                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a sequel to Pirsig's famous Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, first published in 1974.  Both books are technically novels;  but in fact the thin story-line - the account of a journey - is the thread on which is strung a strenuous metaphysical investigation of ultimate reality.   This investigation is couched in a ruminative, discursive and colloquial style which, given the difficulty of the subject matter, is easier to follow than would be a dry and austere academic presentation of the conclusions which Pirsig has reached.  In Zen Pirsig managed to make this search by his central character, Phaedrus, read like a tense and rather desperate detective story, with no less than the sanity of the investigator being at stake - and Phaedrus does succumb for a while and has to spend a period in a mental hospital.
<br />
<br />Lila again has Phaedrus as the central character,  though this time he speaks in the third and not the first person singular,  and he is presented as the author of the earlier book.  This time he is travelling on a sailing boat instead of on a motor-cycle - and although at one point the sailing boat is used to underline the fact that he is a loner, it is not otherwise used as a trigger for an investigation into the nature of things as the motor-cycle had been used in the previous book.  The tension and suspense of the first book is missing, and from that point of view Lila is less gripping than Zen was.  The reason for this is not that Pirsig's narrative skills have deserted him, but that, whereas Zen had ended with Phaedrus' solution to the problem of what was the ultimate nature of reality, Lila merely works out some implications of this solution.  In order to make the later book a self-contained work, the conclusions which Phaedrus had reached in the first book need to be restated.  Pirsig is too much of a craftsman to do this by mere repetition of what he had said in Zen;  even so, those who have read the earlier book will perhaps feel a certain sense of d√©ja vu. 
<br />
<br />What, then, had Phaedrus discovered as the ultimate nature of reality?  He had felt that the two modes of western thinking, the classical and the romantic, were both unsatisfactory.  The romantic, which will not come to grips with the underlying meaning of phenomena, is basically superficial.  The classical mode, with its analytical procedures, often destroys what it investigates.  The romantic mode stresses the subjective impact on the observer;  the classical stresses the objective nature of the things observed.  Both are part of what, in Lila, Phaedrus calls the subject-object metaphysic;  and the concept that the world can be understood in terms simply of subject and object has been deeply embedded in western thought ever since classical Greek philosophy.  However, the pre-classical Greeks, through their concept of arete, held out the possibility of a richer understanding.   Phaedrus translates arete as "Quality" (and sometimes as "Value"), and it is by Quality that the conclusions reached by the classical or the romantic processes need to be judged.  
<br />
<br />What had, in the first book, driven Phaedrus into temporary insanity was the difficulty of defining what exactly this Quality was.  If you are capable of responding to Quality, you know what it is.  It is what you perceive in a work of art (in the romantic mode) or in the elegance of a rational construct (in the classical mode);  and where it is absent, the art or the rational construct convey a defective understanding of the world.  But because (as Phaedrus believed)  this Quality is pre-intellectual, it vanishes the moment you try to pin it down by definitions;  and if you cannot define it, you are at the mercy of the scoffing of such as Rigel (another character in Lila).  
<br />
<br />Besides, Quality is perceived in different ways by different cultures.  Is it therefore a purely relative concept?  Phaedrus thinks not.  In Lila he conceives it in evolutionary terms.  The relativism, therefore, is not absolute:  in all societies Quality is that which leads to improvement.  It is therefore Dynamic (always spelt with a capital D) and not static.  
<br />
<br />Phaedrus describes evolution as going through four phases:  the inorganic;  the biological; the social; and the intellectual.  Mankind originates at the biological level.  The biological level then "invents" the social level, and it does this for the benefit of the biological level;  therefore every development that leads from the lower to the higher level has Dynamic Quality, and, in that context, has Moral Quality, too.  Nothing that threatens to sacrifice a higher to a lower level is moral.
<br />
<br />At the social level new patterns or codes are developed which eventually become static.  The social codes regulate the society and so protect it from slipping back to a lower level;  but at the same time their rigidity is often intolerant of intellectual criticism.  That intolerance is immoral when intellectual criticism is Dynamic, i.e. when it is trying to move mankind along to a higher level than the social one.  Intellectual criticism is, however, degenerative and lacking in Moral Quality if, as it were, it allies with the biological level against the social level and would thereby produce a slipping back rather than a moving forward.  In this connection Phaedrus has a trenchant analysis of the hippy culture of the 'seventies.  
<br />
<br />In fact, the applications of Phaedrus' rather abstract scheme constantly enliven the book.  The Metaphysics of Quality is applied to such varied subjects as the work of anthropologists;  sexual behaviour;  the megalopolis;  the free market;  the cult of celebrity; the making of movies based on books;  Victorian "hypocrisy";  the significance of the New Deal and of fascism;  Islamic fundamentalism;  cultural discrimination;  the nature of mental illness and the attitudes of psychiatrists.

                    </div>
                    <span>Pirsig's genius with Zenandtheartofmotorcyclemaintenance is his ability to tie down an almost clinical analysis of life from the busy interactions of sub-atomic particles, to the mystical interactions between humans and their environment.  He distils the essence of our own collective, and disparate experiences, to a floating essence of truth.  This is not a truth which excludes debate, but like each core physical reaction within us, allows for each individual and new perspective to be considered, and have it's place in the sun.  It is an outwardly clinical, but ultimately enriching journey, allowing every reader to interact, react, and leave a better person for it.
<br />
<br />Nature repeats its structure from the finite to the infinite, and for me, Pirsig's writing reinforces an idea of humanity which can only encourage hope, and promise</span>

                    <span>There's something about reading Robert Pirsig's Lila that reminds me of listening to Steely Dan records. Everything seems to be mastered, the writing is tight and it allows Pirsig to zone off into what can either be described as self-indulgent tengents or brilliant essays on metaphysics - just like those extended solos and cryptic lyrics on albums like Aja. But like Steely Dan, there's also a cold, almost clinical atmosphere to Pirsig's character Phaedrus. If you're like me you can indulge Pirsig a bit just as much as you can put on a Steely Dan record.<p>There really isn't any other author I've encountered quite like Pirsig, and that's a good thing. On the surface this is the story of Phaedrus, a man who's written a novel - Zen and the Art, it seems - that has given him fame but also turned him into a recluse. He's traveling alone down a river in upstate New York when he ends up picking up a woman. That woman, Lila, becomes the focus of his wandering search for a more inclusive system of thinking. He calls this system the Metaphysics of Quality and it resembles a computer program in its design. The book then alternates between the story of Phaedrus and Lila (who increasingly is revealed to be mentally ill) and Phaedrus's (sometimes ingenious) musings.<p>Sleek, well-written, fascinating but also cold and indulgent, I'd recommend Lila to those who aren't bloody-well annoyed when a Steely Dan record comes on.</span>

                    <span>The great thing about Pirsig's writing is that he takes apart and analyzes many beliefs that we take for granted in our every day lives.  Then he resassembles them into a logical mapping that literally provides an explanation for everything, from the behavior of cells, bacteria, animals, trees, humans, societies.<p>Granted, the structure of the 'story' makes it such that it is more of a doctrine on morals and values rather than a page-turning novel.  But that is what makes it great.  We don't have to put up with unnecessary story fluff if it were a true novel, and we also don't have to deal with dry philosophical incantations with equations and symbols etc.<p>This book will only really be enjoyed by those who liked the first book for its philosphical analysis, because he picks up the discussion and takes it many steps further.  For those of us interested in understanding our lives and our behaviors, of why we do what we do, how we got to where we are today, and what it is each of us individually and collectively value, he offers some very amazing and compelling arguments.  And he backs each of his theories up with quite rigorous logical explanations.  This is one of the main reasons I enjoy his work; he doesn't just throw something esoteric idea out there and wait for someone to prove him wrong; he follows every argument up with logical analysis.<p>Bottom line, if you are into the philosophy of it, you will come out of each chapter of this book with a different outlook on your everyday life.  You will see things in a different light, and that is what makes this book great for me.  There are very few other books out there that successfully do this.</span>

                    <span>I ended up not caring for this book for several<br>reasons. <br>1) Pirsig is not a very nice or likeable <br>person. Certainly it is not a requirement<br>to be likeable, but it helps you get through 400+ pages.<br>He knows this, but doesn't seem to mind enough to<br>change.<br>2) Everyone and everything is a foil for his own ego.<br>He never learns any thing from anyone that doesn't<br>groove with what he already wants to think. <br>3) What is his philosophy? There are numerous interesting<br>observations on indians and victorians, but <br>his philosophy reminds me of utility theory. <br>If you are sufficiently clever you can argue for anything.<br>In these reviews people are saying how great is his<br>thinking, but if you had to tell someone what his<br>thinking is, what would you say?</span>
