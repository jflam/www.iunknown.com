                    <span>The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller.</span>

                    <span>First off, for people who are complaining  about installing Windows 2000, it only took my approx. 6 1/2 hours! I love it because every time I launch Internet Explorer it freezes! I also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before I even hooked up my internet. The one thing I love the most though is that I can download any movie I want. Like the recently video game adapted film Mortal Kombat! It was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes. The blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver. I also bought the separate Ctrl Alt Del accesory pad, ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i've used it so much. But all in all DOS has been a blessing, and i hope everyone embraces Windows 95 into their homes.

                    <span>I think that this is a very good Operating System, but it is FAR TOO OVERPRICED!
<br />A Note to the person who has the issue with disk#4 of his setup disk set:
<br />Try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy, if that does't work, then boot into MS-DOS with a Windows 98SE bootdisk and select the CD-ROM Drive letter and then type "CD I386" then type "winnt" then it will start the installation from the Compact Disc.
<br />I gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better Operating System for that price.</span>

                    <span>I purchased a package for window xp in may this year and just got a computer on which I wanted to use it. On Thursday Nov. 25, we wanted install it but the boot disk # 4 was observed to be problematic and thus the whole installation was not successful.
<br />
<br />Please advice me.

                    <span>Ok- I know that a lot of people say that they have a lot of problems installing Windows XP. First of all- the way that XP Handles Drivers is very different from 95,98,ME, and 2000. Many drivers do not work with XP, so it is important to contact your hadware manufacturer(s) to make sure that it is compatible. Older hardeware (ESPECIALLY LAPTOPS) may not have drivers that are compatible with XP. However, if you are building a new PC... I highly reccomend Windows XP Professional. Home edition is okay for a lot of things. But when you get into home networking and other advanced tasks, XP Pro is the way to go. I have had 2000 on my computer before this... and I always had problems. As soon as I upgraded to XP Pro, all problems went away. I also just built another computer... and XP Professional Works seamlessly with it. I am 100% satisfied with XP Pro.</span>
