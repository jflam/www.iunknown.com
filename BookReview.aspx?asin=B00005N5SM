                    <span>This series is absolutely stunning in many ways. First and foremost, the cinematography is breathtaking, from the verist handheld shots to the almost abstract compositions of aerial 90 degree and macro shots. Ron Fricke's Baraka has had a lot of influence on the documentary genre, and there are plenty of Baraka-type moments in here, with assorted new age-ish world music pastiches to support them.<BR>But show is not all there is. The script is beautifully written, with just the right balance between narration and interviews, and editing that lets the product breathe, and the viewer reflect. The agility with which the episodes branch out from the story of individuals to natural, historical, social and cultural references is impressive. And amazingly, you never loose touch with reality, since the documentary's transcendence lies upon the day-to-day lives and thoughts of its subjects.<BR>You also feel the respect the crews had for their subjects, and the «making of» bonus shows it well. Ethnological research ethics are respected, in a world where ethical rules towards the «Other» are too often pushed aside by the greed of producers and researchers.<BR>All in all an amazing document to be viewed over and over again. This is one boxset I highly recommend.</span>

                    <span>Two Words. National Geographic. I subscribed to the magazine, saw the atlas, and rented the movies at the Anna Lemmon Wheelock Library in Tacoma very frequently. National Geographic took us through the enchanted Amazon, and great cities like Rome, Baghdad, and Sydney. They took us through the terrifing wars of Iraq and explored the top of K2 and Mount Everest. They did documentaries on cats, tigers, lions, lizards, and traveled with Steve Irwin through Australia. Now they take on the biggest challenge yet. AFRICA "GOD'S GIFT".<P> I call Africa "God's Gift" because in my prospective, he did something special with it. Every continent has something special to it but Africa has a little bit more. It was featured on CBS's "Survivor Africa" as they went through exciting challenges and tasks in Kenya. The northern part of Africa, now in a country called "Egypt", had ancient lands in early times. The people built sphinxs, prymids and had very hard jobs which they did for most of the day for little or no pay. <P> National Geographic did their best for this and accomplished their mission at the same time. Their mission for "Africa" was to get a television special and feature Africa's best features. I can definatley tell you, that if you want to see something neat and experiance Africa at the same time, this is for you.<P> Don't get overeactive about this it is a great special but, you shouldn't get carried away. OK maybye you can get carried away. It's wonderful without a doubt and shows everything about this splendid continent.<P> Give it a try. Go ahead! <P> Have a good life America!,<BR> Jeffrey Alan Cote'<BR> (brazilgamer_tacomawa)</span>

                    <span>This DVD series uses a refreshing and unique way to tell the story of the people, places and animals of Africa. The personal stories were touching, the landscapes were breathtaking and the close up on the animals was just amazing.<P>I was very happy to see a series that did not just identify what's wrong with Africa, but took the time to tell us so much of what is right and is worth saving and exploring. Timely indeed!!!<P>In so many ways this was more than just a documentary. This in-depth and honest look probably saved all the other documentaries or books that are about Africa.<P>I am glad to see that so many Africans are proud of their culture, many preserve it in so many ways and yet realize that some changes are necessary to keep pace in a global environment.<P>Thanks to all the wonderful people from the different countries on that beautiful continent that allowed me to peek into their lives. I am eternally grateful. Thanks also to the wonderful crew that did all the work to bring such remarkable stories into my living room. It was well worth the hard work. It was just wonderfully touching!!!</span>

                    <span>From the technical point of view, the images are crisp and the sound is excellent. However, this series was shot on film, and transfer to the NTSC 29.97 frame rate just isn't good. I think the PAL version must be so much better. As a result, there are many shots where motions are jerky. I am not talking about the timelapse, ok? Those are very well done! <P>Second issue is that this compilation has no extras except the 1-hour "bonus" making-off, and soem web links. Where are the directors' commentary? Where are the multiple languages? The whole series doesn't even have subtitle!? This is such a shame. If you have seen an IMAX DVD before, you know what I mean, they pack so much extras into their DVDs, like 4-5 languages, closed captioned for the Hearing Impaired, trailers etc. Africa is a wonderful collection, only marred by its lack of extras, which are already becoming essentials in DVDs these days.</span>
