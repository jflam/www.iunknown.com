                <span id="Label1"><p>When Joe Trippi signed on to manage Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign, the long-shot candidate had 432 known supporters and $100,000 in the bank. Within a year, Trippi and his energetic but inexperienced team had transformed the most obscure horse in the field into a front-runner, creating a groundswell of 640,000 people and raising more money than any Democrat in history -- more than fifty million dollars -- mostly through donations of one hundred dollars or less.</p> <p>This is the story of how Trippi's revolutionary use of the Internet and an impassioned, contagious desire to overthrow politics as usual grew into a national grassroots movement and changed the face of politics forever. But it's also more than that.</p> <p>It's about how to engage Americans in real dialogue, how business leaders, government leaders, and anyone else can make use of the most revolutionary idea to come along since man first learned to light a fire. No ... not the Internet. Or computers. Or telecommunications.</p> <p>Democracy.</p> <p>For those who thought the Dean campaign ended with a screaming speech in an Iowa ballroom, this book is a wake-up call. Joe Trippi explains how -- right now -- Internet democracy is transforming every aspect of American life by evenly distributing power. He reveals innovations that are on the horizon, which companies are poised to become first-movers in this new era, and which are in danger of being left behind.</p> <p>From his behind-the-scenes look at Dean's shocking rise and fall to his "seven inviolable, irrefutable, ingenious things your business or institution or candidate can do in the age of the Internet that might keep you from getting your ass kicked but then again might not," Joe Trippi offers an inspiring glimpse of the world we are becoming.</p> <p>And he shows how power, in the hands of all of us, changes everything.</p></span>

                    <span>I hadn't really realized it before I read this book, but television--and especially televised politics--is a ridiculous notion. Trippi talks candidly about how he rejected the old model with his work on the Dean campaign, a campaign more about its supporters than its candidate. He explains how bottom-up business models like eBay and Napster are shaking up traditional corporations, and how these phenomena are essentially movements rather than simple businesses--and are therefore ultimately unstoppable.<P>Trippi walks us through the Dean campaign, dwelling more on the principles and themes than on day-to-day operations. This isn't a post-mortem or a retrospective as much as it is a vision for the future of American politics. Those of us who followed the campaign saw where the Internet took it; Trippi shows us what lies farther along that path--the trail he blazed--last year.<P>Amazon itself has a grassroots element to it: the customer comments we post here can make or break the sales of the books we review. Trippi seems to understand this--he mentions specific people by their "handles" from the Dean Blog, at times giving them as much credit as he did seasoned political folks on the campaign staff.<P>Great book, well-written, and fun to read.</span>

                    <span>Joe Trippi's account of the rise and fall of Dean's campaign is certainly interesting, but it is by no means accurate or definative, which is odd coming from the campaign manager himself. Just as he did while managing the campaign, Trippi focuses more on himself as a martyr of sorts and less on the actual people who powered the campaign. If he introduces another key player with respect--Dr. Judy Dean, Kate O'Connor, etc--you know that within a few paragraphs he'll be detailing how difficult they made his job. He even goes on at length about how disorganized the staff was--but wasn't he the manager? <P>According to Trippi, he never really wanted to work on the campaign, and had vowed to quit after New Hampshire no matter what. Hmmmm.<P>He goes on at length about how they created a campaign that was inclusive and inspiring to "regular people" but he doesn't seem familiar with who those people actually are/were, only with the trials and tribulations of his own rise and fall. <P>You also won't find much in here about the millions of dollars he paid his own firm for ads that didn't work, or the long hours he spent out of the office appearing on numerous talk shows promoting...Joe Trippi. <P>So, in the end, The Revolution really does portray the ways in which the campaign failed, but not, perhaps, in the way Trippi intended.</span>

                    <span>I'm an insomniac, but it's rare for me to give up the 3 or 4 hours of sleep I am able to get in a night. Reading this book kept me up until the sun came up. Trippi's writing style is almost conversational and if you paid attention to the Dean campaign, you can almost hear his voice in your head while reading the book.<P>It was a glorious, painful, and hopeful read, reliving some the incredible highs and incredible lows of the Dean campaign. I started following Dean online before Trippi was the campaign manager, so the book was full of nostalgia, but also some interesting nuggets of the "inside story." The book is not a tell-all, but talks frankly about mistakes, both Trippi's and the campaign's, and what could have been.<P>Trippi follows the campaign from start to his stepping down as campaign manager, and the crash and burn is painful to remember for all of us. But just when the book reaches its lowest point, Joe "You gotta' believe" Trippi reminds us that we changed everything. And the Dean campaign wasn't a 10-second scream of an ending, it was a beginning of a movement to take politics away from the TV set and bring it back to our communities. The book ends on a positive note that rekindles the spirit and makes me think that next time, we'll succeed.</span>

                    <span>This book transcends the trendy genre of political tell-all to expound on the virtues and pitfalls of life and work in a changing political paradigm. Trippi, through his years of experience in the field of electoral politics, shows his readers the brave new world of internet-driven democracy and makes us understand what the technological advancements will mean for grassroots politics in the election cycles to come. Beyond his thoughts on the future of politics, Trippi does shed a very interesting light on what really happened to the Dean campaign, from the highest of heights to its darker moments. An enlightening and engaging read, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised will keep you fixated on one goal, taking our country back for ordinary Americans again.</span>

                    <span>Joe Trippi does a masterful job detailing the raise and fall of the Dean campaign in, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised." More than that, Trippi details how politics in America will never be the same and how any candidate, party, politician or any business for that matter, unwilling to harness the revolutionary technology of the internet by building supportive communities will be left on the ashbin of history. A terrific read indeed.</span>
