                    <span>The author introduces the ideas associated with Briggs-Myers personality traits classification to the area of romantic compatibility. He does a good job of explaining the adjustment patterns of all sixteen such types. The book is  easy to read. With a few exception, his recommendations boil down to: (1) Stick to your own MBTI type, or (2) A female I, F, or P will also be compatible with the corresponding male E, T, or J. (And vice versa). I believe author's recommendations are undamentally sound. The book is aimed at singles who are still looking, not at couples working through their differences. Though the later group may also find the book interesting and useful. <p>Weaknesses: (1) The author seems to borrow a lot from Keirsey and Bates' book "Please Understand Me: Character and Temperament Types" (There's a newer edition of this book). (2) It is not clear what additional/original research was supplied by the author; or the depth, breadth, and rigor of such "research". (3) The personality characteristics author describes are those of a well adjusted person of that Briggs-Myers type. There is no description of how these types behave in a relationship when they feel "under stress". (4) The personality test in the book is a McTest, useful for entertainment purposes only. (For a few bucks you can get a professional caliber test on the Web). <p>Still, on the whole this is a good book. If you are interested in getting a better understanding of the mechanics of romantic compatibility, and you never looked at it from the point of view of MBTI classifications, this book is highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Nice application of psychology, though it would have been nice if they'd put in a section on teen romance. While most of the readers are probably overweight middle-aged women unsatisfied with their marriages, the publishers need to realize that depressed GIfted and Talented youth ususally try to read these things too for whatever reasons. Oh well... minor flaw. I look forward to finding one of the 20 female "mystic writers" who attend my school... even though there are approximately 4 in my grade level.</span>

                    <span>Rather than review the book as a whole, I'd like to make one comment:  if you have a rare personality type, and you know who you are, because you probably think you're a little odd, this book can be extremely helpful. <br> <br>I'm an INTJ, which makes me approximately 2% of the population.  That, I already knew.  What I didn't know, is that I'm compatible with a personality type that I would reject outright based on first impressions.  I won't say it's opened up a whole new world of dating for me, but it has, quite literally, doubled the number of people I would consider going out with.  As an endorsement of this book, that statistic speaks for itself.</span>

                    <span>I had taken the Myers-Briggs personality test about four times before a friend of mine showed me this book.  Having had the exact same results from the personality test each time, I had a lot of faith in the system and thought that this book could offer some great insights into comaptibility and the dating scene in general.  I was not disappointed.  I recognized my last failed relationship immediately and finally understood what it was that went so terribly wrong.  Since I am an extreme in three of the components of my type, I have little patience for people whose types are the exact opposite of mine.  What's more, the relationships that affected me the most, the ones in which I felt the most connected to my partner, were the same "perfect matches" that Dr. Avila recommends.  The most refreshing part of this book was the fact that  Dr. Avila makes no judgments about personality.  One type is not preferrable over another.  The personality traits I had previously seen as flawed or less desirable are now simply differences.  In other words, they're not my type!  The only part of this I was uncomfortable with was the advice on getting close to your match and making them fall in love with you.  Because I am a romantic at heart, I squirm anytime anyone suggests being someone you're not in order to win someone's affections, though, in the end this is not what he intends.  Still, I highly recommend this book especially to those who are intropspective and love psychology.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Avila proposes a theory for how people will be romantically compatible based on their Myers-Briggs type indicator.  He has done a nice job describing the behavioral characteristics of each type.  However, I disagree with his hypothesis on appropriate matches.  I was surprised that Dr. Avila did not incorporate other research into his book.<p>For each type, he believes that the exact same type would be appropriate - or the exact opposite type.  Other research suggests that people need to share at least 2 preferences to be compatible.  Moreover, that the one dichotomy that people often match up on is the S and N.  His theories are also in direct contradiction to Kiersey's Temperament - which states that Idealists and Artisans are fundamentally at odds, as are Rationals and Guardians.  Avila recommends these matches.<p>I also found his recommendations for venues to meet partners to be weak.  Unless one is in their mid-20s, I can't imagine going to a law library to meet an INTJ.<p>I don't think that this book was worth the money.</span>
