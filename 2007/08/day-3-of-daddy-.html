<p>Sometimes outings are for the kids, sometimes they're for the daddy. After a couple of days of going to parks, we (well, I) decided to do some shopping today. </p>

<p>I wanted to explore the area south of where we live, so we drove down to Fry's. Ben had a great time dancing to music at Fry's on the patterned marble flooring that they have (lots of circles and triangles), and the boys enjoyed watching the Blu-Ray edition of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366548/">Happy Feet</a> on a 63&quot; 1080p Samsung plasma TV (OK, I enjoyed it too).</p>

<p>Next up after Fry's, we went over to check out the Costco in Issaquah. There's a pretty cool <a href="http://www.ci.issaquah.wa.us/Page.asp?NavID=541">farmer's market</a> in the same complex as well. One thing that's been on my list to get for some time is a replacement vacuum cleaner. Our 10+ year old Bissell is doing a poor job keeping up with Kobe's seasonal shedding that's happening right now. I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hoover-U5507-900-Rewind-Bagless-Upright/dp/B000FFQ554/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-8874977-3739145?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1188101504&amp;sr=8-1">Hoover Elite</a> vaccuum for $89. It's a bagless vacuum, so it's rather cool / disgusting to see the incredible amount of gunk that this thing can suck out of carpets. It's much quieter than our Bissell, and I'm pretty amazed by the results.</p>

<p>On the way home, I decided to take a side trip up <a href="http://www.bicycleclimbs.com/ClimbDetail.Aspx?ClimbID=6">Zoo Hill</a>. This is a tough climb - it ascends 1200 feet in 2.5 miles - I was a bit worried that the car wouldn't make it around some of the inside corners of the switchbacks! When I ride myself back into shape, that's the climb that I'm going to test myself on. Not sure when that will be (definitely not this season) but it's good to be able to visualize your challenges.</p>

<p>It's been a long 3 days. But I'm getting into the rhythm of this daddy daycare thing, so I'm not as tired as I was on the first two days. Half way there!</p>
