<p>I'm at home this week with the two-and-a-half kids (Kobe the dog counts as half a kid) while Carolyn takes a much-deserved vacation at home in Toronto. I've survived day one - five to go!</p>

<p>I saw that Nikon has released the <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3.htm">full-frame D3 SLR</a> - the one with the insane ISO 256,000 setting. It's a good thing that I don't own any DX lenses :)</p>

<p>As I approach my 40th birthday, I've started riding again. I spent a lot of time riding as a kid and got pretty good at it. About 8 years ago, I bought a bike that I would have killed for when I was serious about riding, and rode it maybe a dozen times. Now that I live in a bike-friendly town and within easy commute distance (6 miles each way) I've started riding it again. There's no shortage of hills around here, which makes that 6 miles, um, a bit more challenging than 6 miles in Toronto (had to swap out the 12-23 for a 12-27). I figure that I should drop about 25 pounds or so to get into a good power/weight ratio for riding the hills around here - plenty of time to make that happen.</p>

<p>Don't worry, IronRuby is in good hands with our devs. The Rubyforge sync script is done, and we're finishing off a few more foundational features before we go live at the end of August.</p>

			<p>It seems that everyone who moves out west starts riding their bike in to work.</p>

<p>My dad as well started biking in to work every day. We live in North Vancouver and he bikes all the way to downtown Vancouver. I don't know how he does it.</p>
