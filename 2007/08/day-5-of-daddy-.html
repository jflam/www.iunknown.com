<p>Today was a visit to the <a href="http://www.zoo.org">Woodland Park Zoo</a>. It was a beautiful day in Seattle, about as good as it gets. The boys were pretty good at the zoo today. The only bad thing that happened was when Daddy forgot that Matthew was sitting on the back of the stroller when he took Ben out of the stroller to see the tiger ... Fortunately nothing really bad happened to Matthew outside of a bit of shock from the fall.</p>

<p>This weekend was a weekend of birthday parties. Our neighbor Sofia turned 2, and the <a href="http://www.reptileman.com/home.html">Reptile Man</a> entertained the kids. When Ben saw the iguana, he called it a dinosaur, but when he walked up to it, he changed it to 'baby dinosaur'! The photo above is a quick snapshot of a Komodo Dragon that I took today at the Woodland Park Zoo. Ben was excited to see dinosaurs again!</p>

<p>We also went to Vivek's 720 day celebration at <a href="http://www.ci.redmond.wa.us/insidecityhall/parksrec/parks/grasslawn.asp">Grasslawn Park</a>. Matthew was excited to be there, but decided to go and climb on the amazingly cool 'spider web' climbing structure at the park instead of participating in the incredibly well-orchestrated games for adults and kids. There was lots of music played at the picnic and the boys spent a lot of time dancing on the picnic tables (don't tell Carolyn about this). Ben was entertaining himself by stuffing wood chips into his sandals, which was fine by me since I was worrying about Matthew's daring climbing exploits :)</p>

<p>Carolyn gets home tomorrow night - just one more day until the cavalry arrives!</p>
