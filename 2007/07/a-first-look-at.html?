<p>We've been working very hard over the past couple of months to get our first source code release ready. I'm happy to announce today the first drop of the <a href="http://iunknown.typepad.com/IronRuby-Pre-Alpha1.zip">IronRuby source code</a>. IronRuby is licensed under very liberal terms as set out by the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/permissivelicense.mspx">Microsoft Permissive License</a>.</p>

<p>We're also happy to announce that we will be <strong>accepting source code contributions</strong> into the IronRuby libraries. Right now we have a lot of logistical work that we still need to do, but we fully intend on getting IronRuby onto <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">Rubyforge</a> by the end of August. </p>

<p>Some of you may be wondering why we are only accepting contributions into the libraries and not the entire compiler. It's because IronRuby is built on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), and the public interfaces to the DLR are not complete at this time. Since the DLR will ship as part of the CLR in the future, we cannot accept contributions into the IronRuby compiler, at least initially. However, once the DLR matures and reaches 1.0 status with fully supported public interfaces, we will <strong>fully open up all parts of the IronRuby project for external contributions</strong>.</p>

<p>To start playing with this release, you'll need to build IronRuby. This release of IronRuby requires the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en">.NET Framework 2.0 Redistributable</a>. Just unzip the source code file, and run the build.cmd batch file to create a release-mode build of IronRuby. </p>

<p>You can kick the tires by typing some code interactively using our simple REPL console application. You'll find it at \bin\release\rbx.exe. You should add \bin\release to your path to make your life easier.</p>

<p>Next you should look at the unit tests under \tests\ruby\builtins. This will give you an idea of what works and what doesn't work in IronRuby. We've put most of our effort into Array and String; any other support that's in the libraries was put in there to support building Array and String features.</p>

<p>We have .NET interop working out of the box; you can import .NET libraries into your Ruby programs via require:</p>

<pre><code>
require 'mscorlib'
require 'System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how you need to use the fully-qualified assembly name in require.</p>

<p>We don't have <code>include</code> working yet at top-level scope, so you'll need to either use fully-qualified type names or assign them to constants:</p>

<pre><code>
Window = System::Windows::Forms::Window
</code></pre>

<p>We also have pretty good performance in this release. We use a DLR feature called Dynamic Sites, which is our implementation of adaptive call-site method caching. Other than using Dynamic Sites, we have not done any other specific performance tuning for this release. </p>

<p>In micro-benchmarks which measure method call performance, we are significantly faster than Ruby 1.8.6. In micro-benchmarks which measure library performance, we are on par with Ruby 1.8.6; we expect to see performance improvements in these benchmarks in the future. In micro-benchmarks that involve raising exceptions, we are slower than Ruby 1.8.6; but if control flow on your program's critical path involves raising exceptions you may want to rethink your design :)</p>

<p>We're really interested in hearing what you have to say about this release. I'm at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/">OSCON</a> all week, so feel free to come up and say hello if you're attending. My IronRuby talk is this Thursday at 5:20pm, and I'll be busy cooking up a fun demo for that talk between now and then. If you're not at OSCON, feel free to send mail to jflam at the big software company in Redmond.</p>

<p>Last but most important, I'd like to thank the members of the IronRuby team: <a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/">Tomas Matousek</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/haibo_luo/">Haibo Luo</a> for their hard work in getting this release out the door. Great job, guys!</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p>I have been waiting for this since ages. I am happy to my gift 3 days earlier than expected.</p>

<p>Where can i see all those white papers related to IronRuby, Have you managed to release it or still under preparation...?</p>

<p>Great to see IronRuby on the First day of Oscon 2007.</p>

<p>I am sure IronRuby will be the  most hot topic discussion at Oscon.</p>

<p>Cheers Again.</p></span>

<p>Nice work but what&#39;s the deal with all the environment variables in the batch files - like %ROWAN_BIN% and %MERLIN_ROOT% ?</p>

<p>My system doesn&#39;t have them setup...are these internal variables? I notice iron python uses the same ones.</p>

<p>The docs is somewhat different :)</p>

<p>Will play more this evening.</p>

<p>One detail, you might want to remember that Rubinius uses rbx as the command name, and that your simple IRB goes by the same name will cause clashes at some point.</p>

<p>@{Oleg,Ben): I would love to see an F# interactive console in VS as well. We could definitely use the help to implement that feature (you can see that we don&#39;t exactly have a big team :)) IronPython does not currently have this feature. I just had lunch on Friday (accidentally as it turns out) with a dev on the F# team at MSR. I&#39;ll ping him to see if he&#39;d like to help out on that integration as well.</p>

<p>@Ben: Sorry about the environment variables. We extracted this source code from the much larger project that we have that builds all four of the languages on the DLR (IronRuby, IronPython, VB, and JS). Our build packaging script doesn&#39;t grovel through batch files to do the right thing (yet). So for now the only batch file that is guaranteed to work is build.cmd in the root - please ignore any other ones that might be sprinkled throughout the sources until we get our build script working correctly.</p></span>

<p>I (and I&#39;ll use I here since I fully take responsibility for this decision if it doesn&#39;t work) felt that more folks contributing to open source projects were comfortable with Subversion than with TFS. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for folks to contribute, so Rubyforge was the natural choice here.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-77158700-content"><p>Hey,<br />
I wanna say great job on this I like the direction its heading but I have one question.  I ran into a snag trying to use the Time.now command from ruby.  I tried to require Time but had no luck with that.  Has anyone else gotten things other then hello world and interaction with WPF to work with this yet?  I would really like to explore it more and am really excited for this project.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work!<br />

		<span id="comment-77168888-content"><p>18 months ago, I was a ruby newbie, doing Rails at a major search engine.</p>

<p>David Thomas (of pickaxe book fame) came and did an all day class on Ruby for the group.</p>

<p>When it was time for Q&amp;A, I asked a number of questions that really ruffled his feathers.</p>

<p>My favorite one was &quot;Dave, do you ever see Ruby running under .NET?&quot;</p>

<p>He fumed, got all loud and screamed at me that this day would never come cause Ruby was &quot;too complex&quot; for .NET</p>

<p><br />
So congrats John and team for letting me have the last laugh on this one.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-77240072-content"><p>congrats first!great job</p>

<p>however,some issues here<br />
although it&#39;s a pre-alpha version,i found that even some basic arithmetic operations are missed</p>

<p>for example,1/2.0 gives 0;1.0/2.0 will result in an exception</p>

<p>power,like 2**3,is also not implemented yet?</p>

<p>The same happens when i try some code with Bignum class</p>

<p>Hope to see promoted releases soon!</p></span>

<p>What&#39;s the chance of us ever seeing IronScheme? It would be good to have something to take over from where Common Larceny leaves off. What do you think: in this life or the next? ;-)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong Python and Ruby are mucho cool but when I want to get my functional / language-compiler designer grove on then Scheme is what I really want. WPF apps written in Scheme... you know it makes sense :-)</p>
