                    <span>This is easily one of the top 10 best investing/finance books that I've ever read. I would rank it right up there with other classics such as Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, the Market Wizards series by Schwager, etc. 
<br />
<br />Rogers gives you a historical, social, financial and political perspective on the world that you won't get elsewhere. He lives in the world of how things are, rather than how we hope they should be. He has the ability to step back from the crowd, analyze a situation, compare it to historical tendencies and make logical investment decisions. 
<br />
<br />For example, when the Japanese market in the early 90's went from 40,000 to 30,000 he was asked if now is the time to buy. He saw on the front page of a newspaper that golf memberships were still selling for a million dollars. It didn't sound like much of a bottom to him (the market now is at 11,000).
<br />
<br />(Similar comparisons could be made about the US market now)
<br />
<br />I also really enjoyed the travel stories (border crossings, bribing guards, adventures in Africa, romance in the Sahara, the famous bird market in China).
<br />
<br />The book has everything. High finance, intrigue, romance, history, remote and distant lands, ancient cultures. Truely, a trip of a lifetime!</span>

                    <span>It's lot of fun to travel around the world with Jim Rogers and listen to him describe the world and fulminate against the folly of governments.
<br />
<br />It's also fun to think about the things he got right and the things he got wrong (US exchange controls by 2000, for instance) and consider why he thought what he did and how things actually unfolded.
<br />
<br />He advocates getting out and living your dream; sound advice, that. He also predicts that Clinton will be the last Democrat ever elected an American president because of irresponsible policies pursued for eight decades, and the collapse of our society because the Republicans aren't fundamentally any better. Certainly with that hanging over your head, you'd be much better off going for a bike ride.

                    <span>An arrogant, rich guy brags at length about snagging a trophy girlfriend (his client's daughter), then chuckles to himself as he motors his shiny BMW bike through crowds of "brown faces" (I think those were his actual words).  As a travelogue, this book fails because all of the locations and cultures blur together.  As a means of imparting financial strategy, this book also fails--for the reasons noted in other reviews.  Anything worthwhile the author has to say is completely nullified by his enormous ego, which comes across on every page.  For those of you seeking adventure writing or stock tips, look elsewher.

                    <span>The author, Jim Rogers, is a international investor and bike adventurer. By reading this book, through the author's eyes you can experience a graet world bike adventure. In this tour, you are going to see natives' lives and cultures in those countries, even to understand those and world economics, for as a investor on the bike the author observes those areas in detail from many viewpoints. It's interesting and useful to read this book, by which you can enjoy a world bike adventure and study economics.</span>

                    <span>The Investment Biker: Around the World with Jim Roger would not have been a book I would have chosen to read on my own but, after being assigned to it I would recommend it to those interested in world economy, travel and BMW motorcycles.  One follows Roger around the world on his 22-month expedition of six continents and numerous economies and societies.  Along with his girlfriend, Tabitha, Roger, a Wall Street legend, entertains with antecedents from his trip, while giving valuable insight of each economy he comes across. Roger is known from revitalizing the "Sleeping Beauty" that is the Austrian stock market.  Over the 65,067 miles traveled BMW motorcycles and thousands more by boat, plane and train, Roger experiences first hand global societies, international economies and how they are seceding and failing around the world.</span>
