                    <span>The copy I have contained printing errors. the first 66 pages was the beginning section to "vi editor pocket reference" then it picks up on page 73 with what seems to be the rest of the javascript pocket reference.
<br />
<br />I'm new to javascript and programming in general.. and took me couple of days of trying to understand it before someone pointed out to me that i was trying to make sence of the wrong content.
<br />
<br />This is the first time I have seen errors of this sort from a major publisher.
<br />
<br />thanks o'reilly, for wasting hours out of my life.</span>

                    <span>I was hoping and expecting that this little book would be the same quick-and-easy reference book that e.g. the "VBScript Pocket Reference" is -- I was sadly disappointed. <p>Since "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" is by the same author and publisher, I also expected this book to be a (somewhat) boiled-down version of the very thorough JavaScript Reference from that much larger book. I was even more disappointed there. <p>In a "pocket reference" such as this I want and need nothing more or less than an alphabetical listing of the JavaScript universe. However, this book is divided into numerous chapters that require you to already know what category the thing you seek belongs to. Since there's no index in these little books, it is useless to me as someone who's still learning this stuff. I've set my copy aside and use the "Definitive Guide" exclusively.</span>

                    <span>I've found this is a great little reference that I can carry around with me when working on creating web-related programs. <p>Its primarily a quick-reference guide to all the attributes on each of the common Javascript objects in the DOM (Document Object Model) and a very light overview of syntax.<p>Don't get this for any kind of help on actually programming Javascript .. this is just primarily a reference.</span>

                    <span>This is a good Javascript reference.  I use it all the time.  Its small and easy to carry around in a laptop bag.  Some areas could use a little more detail.  For example, the one I need the most, window.open--what are all the window options????  Still very good and recommended though.</span>
