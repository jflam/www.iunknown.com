                    <span>The other reviews here use enough glowing adjectives that I won't add many more, but it will suffice to say this is a dramatic and epic color monograph. Those of you who are consumers of the imagery in National Geographic will experience more than a few flashes of recognition as you page through the sumptuous images in this book. Unlike on the pages of national geo, however, this book gives Steve's images the chance to stand alone, independent of editorial and other clutter on the page, and in this singular treatment it is easy to recognize them for what they are: exceptional color photography, and exceptional pieces of art. Whether you have traveled to southeast asia in body or in mind, you will find these images deep and resounding, worth many hours of leisurely flipping. If you are a color photographer, you will stop and stare with admiration, remembering again why you carry a camera.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book quite by accident in the art section-knowing nothing and caring little about photography. After riffling through it for a while, I suddenly realized that these unbelievably beautiful, gorgeously colored, perfectly composed images were photographs, not paintings as I had hoped. Add to that the emotional content of these exotic images, they hit me in the eye, mind and heart with the impact of blow to the solar plexus. It is at the top of my wish list and a must for every artist, photographer, or any one who has eyes!!!</span>

                    <span>Had the opportunity recently to see many of the pictures from this book during a Steve McCurry exhibit at the George Eastman House in Rochester. If you are in the Rochester, NY area I highly reccommend this exhibit. Just amazing pictures. McCurry combines the immediacy of photojournalism with the artist's use of color and composition. Steve McCurry's work is a must for any lover of beautiful, thought-provoking photographic art.</span>

                    <span>Steve's colors really flared in this collection of his best. The format of the book is very well thot out: every image is printed with full page frame to enhance the viewing pleasure. The Afghan-girl is, of course, in there. Highly recommended for learners & for art book collectors.</span>

                    <span>As a lover of photography books, and pictures of exotic locales, I bought this volume based on the glowing recommendations of the other reviewers from Amazon.com. The buyer should know most of the images were taken in India, and so if one is expecting a good mix of images from various places in southeast Asia, he is not going to find them in this book. Nevertheless there is a good balance of pictures of people (i.e., portraits), people going on with the business of their lives (working, playing, begging), and a few stunning city landscapes (I wish there were more of these). <BR>The book is not cheap-there are not really that many pages (one image per page)- and although the quality of the paper and the pictures is good, it is not superb. I have owned better. Overall, for those readers who love looking at beautiful pictures, or those who can relate to pictures of people and places in Asia, this book is worthwhile buying.</span>
