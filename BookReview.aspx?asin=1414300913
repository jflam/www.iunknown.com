                    <span>Granger's connections to Christian doctrine and ceremony are at times extremely insightful and believable, and at times a bit of a stretch that seem like personal opinion.  The first half of the book deals with literary elements, patterns, and themes that that Rowling uses to ensnare our imagination, and to deliver hidden messages (or as Granger would put it - underlying truths).  The second half of this book is a book-by-book breakdown (first 5 of them) of some of the earlier mentioned themes and symbolism, but is also filled with insightful and astoundingly true revelations and connections.  Though at times pushing too hard to make his connections to Christian ceremony and tradition, Granger does an Excellent job of showing the (informed) reader that the Harry Potter novels are not some hideous trap that children should fear.  But are instead, literary masterpieces of knowledge and influence that are to be embraced by all generations and creeds!</span>

                    <span>In "Looking for God in Harry Potter," John Granger shows the Christian side/allegory inside the bestselling series by J.K. Rowling.
<br />
<br />John Granger looks into hidden Christian symbology which he found within the Harry Potter series.
<br />
<br />After reading his book, I think it's a wonder many people refuse to see God and a positive portrayal in the Potter series. I mean, one cannot miss it when Granger points it out.</span>

                    <span>This book went way beyond my expectations and was incredibly helpful.  When my fifth grader wanted to read the first Harry Potter book years ago, I borrowed one from the library to preview it and was immediately addicted.  I let my son read it, but always had a niggling fear that I might be encouraging an interest in magic, witchcraft, or the occult.  Mr. Granger has put my fears to rest with his brilliant analysis of what is truly behind these stories.  I always knew that Ms. Rowling was a genius storyteller, but now I can appreciate the depth of her intelligence, thanks to John Granger's.  For everyone who wants to love Harry Potter but was afraid to, read this and be at peace! (Somehow I accidently clicked on 4 stars, FIVE is my vote)</span>

                    <span>As an evangelical Christian, I was very suspicious of Harry Potter, especially as many respected Christian leaders put it in the same genre as Philip Pullman's atheistic Dark Materials Trilogy.  Having seen the first Potter movie, I noticed a lot of Christian symbolism.  Shortly thereafter, I read Connie Neal's "The Gospel According to Harry Potter", and I was encouraged to see I wasn't the only one picking up the Christian themes.
<br />
<br />John Granger's work goes even further than Connie Neal's, in a scholarly way, he shows how J.K. Rowling uses Christian symbolism in her stories just as her favorite authors C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.  Granger uses his background in classical languages and English literature to explain how Rowling uses symbolism to present glimspses of Christ and the Christian faith, just as C.S. Lewis does in the Chronicles of Narnia.  Granger makes such a well-argued, powerful case that any critic of Harry Potter must meet the challenge of "Looking for God in Harry Potter".  It is encouraging to read a book that is not only intellectually honest and stimulating, as well as devoutly committed to Christian truth.  I would highly recommend this book and similar articles Granger has written on his website at www.hogwartsprofessor.com.  Enjoy the book!     </span>

                    <span>I happened across this book through a friend who is an Orthodox Christian seminarian.  The topic of Harry Potter came up, and although he hasn't read any of the Harry Potter books, he referred me to Mr. Granger's website.  There was an excerpt of one of the chapters there, and it was so compelling that shortly thereafter, I bought the book.  
<br />
<br />This book is far from any kind of trite commentary or apology trying to "reconcile" Christianity and the Harry Potter books.  If you get this book, be prepared for a read that will go into such things as literary devices and symbolism and such.  Things like that may seem a bit abstract and over the heads of some people (and I can't say that I enjoyed such topics in school), but through these, Granger presents a very good case as to why the Harry Potter books can be accepted, enjoyed, and applauded by Christians.  
<br />
<br />There are a few places where there are minor mistakes, and there is a time or two where Granger stretches his case just a bit, but all in all, this is a very good book.  I've already lent it out, and had friends of mine come back with very similar opinions of it.  
<br />
<br />It will be interesting to see if this book will be rewritten after the series is over (so as to include the entire series).  I'd definitely look into getting such a future edition as well.  </span>
