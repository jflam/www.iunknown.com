                    <span>I used this text as a secondary supplement for an American Sailing Association "sailing certification" , and I found it refreshingly helpful. Well known today, and with hundreds of titles, the "For Dummies® Books" collection offers you valuable basic information on hundreds of subjects, from "Accounting for Dummies" to "Yoga for Dummies". <P>"For Dummies® Books" strive to make a subject enjoyable to read, interesting and simple enough to understand so anyone can grasp the concept . In "Sailing For Dummies", J. J. Isler and Peter Isler accomplish just that: enjoyable, interesting and simple. This is a very basic text for the first 140 pages, then, for the remainder of the book, the Islers add to your foundational knowledge of sailing ending with subjects such as: sailboat racing, chartering and buying a boat. <P>"Sailing For Dummies" is livened up by the use of cartoons, interesting quips and quotes and engaging icons found throughout the book in the margins. The icons denote sections of information that promote "tips", "safety", "danger", "nautical words", "sailing stories", etc. Add the above with b&w photos, great diagrams and an excellent index, and you have a book valuable to any novice who wants to know more about sailing.

                    <span>This is an excellent sailing textbook - as the cover states it's "A Reference for the Rest of Us!" That is, it can be used as a beginner's book and then kept for use as a reference manual. I have read and re-read this book several times and each time I re-read it, something I didn't understand or fully comprehend "jumps out at me" and I become a better sailor because of the information contained within and imparted by this book. <BR> Also, some people know their subject but are unable to teach others what they know. Both JJ and Peter not only know their subject, sailing, but are also very adept at transferring that knowledge to their readers, sailors and wannabe sailors!</span>

                    <span>The authors have maybe a bit too much expertise and experience to effectively write for "dummies" like myself. Somehow after reading this, I had just as many questions as before. Part of the problem is this book is way too comprehensive, covering such topics as sail-boarding. I would rather have had more in depth explainations of the basics and more diagrams/illustrations.</span>

                    <span>Hard to beat this book if you're just getting your hands on the mainmast for the first time. A wealth of info on every topic you'll need to know, presented in pictures and entertaining quotes and headlines. There are sections that deal with all the tricky details of actually getting the boat out of the dock and into the open sea, as well as a crucial section on what to do if, well, your sailing experience doesn't exactly go as planned. Pay attention to what the Islers say here-- you'll protect yourself from the most common (and often dangerous) mistakes beginners make if you've barely dipped your feet into water, and you'll improve your skills to a surprising extent even if you're more advanced.</span>
