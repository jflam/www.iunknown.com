                <span id="Label1">This book covers all of the new and improved data-access features of Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and illustrates how to put the various components and techniques to work in real-world applications. The first chapter spells out the concepts of databases in general and then introduces the reader to the Data Control and the VB Data Form Wizard--a quick way to snap together a database interface. From there, author John Connell spends a few chapters illustrating how to code the data control and build a "bulletproof" user interface to your data.<p> After a discussion about planning your database structure, Connell steps you through the process of building a fully functional application that uses many important VB features. The chapters include screen shots, diagrams, and code snippets, with plenty of tips and step-by-step exercises. You can download the source code for the included examples from the publisher's Web site.<p> Once you have the preliminary education under your belt, the author presents Microsoft's Universal Data Access (UDA) architecture. He shows how to create your own data-bound ActiveX controls and use Active Server Pages (ASPs) to fetch and return database records via a Web browser. Connell finishes off this lengthy education with a brief foray into data mining and a discussion of how to export data to other applications. <I>--Stephen Plain</I></span>

                    <span>Prior to picking up John's book I had some familiarity with 'desktop' databases like Lotus Approach and MS Access, and had a beginner's understanding of the Basic Language, but felt to intimidated to actually code my own database from scratch in a major programming language.
<br />
<br />After studying John's material and hand coding the examples (no copy and paste), I gained the confidence necessary to bid on a Database contract in the manufacturing sector. I won the contract. The database has been in production for over 4 years now. 
<br />
<br />The client recently asked me to upgrade it. This IS IMPORTANT, because John's emphasis on good database design, code optimization, and component reuse HELPED me to write code that I can easily return to and understand later when it's time for maintenance or upgrades.
<br />
<br />And yes, there were two examples in his code that were broken, but they were minor mistakes and he teaches so well that I was able to fix it myself and make the examples work.
<br />
<br />P.S. In the recommended titles below:
<br />The first - is actually a great VB/MS HTML help  reference.
<br />The second - is by Dan Appleman. Dan's books are a MUST HAVE for serious VB developers.

                    <span>I strongly recommend purchasing a copy of Beginning VB6 Database.<p>WHY?<br>Top quality code that works! <br>Great working examples! <br>Gets you into the "preverbal" guts of VB Database programming.<p>Want to learn how ADO works? You will find in Johns book. <p>John's book has taken me well beyond the "basics" of VB database programming, with...<p>First rate screen shots of the applications development and the real world examples he presents as you move along from one chapter to the next.<p>And yes all with excellent easy to follow explanations and code.<p>Solid examples of good Class development. Well document/written/<br>Useful API code and more importantly it works! <p>And guess what John explains why!!!  <p>I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. <p>Soooooooooo....<br>If you what get a grip on ADO, I can't think of a better place to start then with... <br>Beginning VB6 Database!!!<p>THANK YOU JOHN!!</span>

                    <span>Hurray for John Connell he speaks to us beginners on our level. It was also very encouraging when he mentioned that he did not get it the first time, he had a light bulb moment. I have never heard a guru admit that before they usually give the impression that it came very easy for them.<p>The exercises seemed to encompass a lot of VB functions, uses, and neat tricks. The explanations are complete, well thought out, and unambiguous. With little or no exposure to VB any programmer should be able to follow along.<br> <br>My next goal is VB.Net I hope Mr. Connell will write/has written a book that addresses it. Wrox should adopt his style for all of their text books.</span>
