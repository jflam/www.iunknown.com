                <span id="Label1"><p align="left">Blending scientific fact and sports trivia, Robert Adair examines what a baseball or player in motion does-and why. How fast can a batted ball go? What effect do stitch patterns have on wind resistance? How far does a curve ball break? Who reaches first base faster after a bunt, a right- or left-handed batter? The answers are often surprising -- and always illuminating.</p><p align="left">This newly revised third edition considers recent developments in the science of sport such as the neurophysiology of batting, bat vibration, and the character of the "sweet spot." Faster pitchers, longer hitters, and enclosed stadiums also get a good, hard scientific look to determine their effects on the game. </p><p align="left">Filled with anecdotes about famous players and incidents, <I>The Physics of Baseball</I> provides fans with fascinating insights into America's favorite pastime.</p></span>

                    <span>I thought this book was good for the most part. It gives great discussions on topics like bat types and different pitches (curve, fastball, etc). It dispells myths about corked bats (they don't really help) and rising fastballs (they don't rise).<P>Most results of his studies are presented in tabular format, so it will be easy to get the basics of the book even if you don't understand all of the physics. Personally, I had trouble understanding the sections about curve balls. I think this is more of a personal hang-up. Even though I have an engineering degree, I have never quite grasped the physics of spinning objects.. Otherwise, I thought this was a good book. Just not quite great to earn a 5 Star..</span>

                    <span>I am a HUGE baseball fan, and have been since Junior High. I grew up at the little league fields watching my older brother play. Since I've been in college, my love for baseball has only grown. I read this book after just finishing college level introductory physics. While the concepts in this book are not the most complicated, readers who have not had a similar level of instruction may find some of them hard to grasp. I think this is mainly due to the author's writing style. At any rate, even if it takes you a few times to read and understand the explanation of why a curve ball curves (which I have gone back to time and again because it so amazing!), it is well worth the time. Baseball fans will gain more respect for the game and its players. Skeptics who think the game is mind-numbingly boring might even come to like the game after reading this, if they have any respect for the role mental ability and precision plays in sports.<P>I highly recommend this book for baseball players, fans, physics majors (it's one of the more fun and easy to comprehend real-life applications of your field of study!), and anyone who isn't afraid of a little technical language!</span>

                    <span>Trajectory lines, momentum, and distance vs. velocity from a batted ball aren't exactly what you think of when you watch the great game of baseball are they?<BR> This book keeps the reader thinking outside of the box and it lets them get a closer look at which part of the bat will send the ball to a certian place-like in the stands, how fast the ball can be hit, and where the perfect hitting point-or 'sweet spot' is-among other things. It answers the questions of many 'rookies' like why their hand stings after a certain hit and how they missed that 'perfect' pitch. This book gets inside the game of baseball and it contains explainations for why the ball does 'what it does'. <BR>This book is very informational and it provides great detail and extreme elaboration on virtually every topic that is covered.</span>

                    <span>The Physics of Baseball is not physics text - it uses the principles of physics to explain things like why a curveball curves, what happens when the bat hits the ball, how far a ball can be hit, and so on. The book is not math-heavy, but it does assume the reader has some knowledge of basic physics and can follow technical discussions.<P>The only part of the book that disappointed me was the discussion of corked bats. Adair uses a theoretical model to prove that a corked bat doesn't help - that corking a bat will make the ball travel only a few feet farther at most. While he may be right in his conclusion, I think his theory should be tested with experiment. A batter hitting a pitched ball is a complex system, and it's quite possible Adair's model is too simple.</span>

                    <span>While this book is considered a classic and is cited in many articles about the game, The Physics of Baseball is pretty dry. Granted, I am not a physicist, but an avid baseball fan. After reading numerous news articles and hearing about the book on baseball shows, I picked up a copy of this book. While I found things like the physics of a curveball or physics of a corked bat interesting, a lot of the discussion was over my head, which granted may say more about me than the distinguished author.<P>However, the problem with this book is that once it loses a reader, it is hard to get back on track. This book almost seems more of a reference book than a book to be read cover-to-cover. Surely, it is a novel, incredible contribution to an area that has been neglected, but I am happy (for now) to remain a fan and let the physics take care of themselves.</span>
