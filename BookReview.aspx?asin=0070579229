                    <span>I read this book to supplement my CFA curriculum studies.  Compared to other Schaum's books, Financial Management by Shim and Siegel merits a rating of between 3 and 3 1/2.
<br />
<br />Four chapters covering topics of Risk Return & Valuation, Capital Budgeting, Capital Budgeting Under Risk, and Cost of Capital were excellent.  Other chapters were also well written.  The problem sets solidified concepts and were a pleasure to work through.
<br />
<br />The authors present the material in a straight forward and easy to understand manner.  They provide numerous examples of how to apply the concepts which are truly beneficial.
<br />
<br />My main complaint is that there are dozens of errors throughout the book, which indicate sloppy proofreading.  This can potentially frustrate readers new to the field of financial management.  Calculation errors (!), misapplication of formulas (Do vs. D1) and mislabeling of charts (time lines / cash flows) were particularly frustrating and can be confusing.
<br />
<br />I welcome the authors to contact me if they plan to release an updated edition (this book copyrighted 1998).  I'll be glad to share with them the errors (at least I think they are!) I found.
<br />
<br />It would also have been nice if the authors utilized financial calculators for some of the TVM (time value of money) applications and indicated the keystrokes.  A break-out box showing the steps on a Texas Instrument BA-II or HP12-C (two popular financial calculators) would be helpful.
<br />
<br />In sum, Financial Management is a very readable book.  It is comprehensive, practical, and provides a good depth of discussion without getting too theoretical.  Just watch out for the silly mistakes.</span>

                    <span>I don't know what that reader below is saying.?? This book was very helpful to me when I used this for a finance class. It's great because it has quizzes/exams, definitions, key terms, a useful index, many many sample problems, and formulas in bold. When you are a busy person and are using this as a refresher, or in conjunction w/ a textbook, it's very helpful to have this paperback workbook to go through for a quick reference. 
<br />
<br />I've referred to it many times while reading through my textbook, doing homework problems, or studying for a test. 
<br />
<br />Love the schaum's series - this one in particular has been very useful to me. </span>

                    <span>This work is a good supplement to the class text. It has hundreds<br>of solved problems depicted. In addition, the Schaum's covers<br>international financial management problems which are not always<br>found in the standard texts. This is a good practice<br>workbook to reinforce the current text and class notes.<br>Complex cash flow problems, present value and return on investment problems are shown with accompanying diagrams to aid<br>in the visual presentation. This text is excellent in order to<br>prepare for formal licensing exams and other comprehensive<br>tests .</span>
