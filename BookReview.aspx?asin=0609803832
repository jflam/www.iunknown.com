Visit the regal plantation manors, the elegant town houses, the nicely appointed vacation homes, the proudly painted homes of the populace, and the omnipresent gardens of nine beautiful Caribbean islands. The very notion of a unified Caribbean style would seem to be impossible in this realm of separate island worlds, yet the diversity is rooted in a common Creole heritage, resulting in a fascinating vernacular architecture that tells the story of life--both past and present--in the West Indies. <I>--Amy Handy</I></span>

                    <span>My favorite of the Style books. I purchased this when it came out and glad I did. I still enjoy the beautiful pictures that really bring you back to the islands. To me this is the best of all the style books--with other titles English Style, French Style, Spanish Style. Caribbean Style has remained in print and stood the test of time. Also an excellent reference for interior designers for island style.</span>

                    <span>this book was not what i had anticipated. <BR>it might be great for tourists who want to see the true island living,or doll house makers, however, <BR>as an architecture student and a caribbean native i was not impressed by the literature, or lack thereof.<BR>excellent photography.</span>

                    <span>I live in St.Thomas, USVI and wanted to build a doll house for my 3 yr old to have as a rememberance of living on a tropical island. Since St. Thomas is a US Territory it is more Americanized, so I purchased Caribbean Style for a better refference. It is now my doll house bible. Now my daughter will have a authentic reproduction Caribbean house!</span>

                    <span>When it was first published, this great book stunned every body. I remember our surprise watching the pink cover, the blue pages, the nicely cut pages. As in Marie-France Boyer books illustrated by Eric Morin you found in this series "french style", "english style" and italian style", for the first time, artistic layout, creative photographs, technical architecture drawings and 280 pages full of pictures and precise descriptions. If you plan a trip to Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Barthelemy, Antigua, Nevis, Montserrat, Barbados, Haiti or Jamaica, buy this book. It is "indemodable". As invitees in Plantation Bologne, one of the best ron maker in Guadeloupe we stayed in the former distillery manager house . All architectural details of this type of houses can be found in this book. If you were lucky enough to spend some time in any of these islands, you will want to buy this book too. It is a standard in its own.</span>

                    <span>This book is a treasure. It is unique in the sheer coverage it affords an array of islands which are usually represented by a few photos of beaches and lush foliage. Caribbean Style takes the reader inside the refurbished plantations, through the cities, and around the steep mountain sides to the poorer housing of the average islander. To rave over the colors of their shanties [my word] is akin to extolling the cardboard-box hovels of America's urban homeless. But still, this is a fascinating look at the wealthy and the other Caribbean which visitors locked in their tourist enclaves might not see. I particularly liked the architectural section at the end which delineates the housing styles on specific islands. Given the numbers of vacationers going to the smaller islands every year, it amazes me how hard it is to find picture essays on them. For me this book was a treasure trove of rare images and therefore, a must-buy.</span>
