                <span id="Label1">In 1824 a young Norwegian named Niels Henrik Abel proved conclusively that algebraic equations of the fifth order are not solvable in radicals. In this book Peter Pesic shows what an important event this was in the history of thought. He also presents it as a remarkable human story. Abel was twenty-one when he self-published his proof, and he died five years later, poor and depressed, just before the proof started to receive wide acclaim. Abel's attempts to reach out to the mathematical elite of the day had been spurned, and he was unable to find a position that would allow him to work in peace and marry his fianc<br /> <br /> But Pesic's story begins long before Abel and continues to the present day, for Abel's proof changed how we think about mathematics and its relation to the "real" world. Starting with the Greeks, who invented the idea of mathematical proof, Pesic shows how mathematics found its sources in the real world (the shapes of things, the accounting needs of merchants) and then reached beyond those sources toward something more universal. The Pythagoreans' attempts to deal with irrational numbers foreshadowed the slow emergence of abstract mathematics. Pesic focuses on the contested development of algebra--which even Newton resisted--and the gradual acceptance of the usefulness and perhaps even beauty of abstractions that seem to invoke realities with dimensions outside human experience. Pesic tells this story as a history of ideas, with mathematical details incorporated in boxes. The book also includes a new annotated translation of Abel's original proof.</span>

                    <span>To me, Abel's Proof successfully bridges the difficult gap that separates math books from fun books. Being one who appreciates the history and development of ideas and who is not afraid of a few equations, my needs as a reader were tastefully satisfied. If you, like me, find yourself enticed by some of the more subtle problems in math and science, while at the same time, have not the recourse to explore each one to their fullest, this book will be a welcome guide. Pesic uses Niels Abel's proof (1824) regarding the general insolvability by radicals of fifth degree equations as the central trunk of a robust tree whose branches contain delightful episodes of mathematical examples, human dramas, twists of fate, and historical parades. As much a biography as anything else, I could feel the personalities of the mathematicians evinced through their contributions to the question of solvability. From the near misses of Ruffini and Gauss to the final QEDs of Abel and Galois, one sees the human elements of struggle, triumph, anger, and success, set thoughtfully alongside the mathematical details. Carefully arranged mathematical sidebars allow this book to be read with as much technical intent as one chooses to bring; the math is there for the taking (little goes beyond a basic familiarity with algebra). In short, this book offers a delightful way to see some intriguing math and the characters who made it happen.</span>
