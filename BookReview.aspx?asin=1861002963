                    <span>... Anyways, I bought this book because I urgently wanted to learn PHP and use it with mysql for a web site, and it was great. You learn the syntax of PHP, and then there are a variety of tutorials on the different capabilties of PHP, including database and image editing (this is actually really cool). Then at the end there are 4 sample full-blown programs that are explained and available for download at the book's website (as well as all the source code throughout the book). These include a web forum script, a send mail script, etc.<P>As great as this book is, I wouldn't recommend it to someone with no programming experience though since the explanations are very concise and thus brief. But anyways, one should not learn PHP as a first language as it is very limited to web uses unlike other scripting languages such as Python.</span>

                    <span>Ok, this is a very good book. I bought this book, with very limited programming experience. I had only really tinkered around with PHP.<P>I found this book very easy to read, and use when I needed it later for a specific job. I think this book is better used going through it from start to finish, taking notes, or however else you learn. There are about 200 pages of Appendix with some handy references.<P>I skipped the installation chapters as I had PHP already installed on my web host.<P>At the end of many chapters, there are exercises you do that links to the chapter you just covered. For the first few chapters you work on a online job application, and build that up at the end of each chapter. Then it moves on to an address book...<P>At the end of the chapters(before the appendix) is 4 case studies: Shopping cart, Phorum discussion board, Email application, and Database browser. Here they write these web applications, and show you how it's done!<P>There are not many mistakes in the writing. I think there are two mistakes in the code, but that is covered on their website.<P>Overall I think this is the best book on the market for PHP. It is interesting, very practical, and is a great book for learning PHP.<P>What are you waiting for? :)</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was looking for a PHP book that wasn't just a reprint of the manual (like most of them are). This book is great for newbies and expirienced programmers alike. This is the book that'll be on your desk 24 a day -- since you'll keep refering back to it. <P>Should be on every serious PHP developer's book shelf. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that the chapter on PHP and XML didn't provide as much details as I was hoping for. But since I got it really cheap using a coupon from UnderTag.com, I can't really complain.</span>

                    <span>The book would explain PHP well if there weren't so many grammatical errors. The first few chapters were well worth reading, but about halfway through, stilted sentences and the incorrect use of "which" and "that" put me off the treatise entirely. I know that books of this ilk must be written hurriedly so the technology described in the book doesn't get a chance to change substantially before the book goes to market, but this is ridiculous. If I were shopping for a PHP book, I'd look seriously at some others.</span>

                    <span>This book might be worthwhile as a classroom workbook where you go through each and every chapter in order. As a book for somebody who wants to get things done this book is terrible. You have to wade through entire chapters to find what you want and the index is useless.<P>For my real world projects I have never found what I wanted to know in this book. You are better off just looking at online documentation. <P>It is also out of date and lacks coverage of sessions (there is a newer edition of the book that might include this but I am not going to buy it).</span>
