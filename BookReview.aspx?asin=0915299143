                    <span>After only reading a few pages of this book I could see that this Toyota has a lethal weapon in business that American companies seen not interested in using - or worse think that thay are using it just fine? Compare "TPS" with "My Years With General Motors" and imagaine who you would rather compete with? Demming said something like "export everything from America... except american management!" This book will show you why.<br> This book is not a "ISO" type blueprint in that it is a consise overview without much "filler" or stale requirements so don't worry if you donot get the big picture until you have read and maybe reread the book. <br> One note -  I think that just maybe (if I can be so bold) that chapter 3 should be read first then the rest of the book. I also recomend other books (and web searches) on Kaizen by those who have done it for as long as Mr. Ohno.<br> I love this book!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading Mr. Ohno's book. Even though it is a short book, it is full of ideas that can be applied to any production bussiness.<br>Even though that the system was created for a car production facility, the concept of "waste" is useful to any type of manufacturing. This idea, coupled with the concept of producing exactly what is sold ( or what the client requests )allows any company to became profitable in times when profit margins get narrower and narrower.</span>

                    <span>I am a former Toyota Engineer and recommend that anyone interested in learning about the Toyota Production System a.k.a. lean manufacturing this is the place to start.  Mr. Ohno is the creator of TPS and he gives a very good overview of how the system works.  The book is very easy to read and easy to understand.  This book should be read by all upper management employees looking to create a lean environment in their plants.  The book will give you a good foundation to start implementing the techniques.  It is the best book to read considering it comes from the inventor himself.  It is the best you are going to find shy of being actually trained within Toyota's walls.</span>

                    <span>This is a short book and as such gets to the point.  Explains difficult concepts in a simple way.  This book explains how JIT, Kanban, Zero Defects came about.  Also shows what is missing from American JIT and that is production leveling.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Ohno is the father of Toyota's just in time production system, also called lean manufacturing, though it is more than just that.  The book gives an excellent primer on the basic principles of JIT, work-flow, leveling, waste minimization, etc.  He also covers the history and application of these philosophies at Toyota.  The book is a surprisingly good read, and Mr. Ohno's dynamic and engaging personality shows through.  A must read for MBA students, persons in manufacturing or occupations where time is money.</span>
