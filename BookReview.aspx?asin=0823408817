                    <span>This Book explains the life of Thomas Jefferson.  It starts out explaining how his father died when he was very young, leaving him the man of the house and with a lot of responsibilities.  The book also explains how Jefferson always loved reading and decided that it would be good to go to college for law.  He was the person who wrote the declaration of independence and was the secretary of state for George Washington.  	He also served two years as president himself and established the University of Virginia.  The book also tells how upset Jefferson was when he lost his wife and daughter.  <br>	I liked this book because it told about Jefferson's life in a way that wouldn't bore children.  It was really colorful and it was fairly easy to read.  It is a book that children could pick up and really get into where as other biographies might just be boring and something children would only read when they had too.  <br>	I think that the message this author is trying to send out is just what an important person Jefferson was.  It seems that he really wants children to be able to get into books with biographical context and not find the subject to be dull and boring.  The book also has the pictures that really jump out at you which children really love.</span>

                    <span>Adler does a superb job in the "A Picture book of..." series. The book has lots of biographical information but presented in such a manner that young students will not be bored. Great illustrations on each page give little ones lots to look at while listening. The book concludes  with a timeline of important dates. Good resource material for grades K-3  as an initial introduction to key people in US history.</span>
