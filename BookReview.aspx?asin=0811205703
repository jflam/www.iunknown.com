                <span id="Label1">This volume, the journal Merton kept on the journey to Asia where his life ended, also is a culmination of his long spiritual journey as a writer. "His ecumenism was total," the editors remind us, "and we find him ranging from Tantric Buddhism to Zen, and from Islam and Sufism to Vedanta." The book, however, is not dryly academic; rather, as the foreword suggests, "Merton's pilgrimage to Asia was an effort to deepen his own religious and monastic commitment." Merton himself was clear about this sense of pilgrimage; so too was he clear that this meant in no way a break with his Christian roots. "I think we have now reached a stage ... of religious maturity," he writes, "at which it may be possible for someone to remain perfectly faithful to a Christian and Western monastic commitment, and yet to learn in depth from say, a Buddhist discipline and experience." This book is the fruit of such learning. Including descriptions of his meetings with the young Dalai Lama, the book is meticulously edited and supplied with useful explanatory notes and appendices, including transcriptions of talks that Merton gave during his trip. Most movingly, however, the journal itself concludes with the narrative of his transformative experiences in Ceylon where he visited three colossal figures of Buddha carved from huge stones. "Surely," he writes, "my Asian pilgrimage has come clear and purified itself." A few days later he passed away. <I>--Doug Thorpe</I></span>

                    <span>This book is a must-read for fans of Merton, and for anyone interested in encounters between Western Christianity and Eastern religions (particularly Hinduism and Buddhism).<p>Merton achieved incredible realizations and great insight into Buddhism despite the fact that he lived most of his life as a monk and hermit isolated at Gethsemani Abbey in Kentucky, USA. At the end of his life, invited to present a paper in Bangkok on the renewal of monasticism, Merton made what he called his 'Asian pilgrimage' and finally set out to see firsthand what he had studied in books. This journal took him all across Asia, to various holy sites, and to encounters with numerous religious communities. He met, along the way, such people as H.H. the Dalai Lama and Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. He records all of this, his encounters, and even more interestingly, his own reflection on Buddhism and Christianity, in this wonderful gem of a journal.<p>What would have happened had Merton lived a few more years? I often ask myself this. He was exploring not just the surface of Buddhism (even now, many decades later, the presentation of Buddhism in the West can be very superficial), but delving into its very heart -- mandalas, tantras, and so on, and probing into what their nature was and what this might mean for Christianity to encounter a spirituality that seemed at once totally foreign and alien, and yet at the same time the very essence of what Christianity means.<p>Merton was a brilliant individual. He does not succumb to easy platitudes such as "It's all the same thing" or anything like that. He respects difference. But he does also certainly see a deep and dazzling dynamic unity -- a truth -- that penetrates all of this -- and not just this, but every moment of our lives. That living power -- that is what is important, and he witnessed to this in his life and writings.</span>

                    <span>At the end of The Seven Story Mountain, Merton records his understanding of what God was<br>telling him as he continued as a young monk. The final passage in the book reads, in part, "But<br>you shall taste the true solitude of My anguish and My poverty and I shall lead you into the high<br>places of my joy and you shall die in Me and find all things in My mercy which has created you<br>for this end. . . That you may become the brother of God and learn to know the Christ of the<br>burnt men." And that is how Merton died, a burnt man in a monastic habit on a bathroom floor in<br>Thailand, electrocuted by a faulty fan switch as he stepped out of the shower. Eerie how things<br>work out sometimes. The Asian Journals record the end--spiritual as well as temporal--of<br>Merton's journey, and I tend to think that he found what he was looking for. I like to think he did,<br>and when I visited Gethsemani myself, it was the Asian Journal, even more than Thoughts in<br>Solitude, that convinced me of this. Of course, Merton had all but left Gethsemani behind when<br>he took down the Journals; there is speculation that he was at some point going to ask his abbot<br>to approve him staying in Asia as a hermit of some sort, and the fruits of that adventure in<br>following God are lost to us, among so much else that was lost when we lost Fr. Louis, our<br>Thomas Merton.<p>The Asian Journal is many things. It is both a travelogue and a tribute to place, strangely<br>comparable to Matthiessen's Snow Leopard or Merwin's Lost Upland. It is a record left by one of<br>the greatest Christian spiritual mentors of the 20th century of visits with two of the most<br>important Buddhist spiritual mentors of the 20th century, the current Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat<br>Hanh. It is a sustained rhapsody on both Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism by a Christian<br>monastic most influenced in his "Eastern path" by Rinzai Zen and Confucianism. It is a fairly<br>good work of Buddhist art criticism, particularly if you are interested in comparative<br>iconography. But more than all this, it is just Merton, plain and simple. It is unvarnished, the man<br>knew he was no saint, though he also knew he was looked upon as such by an increasing number<br>of people. This from a man who wrote on the back of his ordination card the passage from<br>Genesis referring to Enoch, "He walked with God and was seen no more, for God took him"!<br>Merton wanted a deeper solitude. He found it, and eventually found it in death, in Asia. All this,<br>and more, is recorded in Merton's Asian Journal. His account of his final enlightenment<br>experience at Polonnaruwa, when he writes "I mean, I know and have seen what I was obscurely<br>looking for," is alone worth the price of the book. It is easily Merton's  most personal work,<br>though much unlike the multi-volume set of journals published after the restrictions in Merton's<br>will ran out. Seven Story Mountain was also personal, but was written by a precociously brilliant<br>young writer still in the somewhat triumphalistic  flush of his conversion to Roman Catholicism.<br>The Asian Journals are, quite literally, the last things Merton ever wrote, and in them he is at the<br>height of his powers, and he is deep into the divine mystery of God when he writes these<br>journals, even when he is joking about parrots or Indian food. Throw in all the photos taken by<br>Merton himself (the man experiences dai kensho and still has the presence of mind to take<br>pictures of the reclining Buddhas!?) and the documents relating to his death, and there is no<br>excuse for a lover of Merton's life and teachings not to own this book.</span>

                    <span>One simply never tires of reading Thomas Merton. The Asian Journal provides a remarkably poignant and tireless encampment with one of the remarkable men of letters of the 20th century. The text is colored throughout with Merton's search for a place of greater solitude (his dissatisfaction on many levels with the cheese factory his beloved Gethsemani abbey had become being well known for some time before his death) -the redwoods of California, possibly Alaska- and as the journal progresses one begins to feel in his words a kind of prescient kinship with his own accidental death, occurring, of course, in Bangkok before he had completed his Asian pilgrimage. The appendices are priceless - the characteristic sweetness of his informal talk on monasticism given at Calcutta, and the remarkable lecture on Marxism and Monastic Perspectives with its prophetic last sentence "So I will disappear". Free of polemics, so giving in its human searching, this is, once again, essential Merton.</span>
