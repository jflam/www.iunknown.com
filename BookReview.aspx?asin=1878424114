                <span id="Label1">Deepak Chopra&#146;s best-selling guide to creating abundance and prosperity is now on CD and read by the author. Based on seven natural laws that govern all creation, this book shatters the myth that success results only from hard work, exacting plans, and driving ambition. Deepak Chopra offers a life-altering perspective on attaining success: Once we understand our true nature and learn to live in harmony with these natural laws, well-being, good health, fulfilling relationships, energy and enthusiasm for life, and material abundance can be achieved. Simple yet profound, the book&#146;s timeless wisdom and practical steps can be applied with surprisingly quick results.

                    <span>I have read almost all of Deepak Chopra's books. From some I gained much, from some I gained little, but from this one I gained the most. It's filled with 7 common-sense principles for attaining your goals and being happy. All the principles presented are profound yet simple - some more practical than others. All are concepts most of us already believe in but don't know exactly how to express. This book clears it up. If you're going to buy just one Deepak Chopra book, let this be the one. I also highly recommend "Open Your Mind, Open Your Life" by Taro Gold which is a collection of hundreds of thoughts from Eastern wisdom. "Open Your Mind, Open Your Life" and "The Seven Spiritual Laws" are my two favorite books of wisdom of all time. Excellent!</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for a book that will serve as a practical guide about how to become financially successful, this book is NOT for you. This book's focus is more a philosophical guide on how to accept fate and let go of events in our lives that we don't necessarily have control over. For example, Chopra suggests that after we've done our best to prepare for success, let go of the final outcome. If our plans don't work the way we anticipated, so be it. He teaches the reader how to accept fate and let fate serve as a guide to us as far as the direction we need to be taking in our lives. Chopra is NOT saying good things in life will come to you if you only sit on the couch, but provides readers with new ways of thinking about disappointments, successes, achievements, and failures. He suggests that by trying to force too much of our will on the events or people in our lives, we can actually push out of our reach the very things we desire. I found this book to be very calming and reassuring. He reminds us that we, as humans, are not ultimately in control of our lives, and that there is a higher power that influences our destiny, whether it be the energy of the universe or God. I think each reader can tailor Chopra's philosophies to their own needs, no matter what their religion. It just simply takes an open mind to do so. If you worry a lot about your future, I think you'll find this book a reassuring stress-reliever. Hope this helps!</span>

                    <span>It is always nice to find someone out there that thinks the same way you do, however express it much better.<P>In "The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success", by Deepak Chopra, he describes the fundamental principles of the universe and how we as part of the universe can be successful. Throughout the book he has to slow sown and explain how he is using many of the words as we usually give them different meaning. Then there are a few times that he has to turn to Indian words instead of making up new ones. Many say he is based in Ancient Vedic concepts yet if you did not know of them you would relies these are concepts of the now.<P>He hits the deck running with this book so if you have not been exposed to these concepts before you may need to re-read the book several times. And this book was not meant to jus be read you need to practice the concepts to understand them. This book is based on "Creating Affluence" and does not have the size to contain a lot of background reasoning for drawing conclusions. Your practice off the laws will do that for you.<P>The concepts are too simple to give the titles any meaning however here they are.<BR>1.	The Law of Pure <BR>The source of all creation is pure consciousness...<BR>2.	The Law of Giving<BR>The universe operates through dynamic exchange...<BR>3.	The Law of "Karma" or Cause and Effect<BR>Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind...<BR>4.	The Law of Least Effort<BR>Nature's intelligence functions with effortless ease...<P>5.	The Law of Intention and Desire<BR>Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment...<BR>6.	The law of Detachment<BR>In detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty...<BR>7.	The law of "Dharma" or Purpose in life<BR>Everyone has a purpose in life...<P>On a personal note it is so eerie that many of the things he talks about especially in the seventh law was the way me ad my siblings were raised. However I was 20 years old before cutting throw my first Veda<P>Be sure to also listen to the audio to here how he emphasizes.</span>

                    <span>...myself included.<P>I first read this book about 4 or 5 years ago when I began my journey towards discovering my Higher Self. This book is a great read no matter what religion (if any) you belong to. Honestly, the fundamental laws that lead to success in the game of life along all lines--health, wealth, peace of mind, love/relationships and true expression--are very simple but few of us are lucky to happen upon them. Then, for those who do, applying these laws consistently is something that even fewer of us do.<P>My favorite nugget of wisdom from this book is the follow:<BR>"That which doesn't multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor receiving." (pg. 30)<P>I try to keep this insightful idea in mind when I consider not only finanacial and material concerns but my relationships and interactions with people as well.<P>I have read 3 of the author's books and this one is thus far my favorite.</span>
