                    <span>I accomplished my lifetime dream of starting my own business. Howevever, I lack experience in business. I heard about Kick Start Your Dream Business, bought a copy, and find it to be the best possible investment I could have ever made.<P>Romanus's suggestions, tips and step-by-steps are easy to follow, enjoyable, and informative. I would recommend this book to anyone-from the already knowledgeable and experienced to the pros.<P>Thanks,<BR>Romanus</span>

                    <span>Romanus is WONDERFUL! I took my boyfriend to his seminar after hearing Romanus speak at a SF Chamber of Commerce. The book (and his seminars) do exactly what they promise to do- get you started and on your way to making your dream business a reality. He breaks the process down into easy and manageable steps. The book takes the fear out of getting started and addresses your concerns and worries. He has consulted with hundreds of people on how to turn their dream ideas into realities. His 14 years of trial and error are all in the book! I highly recommend you read it! Now my boyfriend and I are following his book step by step and progressing weekly towards creating my boyfriends dream company.</span>

                    <span>This book is exceptionally thorough; detailed and practical, with tons of worksheets and exercises to perform. However, it seems very focused on product-based business, versus service businesses. The author does include service businesses in his examples, but the exercises and worksheets seem to me to be very helpful for those people providing an actual product, with suppliers and vendors and product margins and the like. Overall a recommended book, especially if you're looking for an exceptionally detailed blueprint for moving from idea to execution.</span>

                    <span>I just started my business several months ago and it has been a roller coaster ride! There have been some really discouraging days and this book helps me find new ideas and inspiration to keep on going.

                    <span>As a speaker to entrepreneurs I frequently reccomend this book. <BR>It is packed full of paractical ideas on starting a business plus many specific steps to follow for certain aspects of business like researching products, manufacturing and <BR>distribution. People will also appreciate all the real life stories of the challenges people faced in business and how they solved those challenges. <P>Romanus has a straight forward clear and concise way of advising the reader. I got a lot out of this book and I know many others will too.</span>
