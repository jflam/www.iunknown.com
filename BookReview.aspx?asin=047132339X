                    <span>Alot of those get rich quick gurus do not tell you about the technical analysis that is covered in this book.  They just paint pictures of them buying and flipping and making 40,50,60 thousand dollars and its easy.  If it was so easy, then we'd all be millionaires.  There is risk involved and this book lets the reader know that, along with the rewards.  </span>

                    <span>I've read many real estate books and this one is the best at covering the broadest spectrum.  The best part about the book is that as other reviewers have stated, the book is up-to-date and not outdated like some other "get rich" quick real estate books.  Those times are over.  One word of caution is that the book does not touch on multi-family properties and could use a little more by the way of how to measure performance.</span>

                    <span>Very informative and lots of practical advice.  Calculating Cap rate and how to derive a value off the anticipated rents is not discussed in many other books.  Good, detailed advice for anyone considering a property.  </span>

                    <span>i've bought and sold a few pieces of personal real estate, but i'm new to real estate investment.  i looked long and hard for a book that was short on hype and "get rich quick" and long on the facts, both good and bad.  this book is it- the authors cover all of the major types of real estate investing (though they focus primarily on residential) and give you the tools to get started.  highly recomended.</span>
