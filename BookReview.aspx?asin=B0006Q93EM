                <span id="Label1">One nonfiction film that truly creates a narrative journey, <I>My Architect</I> is filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn's engrossing search for his father. Louis Kahn, one of the most celebrated architects of the 20th century, died in 1974 and left behind a highly compartmentalized life, including two children born out of wedlock to two mistresses. Nathaniel interviews the members of this somewhat puzzled family, but his deepest experiences are visits to the buildings that his father made (such as the grand Salk Institute in La Jolla, California), culminating in an emotional trip to Bangladesh. Here, Louis Kahn designed a massive government complex, a soaring achievement (and fascinating paradox--a Muslim capital designed by a Jewish man). This film asks:  where does an artist truly live? In his life, or in the work he leaves behind? Nathaniel Kahn takes an amazingly even-tempered approach to this, given his personal stake in the story, and the result is a uniquely stirring movie. <I>--Robert Horton</I></span>

                    <span>I watched this movie because I am fond of Louis Kahn's architectural works and I took my wife along as a test if general public would be able to relate to an architectural movie.  It just happened that this movie managed to captivate the audience's heart strings.  The essence of the Director, Louis Kahn's "bastard" son (as the Director called himself) was to discover his father via interviewing his colleagues (I M Pei, Philip Johnson), his admirers (Frank Gehry), his critic (the name has escaped me but the person that blocked Louis' utopian vision of having a non-vehicle city of Philadelphia, his ex-employees, his mistresses, his friends (in Bangladesh and India and happened to be architects in their own rights), viewing his works (some soaring in spiritual heights and grandeur and some simply polarised opinions).  As the movie concluded, the Director said succinctly that he finally rediscovered his relationship with his Dad and it's time to move on after finishing this project.  As some people said in this documentary, it's essential that Louis is seen as a fallible human-being but not a being of extraordinary capabilities.  They continued to say that whilst there's no denying he made mistakes, that's offset by all contributions that he made to humankind and a person that sacrificed so much for his art at the expense of his families and his livelihood.  This documentary comprised of many aspects that I didn't know of Louis Kahn and irrespective if it's catering to architectural buff like myself or to people who simply wanted to engage in splendid human story, this documentary is it.  Whilst documentary is a bit crass, like Louis Kahn's belief, honesty and integrity in art is pivotal and I think his son would make him a very proud father indeed.  This documentary comes in square format.  Soundtracks that came together with this documentary can be deemed as whimsical (from all fields imaginable) but some really rose to the ocassion namely the one by Beethoven.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Nathanial Kahn tells the story of a son's search for the mystery of his father through this one son's   personal search. The story is emotionally gripping.  The journey includes some fantastic visuals of buildings designed by Louis Kahn (example, the Salk Insititue), biographical information on his life, and interviews with prominent architects such as I.M. Pei, Moshe Safdie, Phillip Johnson and others.
<br />
<br />The film also presents a working architects office and interviews with those who people such a world (even taxi drivers).  A touching interview is with a man who viewed Louis Kahn after he had had a heart attack in Penn. Station...the viewer can feel the emotion of the son in the need for this interview (Nathanial was eleven when his father died). Louis Kahn's death  was a  front page NY Time's  story.
<br />There is a design to the film  that interweaves these various threads with remarkable honesty and objectivity.
<br />This documentary film is truly a work of art (including the selections that comprise the musical score). It is one to own.</span>

                    <span>I was very impressed with the manner that Nathanial Kahn included his audience in the discoveries he made in the documentary of his father. Although I watched it three days ago, the film still weighs heavily on my mind and in my heart. My heart goes out to the 11 year old boy who lost his father, and his dreams at such a young age. My respect goes out to a director who approached the project in such an openminded and honest manner.
<br />
<br />Nathanial Kahn managed to create a wonderful film that explained much about Louis Kahn's life and personality without de-mystifying him in any way. His movie is honest, personal and objective at times. At others, it is detached, and purposefully open ended. The complexity of the film is a clear reflection of the complexity of Louis Kahn himself. A man who was a genius, but was so flawed in his personal life.
<br />
<br />Nathanial Kahn, like his father, is  truly a creative genius. If one studies the evolving nature of his style through this film, it is clear he was experimenting and learning as he went. He was adapting to the content.
<br />
<br />He would extract memories from individuals who knew his father, but the information was decidedly different depending on whether the person knew he was Kahn's son, or whether this fact was hidden from the person being interviewed. It was fascinating to see how he himself hid the fact that he was Louis Kahn's son in an effort to obtain more objective thoughts from his subjects. A less talented filmmaker would have been unable to evolve throughout the filmmaking process the way Nathanial Kahn did. 
<br />
<br />The honesty of his approach could be construed as a lack of a strong concept for the film, but I believe it is truly a reflection of his openmindedness, and his desire to get at the truth about his father. His clear lack of an agenda for the film is not only a credit to him as a filmmaker, but it is the one aspect of him that separates him from nearly every documentary-maker in the national spotlight today.
<br />
<br />Finally, I can't end this review without commenting on Ed Bacon, the retired city planner from Philadelphia, and Louis Kahn's arch enemy.  Ed Bacon has to be one of the most crass and uninspiring people I have ever seen on film. An egotist with a trailer park mentality at best. 
<br />
<br />It is ashame such an unintellectual individual could hold so much power for so long in a city as great as Philadelphia. The damage he created in his career will haunt that city for decades. I certainly credit Nathanial Kahn for simply letting the camera roll. The more Ed Bacon talked, the more foolish he looked and sounded. Nathanial Kahn's genius for quickly adapting to his subject captured the true evil that Mr. Bacon somehow managed to exploit for so many years. Through this film, it is quite satisfying to know that in the end, Louis Kahn triumphed over Ed Bacon. This is what history will record.
<br />
<br />I do not believe there was true closure for Nathanial Kahn,  but I do believe the facts show his father truly loved him in his own way. This was clearly evident in photos of the two, as well as when they made the book of funny boats one evening when Nathanial was a child. 
<br />
<br />There is no question that Louis Kahn hurt those who were close to him. Nevertheless, there was something special about him that kept his family and friends in place for so long both during life, and long after his death. The film does not completely explain this phenomenon, but like his art and his life, it is a question that has no clear answer.</span>

                    <span>This film works just beautifully, both as a personal narrative and as an exploration of Kahn's visionary architecture.  I was utterly floored by the emotional impact of Nathaniel Kahn's journey into his father's past.  As Kahn's appreciation of his father's professional accomplishments expands, so, too, does his sense of loss for the absentee father whom he knew only fleetingly, and who died when he was eleven.  By the end of the film, when we see the reverence with which Kahn is viewed in India (where he is considered a sort of yogi or guru for his transformation of matter into "light and silence"), and in Bangladesh (where his enormous personal and financial sacrifice to build the governmental center made him a martyr in the eyes of many), we may come to view his problematic moral and family choices as simply the byproduct of a mind focused on universal themes.  But this does not negate the intense pain he caused his several families, and it is instructive that someone so generous and talented was also the instrument of so much personal suffering to those who loved him most.  The filmmaker explores all of this with unflinching honesty, enhanced by wonderful camera work and an evocative soundtrack; he has created a work of art entirely worthy of his famous father's legacy.    </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a movie by Nathaniel Kahn, about his father, Louis I. Kahn, who is regarded as one of the great architects of the 20th century. Notice that the movie is titled "My Architect," not "My Father." Nathaniel does not know much about his father; Louis Kahn died when Nathaniel was 11. He died in Penn Station, in the restroom, and his body was unclaimed for three days because he had scratched out the home address on his passport and no one knew who he was. Nathaniel's mother told him this was because his father had decided to leave his legal wife and daughter, and come to live with Nathaniel and his mom. Up till this time, Louis had only come to visit Nathaniel and his mother about once a week, at night, and they drove Louis home before morning, letting him out a few blocks from his home.
<br />
<br />This film is shot documentary style. Nathaniel is now in his 30s, and he wonders if his father ever had any intention of actually living with them. It has been 20 years since his father passed on, and most of his father's friends are now in their 80s. Nathaniel decides to go talk with some of them and try to get a better idea of who his dad was. He has also decided to visit all of the major buildings his father designed, hoping to get some feeling from his dad's work about what kind of person he was, and hoping to feel some connection with what his father has left behind. There is archival footage of Louis Kahn at work in his office, lecturing university students, and surveying the construction of his buildings.
<br />
<br />What Nathaniel discovers is that most of the people who knew Louis Kahn understood him through his work, but did not know very much about his personal life. He was a difficult man in many ways, and stories are told about how he worked his employees so hard that he would not allow one of them to leave work and be at the hospital when the man's child was born. Some of the people that Nathaniel goes to talk to are nice until they learn that he is Louis' "bastard son," and then they don't want to talk to him anymore. Some of the people tell him that his father was a genius and that his work was too big and important to allow him to focus on something as insignificant as his family. Some of the people knew about the "second family" and when they find out who Nathaniel is, they cry.
<br />
<br />At some point, Nathaniel discovers he has ANOTHER half-sister, also the product of his father's extra-marital affair with an employee. But that family moved on, whereas Nathaniel's mother spent her life hoping and dreaming and waiting for Louis to choose her over his wife.
<br />
<br />So the entire movie is a search to find out what kind of person Louis was, and for Nathaniel to sort out his feelings for his father. He wonders, are he and his half-sisters a family??? Did his father care about people, or only about buildings?
<br />
<br />At the end of the movie, he still doesn't have the answers about why his father did what he did, or whether his father intended to come live with them, or even if his father loved his mother at all. He finally meets his two half-sisters, he talks to aunts and uncles on both sides of his family (some of whom did not know he existed), he challenges his mother about why she never moved on and found a life companion, and finally he decides that it's time to let go of the father he never had.</span>
