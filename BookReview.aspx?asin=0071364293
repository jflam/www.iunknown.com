                    <span>This is an excellent book. The author stresses the difference in communication styles and the communicatiuon partnership between the sender and reciever. The information on "Making the most of meetings" and "successful presentations" was exceptional. A very good book for anyone who wants to increase their own communication skills, as well as those who teach communication to other.</span>

                    <span>This book did not help me at all.....If anything, it should the handbook of how NOT to communicate in business.  Just a bunch of hash and rehash I'm sure the author found somewhere else.  Save your money and buy something more useful.</span>

                    <span>When I first start reading the book I was about to stop reading since it seemed too simple. But I kept reading and see that there are techniques and well chosen examples of how to communicate with your peers and boss. The communication profiles section is a must read. After this section you'll see you can't stop reading the whole...</span>

                    <span>In a world that prides itself on "efficiency," Lani's  personable, professional treatment of over-all communication is truly EFFECTIVE. My copy of this handy handbook is filled with different colored highlighting, scribbling in the margins, and dog ears. The format is delightful for one who reads many books; the style makes one feel as if the author, Lani Arredondo, is right beside you, encouraging, smiling, touching--always teaching more fine-tuned ways of communicating.<p>This easy-read is a priceless blend of head and heart, mindset and skills. The play on "p's" makes for easy Practice! The part our perceptions play in our interactions sets the stage. Perceptions, personality profiles and pausing were keys for me. Lani leads the reader by conversational tone to understand how differences can be pluses when managed with understanding and skill. We are reminded to pause when confronted with less than positive folks. <p>Another strong point in this age of speed is the crisp format and the relevant tips for being brief. And bold. Lani confronts in a warm style the general fear of facing issues--glossing over, backing down, etc. She gives workable ways to help individuals and teams talk through to real solutions.  The lively lessons on giving instructions and feedback are helpful for those who hesitate or barge in inappropriately.<p>"Communicating Effectively" builds logically from laying a foundation of understanding to getting the courage to be real and right on! When every job ad calls for "excellent communication" and "getting along with people," this book should be next to everybody's laptop--and bedside. It's next to mine and I'm still highlighting!</span>

                    <span>In every chapter I learned something helpful to improve my communications, not only at work but also at home.  I especially like the author's concept of "building bridges" and the specific skills for doing so.  <p>It has helped me a great deal with my co-workers and personnel.  I plan on suggesting this book as a "must do" for my staff!!</span>
