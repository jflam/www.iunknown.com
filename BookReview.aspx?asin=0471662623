                <span id="Label1">More than thirty proven sales strategies from John Patterson, the father of American salesmanship<br>   People don't like to be sold, but they love to buy," Jeffrey Gitomer likes to say. And he's been saying it for years. When Gitomer began his research for this book, he discovered a quote by John Patterson, founder of National Cash Register, that was amazingly similar-"If the prospect understood the proposition, he would not have to be sold; he would come to buy." After discovering the similarities in their philosophies, Gitomer developed 32.5 principles of selling based on Patterson's ideas. These principles capture the essence of what Patterson preached 100 years ago, with twenty-first-century adaptations and concepts for implementing his sales strategies. Patterson was the first to write a sales book on dealing with objections, the first to create and use a sales training tool, and the first to refer to prospects as "probable purchasers." And it was Patterson who created the demand for a receipt, now one of the most powerful pieces of paper in the world.<br>   Each principle includes a quote from Patterson, one quote from Gitomer, and an occasional quote from another relevant person. Icons after each principle help readers understand how to think about the concept and adapt it to their needs, and how to turn that concept into action. The Patterson Principles of Selling are easily understood and just as applicable today as they were when Patterson developed them to sell cash registers. They offer a proven, commonsense approach to the sales process that will give salespeople the key to success today, tomorrow, and forever.<br>   Jeffrey Gitomer (Charlotte, NC) is a leading authority on sales and customer service whose clients include BMW, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, and Hilton Hotels, among others. He is also the author of the popular syndicated weekly column, "Sales Moves", read by more than 3.5 million people across the United States and Europe.</span>

                    <span>On target and once again the living proof that it is not necessary to have the perfect product, rather the perfect sales pitch, to be successful in selling. No matter if we are talking about the 1880s or the twenty-first century, if you can create the right interest, right sales tactics and create the demand, you will be successful. When you finish this book, you will come to realize that the only person holding you back is none other than yourself. Gitomer serves up a winner that stands heads and shoulders above the other "How to sale your product" books. Buy it, read it, and make your mark.</span>

                    <span>This book gives the reader the opportunity to learn selling at the feet of John Patterson, the original master salesman of America. Gitomer does a great job bringing Patterson's principles into this era. I recommend this book to every sales associate out there!</span>

                    <span>Jeffrey Gitomer makes some good points but nothing I haven't seen before in his weekly columns or "Sales Caffeine". I was surprised at how short/small the book was and even more surprised when I saw the extensive use of large fonts, short chapters and wide margins. This is more like an 75 page book - not 130. The main thing that I got out of it was a desire to learn more about John Patterson -- he was an intriguing guy.</span>

                    <span>This book is very good except for a few points. One every time Patterson is quoted we get a Gitomer quote which often is totally off-base. This is a minor quibble. The major problem with the book is that it assumes you have a customer base from which to start. While it helps you develops a pitch for the PP it assumes in many cases that you already have customers to return to; Gitomer does not handle developing new leads at all. I consider that a sales flaw; you may not.</span>

                    <span>Gitomer does it again.<BR>If you found this book to be a review, you really need to get his "Sales Bible". Clearly the Patterson book is research into John Patterson, founder of sales principles still used today.<BR>If you are buying one book from Gitomer, make it the "Sales Bible."<BR>The "Sales Bible" is a must for any sales person. I refer to it almost weekly, and I've since become self sufficient from a home office. It turns out my best sales manager is "The sales bible" and myself. This is the absolute best self motivator. <BR>As far as the free e-books, Gitomer is a master marketer. When he has a one day sale, it's not B.S. It really is a one day sale. He's a honest sales rep that means what he promises. Novel concept!<BR>Looking for free tips? Go to his web site and sign up for his sales caffine emails. I used his free advice for a year before I even bought a book. Gitomer understands customer loyalty and building relationships and value.<BR>If you don't agree, you just don't know Gitomer.</span>
