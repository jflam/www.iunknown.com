                    <span>This small textbook is a hard find in the finance world. The authors have managed to clearly explain a topic that is very difficult and unclear to begin with. It would be nice to see this book expanded into a larger text with practice problems, solution sets, and discourse on relevant research and current journal articles. Nonetheless, I thoroughly recommend this book to students and practitioners of finance alike.

                    <span>This is a good place to start if you have a good grasp of calculus and probability (just undergrad level-no measure theory or SDE needed). I am using it as a main text for a class and the book is very compact and precise as the same time it covers the main battle ground of the field of financial mathematics. 
<br />
<br />My training is math and when I need the financial applications, I support it with John Hull's bible. As a math person, I get tiered of reading the pages and pages of long stories in Hull's  book which can be summarized by a couple of equations with brief description. Hence, if you are like me who can understand (short) stories equipped with mathematical symbols, I definitely recommend you start here. </span>

                    <span>This text is a useful introduction to derivatives pricing. The examples and exercises are well-thought out and relevant, but I took off a star because there weren't more of them. One of the authors' stated goals was to bring the text's readers up to a level of rigor that would enable them to model new financial products for which "off the shelf" tools were not available. They succeeded admirably.
<br />
<br />This ought not to be the only such book in your library, but if you need a quick but still rigorous introduction or if you're a student struggling with a less than idea class text, this work is invaluable.</span>

                    <span>Major steps were skipped.  A reader without a fair mathematical background would not understand why suddenly a statistical result could be used to replace the whole martingale equation.  A lot of assumptions were made on the knowledge base of readers.  Therefore, it is not an introductory text.  If the reader has a fair mathematical background the reader needs not start with this book.  If the reader does not have the background, he can't understand this book.  This book is in the middle of nowhere.  In short, the authors skipped too many steps.  An subjective opion: It seems to me that the authors were very lazy to type.  </span>

                    <span>As a new person on the Wall Street, I picked this book after reading all reviews instead of Hull as my first book.<p>Reviews said undergraduates can handle this book. Wrong. Despite solid engineering background (IIT), I found this to be rather dry book. Certaily not the first book.<p>I have started Hull. And found that much more accessible and practically useful. Gets you into solving problems and getting answers.</span>
