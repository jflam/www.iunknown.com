                    <span>Luckily, I was able to find the Large Print edition at the public library.  Written in the modern history style, forming opinions instead of using factual information, he even changes his mind from his earlier writings, LINCOLN'S HERNDON (his law partner), saying he has grown "skeptical" about what he had passed on as facts.  Feelings don't matter in factual history.  
<br />
<br />He intimates that Abraham Lincolnn had "questionable" relationships with Joshua Speed with whom he boarded and shared a room and Ann Rutledge, though Lincoln seemed to have avoided becoming involved with women.  He quotes Stephen Ambrose whose opinion was that presidents need a confidant "who can be trusted absolutely never to divulge a secret."  
<br />
<br />These six spotlighted as "intimate friends" to Lincoln all divulged the letters and confidences they were trusted to keep secure!  They profited from the assassination by writing books.  His personal secretaries, the two Johns: Hay and Nicolay were no exceptions.
<br />
<br />For a private, "close-mouthed," self-educated, diversive president, he had no real friends as a youth, nor as President.  He enjoyed his sons, playing on the White House lawn with goats and other farm animals.  You can take the boy out of the country but you can't take the country out of the boy.  Did Mark Twain say that?
<br />
<br />Since his orations were considered on a par with Shakespeare, I am wondering if they had speech writers for the presidents back in the 1800s.  Are those really his words and beliefs?  Did JFK really come up with the "Ask not what your country can do for you" or was that also phrased by some speechwriter?  Lincoln was a good actor, sought public influence with his Civil War addresses.
<br />
<br />Mr. Donald has won two Pulitzer prizes for his earlier books about Lincoln and many concerning aspects of the Civil War.  But I would not call him an expert like Geoffrey C. Ward or William Davis.  He is a good researcher.</span>

                    <span>This is a relatively good book. The great thing about it is that the book is very easy to read and understand, unlike some books on Lincoln that sometimes read more like text books. This novel examines the most important relationships that Lincoln had with his male friends.
<br /> 
<br />One of the problems I had with this book is that the author couldn't seem to make up his mind on Lincoln's sexual prefrences. I do believe that it's quite clear that Lincoln was hetrosexual and never had a romantic or sexual relationship with his friend Joshua Speed.
<br />
<br />People often seem to foget that the way words where phrased back then is very different from how we use them today. Lincoln loved his wife Mary, even though their marriage was rocky.
<br />
<br />The point of the book isn't really about his family life but more on how his later relationships affected him. How everyone seems to think that he had many friends when in truth he only had a few favorites. What I got out of this book was a different picture of a Lincoln that I rarely think about. Even though I've been interested in his home life for years. The fact is that Lincoln often had serious emotional and sometimes even mental problems that most Lincoln biographers would rather forget. He is such an enigma in the American psyche.
<br />
<br />I personally felt that this book painted the life of a real man, one whom everyone wants to know but few people really understood or knew. The book also gave me a new respect for William H. Herndon (Billy), who I've never been very fond of, because of his rather cold views on Mary Todd Lincoln. This is one of the few new books that gave me something new to learn Lincoln in years. It probably won't answer many other questions about Lincoln. This would be better for someone new to reading about him. However, I rather like it, even though I do wish that the author had gone into more detail on certain things.

                    <span>Abraham Lincoln has always been and remains one of the most compelling figures in American history.  His rise to greatness seems so unlikely, his personality so different from what one expects from an American president and yet his importance to history is so vast that historians have sought to understand him ever since his murder in 1865.  David Herbert Donald is one of the finest living Lincoln scholars and he has written numerous books on his subject.  In this one, he focuses on an area previously neglected, Lincoln's friendships.  In chronological order, Donald looks at the important relationships in Lincoln's life, outside of his family.  Lincoln's first important friend was Joshua Speed, whom he befriended on his arrival in Springfield.  Lincoln and Speed shared a single room (indeed a single bed) for years as young bachelors and without question Speed was Lincoln's most intimate friend, one of the only people to whom young Lincoln could truly open up.  After both men married and Speed moved to Kentucky, the friends grew apart and Speed had little to do with Lincoln in the 1850's when the men came to opposing political views regarding slavery.
<br />
<br />Donald makes it clear that while Lincoln had other friends, none truly knew or understood him.  Indeed, his law partner of 17 years, Billy Herndon spent the years after Lincoln's death trying to put together a biography by interviewing everyone who knew Lincoln.  Lincoln's final important friendships were with Alexander Seward, his Secretary of State, who grew to admire Lincoln deeply and his young personal secretaries John Nicolay and John Hay, who not only toiled tirelessly for him but gave him solace and helped assuage his loneliness in the White House.
<br />
<br />In his exploration of Lincoln's friendships, Donald has no specific point to make.  He just writes interesting history.  But, nevertheless, what emerges is a portrait of a man with a zest for life who loved a good story and told endless jokes but who was also morose, melancholy and mysterious, even to those who knew him best.  Lincoln's friends may have cared deeply for him.  It will always be unclear just how much Lincoln really cared for them.  This is a fine little book and anyone interested in the life of Lincoln should read it.

                    <span>Ain intellectually and historically honest treeatment of a subject about which little information exists--the personal / emotional side of Lincoln's connections with several of his close contemporaries. With lucid, straightforward writing it manages to convey the particular qualities and character that uniquely attended each connection. It doesn't add more to the subject than the historical record suggests, but it does pull together what iis known of each relationship and present the material with thematic consistency and honesty. Seeks to inform rather than to advocate an author's pet bias or theory--e.g., avoids the self-indulgent nonsense of some Lincoln writers that interprets historical norms through the distortion of a modern social lens, for example interpreting his friendships as latently homosexual ... a theory which may gratify the emotional need of the author but for which no true historical evidence exists. Hurrah for disciplined, honest history!!</span>

                    <span>The book was easy to read and not very lengthy, but I got the sense the writer wanted to focus more on Lincoln's bedroom habits (Is he gay or not?) rather than anything else. We learn very little about his relationship with his wife. Maybe the reason for this is Abe Lincoln's friends rarely got along with Mary Todd Lincoln, and book is told through the eyes and experiences of Abe's friends or former law partners. Lastly, I felt the writer didn't tell us enough about Lincoln's children. Why was Abe's relationship with his eldest son so horrible? Was Abe never around when the kids were being raised or did he not show any interest in the boys? Some clear explanation would be helpful. In short, the book is interesting but a disappointment when all is said and done.</span>
