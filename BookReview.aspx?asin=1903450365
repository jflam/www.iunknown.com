                    <span>this is not a actionscript book or a book that explains the features about the flash program. It's only a book that will give you an idea about how other designers (not masters that means a lot of years of experience) face their proyects and how they solve them. So it's very interesting if you want to know their process and some new tricks. I recommend it.</span>

                    <span>This is the coolest book I have ever seen, unlike any other book out there.  Includes tutorials, background information, and more.  If you love Flash, this book must be in your collection.</span>

                    <span>Code samples and tutorials from different Flash artists, including individual influences and perspectives.  Some of the artists are way out there.  The code is consistently understandable if you really spend the time with the tutorials, and you have a basic ActionScript knowledge.  This book is cool.</span>

                    <span>Plain and simple this book is about the code!  Some of the authors have interesting perspectives (Brain Limond) but when it really comes down to it, who cares!<p>The real value of this book is knee deep in the minds of the people who wrote the actionscript for the tutorials.<br>Pick it apart, and get in to the head of each of these authors and there you will find the price of the book worth every penny you may have had to pinch to purchase this very expensive book.<p>The coding style that Erik Natzke talks about and demonstrates in this book is priceless.  <p>So bottom line if your a actionscript junky and you got the IQ to dive into someone else's mind I just don't see how you could not love this book!</span>

                    <span>If your goal is to learn anything about Flash, buy something else.  This book is a pretentious vehicle written by and for people in the industry who take themselves far too seriously.  It's a "coffee table" book of Flash sites and designers essays, and as if that wasn't absurd enough, it's peppered with ostentatious quotes like the following from Flash designer Yugo Nakamura:  "What I was trying to capture was the reflection, the impression of the real human being conveyed through the way time flowed between the keystrokes."  Also included are poorly explained Actionscript references and a CD that offers little value to aspiring developers.</span>
