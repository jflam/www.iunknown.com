                    <span>I agree with most of the other reviewers. If I were opening a coffee cart or kiosk I'd find this book educational. As it is, it lacks details but does give good basic information. You can start here but "Become a coffee house owner" is far more detailed, with business plans, budgets, specific list of items needed (down to the grease trap), contacts, employees, probably health requirements etc. I did gain some knowledge from this book, but it won't be a point of referral in the future.</span>

                    <span>Let's imagine you are thinking about buying that espresso stand down beside the street corner near your home. "Hmmm....wonder if that is a goldmine waiting to be mined?"<p>If so, this book is an adequate first step in your research. It touches a wide range of topics with a scientific, by-the-numbers approach. Therein lies the fault.<p>You see, entrepreneurship is not a science. It is an art. So, too, is service and great coffee!<p>By all means, buy of read ESPRESSO! STARTING & RUNNING YOUR OWN SPECIALTY COFFEE BUSINESS first. The ESPRESSO BARTENDERS GUIDE TO ESPRESSO BARTENDING has to be the next book on your journey to making a living brewing great coffee.<p>Before you buy that espresso stand, though, get hold of RETAIL MANAGEMENT by Ron Hasty and learn why the location of that stand may, or may not, be in a good location for your target market!

                    <span>This book is better than nothing but has no real depth.  It lacks any real financal information or planning guidelines.  In the era of the web there are almost no sites or addresses listed.This is just a walk in the park where it must have been written. If you are serious, look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>This book was useful for a few things for the absolute beginner (which I was when I read it), such a lists of supplies, questions to ask potential suppliers, and some basic info about how espresso machines work, plus the vocabulary to go with them, but beyond that was filled with a lot of not-so-helpful filler.  It focuses too much on espresso carts considering it didn't represent itself as being for that (if that's what you want to do, it'll be more helpful) and even goes so far as to be condescending at times - reminding you to be polite in challenging a demonstrator to pull a better shot of espresso if the first one is lacking.  Overall not a complete waste of money, but definitely not something I'll be referring back to.</span>
