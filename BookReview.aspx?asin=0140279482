                    <span>AMAZING. Such a small book, already worth the piddly amount I paid for it and I haven't GONE to london with it yet.<P>It it extermly detailed, showing train sations, routes, bus routes and route numbers, underground map and stops onthe street map, shows bars, restruauntts, cinemas, theatres, cultural, churches, tourist, sites walking tours, the works.<P>it's a full city map - two pages at a time, I think if it were printed as a whoel page it would be a HUGE map, scale is 6" to one mile, so that should give you an idea of what kind of detail it has.<P>Want to see what's north of yoru page? go to the page number listed, there you go! Along that edge it shows the bus routes going to that new page - JUST AMAZING. I know I won't be able to LIVE without this map while there. Parks, monuments, cemetaries, museums - all of it.<P>Imagine my surpise to get it and FIND my hotel before we even get there. I mean it's LISTED on the map! Southwark Rd. at Bear Lane and Burrell! All kinds of hotel are ON the map! Right there! I'm tewo block fromthe New Globe! and 3 blocks from the OLD Globe!<</span>

                    <span>The London Mapguide was indispensable during our recent trip to the city. Each page's map is jam-packed with information: sites, museums, post offices, parks, hospitals, churches, and even select pubs, restaurants and clubs. Aesthetics are important to me, and I can vouch that this guide is very well put-together, colorful and easy to read. Also, the book handily has pages at the beginning and end with plenty of info about museums and other sites, including hours of operation, their map location pages, pricing, etc. as well as emergency numbers, service info important to tourists, a large Underground map (yes, the famous one) and a fairly comprehensive index of street names.<P>The most unexpected benefit of the guide was how handy it was for figuring out the public transportation system. We bus-hopped all over London using this guide alone, seeing much more than we would have if we had just taken the Underground. The maps very clearly illustrate all of the bus routes and Tube/railway stops and it's super easy to trace how to get from one part of the city to another, seeing as much as possible along the way.<P>We used this map guide so much during our stay in London that it feels like as much a memento as anything else we brought home. Just flipping through it now brings back a lot of memories. Another reviewer complains that this guide doesn't cover a very extended area, and while it is true that it doesn't include maps for the outer fringes of London, it covered a perfect area for we tourists spending a week trekking all over the city's heart. I strongly recommend this guide!</span>

                    <span>Just got back from a wonderful vacation. This mapguide was incredibly helpful in finding all the locations I wanted to go to. More importantly for anyone who travels a lot and likes to wander and explore, you can easily figure out where you are and then where to go to catch the tube or bus. It is compact and handy. I cannot recommend this enough. The details for a city known for it's complexity make this invaluable.</span>

                    <span>I went to London with this map book and some general guidebooks two years ago. The maps in this book were incredibly useful and detailed -- better than any of the other books' maps, without question. Sounds silly to say, but I can't believe how much I appreciate the fact that even hotels are marked on its pages! Helps when you're planning your next trip, too! You will not regret buying this.</span>

                    <span>I found this map book extremely helpful on my recent stay in London, particularly the information on bus routes. I would never have had the courage to take buses, and I am glad the book gave me the info I needed to do so without fear of getting lost. The tube may be quick, but there is nothing like sitting in the front topside of a double-decker bus to really see London!<P>I found the dimensions of the book somewhat awkward, and I kept wishing it was skinny enough to stick in my back pocket, since I wasn't carrying a bag. As is, I was always having to hold it, and therefore afraid of losing it. <P>But all in all, you couldn't ask for more information, or a clearer map of an often confusing city.<P>Recommended.</span>
