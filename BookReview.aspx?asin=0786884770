                <span id="Label1">Two filmmakers who've beaten the system give the real dope on what it takes to get your movie made <P> Do you have to go to film school to get your movies made? No, say two young entrepreneurs who survived the grind. Here they offer 140 strategies for making movies no matter what. Amateurs as well as seasoned veterans can pick up this entertaining and incredibly useful guide in any place--at any point of crisis--and find tactics that work. Whether it's raising money or cutting your budget; dealing with angry landlords or angry cops; or jump-starting the production or stalling it while you finish the script, these strategies are delivered with funny, illustrative anecdotes from the authors' experiences and from veteran filmmakers eager to share their stories. Irreverent, invaluable, and a lot cheaper than a year's tuition, this friendly guide is the smartest investment any future filmmaker could make. <P> Strategies from the book include: Love your friends for criticizing your work--especially at the script stage Shyness won't get you the donuts Duct tape miracles Don't fall in love with cast or crew (but if you do...)</span>

                    <span>If only I had read this book before starting my Theater Company! Camille Landau & Tiare White's knack for critically examining the element of human relations in "What They Don't Teach You at Film School: 161 Strategies to Making Your Own Movie No Matter What" is what makes this book invaluable.<P>More-so than give information on film-making techniques (even though like Campbell's Soup - "it's in there!"), these insightful filmmaker/authors take the reader beyond mere textbook theory, and vividly illustrate the HUMAN day-to-day processes of filmmaking, from top to bottom, with all its joys, pains, challenges and triumphs.<P>THANKS! Camille & Tiare for taking beginning filmmakers, such as myself, on a guided tour of filmmaking at it's best, at it's worst, and still put it all together to "Make A Movie No Matter What!"</span>

                    <span>Sometimes I randomly buy books like this that SOUND like they have a really great premise, but they turn out to be amateur and doltish. Not so with this book -- it more than delivered on the promise made by the title and description. What a book!<P>I was struck in the first few pages at the encouraging tone of the book, and then again by the heft of the authors' intellects -- wow, these women have brains! But brains aren't all they have. They've got plenty of common sense about filmmaking with which they have been more than generous in their book. I learned more about filmmaking than I have from reading any other book, and at the same time I was energized and ready to pick up a camera, instead of discouraged and ready to run far away from any dreams of filmmaking.<P>It may be too late to go to film school, but it's never too late to read this book and get the down-low on everything you could want to know about making a film, conceptually, practically, and realistically. I'll have to read this book a few more times, and keep it close at hand for reference.<P>Well done, Camille and Tiare.</span>

                    <span>It is a must read because:<P> It covers things no other book covers in as much depth. For example: how to act and interrelate to members of your film crew. <P>It is inspiring in its insistence on persistence. Amazingly, this book brilliantly discusses how you might feel while promoting your project and how it affects you and your promotional efforts. (Again something unique.)<P>And much more. It is at 244 pages too short.<P>It is a hoot. These women are love's loosers. They may know how to act toward their crew--but life seems to have given the authors nothing but used trucks with bad transmissions when it comes to boyfriends. They have a philosophy to match. So take their advice on everything but love--and enjoy.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is extremely well-written, targeting exactly what the title says: "making your own movie no matter what". I submit that the ppl having issues with this book either (a) need to have a clue, or (b) can't read (ie, the book title).<P>The core, primary, absolute must-have of making a film is persistance. PERSISTANCE. Not the technology, not the "film or digital" question, not "Hollywood or Sundance or not", & not even the funding (or lack thereof). Really terrible films are made with big-budgets all the time, simply b/c of the incredible persistance of the director, producer, etc. Anybody see "Daredevil"? The [director] got some high-quality storyboards made, & literally sat in front of Producers for years & years until he convinced somebody to fund it (too bad he didn't spend the $$ on a script). Persistance => green-light. <P>Landau & White target the person emerging from film-school, and/or those who've given it a miss, & lay-out the bare necessities:<BR>1) Vision. Ie, WHY you want to make a film. Absolute must-have, for success. They include some very good ideas & break-down the process here for determining just *what* you [originally] wanted to say. <BR>2) Script. Pummel your vision/motivation until it screams, & squeeze that into a screenplay format that's presentable. And make *sure* to have your [next] one ready, if/when you current work gets noticed(!!!)<BR>3) Production. Ie, find like-minded, talented ppl to work with you, & learn how to treat them properly. Getting into that whole "diva" crap will only destroy your chances of making films later-on... <BR>4) Community. Make sure to work w/ others, both on your own productions & others'. There is no better way to learn how to make films, than making films. Why do so many ppl blindly repeat this, & then try to make their 'first movie' & never have been on a hot set before?!!<BR>-and always-<BR>5) Persistance. From various techniques of equipment acquisition to relationship issues, Landau/White keep the book directly on-target: "Don't Give Up". If some, or even many, of the suggestions & personal stories/experiences related err on the side of "feel-good", I for one am not even slightly dismayed. Why? b/c ALL the material is from Direct Experience. I have over 100 books on filmmaking, & huge numbers of them are clearly info cut/copy/pasted back & forth from ppl who "read it somewhere". Landau/White know what they're talking about, b/c they've *done* it. And having done it, they realize that a tremendous amount of filmmaking is (pre)planning & fighting fires... ie, "Project Management" ("Ewww!!!" say the 'Artists'). Well, filmmaking is tough, & any little bit of inspiration (coupled w/ a ton of great guidelines) is greatly appreciated. <P>I say all this having shot cable music-videos & short films, where one of the main comments from cast & crew was the [appreciation] for not having a high-stress set. Wow. Not the script, (which was great, natch). Not the production value(s). Not even the (lack) of craft-services or not. Just treating ppl well, appreciating their input, & making them feel part of the Process.<P>This is the core of what Landau & White are communicating, & they do it extremely well... amidst a major lack of books communicating same. <P>I for one am highly appreciative.<P>If you need "how to find $$ for your films" book(s), check out "Digital Filmmaking 101"; if you need a very-good in-depth tech workbook of digital filmmaking, check out Billups' books. <P>But whatever [book] you use, you will also need MOTIVATION & PEOPLE-SKILLS. And Landau/White teach (as much as possible in book-form), both. <P>Thank-you, ladies.</span>
