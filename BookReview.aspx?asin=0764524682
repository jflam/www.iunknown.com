                    <span>I have lived in China for most of the past year and travelled extensively in China for the past five years. Often on my travels, Brown's book is a trusted companion when visiting one of his 50 sites. His insightful and personal accounts of his experiences are both entertaining and educational. What I like most about this book is that Brown likes China and appreciates its differences. This is not true of all guide books, especially Lonely Planet's China who delights in complaining about just about everything. Unfortunately, for guide book writers, China is changing so fast, much of Brown's information on hotels and restaurants is out of date. Restaurants and hotels sometimes disappear and new ones take their place. With that one exception, I found his information to be accurate and useful. Whether you are an old hand in China or making your first trip, this book is a must buy.</span>

                    <span>This is the only English tour book I've found so far that looks at China through Chinese eyes. The author weaves a tapestry of place in China, providing a glimpse at the rich history and culture that surround each memorable spot. When seen through the author's eyes, China shines with a an ancient aura unexperienced by most tourists -- like a beautiful rainbow that can only be seen from the right angle.<P>The author mentions famous poets, painters, historical figures, religious hagiography and provides a glimpse of the sweep of dynasties. The text evokes China's fascinating past with snippets of famous Chinese poems, insightful historical references and pointers about books that will widen your cultural horizon. His sense of awe and majesty bring back a sadly fading dimension that has been purged by the current regime, and is all too often lost in the glossy world of tourism literature.<P>While this book also can be used as a how-to-do-it guidebook, it's true value lies in providing tantalizing panoramas of time and place in China. My only wish is that the author would provide even more cultural information, so that what we see during our visits would be somewhat closer to the rich, captivating landscapes the educated Chinese person sees. Even with this book, so many spots of immense historical and cultural significance are simply beyond the ken of most travelers. Sadly, without books like this one, a visit to China is akin to going to a 3-D movie without the special 3-D goggles.</span>

                    <span>In Frommer's China expert J. D. Brown gives us more of a travel log than a travel guide, which in this case is a refreshing change. Very few people have seen China as extensively as J. D. Brown. His recording of his actual experience at each of the 50 destination will stimulate new itineraries for you to consider. Brown states, " In this guide I've recorded in as frank detail as possible 50 of my most memorable travels in China." <P>If you are going to Cruise the Yangzi River (Three Gorge Dan) this is is best description in a travel book available today. Also superb is his "Great Wall" write up. Brown's 'Summer Palace' write up, while good, criticized the British and French for their terrible act of destroying the original palace, but said nothing of the destruction caused by Mao's henchman.<P>His recommendations for accommodations often have web site address and email (an important additions that many other guides omit), and Brown's restaurant and hotel recommendations are reliable and commendable.<P>On the weak side this 'travel log' lacks the interesting information that is found in other guide, i.e., understanding of Mao's Communist China, Tiananmen Square commentary, modern China, etc. The accommodations and dining recommendations are very light and maps are few and far between. <P>What Brown has done is give us a valuable supplement to use in conjunction with your China travel guide (see my reviews on Rough Guide China and Lonely Planet China for highly recommended guides). Again this is not my first choices in guides for selecting hotels, restaurant etc. BUT it is often my first choice for descriptions of select sites and my first selection as a collaborating guide to supplement my primary guide. Highly Recommended.</span>

                    <span>We received this book just before leaving for China. I found the information on the cities very helpful--key sites, hotel & food recommends. It also documents well the Yangtze River cruise that many Westerners are including in their travel plans prior to the opening of the Three River Gorges Dam.<P>The "common phrases" that are summarized in the book were all we really needed to get around and be understood. In addition, the brief overview of the lengthy Chinese political history helped us to keep the various sites we visited in perspective. Overall, a solid guide book to take with you on your next visit to China.</span>
