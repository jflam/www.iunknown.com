                    <span>This terrific book covers ground I haven't seen elsewhere in the consulting field, including: umbrella brands, brand equity, establishing your name as the brand, tying-in products, using the media, and a great deal more. There is one reviewer who has posted the identical, negative review in all of Dr. Weiss's books: they are "repeats" of his classic "Million Dollar Consulting." There is no way this lengthy explanation of branding receives more than cursory mention in "Million Dollar Consulting," as good as that book may be. I doubt the negative review is based on actual reading of the book. For consultants who are rushing from "fire to fire," this is a great resource to slow us down and tackle the longer-term marketing which will result in business pursuing us rather than the other way around. There is nothing revolutionary here, just solid, pragmatic advice to use tomorrow.</span>

                    <span>Not just for the individual but also for the person in firm. I have applied Alan's ideas in selling professional services and differentiating my "products" from in-house work and competitors.  The book is packed full of ideas.  Implement two and it may take awhile to see the results - but it comes.  As the other editorials write - it's not about cold calling - it's about the client(s) coming to you.  Sound impossible.  Read the book, it will be the best investment you ever make!!  And I do mean investment - it'd take you take years to think of some of these ideas - if ever.</span>

                    <span>More fantastic consulting practice advice from Alan Weiss.<p>Eight months into building my leadership influence consulting practice, Mr Weiss has given me the gift of branding.  He has shown me how to build the "gravity" to draw prospects to me, how to get more specific about the value I offer to clients, and what actions I need to take now to build the brand that will build my business.<p>I have seen some of these elements before, but this book wraps it all up in a neat template for action, and it has got me moving.  I keep this book on my desk, not my shelf.</span>

                    <span>As a full-time practicing consultant to FDA-regulated industries for the past 5+ years, I enjoy and benefit from all of Weiss' books. 'Tho much of the information is repeated, it still serves to motivate. And, if each reading causes me to initiate only one more new (to me) technique, it is money and time well spent.  Consulting tends to be a somewhat lonely profession, and part of my support group are books such as this. If you agree w/ such benefits, then I recommend this (and his others) heartily.</span>
