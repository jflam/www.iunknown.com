                    <span>i didn't know whether to get this one or Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2000.  i looked on amazon.  this one had a table of contents that seemed to cover more of the admin stuff that i was looking for so i was very close to buying it but, having never bought a sams book, i decided to compare the two at the bookstore.  it took very little time before i decided to get Inside.  Unleashed has tons of admin dialog boxes with text that walks you through the dialog boxes and says "i really like this feature."  just wasn't what i was looking for.</span>

                    <span>I would be surprised if you could find more than, say, 20% of this book that is not also in the online product documentation.  It is far too general and shallow to be useful in the real world where most of us live.</span>

                    <span>I have read around 12 SQL books. If there is a highly rated SQL book, I probably read it. Along with "Microsoft SQL Server Performance Tuning and Optmization", this book is the best there is. This would be the book I will take with me if I had ended up in some isolated island with a SQL Server I had to manage. If you are some GUI button pushing SQL monkey, get this book fast and master its contents, only then you will become a real SQL DBA. One note, I also highly recommend "Inside SQL Server 2000" from Microsoft. But that book is not quite as comprehensive as this one.</span>

                    <span>I have found this book to be a great resource for development, administration, and performance tuning for SQL Server.  I have been working with databases for almost 10 years and with SQL Server for over 5 years.  I find myself frequently referring to this book and getting useful information.  I would highly recommend it for both intermediate and advanced users.</span>
