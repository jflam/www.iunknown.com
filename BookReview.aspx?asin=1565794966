                    <span>We have some nice mountain scenery here in New Zealand but never has it been showcased in a book of such class and quality as this one from Westcliffe. I do have two other books of Colorado from Fielder, "Colorado's CDT" and "To Walk In Wilderness" and I think about 4 of the photos look familiar out of the 200 or so in this book.
<br />This is a large, heavy and classy book. The photos are generally full page, some double page, and are crystal clear with superb colouring and lighting. A page of text introduces each mountain range featured followed by the photos with interesting captions under each one but the emphasis is on the photos. The photos make you feel like you want to be in the scene enjoying what Fielder was obviously enjoying at the time too. The book retails at $75 but I consider it a bargain at Amazon's discounted price for what you are getting.
<br />If you are a mountain lover like I am then this book is a must have. There has been and will be very few books like this ever published - thoroughly recommended.

                    <span>Over the years, Fielder has taken many a spectacular photo.  In John Fielder's new book, Mountain Ranges of Colorado, all of his greatest images over 15 years form a complete and comprehensive view of the reason for Colorado's trademark beauty: the Southern Rockies.  The book not only goes range by range through the entire state, but presents some of the best images Fielder has ever done.  A granite-feel cover, along with the photos, guarantees that there isn't a book like this out there, and there won't be unless Fielder does a sequel.  </span>

                    <span>A few years ago I wrote a review of "Colorado: 1870-2000" by John Fielder and "Colorado: Yesterday & Today" by Grant Collier.  These two photographers both have new coffee table books out: Fielder published "Mountain Ranges of Colorado" and Collier published "Colorado: Moments in Time."  These are two of the nicest color photography books published on Colorado in quite a while, so I thought I'd write another reviewing comparing the books of two of Colorado's best photographers.  For the reasons listed below, I've concluded that Collier's new book is a little better than Fielder's.
<br />
<br />1) Quality of photos: The photos in both of these books are very nice and really show how spectacular Colorado is.  I think Collier does a better job compositionally, while Fielder's shots have a little better lighting and colors.  My own complaint with Fielder's shots is that many of them have been published in previous books and calendars, so if you own any previous work by 
<br />Fielder, you may be disappointed to see the same photos published here.  EDGE: Colorado: Moments in Time
<br />
<br />2) Design & Appearance of Book:  Fielder's book has a cool backdrop of granite and Collier's book has a nice backdrop of wavy sand.  The interior of both books is also very well designed and the photos are nice and big.  Fielder's book seems to be printed on somewhat cheaper paper, but the overall design is very comparable.  EDGE: Even
<br />
<br />3) Reputation of Photographers: John Fielder has published many books and is very well known, while Collier is a newer photographer, who is not yet as well known.  EDGE: Mountain Ranges of Colorado
<br />
<br />4) Written Text: In addition to taking the photos, both photographers wrote the text for their books.  Collier is nearly as good a writer as he is a photographer.  He wrote concise and very information essays on various aspects of the history of Colorado that really complemented the images in the book.  Fielder text was not as well written, although it was an improvement on his previous attempts at writing.  The text tends to ramble on and the writing style could use some improvement.  But there is some good information in there if you look hard enough.  EDGE: Colorado: Moments in Time.
<br />
<br />Overall Vallue: Fielder's book has a retail value of $75, while Collier's book has a retail value of $45.  Both books are very large.  Fielder's is just a little bigger, but not much.  So, even with the large discount that Amazon.com currently provides on Fielder's book, Colorado: Moments in Time is still priced lower.  I therefore believe that it is, by a small margain, the best book and the best overall value.  </span>
