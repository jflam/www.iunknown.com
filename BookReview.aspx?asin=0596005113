                    <span>I bought the book even after reading previous reviews.   Oh well.  If you have any knowledge of Windows and it's functionality and want to improve on those skills, this book won't do it.  It's all about tools and utilities you can download or purchase, and how to use those programs.  Not much insite into Windows built in tools and better ways of using them.  I did think the host files and DNS section could be helpful, but as a previous poster said, you can find tips like that on the internet.</span>

                    <span>Written in an very pleasing quick to the point manner, this book offers its readers much in the everyday and not so everyday use of your Windows XP system.<p>This is not a script kiddie or hacker book. It encompasses the real meaning of the word hack. To hack into your computer to make it do things that it isn't generally meant to do, or to access things within your system that are not know or are hidden from the average user. Somebody who rigs something to enhance it, make it better, or make it do something more, is the real meaning of a hacker. Rather than its misused meaning of somebody who breaks into systems. (cracker)<p>I have to give this book 5 stars.<p>This book is not another wanabe hacker book, but a book on some quick enhancements that can be made to your windows xp computer, ranging from hacking the registry, using many of its commands and utilities, to using downloadable software and tools.<p>Plus the book is put together in a way that allows you to reference the areas that interest you or apply to you, so you don't have to read the chapters or hacks that don't interest you.<p>Don't misunderstand the title of this book, it doesn't have anything to do with the misused meaning of the word hack. It has nothing to do with breaking into or exploiting computers. Its more of a book on how to enhance your computer and your computer experience. As for those who say you can get this information elsewhere just by searching online. We'll you can get most information on any topic by searching online. All the information needed to pass the MCSE is available online as well, but I would still like to have it all in one spot, having had somebody else do that searching for me. (and no this book has nothing to do with the MCSE or any other cert, was just used as an analogy to explain my point)<p>This is an excellent book, and even if your an advanced user you will find this book interesting, and fun to read. I did. Many of the hacks I knew already, and some I didn't. Many were very useful and I enjoyed reading this book very much.<p>If you want to learn how to hack or, I should say crack computers, then this isn't a book you should be looking at. If your an "advanced" computer guru, then do your research before you buy the book, go to "O'Reilly & Associates" website and check the TOC and see if this is what your looking for.<p>Personally I think this book is great reading and has sometihng to offer to everybody, even the advanced user. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The O'Reilly Hacks book format is to provide the reader with one hundred focused 'hacks' that provide a wide variety of tips for expert readers on the subject at hand. This book falls a little off that mark. The text of the book is not very focused, though it is more personable and easier to read than the other Hacks books.
<br />
<br />What bothered me was that the hacks were not all particularly XP relevant. Picking a web browser and a hack on war driving seem off the mark to me. On the one hand, they could have called it 'Windows Hacks' and I would think that the book was dead on. Since they called it 'Windows XP Hacks' I expected to see more XP specific information.
<br />
<br />That being said, the book has a lot going for it. There is a lot of cool and unique content in it. I particularly liked the sections on tweaking the UI and hacking the registry. I also appreciated the information on how to surf the Internet safely.
<br />
<br />Before you buy you should have a look at the table of contents first to make sure that you are getting value for your dollar.</span>

                    <span>I have to confess. I am just not "Geek" enough to fully appreciate this book. And while I have used Windows XP for years and have taught Windows usage, I found that there was only a couple of things in the book that I could actually use. Yes there was a wealth of information for those who dream of things to do to their Window's registry. And yes you can find lots of stuff to do to Windows XP that will make your little "geekie" heart go pitty-pat. But for this advanced computer -jockey, I'll just stay on the side-lines playing with the Power Toys for Windows XP Tweak  UI program, the one program I found in the book that I felt I could use without blowing up my computer, and be glad I didn't do any damage to my computer.</span>
