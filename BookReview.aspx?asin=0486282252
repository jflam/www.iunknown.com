                    <span>Until now, I had known Lysistrata only by reputation. What can I say - I should have read it myself long since. This play seems to offer everything. It goes beyond just bawdy, but never turns salacious. It's got silly wordplay, but real social commentary. The battle of the sexes is about real battle this time, and Aristophanes fires a few well-aimed shots at both the men and the women. It's a classic of the Western canon, but amusing and readable. Also, for those who dread literature that's "good for them," it's short. The script comes in under 100 pages, and they're not dense pages. 
<br />
<br />As I said, this is a modern rendering full of wordplay and chants for the traditional Greek chorus. I'm afraid that the easy, humorous style puts me on edge, though. If a play starts in classical Greek, then ends up in modern English with proper rhyme, scansion, and dialect(!), I know the translator has taken some serious liberties with the libretto. Still I'm torn. Which is more important, academic integrity in creating a version for English readers, or being true to the popular, funny, bawdy tone that Aristophanes intended? I really can't answer that question.
<br />
<br />It's a great play in a readable translation. There's a good bit of explanatory material, but not the kind that interferes with the flow of the play. I recommend this Lysistrata if you want the fun in the play, but I have reservations about the rigor of the translation.

                    <span>"Lysistrata" is truly a revolting play that pokes fun at women.  They say Aristophanes thought women to be more than toys for their men, but I see the opposite.  I think Aristophanes made a satire out of women and the only thing they are good at: sex and reproducing male babies.  This is no compliment. To think that the only way women can change their husband's minds would be by withholding intercourse.  This is preposterous! I found this play derogatory with ill humor.  I do not recommend.</span>

We'll abstain.<br>-I imagine they'll conclude a treaty rather quickly"<p>I picked this up when I saw that many peace groups were putting it on as sort of an answer to the warlike nature of our times. Apparently, it's a timeless notion- The women of the city were tired with wars, so they decided to collectively cut their husbands off. Of course, this leads to man funny incedents, as neither men or women find it easy to deal with this.<p>I wonder what everyone is suggesting today? The Great American Poke Out? This is a wonderful, short play, and the translation preserves all of the puns and metaphors that color this comedy with innuendo.<p>In a warlike world, it's fun to be able to sit back and enjoy a llittle comic fantasy. And at the price, you're paying less than the average movie: for something far better, in my humble opinion.<p>Get this book!</span>

                    <span>I took a class from Parker over ten years ago during my dark days at the University of Texas at Austin. He taught a course in the Classics department called "Parageography," which was about the geography of imaginary lands. I think it was an excuse for him to really get into the literature that he loved. It was a fun class, made all the more so because Parker allowed me to do the class project, wherein we created our own imaginary land, in hypertext (this was, obviously before the WWW, and hypertext had not gotten much play--I can't even remember the program I used on the Mac to create it).<p>Parker's claim to fame as a scholar of classics, however, was his modern translations of Aristophanes, including this famous satire on how women could stop war by withholding sex. The translation is good, but still somewhat problematic for today's audiences--many of the assumptions of the story are based on the Greek and Trojan cultures, so a modern reader must check the notes every once and awhile to get the full nuance of the poetry. On the other hand, Parker's goal was to not censor the ribaldry, and so there's plenty here for an audience to realize that, even in 2,000+ years, some things really never change.</span>

                    <span>I find that I probably can't criticize Aristophanes for his comedy <br>as it has lasted over a thousand years, but I can say that it must lose something in this translation. I see these other reviews and<br>wonder if they  are talking about the same play that I read? <br>This is worse written than a "King of Queens" sit com...<br>  I'd walk out in the first act when the Spartan woman begins to do a dumb blond bit with bad grammar.<br> It is so bad a Stiller ( father or son) would turn down the script! Save you money and time and find another version....</span>
