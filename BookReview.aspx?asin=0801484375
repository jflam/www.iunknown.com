                    <span>   Joanne Pope Melish's, Disowning Slavery: Gradual Emancipation and Race in New England, 1780-1860, examines free blacks in the Antebellum north with a particular focus on Connecticut and Rhode Island.  Melish's monograph addresses three central themes: northern slavery as an institution, the psychology of racist whites, and white's counteraction to free blacks. 
<br />
<br />   Melish begins her monograph by examining northern slavery as an institution. Melish contradicts common interpretations among historians, arguing that northern slavery did indeed generate a significant impact on the northern economy.  She argues that blacks performed common household responsibilities, that enabled slave owners to pursue a career, in which they could not have done without the assistance of slave labor.  Lastly, she differentiates northern slavery to southern slavery, as being a system of indentured servitude, rather than a system of market production.
<br />
<br />   Melish's second theme analyzes the psychology of northern racists.  Despite emancipation, many whites and even anti-slavery activists, believed free blacks to be a social threat.  Many whites could not embrace the transformation of blacks becoming free, and accept what Melish calls, "black role reversal".  Many believed, free blacks could not comprehend the ideals of "white republicanism".  They argued blacks are limited to mindless labor, and are incapable of social mobility and conformity.  The most common argument among northern whites is that blacks were perceived as being social misfits.  Blacks were commonly associated with stealing, prostitution, laziness, excessive drunkenness, etc., which forced white citizens to serve the role as "social babysitters".
<br />
<br />   Post emancipation witnessed the substantial rise of theoretical perspectives and popular literature pertaining to race and race relations.  Theories such as the environmental theory, explored the physical and psychological structure of persons of color, and their destiny in white society.  The emergence of free blacks, Melish argues, placed the issue of race relations on the front burner in all spectrums of society.  
<br />
<br />   Melish's final theme address the counteraction by northern whites to the emergence of free blacks.  The failed agenda of the American Colonization Society, and the success of immediate abolition movement, compelled northern racists to forge what Melish calls, "legal bondage", and place free blacks in the social status of, "slaves of the community".  In 1784, both Connecticut and Rhode Island passed legislation known as the post nati emancipation bills.  The legislation mandated that children of blacks born after the first of March 1784, will continued to be held in bondage until a specified age (usually between the ages of 18 and 25).  In several cases, whites successfully extended the manumission age through legislative reform and loopholes.  Northern racists further employed legislative tactics to maintain black social control.  Some legislation included the regulation of housing, curfews, leisure activities, and especially, sexual race mixing.  Melish explains how sexual relationships and especially child production between races, was viewed as the ultimate sin.    
<br />
<br />   In addition to legislative reaction to control the emerging free black population, white resistance increased dramatically.  Race riots, attacks on black neighborhoods, symbolic degradation through popular literature, etc., attempted to "abolish the black man", and preserve the stability of "white America".  
<br />
<br />   Melish's monograph provides insight to the issues regarding the emergence of free blacks in the antebellum north.  Melish exposes the attempts of northern whites to control free blacks, and in essence, transform them from slaves to, "slaves of the community".   
<br />
<br />   Disowning Slavery is an interesting,informative read.  Her extensive research provides the reader with a clear interpretation on free blacks in the north.  Sometimes the book becomes highly unorganized and sloppy.  Overall, I would recommendend this monograph to anyone interested in this topic.

                    <span>In Disowning Slavery, Joanne Pope Melish strongly refutes the myth of a free New England, untainted by slavery and racial disharmony.  While slavery did not exist in either quantity or duration on a scale comparable to the South, Melish conclusively shows that it  existed in the northern states well into the 19th century, and argues that it was an important component of New England's economic success.  Like feminist historians who have argued that women's domestic labor was crucial if men were to be able to engage in economic activity outside the home, Melish shows that as domestic servants and agricultural laborers, slaves performed the drudgework that Yankee entrepreneurs would otherwise have been employed in.   Because such urban entrepreneur slaveowners were a small (though influential) percentage of the population, slavery was allowed to gradually die out in New England, most often through judicial interpretation.  Gradual emancipation meant that there were few great political battles over ending slavery in the North, allowing New Englanders to erase their memories of its very existence.  <p>	However, because slavery was allowed to die without the benefit of public debate and legislative control, freedmen's legal and social status was never clearly defined, nor was the means by which former slaves were to be integrated into free society.  Whites were able to congratulate themselves on their moral superiority as free societies without having to concern themselves with the welfare of now-emancipated slaves.  In turning their backs on the problems of freedmen trying to adjust to their new status, they prevented blacks from becoming full members of their communities.  They saw proof of blacks' inability to provide for themselves as an insurmountable racial characteristic even as whites refused to provide economic or legal opportunities that would have allowed former slaves to improve their condition.   Over time such self-reinforcing racial attitudes grew into a fully developed philosophy of racism, embellished by exaggerated depictions of black caricatures in the popular culture of the North.<p>	Indeed, Melish cites a vast array of cultural documents (popular literature, newspaper editorials, plays, and pop art) to demonstrate New Englanders' racist attitudes. Her narrative also amply demonstrates how the process of gradual emancipation allowed the North to forget that slavery had ever been part of their society, leading to their smug moral superiority.  However, neither her evidence nor her reasoning adequately explains why it was necessary for Northerners to adopt racist attitudes.  It does not seem that the limited number of freed blacks in the North were a significant economic or social threat to whites; there seem to be no concrete reasons for the development of racist attitudes, especially considering how committed many northern whites were to ending slavery in the South for moral reasons.  Melish seems satisfied to accept that people have a natural need to define themselves by creating an "other" as a point of (negative) comparison; her work would be greatly enhanced by exploring the reasons that this might be so.</span>
