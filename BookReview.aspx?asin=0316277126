                <span id="Label1">Every year, all across America, the excitement builds as March approaches. Like only a few other sports events - the World Series, the Super Bowl, the World Cup - the games that culminate in the national college basketball championship propel sports fans throughout the country into a frenzy. And nowhere is the rivalry more intesnse than in the nine-team Atlantic Coast Conference, which has long been a breeding ground of basketball superstars (Michael Jordon, Grant Hill, and Kenny Anderson among others) and has sent at least one team into the NCAA's Final Four in fifteen of the last eighteen years.  <P>In this widely acclaimed book, John Feinstein takes us behind the scenes of the ACC through an entire unforgettable season. He captures the thrill of the games, the personalities of the players, and, most compellingly, the formidable and surprising challenges that confront the teams' coaches. Feinstein's book is a triumph of sports reporting - a living portrait of how college basketball is coached and played at the highest level.</span>

                    <span>If you can get past obvious Duke bias (and overall ACC bias), you can get a good basketball fix from this one. Feinstein (a Duke graduate) constantly laces read between the lines jabs at North Carolina and NC State. You'll read comments such as "No other ACC coach seems to like Dean Smith, but that's probably because he wins so much" scattered throughout. He refers to the ACC tournament play-in game as "The Les Robinson Game" about 20 times - an obvious shot at the previous NC State coach. Also, the first time I read about UNC having a "wine and cheese" crowd I laughed, but by the 4th time it was annoying. Now, I don't mind a jab here or there, but the lack of similar jabs and critical comments against the other coaches (*especially* Duke) really wore on me after awhile. Is it coincidence that the two teams that refused Feinstein direct locker room access come across the worst? The Duke bias is clearly evident (You'll think Steve Wojo is the second best player in the league after Tim Duncan if you don't know better). Feinstein also spends the first 95% of the book gushing about how wonderful the ACC is, but spends the last 5% apologizing for the league's general collapse in the NCAA Tournament. Snaps at other conferences (like the Big East) really aren't necessary. It would be nice if he gave the rest of college basketball a little credit. I mean, in retrospect, many observers felt that the PAC10 was the best conference that year. Anyways, despite the flaws, I wanted a college basketball fix - and this book gave me one.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as a Christmas present for my husband, but unwrapped it twice to sneak in a few chapters myself because I couldn't wait. Feinstein spent last season in an ACC fan's dream, with great access to games, coaches and locker rooms. I enjoyed the background material on each coach, and found myself reliving games through his descriptions. There are numerous humorous anecdotes, many of which I'm hearing again as filler commentary during this year's games. I have to admit that Feinstein does show a slight preference for Duke, his alma mater -- mine too, so I didn't mind but even I noticed. <P> The end result is, thanks to Mr. Feinstein, I'm watching EVERY ACC basketball game this year (in the past I'd watch for my school and my husband's, and check other scores for standings). Not only that, because I liked Rick Barnes so much in the book, I have actually cheered for Clemson for the first time in my life.</span>

                    <span>A March to Madness by John Feinstein is an in depth look at each men's basketball program in the Atlantic Coast Conference. I liked that Feinstein did an equally large amount of research for the history of each school and the conference in general. "On May 8, 1953, at the Sedgfield Inn in Greensboro, the seven schools voted unanimously to leave the Southern Conference and form a new league called the Atlantic Coast Conference."(p95). I also liked how John didn't just tell about the coaches' lives at work, but also their life at home and their person relationship with their players. Another part of the book I liked was the game summaries with how the coaches felt at each part and what they said to their players before, during, and after the game.<P>The theme of the book, in my opinion, is if you are a coach than you lead your life just like you coach your team. You have the same work ethic. You have the same expectations to succeed, and the same drive to their definition to success. As a coach myself, not on the level of these men but a coach no the less, I agree with the theme. In coaching and everything else I do I strive to reach my goal, in coaching its winning it all, in life it could be something as simple as getting to a friend's house the time I say I'm going to be there.<P>This book is a great read. I highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in learning what goes on behind closed doors in one of the toughest conferences in all of NCAA basketball. I thought the book was a little Duke biased but I have no problem with that because of my Duke ties.</span>

                    <span>No true college hoops should be without this book. Feinstein does another terrific job of showing the reader inside basketball. Thanks to the cooperation of the ACC coaches and players, the season becomes meaningful to the reader. AN enjoyable read. I would say something negative, but there was nothing bad about the book.</span>

                    <span>John Feinstein is one of the most prolific writers in the field of sports journalism. He has written books covering everything from the harshness of playing for Bobby Knight ("A Season on the Brink") to romance of the little schools of the Patriot League ("The Last Amatuers"). When "A March to Madness" was released, I was quite pleased to find a tribute to a season that was so memorable to me. At the dawn of the 1996-97 NCAA Basketball season, I was in my second year at the University of Maryland. I found it difficult to really get into the basketball team my first year because it seemed like more hype than product. It was in 1996-97, that I truly began to embrace the Terrapins. "A March to Madness" chronicles their up-and-down season along with the other eight members of the ACC basketball conference (thought to be the best in the country). Feinstein was given unlimited access to all the teams by all the coaches (save for North Carolina's Dean Smith, who is notoriously stingy about that kind of access) and, as a result, put together a compelling record of, not only the season itself, but the background of the players, schools, and coaches that made that season what it was. Feinstein tells the story of Duke's Mike Krzyzewski leading the Blue Devils' resurgence to the top of the ACC standings just two years after a debilitating injury crushed himself and the Duke basketball program. He follows the quest of Dean Smith to break Adolph Rupp's all-time wins record. The journey of the conference's and country's best player, Tim Duncan of Wake Forest, to end his memorable 4-year career with a National Title comes to an end much too soon and is captured in agonizing detail by Feinstein. Feinstein also covers other notable stories like the surprising run by the upstart Maryland Terrapins to a Top 5 ranking before lack of depth and experience caused them to fall back to the back and the inexplicable implosion of Georgia Tech just one season after it missed the ACC Title by two points.<P>Feinstein's gift when it comes to writing is that brings life to the people he covers rather than just treating them like statistics in a news report. In "A March to Madness", the reader comes to understand the backgrounds and struggles of all of the coaches. On one level or another, the reader can identify with all of them. Feinstein treats the notable players much the same way. This book is a quick read and a truly memorable exposition of the mad world of ACC Basketball.</span>
