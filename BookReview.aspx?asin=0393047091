                <span id="Label1">At last, safe, comfortable, ocean-going power cruisers that  don't cost a fortune to own and operate. When boat designer George  Buehler realized that he no longer wanted to cruise the world's oceans  under sail, he decided to create a line of powerboats that sailors could  love and anyone could afford. For inspiration, he turned to the light,  lithe salmon trollers of the Pacific Northwest, among the most efficient,  seaworthy, and beautiful powerboats ever built. With plans for troller  yachts from 38 to 70 feet and detailed information about everything from  design theory, building, and outfitting to converting commercial boats,  this book is essential reading for anyone thinking about ocean cruising  who refuses to spend $500,000 on a boat and $500 a day on fuel.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book about building and owning reasonably priced power boats, as well as why it's so difficult to find such boats from the standard manufacturers today. I,too, have often wondered exactly why a 40' power cruiser should cost $350,000 and need 350 horsepower to move through the water. After reading this book, I now know:<P>1. it doesn't have to be that way, but<P>2. the boating industry profits handsomely from that structure.<P>Whether you agree with Mr. Buehler's opinions or not, you really should put his book on your "must reading" list prior to making a considerable investment in your own boat. The included boat plans, the interesting equipment discussions, and Mr. Buehler clear writing style make this one of the best books on the topic I've ever read.</span>

                    <span>Should be mandatory reading for anyone considering living aboard or cruising as a lifestyle.<P>This book is an excellent primer explaining, in easy to understand terms, why certain boat designs may be more suitable for those of us with "realistic" budgets, custom vs. production boats, powering, design, construction materials, etc.<P>Reading this book has completely re-oriented our focus away from production boats to begin the process of design selection and having our own custom live-aboard built! Thanks, George.</span>

                    <span>This book was about Econo-Yachts, Snailboats, World cruisers, motorboats with displacement hulls that are faster than sailboats but slower than plaining boats.<BR> This book sparked my interest in long range cruising with power boats that compare favorably with sailboats. Unfortunately there aren't many around.<BR> The closest category is pilot house boats with small diesel engines that travel at hull speed [1.34 times the square root of the waterline]and aux sails.<BR> This book introduces the possibility of going around the world for the price of a set of sailboat sails at faster than sailboat speed.<BR> The book includes too small to read plans and building recomendations for this kind of boat.<BR> I highly recommend this book for those interested in this kind of travel. This book is about the boat not the travel itself. Delbert Jolly</span>

                    <span>Mr. Buehler's book is an excellent read, and an extremely handy guide for those of us interested in its subject matter but without the bottomless pockets required to enjoy today's production boats. Can you build a boat using just this book? No. Can you plan your round-the-world cruise using just this book? Again, no. However, with chapters on the concept of a proper cruising design, affordability, safety, construction, outfitting and other relevant items, the book is an excellent primer on the concept of safe, affordable cruising for the everyday Joe who loves boats and the water.<P>Mr. Snell may not have found what he was looking for; personally, I suspect he was offended by Mr. Buehler's attitude toward production yachts and their inadequacies.</span>

                    <span>Down here on the Gulf Coast, hundreds of people still make their livings piloting wooden power boats out into open water, staying a few days, and then coming back with holds full of seafood. I know some of these folks. They don't inherit fortunes to buy boats, they aren't millionaires stepping off into the latest trendy adventure, they're people who use boats, well and practically built, to make a living. George's book is about the Northwestern versions of these people and their boats. George asks why people like me can't find proper boats. Why people who want a good, spacious, long-legged cruising vessel but who didn't have a dear rich uncle or a winning lottery ticket to pay for it. Why forty feet should be $750,000.00. And he answers the questions. He answers well. He steps on toes which need to stepped on, and tells us that dreams can come true. He took my little piece of a dream and expanded it. What more can one ask of a book?</span>
