                    <span>Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET is geared towards a classroom, like college or university, if you want to learn yourself, you are stuck, it doesn't provide step-by-step instructions on how to create projects or samples, the web site lets you download instruction for exercises and projects, but you are in tuff luck, because they won't provide you with any solutions to the exercises and projects. Try Wrox press and Apress books, they are better geared toward to the self-learner.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the worest books I seen for ado.net. If you want to learn ADO.NET you need to do it in code, not with the components. The SQL server stuff is terribleand shows bad practices, it uses inline sql statemetns which is a no-no with any good DB and since it uses inline sql  you never learn to call a stored procedure.  You can learn everything in this book for free from MS in the samples MSDN libarary or online at http://www.gotdotnet.com or http://www.windowsforms.net/ or http://www.asp.net.  If you want to get a door stop that you can read then this book might be a good choice.</span>

                    <span>A good book for experienced VB.NET / ADO.NET programmers but if you were, you wouldn't be buying a book on the subject. Maybe not intentionally, but there are many important details omittted from the program examples. Many will not work because of the missing information or assumption that "you should know this" or it was overlooked.</span>

                    <span>I have been working with VB and Database programming since VB version 3.0 and Access 2.0.  I now regularly teach classes in VB.Net and database programming. In fact I have authored several computer books myself. I can say with no hesitation that there simply is no better book on the topic. ADO.Net is significantly different than ADO. Therefore database programming with VB.Net is much different than VB 6.0, and few books do much to clarify the situation. This book is simply the best, if you don't have it, get it right now!</span>
