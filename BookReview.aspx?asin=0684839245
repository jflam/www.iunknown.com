                <span id="Label1">Build it ... and they'll come. Nope, not necessarily, not anymore. It's a crowded, crazy market out there, and no matter how fabulous your product or service, there's bound to be someone else delivering something pretty close. The solution? Take your product or service and ... <i>brand</i> it! Though the idea has been around in management circles since the late 1980s, brand equity has never been more important than it is now. In <I>Brand Leadership</I>, David Aaker and Erich Joachimsthaler set out to guide managers to the next level of the brand revolution.<p>  Building and managing brands, though obviously vital and necessary steps in the process, do not make up the whole picture of the successful development of a brand. What is needed is strategic brand leadership. Implementing this kind of leadership, Aaker and Joachimsthaler insist, requires a radical shift in an organization's culture, its structure, and its systems. In their densely packed but accessible book, they outline what this shift is all about, and discuss the important components of brand leadership: defining and elaborating a brand identity; designing the brand's architecture to achieve clarity, synergy, and leverage; building a brand beyond the obvious route of advertising by incorporating such aspects as sponsorship and the role of the Internet; and organizing the entire company around global brand leadership as opposed to merely the creation of a global brand. To support and demonstrate their ideas, the authors conducted hundreds of corporate case studies throughout Europe and the U.S.  Inspiring and useful tales of such brand-focused and brand-recognized companies as Virgin, L.L. Bean, Nike, Adidas, and MasterCard are told in detail, and they touch on a host of other companies and brands to add texture to the lessons. As is obvious from these examples, achieving an effective brand leadership strategy requires awareness, understanding, passion, and a heck of a lot of work. But in today's enormously competitive brand environment, the rewards can be--and are--well worth the effort. <I>Brand Leadership</I> provides invaluable advice for anyone looking to focus and direct that effort toward a profitable and lasting result. <i>--S.&nbsp;Ketchum</i></span>

                    <span>I found this book very useful with a methodology that every company can follow. I especially appreciated the brand leadership model compared to the classic band management model, the good explanation of the concept of brand equity, the brand leadership tasks and the crm model where it is perfectly explained the relationship between the brand and the customer's self concept. It is more then a book it is a paradigm but if you don't have time don't buy the book you will not be able to read it during the week end</span>

                    <span>This book is a must read for anyone who wants to be anyone in marketing.  As a student, I have found Brand Leadership to be a valuable tool.  It has really built on a totally new dimension to marketing that I haven't encountered in any strategy or marketing class.  Aaker and Joachimsthaler break new ground with their Brand Leadership Model by moving away from the static, short-term traditional marketing and communication models that focus on TV and advertising and don't take into account the vital role the brand plays in an organization's strength, let alone the value that it brings to a company's balance sheet.  This book introduces an entirely new perspective on marketing as it encompasses brand-building with strategy, leadership and change.  Make sure you read "Part IV: Building Brands Beyond Advertising" to get a new stance on brand-building methods.  Read it, you'll never look back!</span>

                    <span>I would say most, if not all, college marketing text are more readable than "Brand Leadership".  Written by two professors of well-known business schools, this is a classic case of trying to make a science out of a hazy subject like branding.  This book is laden with inordinate amount of theories, frameworks, models and worse still, jargon.  If you can handle all that, fine.  But it certainly kills my interest in the study of brand management.  Instead of teaching in a straightforward and comprehensible manner, the authors did just the reverse - turning an interesting and relatively intuitive topic into something dry, complicated and unwieldy.  If you want real, practical marketing stuff, go for the books by Al Ries and Jack Trout, definitely more fun and easier to read.</span>

                    <span>In this third book in Aaker's branding trilogy the University of California professor and brand consultant documents a change away from the classic system of brand management that was created at Procter & Gamble (P&G) in the 1930's and subsequently spread to market-driven companies all over the world.<p>Aaker makes the case that classic brand management is being replaced by what he calls the brand leadership model. The manager in the brand leadership model emphasizes strategy as well as tactics, has a broader scope and is higher in the organization than the old-style brand manager. It focuses not only on short-term financials, but also on brand equity measures.<p>The authors say that this new approach results from the market complexities that have arisen out of competitive pressures channel dynamics, business environments with multiple brands, aggressive brand extensions and complex subbrand structures. This shift involves fundamental changes in organization structure, systems and culture as the authors demonstrate with case studies from companies like Polo Ralph Lauren, Virgin Airlines, Adidas, Marriott and McDonalds. These case studies make the book more readable and drive home the points that the authors make with their rigid system of definitions and processes.  <p>Added bonuses are the chapters dealing with brand architecture, the role of sponsorship and the web, and building brands beyond advertising. Again, by using real world examples, the authors demonstrate how brand building today can benefit from many communications vehicles beyond traditional advertising so long as they make positive connections between the brand and consumers. <p>Brand Leadership is not a casual read, but it will reward the diligent reader with an understanding of how to deal with complex brand management issues and its linkage to business strategy. It will also help organizations that are not so market driven realize that marketing is really just the manifestation of solid business strategy.</span>
