                    <span>This book is an excellent reference for people who want to find the perfect campground in Colorado. This book has sections on what amenties you can find at that particular campground, which time in the season is the least crowded and it has beautiful pictures of the campgrounds. It even recommends the best tent sites in the camp. And these are just a few of the perks you'll find in this book. So if you love to camp, this book is well worth buying. You won't regret it.</span>

                    <span>I challenge anyone to find a better resource for campgrounds in Colorado.  The descriptions are clear, specific instructions on location are provided, and the ratings are accurate.  I only wish such resources existed for campgrounds in my home state.  This is a must-have for anyone planning a camping trip to Colorado.</span>

                    <span>As the other reviews have noted, this is an outstanding book.  While I can't say I have seen every other colorado campground book out there, I still feel comfortable saying you will have a hard time finding anything better.  While there are many outstanding aspects to this book, one of the top highlights would be the full color photos of each of the top 100, while not always a complete representation of the campgrounds (ie, a view from/of one site can't do any campground justice) they are nice to get some idea of the place, and books with pictures are always nicer!  The text includes very good and detailed info about each of the top 100 (includign facilities onsite and somtimes nearby, like where to find showers), and details of the other (non top 100) campgrounds are still fairly adequate.  Again, I think if you are looking for a colorado campground book, this should be all you'll need.<br>My one and only suggestion for readers of this book would be to not take the "top 100" designation all that seriously.  While I don't think you will be disappointed by any of the author's top 100 selection, just remember they are from his point of view and your ideas of what makes a top 100 might be different (I believe the author mentions this as well).  There have been several occasions where I would have rated campgrounds in a certain area differently (ie of 4 campgrounds in an area, 1 made his top 100 and 3 others different, I would have picked a different one). From what I have noticed, the author seems to give priority to the campgrounds with the best views (which isn't a bad thing), but I would probably give more weight to those with the most privacy, but to each their own!  So again, its a great book for info, you won't be disappointed, but just don't be afraid to try some others that didnt' make the top 100 cut, as on several occasions I have found them more appealing to me than a top 100 selection nearby.</span>

                    <span>We bought this book after borrowing it from the library.  The book is full color - which is great - and comes with tons of info that is necessary to make a good camping decision.<p>You have to remember that this book is about the 100 best camp grounds in Colorado, but it also contains info on hundreds of others.  Some of the great features in this book are:<br>1. popularity of the campground - when you should or should not have to make a reservation<br>2. which sites are the best (near the road or near the water) - this helps you to make a good decision before reserving a spot<br>3. amenities - is there a toilet?  running water?  important info<br>4. start rated system for scenery, privacy, rvs, etc. - these things are essential for making a good decision on campground<br>5. alternatives to the busy areas - there are tons of campgrounds listed as alternatives to the major campgrounds in the best areas<p>This is a definite buy if you want some up to date, good info on Colorado campgrounds.</span>

                    <span>We've had this book for over a year, and have found it very helpful and accurate in description!  There were a few campsites that we preferred over what was recommended, but that is just personal choice.  You may want to check on what sites are available for campers before reserving; we came across one campground where the campground host had switched sites.  We just penciled the change in our book.  Great book - we've loaned it out to many friends who wound up purchasing one for their own!!</span>
