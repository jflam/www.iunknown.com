                    <span>The way the books of this series work is that they took a guide for new rangers in Yosemite with the 100 or so most frequently asked questions, and wrote their own answers for each park. It's a great format because it makes for easy reading beforehand, but it's also quick as a reference when you're there because they're arranged in an intelligent order.  There's also a huge reference section at the end with lists, copies of permit forms, and so forth.  So the thing to do is read the FAQ before you leave but bring the book and refer to it once you're there. <p>I've been to Yosemite four or five times since I've purchased this book, and still find it useful.  Partially this is because if you go in different seasons there are different things to see, and sometimes you just want a pizza and that's in there too (Camp Curry has good pizza, if anybody's curious).</span>

                    <span>I already had a couple of trips to Yosemite under my belt before buying this book in anticipation of a third, but I still found it very useful. Much of the information you will want at hand before and during your trip is conveniently compiled in this book, and it is presented in a charming and amusing way. (Bruinhilda, your host, is a cartoon bear.) History, hiking, flora, fauna, lodging, feeding, even five pages of telephone numbers you may need, are all there. The price of this book will be a pittance compared to the total cost of your trip to Yosemite, and it will help you to get the most out of your visit. I particularly recommend this book to people who aren't planning a trip to Yosemite-maybe it will encourage you to go (and to respect and care for the park when you do)!</span>

                    <span>This is THE A-Z Yosemite guild, with info ranging from how long it takes to get there to what restaurants will best suit your needs and not to say, your price bracket. This guide will interest the most unenthusiastic of  readers. It gives you a very lighthearted look at camping (the way it was  intended to be) and detailed insider information of Yosemite with a side of  humor narriated by an animated bear. The animation makes it all the more  enjoyable, as it pokes fun of the stereotypical tourist and his civilized  quirks.  The guide uses a helpful Q&A format. It also provides an  informative hiking graph of strenuosity and milage along with a graph of  campgrounds and their amenities. I consider it the Yosemite bible of sorts  and a must have for first time visitors!</span>

                    <span>This book may be better than Steve Medley's "Guidebook to Yosemite National Park" because of its question and answer format.  The cartoons are excellent, especially if you're a fan of "Farley" as  I am...it's very easy to read and information is easily accessible, also  it's about as up-to-date as you can possibly get.  My husband and I were  married in Yosemite in September of '98, and sent this book around to the  invitees who had never been to our beautiful park.  The book got rave  reviews from all.<p>I would recommend this book, along with the Jeffrey P.  Schaffer book "Yosemite National Park" (which I would also give 5  stars) as "Must-haves" when visiting Yosemite.  The  "Yosemite Handbook" is especially good for people who are  bringing children, and plan to spend the majority of their time in the  Valley...can't say enough good things about this book!</span>
