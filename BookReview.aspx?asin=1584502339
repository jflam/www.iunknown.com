                    <span>I've noticed several scathing reviews from folks who admit in the review that they aren't even game programmers.  Am I missing something?  How in the world could this book be at all useful or interesting to someone who admittedly has no interest in programming games?  Unbelievable.<p>For anyone specifically interested in actually using this book to develop games, you're going to get your money's worth.</span>

                    <span>The Game Programming Gems books are fat and full of good ideas. Unfortunately, these ideas are only really useful to beginning programmers; anyone who has programmed seriously for more than two years will know 90% of the material in the book series. <br>The remaining 10% of the book is remarkably good, with innovative ideas on how to approach problems. But Charles River Media decided to lengthen the book with such trivialities as how to use the C++ Standard Library and using Direct3D. Most of the material in the GPG series is covered better, and in more depth in other books which don't have the word "game" in their title.</span>

                    <span>For anyone who actually works as a game programming professional, I'd highly recommend this book.  Those of you looking for general-purpose interesting programming tidbits, try one of Scott Meyer's books instead, which I'd recommend to ANY C++ programmer, not game programmers.<p>One thing to note: I've heard claims (regarding this and previous books in the series) that these books are simply pre-existing articles pulled from the web and other sources and packed into a collection to be resold.  This is nonsense - every article in the book was submitted by programmers, and was exclusively commissioned and paid for by the publisher for use in this series.  You won't find these articles floating around on the net.  Moreover, because these articles are commissioned, peer-reviewed, and professional edited, the overall quality is much higher than random articles found on the net.<p>Overall, this book, and the entire series for that matter, gets my highest recommendation.  You're naturally not going to find every article or topic useful or relevant, but if you're actually in the trenches, the likelyhood of finding at least one article that really helps you out is likely high.  In my experience, simply finding one really valuable article is worth the price of the book alone.</span>

                    <span>I now have all three of them. OK, first two were borderline acceptable, meaning the ratio of anything exoteric to programming trivialities (like loading DLLs explicitly) was, in my view, not intolerable. Though I'm curious why such a DLL topic would be included in anything "game" and "guru", it's basic Windows programming. <p>But in this third installment they continued this ... practice and even worsened it. A game programmer is BY DEFINITION a more-or-less competent general-purpose programmer, and so a massive inclusion of programming banalities can have no explanation other than blatant, in your face attempts to fatten the book in order to jack up the price. And I'm not even a game programmer, I don't care for games and never written one, nor do I plan to, I buy these game books because they contain examples of PROBLEM-ORIENTED, applied programming, most of which is either directly applicable in a much larger than just games area, or, at least, is inspirational, skill-improving and mind-stimulating, which is better than your typical bland and closed-end language or technology tutorials; neither are they academic, all math and no code. I like these books because they offer this somewhat popperian approach to acquiring knowledge. With that in view, why do they stuff these thick tomes with absolute minutiae? <p>Not all is bad even in that volume, but! Buyer beware, definitely peruse this book before buying, these guys are just squeezing out of you whatever money you're still willing to pay for this kind of literature based on previously-built expectations or simply hype.</span>

                    <span>I pre-order this book before release. I'm not a game programmer but I work in software programming/design for 13y <br>The book is much worst than the GPG1 GPG2. <br>The samples and articles are poor, and the mumbo-jumbo `stl' tricks are cheap. After I've read GPG1/2 and some of GPG3 I can say that 90% of information from these GPG's books is available for free on several sites of game tutorials on Internet.</span>
