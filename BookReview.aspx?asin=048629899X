                    <span>Anyday, anywhere, this book: "The Narrative of Sojourner Truth", is a masterpiece. The hardship she endured, as well as other horrors of slavery will always live in our memories. Afterall, it is said that: 'The evil that men do lives after them'. Sojourner's courage and perseverance is commendable. There is a lot to learn from her.<br>I strain to keep myself from laughing each time a serious issue like Slavery is raised, and I see men and women do nothing but run for cover. The North accuses the South of having been too tenacious on slavery, and the South accuses the North of hypocrisy, insisting that she (the North), started it in the first place: by disguising the first slaves whom she brought (in 1619) to New Amsterdam (the present day New York) as "indentured servants".<br>Surely, the guilty are afraid and ashamed; but that changes nothing. Reality will always remain reality. This 138-paged book is a fantastic history memo. It is the real truth; from Sojourner Truth.</span>

                    <span>Some people look on accounts of slavery as being only for black Americans to read.  This is untrue.  The horror and evil of slavery is something that every American should confront.  This is not to hang or condemn anyone.   Its just to say that a book like The Narrative of Sojourner Truth is  something that everyone should read.  I was at times stunned by Sojourner  Truths startling courage in the face of the evil she faced.  It was also  enlightening to read about the slavery of the Northern states like New York  and that so many people in that region still spoke Dutch even well into the  19th Century.  I was infuriated reading about the treatment of the slaves  but I also was inspired by Sojourner Truths dignity and strength.  Much  like the Nazi holocaust, slavery is a horror that must never be allowed to  happen again.  If everyone read books like this, we would be one step  closer to making that a reality.</span>
