                    <span>A very good book.  It gives you everything you need to know.  It was very helpful in my passing of the Java certification exam.  I used this in conjunction with another book.  I especially liked the 2 minute drills where it summarized all the necessary information you needed to know to pass the test.</span>

                    <span>The exam was very tricky but I worked hard to prepare.
<br />1. Read K&B twice cover by cover.
<br />2. Took the self test twice.
<br />3. Took the mock exam from Marcus Green's site.
<br />4. Took other mock exam from actualtests.com
<br />5. Before giving the exam, I took the self-test from K&B.
<br />6. Finally, read all the exam watchs and self-test from K&B.
<br />7. In addition to above, I also made my own notes on flash card as suggested by Kathy.
<br />8. I have tried all the examples in the computer. 
<br />
<br />Kathy if you are reading this I have to thank to million times because you have developed the best certification book in the whole world. I have given the A+ certification exam and prepared from Micheal Mayers book but it's not the effective.
<br />
<br />Bottom line you are the best java instructor in the whole world
<br />
<br />Sucess is sweet after Failure!!!
<br />
<br />I have to ask you where were you in the year 2000 when I failed SCJP 1.2 exam.
<br />I wish I was able to read the book like K&B at that time but I read ordinay and very poorly edited book for certification at that time do want to same the name.
<br />
<br />Kathy you are very passionate instructor and I have learned a lot about Java language from you book.
<br />Now I am runninig out of words to describe how good is K&B.
<br />
<br />Any one reading this review my recomendation is go for it but remember -> Reading this book + Hard work + Lot of Practice + mock exams == Sun Certification Java Programmer 1.4

                    <span>Excellent study guide.  The breadth of questions on the actual exam is larger than the questions covered in the book and two practice exams.  Dont be surprised if you run into some questions that are not covered in the book.  However, the materials in the book should easily let your score an 80% which is passing by a large margin.
<br />
<br />The practice exam simulations are roughly the same difficulty as the actual exam so you will score similar to what you score on the practice exams.  If you desire a top mark on the SCJP, continue your studies and pursue additional mock exams and training materials.  However, this is an excellent foundation for developing your knowledge.</span>

                    <span>This books is simply amazing. It covers all certification objectives very well and clear.
<br />No further books are needed if you have this one. Read the book and do the exercises and you're set!
<br />
<br />I also recommend doing the mocks at http://danchisholm.net and http://www.javacertificate.com.
<br />
<br />With less than 30 days studying by this book, I scored 95% at Mar 23.
<br />
<br />A great buy! Good luck!</span>
