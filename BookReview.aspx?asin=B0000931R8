                    <span>>Nowhere In Africa was a breath-taking movie with music that can take you away. This is definately a must-see film. UNBELIVABLE! Now let's get down to the music here, since the product is the soundtack that is being sold here. They have this one voice that sings a song that they play multiple times during the movie. It is made to sound like a child. It goes...<P>Eee-OOO Ah.<BR>Eee-OOO Ah.<BR>Eee-OOO Aaaaahhhhh.<P>The sound is just so beautiful. This is the kind of music that is so soothing it could put you right to sleep. But the music is strong and has a message hear of what this family had to go through to survive and what they had lost when their families died when they refused to leave their Nazi Death Chamber. Sad but a must see (and listen)!</span>

                    <span>Best Foreign Language Film winner of 2002 from the Academy Award people and nominated by the Golden Globe is "Nowhere in Africa", from director Caroline Link ~ is captivating to say the least. From Nazi Germany one family escapes in 1938 to a new beginning in Kenya ~ from the autobiographical book by Stefanie Zweig is truly an amazing story ~ but wait it only gets better with an award winning score by Niki Reiser, the Swiss Composer who leads the Baset Symphony Orchestra inclusive of sweeping strings and native chants. Very short (less than a minute) tracks of a child singing with harp accompaniment is haunting. <P>Highlights ~ "NOWHERE IN AFRICA", rhythmic percussion interwoven with the string section, wind instruments join the pulse sating journey ~ "LOVE SCENE", piano solo as strings close in with solace and meditation ~ "JOURNEY THROUGH KENYA", opening sounds of a hoe-down and chants blend within each passage and counter drum beats within the percussion section.<P>Hats off to Higher Octave Music for sharing this wonderful soundtrack with all the "film-score-buffs" who look forward to unique and global world scores ~ this album will sit on my top shelf for continual enjoyment in the next days and weeks forthcoming.<P>Total Time 56:50 on 22 Tracks ~ Higher Octave 83955 ~ (5/06/2003)</span>
