                    <span>I have never read a "Travel" book before, let alone a "Motorcycle Travel" book so I may not be qualified to say that this is more of a tale of adventure than a guide of any sort.  That said, this book has been a page-turner that has me looking for something similar to replace it now that it is over.  Andre's makes you feel like you have been on the road (and off the road) and conveys, often at his own expense, a sense of the ups and downs of his relationship with his two riding partners.  
<br />This is not a Moto-Travel reference.  It is not a guide to where to stay or what to eat.  It is a true-life tale of a dream come to life.  I hope to follow in Andres, Peters and Robert's footsteps some day.

                    <span>The reader should not expect to learn much about any of the Latin American countries that the author visited.  This is a book about what goes on inside a Yankee motorcyclist's head, not about Latin America.  The author seems ill-informed about the places he travels, so can say very little about them.<p>One star because it is very well written, very readable.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book excited to read about a fellow KLR rider undertaking a trip that I've been comtenplating myself. But instead of any insightful look at the people or places along the way, what we're left with is a juevenille cursory glance, while most of the book consists of the author looking to score with the ladies.<p>I felt entirely sympathetic with his two riding companions, as countlessly the author performs bone-headed manuevers, over-sleeps, doens't prepare in the least for a trip of this kind, and the guy wonders at the end why he isn't invited to one of their weddings.<p>This was a huge dissapointment, and if you're looking for insightful looks at motorcycle and travel, read The Perfect Vehicle, or Ghost Rider, or Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenence. All great books.<p>Avoid this stinker.</span>

                    <span>I own basically every motorcycle touring book out there.  This book is by far the absolute best book.  I cannot tell you enough how witty, interesting, and fascinating the author tells the story.  Both my husband and I were glued to the book until it was finished and both of us did not want the book to end.  It was that good!  I felt like I was there with him...</span>

                    <span>Although the author professes to be completely inexperienced that aspect becomes one of the most endearing traits of the book. Rather than listen to the seasoned rider, unflappable and arrogant, blather on about how he managed everything the road threw at him because of his wisdom, Andres takes the reader along to discover a world that I, at least, knew very little about; mistakes, errors, accidents, successes and all.  Carlstein is also very good at describing where he is and I felt as though I was only a bike length behind him as he traipsed through this often overlooked part of the world.  His two riding comrades, however, were a big reason as to why the book is so enjoyable and Carlstein does a great job of illustrating how his initial impressions and appreceations change for his riding-buddies as they struggle with four-months together. My only complaint is how often the reader has one-night stands along the way.  Kinda tacky. Until he finds an Italian gal in Argentina that he, and the reader, really like. But with youthful inexperience he botches that up too, and does not hide his regret. I found myself hoping as much as he, that he could reconnect with her. His honesty is pleasant, and makes the adventure feel more real and tactile. If you enjoy traveling, enjoy motorcycles or love stories of adventure, do not miss this wonderful book.  I wonder how much a good KLR 650 is going for these days?  hmmmm....</span>
