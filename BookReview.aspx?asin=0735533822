                    <span>When I read the course description for the information privacy law class offered at my law school, I immediately signed up. This book was the text used. <P>As a general rule, reading a 700+ page legal book from cover to cover in a condensed summer session is about as pleasant as getting a root canal. This text is one of the rare exceptions to that rule. Chock full of fascinating cases, explanations and statutes, this book was a joy to study. The cases are all either amusing, interesting or instructive on the intricacies of the law. <P>What makes this area of the law so interesting is that it combines tort law with criminal law and privacy considerations. Whether you want to learn about healthcare privacy, wiretaps, the Patriot Act, telephone privacy or computer privacy, this book is likely to address it. In sum, this book is one of the best legal texts I have encountered in law school and that is quite a compliment considering how confusing many legal books can be. This is a worthwhile read.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great introduction to the rapidly growing field of information privacy law. Although it is a casebook designed for classroom instruction, it also serves as a terrific reference tool for lawyers in the field, especially given the field's lack of reference books. The text has broad coverage, including privacy issues about the media, law enforcement, health and genetic data, computers, the Internet, email, anonymity, and the workplace. It also has a chapter on international privacy law. It covers the privacy torts, constitutional protections, FTC enforcement, federal statutes, HIPAA regulations, EU Data Protection Directive, and more. The book is tightly edited; and it provides copious background and explanatory notes. All of the major privacy statutes are explained thoroughly and clearly -- for this alone, the book is worth purchasing! The book is the best synthesis of the field I have yet encountered. If you deal with information privacy law issues, this book is an indispensable reference tool!</span>
