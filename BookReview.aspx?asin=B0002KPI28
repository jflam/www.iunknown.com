                <span id="Label1">After the national success of his 11-hour epic, <i>The Civil War</i>--the highest-rated miniseries in public-television history--many wondered if Ken Burns could capture the same energy and passion with smaller subjects. His reply, the 18-hour history of America's greatest sport, <i>Baseball</i>, not only quieted these worries, it also perhaps surpassed his prior achievement. Massive in scope (it covers more than 100 years), exhausting in detail, and filled with celebrities, journalists, politicians, historians, and the men who played the game, Burns's romantic love letter to the game achieves the impossible: even those who hate baseball can't help but become immersed in it. This is because Burns doesn't just detail the great players and the memorable plays and games; he also presents baseball as a cultural and social mirror, reflecting the beauty and hypocrisy of the nation that created it. Divided into nine innings, two hours each in length, the video examines complex social issues such as segregation, racial inequality (its section on Jackie Robinson, baseball's first African American player, should be required school viewing), labor battles between owners and players, politics, technology and gender conflicts, among others. Then, of course, there's fascinating footage and biographies on the players--troubled icons such as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb, heroes such as Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, and tragic figures such as Pete Rose and Lou Gehrig--the men who, despite a rocky and often hypocritical history, constructed baseball's tradition and preserved its invincibility. <i>--Dave McCoy</i> </span>

                    <span>Not much to add to the other reviews, but this is a mere perfect film documentary by Ken Burns.  The documentary takes on a life of its own by becoming a loving tribute to Jackie Robinson, Black Baseball and an act of asking forgiveness for baseball's segregation. It is ironic that when the documentary was released in the fall of 1994, Baseball had just went into a major strike and there was no Baseball World Series that year. A minor footnote is that the New York Yankees were on the verge of a major image overhaul in the wake of Steinbrenner's second suspension and were to become contenders again when he was reinstated. Ken Burns should revisit the documentary with a follow-up film to cover the Yankees return to dynastic prominence in the mid to late 90's, the eventual end of the Red Sox so-called 'Curse' in the new millenium along with the loss of Joe Dimaggio, Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle. The documentary focuses in on the Baseball's rich history that is emphasized by the statistics of individuals that are used as a yardstick to measure the performances of upcoming and future players. Lastly, KEN BURNS' BASEBALL is a detailed fountain of information, history, and entertainment from the obscure to the obvious that demands repeat viewings showing why baseball is the 'National Pastime'. Note: Great quote from columnist and television personality George Will on the comparisons of Baseball to Football. George Will states, "Football combines the two worst features of modern American life.  It is violence punctuated by committee meetings. In addition, Football demonstrates the manic division of labor that makes life confusing and (I should think)...unsatisfying..."</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>There are two wonderful documentaries contained here.  One is the story of New York baseball, from the Giants to Babe Ruth to the Brooklyn "Bums" to the '86 Mets.  The other is the story of Negro League baseball and breaking the color barrier.  These two separate documentaries come together wonderfully in the chapter on Jackie Robinson.  
<br />
<br />The problem is that the film wants to be something more.  It wants to be the complete story of baseball, and that ambition comes up short.  Many good players and valuable stories were given short shrift because they apparently didn't fit the narrative outline chosen by the film-maker.</span>

                    <span>I wasn't interested in Ken Burns', the Civil War until just recently.  However, I was interested in viewing this film from the begining as I'm a huge fan of the American pastime.  I absolutely enjoyed the interview with Buck O'Neill as he tells his adventures with Satchel Paige as well as Bob Costas' observations of the 1986 World Series.  What I didn't like was the interviews with historians as I was baffled on their, so called, baseball knowledge.  What worked in the "Civil War", didn't work with this film.  As with his other documentary, this film will inspire those who love the game and those who would like to know more about the history.  </span>

                    <span>Wow! This is eighteen hours of the most comprehensive baseball coverage i could ever conceive of. Burns does a great job spreading around his focus, using footage and narration to expertly cover the nuts and bolts of the game for past 150 yrs, which includes crucial historical events, games and player bios. He then has famous writers and historians reflect on the game, giving it the sentimentality that no other sport can match. My only caveat is that if you're not an avid baseball fan, it can drag on at parts. However, if you're a baseball nut (like me) or a historian, this is a MUST-HAVE. Worth every penny.</span>

                    <span>I have come to the conclusion that Ken Burns 
<br />cannot make a documentary over 2 hours long.  
<br />He is repetitious and on
<br />a soap box throughout this documentary.  There are some
<br />wonderful moments, but the east coast bias and the social
<br />commentary get old very quick.  How many times, I groaned
<br />at the screen, "not again"...I get it Ken, I get it...show
<br />me some baseball already.  It is very apparent that
<br />this documentary was made to be watched over the course of
<br />2 1/2 months...it is unwatchable back to back.  Pick any one
<br />disk and it is very enjoyable, but then put it away for a while
<br />before you watch another one.  dissapointing.</span>
