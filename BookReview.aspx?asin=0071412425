                <span id="Label1">Ten steps to surviving a family rift, finding peace, and moving on  <P>A family rift is one of the most traumatic experiences a person can face. It can have a profound effect on virtually every aspect of life, causing depression, relationship problems, and even physical illness. Healing From Family Rifts offers hope to those coping with a split in their families. Family therapist Mark Sichel addresses the pain and shame connected with family rifts and offers a way through the crisis and on toward healing and fulfillment. Uniquely, Sichel does not assume that every rift will or even should be mended. Instead, he offers ways to recover from any outcome, including:  <P>A 10-step process to come to terms with the family dynamics that led to the split  <BR>Methods to find peace and personal reconciliation  <BR>Skills that help to build a second family of people whose values are in line with one's own  <BR>Techniques to fight feelings of guilt when faced with a family rift   <P>Includes inspiring and instructive stories drawn from the author's patients that help readers put their own situations in perspective.</span>

                    <span>With insight and compassion, the author sensititvely explores the highly-charged world of those affected by family rifts. The book is made all the more powerful as the author reveals his personal experience with this devasting experience. The book offers a clear understanding of how family rifts come to be and provides workable solutions. A compassionate and down-to-earth handbook. And a must-read for those seeking to better understand the human condition.</span>

                    <span>I was impressed by how the author outlined the effects and underlying trauma that accompany a family rift. Such insights are really helpful and useful in understanding how to move on from the feelings of paralysis that often accompany rifts. Rarely does a book leave you feeling that a problem is much more manageable, but this one does. I have gotten copies for family members and friends.</span>

                    <span>This book really cuts to the heart of the subject of losing one's family. What I really like about the book is the author's empathetic and effective approach to understanding, coping, and finally recovering from the tragedy of involuntary exile from family or relative. Step by step, he makes it possible to understand and deal with an often deeply painful life trauma. Mr. Sichel gives us all the gory details: but the book is ultimately one of hope and healing. As someone who has in some measure experienced family cutoff, I found the book to be of great comfort and usefulness; and would unconditionally recommend it to anyone who faces similar circumstances, or to those who know a friend or loved one going through such an ordeal.</span>

                    <span>This book was just what I needed. After my brother and I went through a painful fight, he vowed never to speak to me again. My whole being had been shattered. Days would go by where I would barely eat and just lie in bed for hours and hours. Looking online for some help, I discovered this book and it changed my outlook. Reading the stories of those who've gone through trials like my own helped heal my wounds. With each step, I found the courage to move on with my life and continue living. Finally, I regained the strength to let the pain wash away. If you've been cutoff or disowned by your family and feel yourself shaken to the core, this book will be your map to finding happiness again.</span>
