                <span id="Label1">It appears Exchange Server administrators have an insatiable demand for thick books, a demand Jim McBee's <I>Exchange Server 5.5</I>--part of the 24Seven series--should help satisfy. Exchange Server doesn't naturally lend itself to a linear narrative style, which makes for episodic reading. With 18 chapters and four appendices, this text covers most Exchange Server issues, but McBee takes pains to point out the large areas--such as client issues--that are not covered. <p> Interestingly, the book does address migration issues, but not at a technical level. In fact the technical content is pretty light throughout--as if the target reader isn't intended to be hands-on. Sensibly, McBee places a lot of emphasis on preparation and routine maintenance in the central chapters. He focuses on disaster recovery issues, which has an amusing, I-told-you-so feel and uses a lot of ink referring you back to the chapters on preparation and maintenance. The point, of course, is that any disaster you're prepared for isn't a disaster at all.<p> Although <I>Exchange Server 5.5</I> isn't as well-structured as it could be, it is clearly written by someone with a lot of experience. This alone makes it essential reading for anyone starting out with Exchange Server. <I>--Steve Patient, Amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>This book can make mail admin's life easier. I did not pickup this book from the beginning. I had Exchange 5.5 unleashed a year ago. I thought it would cover everything if I looked hard enough. To my suprise, this book is the best book for the real world. I enjoyed every pages I have read. It shows you how to implement solid Exchange server. All the cautions that you should be aware of, i.e. how to restrict relaying without simply disable it. and good security practice. Highly recomended for all Exchange admins.</span>

                    <span>I don't usually write reviews, but I had to for this book. The author not only knows his stuff, but is capable of putting his indepth knowledge in a very step 1,2,3 approach, something I have found to be an exception in alot of what I read. One think I have to note, I am the main systems person for a trading firm, and we are required to do message journaling (keeping all communications for three years). I have tried to find information on this topic and how to implement it on many message boards and other forums, as well as in documentation. Being that I did not know the actual term was "journaling" I found this impossible, and therefore, have been backing up every single mailbox, and that does not even "legally" do the trick. This one 2 page section on how to implement this makes this book worth more than money, because we are now legal. To the author, thank you for your help, and I look forward to anymore lit. that you produce!</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book as a sys admin working with Exchange Server for the first time, and this book took an already complex product and made it more frustrating. I was looking for a book that would explain the capabilities of Exchange Server and how to configure it to exploit these capabilities. This book seems much more concerned with migration of existing enterprise messaging systems to Exchange and upgrading existing Exchange installations than actually setting up Exchange from scratch.<P>While I am sure that there is good info in this book that I will eventually use, I would definitely not recommend this book to someone who didn't know quite a bit about Exchange Server to begin with.</span>
