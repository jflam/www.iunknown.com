                    <span>This book is extremely informative and well organized. Every step in the boat buying process is covered in terms easily understood by a first-time boat buyer (such as myself). After reading this book, I feel confident that I will be able to (1) find, negotiate, and purchase my first boat (at a great deal), and (2) be able to identify those boats/deals which are best left alone. I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>My husband and I are experienced boaters. We wanted to purchase a small cruiser and needed a little more education on the pros and cons of new vs. used. JP's book was well thought out and a great help. We found a beautiful used boat that suited our needs perfectly. The inspection checklist was instrumental in guiding us toward a quality boat at a substancial savings. Thanks JP!</span>

                    <span>While this book is a good overview of buying a boat, it contains no surprises - and I knew nothing about boats before buying it - save reading two magazines.<P>What did it tell me ?<P>- There is approx 30-35% markup on price of a new boat<BR>- you get a good deal if you get 12-15% of that in negociating.<P>What else?<BR>Nothing much but common sense, and repeated info.<P>An organised person could generate the checklists themselves with or without the help of this book or a couple of boating magazines.<P>Anyone who has purchased a new or used car would go through the same tactics with the dealer/seller.<P>What would I reccomend instead ?<P>I also purchased "The Complete Idiots Guide to Boating and Sailing" which gave me a better (but still reasonably high level) introduction to boats/buying.<P>What has really impressed me is my latest purchase (reccomended from Amazon Reviews) and that is the so called "Bible of Boating" Chapmans Piloting. It sounds a bit high-brow, but covers everything and anything a novice or experienced person could want to know. It is letter sized hardcover with 650 color pages - well worth thirty five bucks. Buy that and forget wasting thrity bucks on three empty paperbacks.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Lamy's book has alleviated many of the fears I had regarding the purchase of a new/used boat. His thoughts on how to deal with sales people is priceless. This book should be read by any person interested in buying or selling a small power boat. <BR>I would love to see him write a book on general maintenance.</span>

                    <span>After reading this book it's very evident that the author has purchased and sold a number of boats.

It's well worth the money to purchase this book if you're out looking for a new boat.</span>
