                    <span>Like a great river flowing through a fertile valley, history is made up of many streams - each contributing its singular waters to the majestic confluence flowing to the sea.  The "Hinges of History" are made up of many tributaries - philosophy, theology, culture, customs and rituals - of diverse peoples, blending to form the totality of our historical experience and human formation.

<br />THE GIFTS OF THE JEWS examines the pivotal role of an ancient people, desert nomads at first, who changed humanity's perception of the universe, meaning of life, and understanding of God in relationship with His creations.  Thomas Cahill, who bestselling HOW THE IRISH SAVED CIVILIZATION explored the influence of their role in preserving history, here examines the impact of Jewish history and thought in the Western World.  A gifted storyteller, the author reveals his analysis within the context of other ancient civilizations, including the Sumerians, Egyptians, Babylonians and others.  Unlike surrounding cultures of the time, which saw life as a wheel of continual birth, death and rebirth, the Jews saw life as a covenant relationship with their God, whose promise of faith and fidelity pointed to an end-time - one which would also depend on individual choices.  In covenant, Judaism is seen as the origin of the "processsive worldview," where God unfolds His purposes to effect its end along with our human response.  This transition of thought empowers individuals who are free to shape their unique destinies, and who experience the consequences of those individual choices.
<br />
<br />Unlike other writers, Mr. Cahill does not hide behind mind-numbing posturing.  Instead, he capably unfolds his thoughts in an engaging narrative that leaves a reader wanting even more.  THE GIFTS OF THE JEWS is a fine book, one worthy of examination and reflection. </span>

                    <span>If I could I would personally thank Thomas Cahill for writing this book. Like Paul Johnson, Conor Cruise O'Brien ,the late James Parkes, and a very long list of others he is one of those non- Jewish , in this case Christian writers, who show a deep understanding and appreciation of the Jewish people's contribution to humanity. 
<br />I write this now with special feeling because the world recently has seen a rise in anti-Jewish feeling( admittedly more from the Islamic than from the Christian world) which so deeply distresses as it comes a little more than half a century after over one- third of the Jewish people were murdered simply because they were Jewish. 
<br />And here I think I come to one of the gifts of the Jews spoken about in the book. While the emphasis in the work is on the Jewish gifts of Monotheism, of deepening appreciation of human individuality, of understanding History as a progressive redemptive story ( and not a hopeless cyclical repetition) of social justice, I want to here focus one quality the Jews stressed.
<br /> It is the quality of being merciful and compassionate. And it is the commandment which of all commandments is repeated most in the Bible i.e. the commandment to be just and compassionate to the stranger because you were strangers in Egypt. And here it is important to note that the signature of the Jewish people, the name of founding father is Abraham ( in Hebrew Av-Rachum Merciful Father). And that this quality of mercy and consideration of valuing each and every human being as a special creation of God is the major idea the Jewish Tradition teaches Mankind should hold dear. 
<br />I know there is criticism of this book along the lines that the Egyptians also  had some idea of Monotheism, and that the Greeks certainly( though their formative period came later) had an idea of 'individuality'. But it seems to me that the question is not one of taking credit or blame .
<br />It seems to me rather that there are fundamental values which all of Mankind should share, and that one basic one is respecting the dignity and divine essence of every individual. I think that Cahill presents a convincing argument that the people of Israel helped make this contribution to Mankind. 
<br />It seems to me in this that the gift of the Jews, the greatest gift, the idea of a moral and loving God Who cares for each and every human being, and Who demands of them a walking in the way of mercy and justice is in this sense perhaps best spoken of not so much as a 'gift of the Jews' but as a gift of God to Humanity in which the Jews served as messenger of.

                    <span>Much of this book is a rehash of Sumerian legend from Gilgamesh and biblical stories from Genesis and Exodus, without getting into the unique characteristics of the Jews that made them so important to present civilization.  Eventually he does get into the subject, but in such a peripheral way that he seems to be straining to try to make his argument.  He should have concentrated more on those aspects of Judaism that have truly shaped the west (and he says the undeveloped world also, but that seems to be a real stretch) rather than try to show us that he has read the Old Testament and various versions of Gilgamesh.  There is much less to this book than would appear,  and his gee-whiz style starts to grate on the reader, at least on this reader.</span>

                    <span>In "The Gift Of The Jews", Thomas Cahill advances the theory that the Jews introduced unique world views.  In his view the Jews, unlike antecedent societies, viewed history as progressive, not cyclical.  The Jews recognized the worth of each individual rather than seeing people only as members of a group.  The Jews see human action as making a difference, rather than being the results of unalterable fate.  The Jews see God as a person who talks with His people and who invites them to have a personal relationship with Him.
<br />
<br />Cahill makes his case by telling the history of the Jews as told in the Old Testament, from the call of Abraham to the return form the Babylonian Captivity.  Through his selection of Biblical stories he demonstrates the evolution of the Jewish world view over the millennia.
<br />
<br />This book's depiction of the evolution of the Jewish understanding of God and man's relationship to Him makes for a very interesting read.  It is generally consistent with what I had learned in collegiate scripture classes.
<br />
<br />From the perspective of an analysis of development of Jewish thought as reflected in the Bible, it is very good.  My only question is whether the insights identified as being Jewish are truly unique.  Cahill says yes, but I lack the knowledge to form an independent judgment.  Overall, it is a fascinating book concluding with challenging questions for all readers.</span>

                    <span>PERSPECTIVE:  theologically interested reader, unfamiliar with Cahill's work<p>The Gifts of the Jews is a wonderfully written exploration of the pivotal role the Jewish people have played in the shaping of our modern perceptions and life, irregardless of faith.  Cahill brings extensive theological and historical training to bear, and goes to great lengths, including travelling the world, to do research for his chosen topic.  His thesis, as he calls it, is that the Jewish people were the first to break out of the "cyclic boredom" of ancient world views.  Through their culture, beliefs, and history, they have given the entire modern world crucial "gifts" of individuality, prospective thinking, freedom, justice, and many more.  To illustrate this, he uses a wide variety of historical documents, texts, and commentaries, including several translations of the Hebrew Bible, and weaves them together with a style that is remarkably eloquent, delightfully funny, and impressively accessible.<p>Whatever your religious or political beliefs, this thought- (and spirit-, if you are so inclined) provoking novel worth a read.  Although it is, at its heart, an academic treatise, and as such is eminently open for debate, as exemplified by the many editorial discussions - with much heated agreement and dissention - it is important to note that it is easily enjoyable on a different level.<p>FINAL WORD:  Read this book!  Buy it, check it out from the library, or buy it and donate it to your local library.</span>
