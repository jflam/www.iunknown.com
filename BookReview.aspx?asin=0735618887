                    <span>This is quite a voluminous book, with lots of screenshots and textual information. It defines clearly the purposes and goals of the Microsoft Systems Management Server 2003 software, explains fairly well why to use it and how to deploy it. If you didn't hear what SMS is and did never work with it before, this published work is of great value. However, when in comes to troubles with the use or the deployment of the software, this volume is of little worth. It does only explain the straight path when everything goes fine, but as soon as something went wrong, you are lost.</span>

                    <span>There is no question that if you need to implement or administer SMS, this is a must own.  The book covers everything needed to plan and configure your back-end environment, as well as to setup a good administrative model for IT support, application management and end-users control and deployment.  This title will also serve as an excellent day to day resource long after you have implemented SMS.  <p>Although I completely recommend this title, I found that this book isn't enough completely on it's own to truly cover all the ins and outs of SMS 2003.  Microsoft provides two free downloads which I recommend you read and use in conjunction with this title; "Concepts, Planning, and Deployment Guide" and "Operations Guide" (The SMS 2003 Microsoft website also has many other resources for administration).</span>

                    <span>This book is easy to read.  However, if you are wanting a book that has everything to get up and running on SMS 2003, this book is lacking.  Make sure to read the product's release notes.  If you have access to Microsoft TechNet and Microsoft's website, you will need it to do some homework.  The Advanced Security model in SMS 2003 is definitely far different from previous versions of SMS.  The book does not go into any of this in detail.  I recommend this book, but make sure you collect up the other information I have mentioned.</span>

                    <span>The SMS 2003 Admin Companion is the best guide to SMS 2003 available.  The author doesn't miss a thing and lays out the management applicaton in a logical manner.  SMS 2003 is a huge application with a huge learning curve, and this book helps get you up-to-speed in as little time as possible.</span>
