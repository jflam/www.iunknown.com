                    <span>First things, Keith Ballinger is extremely knowledgable when it comes to .NET web services. This book contains a lot of valuable information about designing and building web services using the .NET framework. So why only 3 stars?<P>This book was published in 2003 (some specs from April 2003 are mentioned to confirm that), but it reads more like a 2001-2002 book. I was really looking for some information about how and when to use WSE instead of standard ASMX. Unlike most ... books I own, this book really needed more technical editing and some better graphics (check out figure 3.3 for a chuckle). Lastly, the website for this book contains no useful information and is often unavailable. I expected more from ... Keith Ballinger. </span>

                    <span>It's hard to think of a writer that has better web service credentials that Keith Ballinger. Because of that, I expected a lot from this book. And though the book is good, it's unfortunately equivalent to almost every other .NET web service intro title. I didn't find any more low-level details or tips that weren't already in other books (other good choices are Yasser Shohoud's Real World XML Web Services for VB'ers and O'Reilly's Programming .NET Web Services for C#-coders). There was disappointingly little advice for enterprise architecture here (how web services should fit into a distributed application) although I got a better understanding of SOAP encodings. I haven't yet found any book that covers WSE... hopefully the second editions of these books will fill this area in.</span>

                    <span>Keith covers a wide range of topics in this book. Unfortunately, the discussion is shallow, and you will find yourself seeking additional resources for all of the topics covered in the book. If you are looking for a high level overview of the technologies involved because you are new to web services, this book is for you. But if you are looking to fully understand the architectural and implementation details for the core web services technologies, be prepared to buy some more books.</span>

                    <span>Having already read another book on Web Services, most of this was not new. However, that does not mean that I found the book to be a redundant addition to my collection. The author does an excellent job of drilling down to the core technologies, XML, SOAP, WSDL, and offers ground level explanations of the technology as well as how they contribute to Web Services. <P>This is an Architecture and Implementation book not an Applied book, so don't expect detailed practical examples, that give you the details of a new widget to use in your next project. The examples provide a good look at the nuts and bolts of the various aspects that the author covers, but that's about all. The author does a good job of providing a comprehensive view of the technology. About the only thing I can say bad about the book is that the white cover gets dirty way too fast.<BR>P-)</span>

                    <span>Too many books talk about web services and spend more time on hype and nonsense then showing you how to build and use them. This book however, does not have that shortcoming.<P>The thing about this book that is so compelling is that you really get into building web services and consuming them, and its done in a way that is very practical and useful.<P>There's the standard explanation of the things, but he never gets all into the hype at the expense of content.<P>I think it's geared toward people with a basic understanding of web services, but even if you don't have that, if you walk through his examples, you'll get there quickly.<P>I will definitely buy anything else that he puts out. He's a great writer and communicator.</span>
