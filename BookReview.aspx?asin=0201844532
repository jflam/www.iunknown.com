                    <span>Basically a horrible book for the same reasons listed by all the other 1 star ratings. I bought it on a whim whilst browsing in a bookstore - wished I'd read a review or few first. 
<br />
<br />To echo my major issues with it:
<br />- The book is 363 pages long, the first 96 being a tutorial on C# and OO, so its effectively only 259 pages on design patterns.
<br />- The tutorial pupports to teach you both C# and OO general principles in 96 pages (and some UML as well)? Seriously now...
<br />- The whole book is full of typographical errors, particularly in the code with regards to erroneous spaces (or lack of) - there are inconsistencies everywhere, as well as misspelled words etc. etc.
<br />- Poor and erroneous commenting e.g.: //create a new Arraylist 
<br />- Examples are very contrived and often far from real world scenarios. I realise examples have to be somewhat contrived for print publishing, but this goes way too far...
<br />- As others have mentioned, the code seems more like Java than C# a lot of the time.
<br />
<br />Given the above, I haven't even bothered to load the CD.
<br />
<br />Consequently the only bits of the book that are actually valuable are the bits transcribed and summarised from other people books, most obviously the classic "Design Patterns" be Gamma et. al. Given this you're much better off just referring to the original source material. (Ironically both of these books are published by Addison-Wesley)</span>

                    <span>I'm what I would call an advanced C# developer, but have always felt I could use some education in accepted design patterns.  I thought this book would be a great start.  Boy was I wrong!  I second every complaint I've read in these user reviews.
<br />
<br />That said, I'd like to add one more to the list:  Often there was nothing in the text to explain how exactly the example code exemplified the pattern being discussed!  This was maddening to me--you get some bad code, then an unnecessary line-by-line description of how the bad code works, but you're no closer to understanding the proper application of the design pattern.</span>

                    <span>Personally, I found this book very easy to read - and I actually appreciate the fact that some time is spent on C# fundamentals prior to diving into the patterns.  If you're already a C# master, skip the intro and go right to the patterns.  But just about everyone can use a refresher on language fundamentals so even though I'm pretty familiar with C#, I still found it a valuable part of the book.</span>

                    <span>Although many have disparaged this book (and with good reason) I thought I would add some weight.  The examples have no real sense of direction, with the author adding in methods that have no clear purpose (or explanation).  The patterns are not really explained in theory; I guess the reader is supposed to somehow glean what the "big picture" is.  Lastly, the glaring error in the Singleton pattern (a VERY common pattern) is enough to make me shudder.  After seeing that, I couldn't trust that the patterns that I don't know were implemented correctly.  If you are a novice programmer, I advise you to put the book down and back slowly away from it.</span>

                    <span>The beginning intro the C# is absolutely POINTLESS. The author should have spent more time on providing better examples and discussions of his design patterns.
<br />
<br />Pg 110: "In both cases our events classes contain an instance of the base Events class, which we use to read in the data files."
<br />
<br />Ok, the base Events class he is talking about has been declared as an Abstract class... and he is telling us that our derived classes contain instances of the base Events class? What is he trying to do, provide misinformation? You can't instantiate or have instances of Abstract classes!
<br />
<br />This is an utter waste of $... </span>
