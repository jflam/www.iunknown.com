                    <span>I loved this book not only did it show the disparity between blacks and whites but also that there was the SCLU with a major effect on the South. We see King's battle with Alabama's law enforcement and see him rise to be a team player.</span>

                    <span>What can I say that the other reviews haven't already said?  This is a must-have for anyone interested in the major issue that has consumed our country and most of the world for so long.  Well-written, well-researched, and well. . . just a plain good read. Highly recommended.<p>Also recommended:  The Color Purple, Bark of the Dogwood, End of Blackness</span>

                    <span>What can be said of Dr. King not already said: he was a magnificent and nation-changing individual and just as important, if not more so, to this nation as the British Founding Fathers.  On the premis that "[f]reedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed[,]" this book argues the foundation of the social outlook of his movement and for a more natural worldview.  The arguments are based on what Dr. King knew: the Church Fathers (eg, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas), the US Constitution, and a realistic belief in people being equal in the sense of all being human and there being no subsets.  I wish every person in the world could read and fully understand this book.</span>

                    <span>Dr. King in this book, gives the background on the successful demonstrations in Birmingham and The  1963 March on Washington. (My father was at that march). Martin gives the insights on his Non -violent Direct Action approach and how it worked in Birmingham. He also explains what he meant in his I have a dream speech. Those who read this book will see that Dr. King favored a approach to bring African-Americans in the Mainstream that is similiar to Affirmative Action. Dr. King's mistakes were he assumed the whites in the North would favor his approach when he came to their neighborhood (Chicago 1966)and that those who favored ending segregation would support spending government money to help poor Blacks. All Americans should read this book.</span>

                    <span>I often wonder why we honor Martin Luther King with a holiday.  For those who wonder why, read this book.  In this book, King uses non violent techniques to force a change in the structure of race relations in this brutal city.  The sixties could have been such a violent time in America had it not been for Dr. King.<br>With his techniques, he changed the social landscape in the deep South for the better.  Why we can't wait is his reason why blacks should not tolerate a gradual change in race relations, but one that recognizes that change is needed as soon as possible.</span>
