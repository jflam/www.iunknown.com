                <span id="Label1"><I>"In October, near the end of the month, Cacciato left the war."</I><p>  In Tim O'Brien's novel <I>Going After Cacciato</I> the theater of war becomes the theater of the absurd as a private deserts his post in Vietnam, intent on walking 8,000 miles to Paris for the peace talks. The remaining members of his squad are sent after him, but what happens then is anybody's guess: "The facts were simple: They went after Cacciato, they chased him into the mountains, they tried hard. They cornered him on a small grassy hill. They surrounded the hill. They waited through the night. And at dawn they shot the sky full of flares and then they moved in.... That was the end of it. The last known fact. What remained were possibilities." <p>  It is these possibilities that make O'Brien's National Book Award-winning novel so extraordinary. Told from the perspective of squad member Paul Berlin, the search for Cacciato soon enters the realm of the surreal as the men find themselves following an elusive trail of chocolate M&M's through the jungles of Indochina, across India, Iran, Greece, and Yugoslavia to the streets of Paris. The details of this hallucinatory journey  alternate with feverish memories of the war--men maimed by landmines, killed in tunnels, engaged in casual acts of brutality that would be unthinkable anywhere else. Reminiscent of Joseph Heller's <I>Catch-22</I>, <I>Going After  Cacciato</I> dishes up a brilliant mix of ferocious comedy and bleak horror that serves to illuminate both the complex psychology of men in battle and the overarching insanity of war. <I>--Alix Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>Rather late in Tim O'Brien's "Going After Cacciato" we read, 
<br />
<br />"These were hard lessons, true, but they were lessons of ignorance: ignorant men, trite truths.  What remained was a simple event.  The facts, the physical things.  A war like any war.  No new messages.  Stories that began and ended without transition.  No developing drama or tension or direction.  No order." 
<br />
<br />One could picture O'Brien sitting at his typewriter (late at night and frustrated) knowing that men have encountered, thought about, written about, and been tortured and confused by war many times before, but yet still being compelled to write about it, but not really knowing what or how.  That there is nothing new to say, and no new way to say it, about something as old as time was clearly a difficult place to start for a writer.  Thus, of the myriad of purposes or possibilities of a novel, O' Brien's is to reckon with his experience, to give readers what is there, even if its coherence is not obvious.  And when the experience is war, there is ample confusion to reckon with. 
<br />
<br />At the center of "Going After Cacciato" is Paul Berlin, a grunt in Vietman, not exactly horrified, nor contemplative, nor heroic.  He could be, and probably was, any normal chap from any normal small American town.  Berlin, if anything, is passive, not really a protagonist, but the departure point of our observation, a portal to the war.  And it is from his patrol at an "observation post" that we witness many different slices or episodes of Berlin's experience. What is and isn't "real" in this experience is not quite clear, something the novel itself points out.  Only "possibilties" exist.  These possibilities make up, among other things, a trek on foot to Paris in pursuit of an AWOL comrade named Cacciato.  This takes them through India, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, among other places.  Our understanding of Berlin emerges as he is postioned in contrast to his fellow squad members.  These include the cocksure Oscar Johnson; Sidney Martin the man of order, rules and will power; Lieutenant Corson, the sympathetic martyr; and Sankin Aung Wan, a source of comfort, confidence, and a possible love interest. Along the way they, their search becomes a lot wider than for Cacciato. 
<br />
<br />Yet this novel is not about characters.  It seems best to read it while watching Berlin's shifting reality, from day-dream to battle, from observation to abstraction. I particularly enjoyed O'Brien's ability to juxtapose the things-as-they-are, raw, "hard observation" of war, with a philosophical inquiry into war as experienced.  While O'Brien might call his philosophizing trite, it certainly isn't.  He clearly grapples with fundemental questions that no doubt have been asked before (why don't men run?), but only because they are the real mysteries of our existence.  What the philosophizing is is refreshingly free from any high brow pretense, which is often used to obfuscate rather than engage essential problems and questions.  O'Brien's questions are real, from his own experience.  He doesn't need to dress them up.
<br /> 
<br />O'brien's method is not a literary game.  I really believe that him to be struggling with his experience, rather than using was as a template for literary wizardry. And when style flows from substance rather than being in search of it, the results are rewarding.  In "Going After Cacciato", part of the challenge of war is to recognize which of the endless possibilities actually materialized.   One thing that has materialized is a great book.</span>

                    <span>Going After Cacciato contains many elements of reality from the Vietnam War, in which the characters are set in this environment filled with death, loneliness, and war. O'Brien portrays this journey through forms of elaborate use of description in this novel. He describes the jungle setting and many other details of this mission so in detail that the reader is visualizing themselves pushing through the overgrowth in search of this so-called man, Cacciato. The novel Going After Cacciato portrays the division of the reality of war and the fantasy state of mind of the soldiers and is a good adventure through the cruelty and reality of war.</span>

                    <span>O'Brien's work "The Things They Carried" is one of my favorite novels. Therefore I was eager to read "Going After Cacciato". After reading the novel I found myself disappointed. I had hoped to read a work on par with "The Things They Carried" or possibly better. Unfortunately this was not the case. O' Brien is an exceptional author therefore the work is worth reading, however it does not live up to the standards I would expect O' Brien's work to reflect. 
<br /> 
<br />The work is successful in some areas.  O' Brien creates vivid scenes through his use of symbolism and surrealism. The novel illustrates the struggle inside oneself between dreams and reality and the difficulty one faces when trying to take an idea and build a future on it. The principle character and his journey after Cacciato lead the reader through various events that not only reveal many truths about war but about life as well. For these reasons the novel should be read, however the reader must not focus too greatly on the hype that surrounds the work.

                    <span>I'm a Junior in High School and recently had to read a short story by Tim O'Brien and enjoyed his writing, so I grabbed a copy of "Going After Cacciato" and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I am an avid reader and definitely couldn't put the book down. Even if you know nothing about war or Vietnam, I recommend you grab this book and snuggle up to a cozy place in your living room and let Tim O'Brien take you to a different time and place.</span>

                    <span>Personally, I found this book fun to read.  Centered around Paul Berlin, a soldier in Vietnam, him and the squad are ordered to retrieve an AWOL soldier named Cacciato, who gets the idea he wants to walk to Paris; which happens to be 8,000 miles.  
<br />
<br />O'Brien has a way of "painting the picture" for the reader.  For instance, six pages consist of detail about a quiet forest.  O'Brien likes to forshadow, and use flash backs as his literary devices.  
<br />
<br />Berlin, tired of the war, wants to escape using his imagination.  Him and the others, including Sarkin Aung Wan (Vietnamese "girlfriend"), like the idea of walking to Paris.  Through many trials and tribulations (inprisonment by the government because of no passports, ambushes, etc.), the team trecks on. Many times Cacciato is almost caught, but he sets numerous booby-traps to escape his hunters.
<br />
<br />  The story is a war-fiction.  It takes place in three parts: first is the war itself, Paris, and the Observation Post.  I would definetely reccomend reading this book.  I'm not going to ruin the ending, but Tim O'Brien is today's M. Night Shyamalan.</span>
