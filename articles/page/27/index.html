  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://www.biasecurities.com/blogs/jim/">Jim Geurts</a> emailed me to ask about my dev environment for Ruby. So I
created this blog entry to talk about what my setup is.</p>


	<p>I use both a Mac and a PC to do Ruby development. When I&#8217;m doing Rails
development, I often use my PowerBook. I spent a bunch of time preparing for
a cross-platform lifestyle by learning the emacs keybindings this
summer. So far it&#8217;s paid off since I&#8217;m quite comfortable in that
editor in both environments. I even hacked emacs to re-enable
ClearType support so that Consolas looks the way it was intended to
look.</p>


	<p>That said, there&#8217;s a lot of buzz around <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> as a dev
environment for Rails. It&#8217;s certainly all the rage with the rails-core
members. I&#8217;m going to consider spending some time in the near future
working with it as I rebuild our corporate web site using Rails.</p>


	<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m building my Ruby &lt;-&gt; <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge using
Windows. I&#8217;m still running <span class="caps">VS 2005</span> Beta 2 since a lot of my
applications have a dependency on WinFX which doesn&#8217;t yet work with
the <span class="caps">RTM</span> version of <span class="caps">VS 2005</span>. As soon as there&#8217;s a solid WinFX build
that lives on top of the Whidbey <span class="caps">RTM</span> bits I&#8217;m going to switch.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re a Windows dev and want to get Ruby and Rails up and running
as quickly as possible, I highly recommend <a href="http://blog.curthibbs.us/">Curt Hibbs</a> most excellent
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/instantrails/">Instant Rails</a> package. This package includes a preconfigured Apache,
Ruby, Rails, and MySQL configuration that lives in a single directory
tree.</p>


	<p>If you don&#8217;t care about Rails and only want to do Ruby work, then get
Curt&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">One Click Ruby Installer</a>.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;ll need some documentation as well &#8211; Curt bundles a .CHM file of
the first edition of the excellent Programming Ruby book (aka &#8220;The
PickAxe&#8221;) by Dave Thomas. I find that this is all that I need for my
day-to-day work in Ruby, even though I own a dead-trees version of the
2nd Edition of the PickAxe book. I would recommend getting the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html"><span class="caps">PDF</span>
version</a> of the book if you live a mobile laptop lifestyle like I do.</p>


	<p>If you want to explore Rails, then I would highly recommend Dave
Thomas and David Hansson&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development With
Rails</a> book. I purchased the <span class="caps">PDF</span> version so that I don&#8217;t have to lug
the book around with me.</p>


	<p>If Apple lives up to its commitment to not prevent Windows from
running on their next-generation Powerbooks, I&#8217;m going to switch to
Apple hardware full-time for both Windows and Ruby development. It
should be awesome to have a dual-core <span class="caps">CPU</span> laptop than can dual boot
both Vista and Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> by middle of next year.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>There are at least two other Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridges. There is the <a href="http://www.saltypickle.com/rubydotnet">Salty
Pickle bridge</a> written by John Pierce and Ben Schroeder, and there is another bridge
written by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubydotnet">Thomas Sondergaard</a>. These bridges heavily leverage the
existing <span class="caps">CLR</span> Reflection <span class="caps">API</span> and its dynamic method invocation
infrastructure.</p>


	<p>Because of this, these bridges are not particularly
efficient in either space or time. Reflective method invocation is a
very heavyweight operation, as <a href="http://www.saltypickle.com/RubyDotNet/20">these benchmarks</a> will bear
out. Furthermore, if value types are marshaled across the boundary,
these objects will be boxed and placed on the <span class="caps">CLR GC</span> heap, resulting
in an increase in memory pressure.</p>


	<p>Writing my own bridge lets me fix these problems, and it gave me an
excuse to study the Ruby extension interfaces and the <span class="caps">CLR V2</span>
lightweight code generation <span class="caps">API</span>. It also gave me an excuse to try out
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/slippman/">Stan Lippman&#8217;s</a> excellent work in fixing the Managed C++ syntax in
Whidbey.</p>


	<p>My bridge addresses method invocation performance by generating <span class="caps">CIL</span>
stubs on the fly using the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/80h6baz2.aspx">DynamicMethod</a> API in Whidbey. These
<span class="caps">CIL</span> stubs are directly bound to the Ruby object&#8217;s methods. So once
those <span class="caps">CIL</span> stubs have been JITed by the <span class="caps">CLR</span>, a method call from Ruby
goes <strong>directly</strong> into managed code. The only overhead is that incurred
by marshaling parameters from their Ruby representation to the
corresponding <span class="caps">CLR</span> representation.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>


	<p>From my comments, Anson Tsao mentioned a couple of other folks I should credit for the MC++ syntax:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>There are a couple of other folks you should credit for the C++/CLI design. <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/">Herb Sutter</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/branbray/">Brandon Bray</a>. Herb was responsible for much of the syntax innovations such as context sensitive keywords (ref class), and Brandon was responsible for writing the language specification and probably knows more about language design details than anyone else.</p>

    <abbr class="published" title="2005-10-31T07:00:00-08:00"><span class="typo_date" title="Mon, 31 Oct 2005 15:00:00 GMT">Mon, 31 Oct 2005 15:00:00 GMT</span></abbr>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Do databases rot the mind? Charles Petzold&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">post about Visual
Studio</a>
triggered this thought in the back of my mind.</p>


	<p>All too often when confronted with a &#8220;business&#8221; problem I, like many
other people I know, wind up reaching for my trusty database. Or, in a
more common scenario, someone hands you an existing schema and says
&#8220;solve my problem&#8221; using it. The reality, however, is that
relational databases are a lousy solution to many problems that we
commonly run across. In a recent e-commerce platform that I created
there was a 7-way join that had to be executed just to retrieve a list
of products to display to a customer. We did <span class="caps">LOTS</span> of performance
tuning of that database and our queries to make it go about as fast as
it could reasonably be expected to go under <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server.</p>


	<p>Just this week, I decided to do an experiment. I reimplemented the
core of our e-commerce platform by loading the entire database into a
custom in-memory data structure. It took me about 1 hour to write the
code to load the core tables into my custom data structure, and about
an additional 15 hours to tune the data structure and refactor the
code to my liking. Oh yeah, I wrote it using Ruby.</p>


	<p>My app was 201 lines of Ruby code (including liberal use of blank
lines to enhance readability). For sake of comparison, just one of the
dynamically generated <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries that it replaced was in the order of
150+ lines of <span class="caps">SQL</span>. And that, of course, doesn&#8217;t count all of the lines
of C# code required to generate, execute, and parse the results of the
<span class="caps">SQL</span> query.</p>


	<p>One more thing: it also ran <strong>100x</strong> faster.</p>


	<p>A bit of history: the original application that I inherited was on
the order of 20,000 lines of <span class="caps">SQL</span> + C#. This was largely due to an
enormous amount of duplication of code due to the (ab)use of stored
procedures to handle queries. My rewrite of that application trimmed
it down to 4000 lines of <span class="caps">SQL</span> + C#. My Ruby application, while not at
feature parity with the existing application, solved essentially all
of the &#8220;hard&#8221; problems. I would estimate that it duplicates &gt;80%
of the functionality of the real application.</p>


	<p>The first version of the code was about 5x faster than the original
application. I then spent some time looking for optimizations. When
you only have about 100 lines of code to look through, optimizations
become pretty obvious. I was able to cache the results of a
(relatively) expensive O(M+N) algorithm that sat on the
rate-determining-step of the computation. This netted me a 20x
speedup. This optimization is simply not possible using <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server,
but is dead-simple when you get to implement your own query engine.</p>


	<p>I <em>love</em> the symmetry of my results: 1/100th the code and 100x the performance. It&#8217;s also much easier to maintain 200 lines of code than 20,000 lines of code. Testing was also much more straightforward.</p>


	<p>Now the code that I rewrote was tailor-made for this kind of
rewrite. It was a read-only database that was relatively (&lt; 1GB) small in
size. If you have such an application lying around &#8211; try rewriting it
using in-memory data structures. If you&#8217;re a bit more adventurous, try
using a dynamically typed language to do this (might I suggest
Ruby?). You just might be surprised by the outcome and come away with
a new technique in your toolbox by doing so.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~gjs/gjs.html">Gerald Sussman&#8217;s</a> talk at <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span> was tied to one of the themes of this year&#8217;s conference: poetry, the arts, and their relationship to software. He talked about code that is prose, and code that is poetry. He showed us some examples of prose that he wrote: some C code that controlled the servos of a large radio telescope array in Chile. He also showed us some code that is poetry: the two-page implementation of <code>eval</code> in Lisp.</p>


	<p>He also talked about how writing programs can help improve the way you think. One example came from a first-year graduate level course in <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~gjs/6946/index.html">Classical Mechanics at <span class="caps">MIT</span></a>. In this course, he gets his students to write Scheme code to describe certain equations. The students found that they understood the equations far better when asked to reformulate them using a computer language instead of mathematical notation. There was also the added side effect that they could now perform computations using their equations.</p>


	<p>Gerald Sussman comes across as a geeky version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders">Deion Sanders</a>. Deion Sanders was great and he wanted to remind you of it when he spoke. Similarly, Sussman is great and he reminds you of that fact when he speaks as well. Some people find this kind of grand standing offensive. Others, like myself, find nothing wrong with this &#8211; if you can talk the talk <strong>and</strong> walk the walk then that&#8217;s fine by me.</p>

    <p>Building a native Ruby implementation on the <span class="caps">CLR</span> is an ambitious
goal. <a href="http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~gough/">John Gough</a> and associates are attempting to do exactly this in
their Ruby.NET project. This is a much harder problem than it looks,
and kudos to John for even attempting it. The semantics of Ruby are
significantly different than other <span class="caps">CLR</span> languages.</p>


	<p>As a simple example, consider the fact that Ruby does not allow method
overloading. How would you construct a Ruby type that must override
methods in an abstract base class that differ only based on their
signatures?</p>


	<p>Another example is the case where you want to surface <span class="caps">CLR</span> features
natively in Ruby. How, for example, will you declare a generic array
in a language that does not support type declarations?</p>


	<p>Last but certainly not least are the sophisticated features
in Ruby such as continuations that make it very challenging for an
implementor to implement efficiently. This feature requires a stack
copying mechanism that isn&#8217;t a native feature of the <span class="caps">CLR</span>. Can such a
feature be added to the <span class="caps">CLR</span> without compromising the performance of
existing languages? This is not clear, and was one of the topics that
came up for discussion during the <a href="http://decomp.ulb.ac.be:8082/events/dls05/implementingdynamiclanguagesonthe.netclr/">dynamic languages <span class="caps">BOF</span> at <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span></a>.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been building a bridge from Ruby to the <span class="caps">CLR</span> in my spare
time. It&#8217;s a complicated piece of software, and I plan on explaining
how I created it in a series of posts on this blog. At the time of
this writing, I can consume <span class="caps">CLR</span> objects from Ruby scripts <strong>and</strong>
implement event handlers in Ruby scripts. The Ruby language can make
it possible for people to create applications that would be more
difficult and take more time using C# or VB.NET. The Ruby language has
certainly changed the way I think while writing code; I hope to bring
that power to people writing .NET code today. Here&#8217;s a teaser:</p>


<pre><code>
require   'RubyShim'
reference 'System.Windows.Forms'

include System::Drawing
include System::Windows::Forms

f               = Form.new
f.Text          = 'My Form'
f.AllowDrop     = true 
f.SuspendLayout

label1          = Label.new
label1.Location = Point.new(40, 32)
label1.Width    = 200
label1.Text     = 'My Label'

button1          = Button.new
button1.Name     = "MyButton" 
button1.Location = Point.new(40, 57)
button1.Text     = 'Click me'

button1.Click do |sender, args|
  p = sender.Location
  label1.Text = "clicked on #{sender.Name} at #{p.X}, #{p.Y}" 
end

f.Controls.Add(label1)
f.Controls.Add(button1)
f.ResumeLayout

Application.Run(f)
</code></pre>

	<p>This will be an open-source project, and will be redistributed under
an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"><span class="caps">MIT</span>-style license</a>. I have not yet released the source code since it is largely proof-of-concept code at this time. If anyone
really wants to take a look at it right now, just send me <a href="jlam@iunknown.com">an
email</a> and I&#8217;l be more than happy to share.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This year, I was fortunate enough to attend both <a href="http://www.rubyconf.com">RubyConf</a> and <a href="http://www.oopsla.org"><span class="caps">OOPSLA</span></a>. These conferences exposed me to many new ideas and lots of new people. If you&#8217;re used to living in the Microsoft (or Java, or <span class="caps">PHP</span>, or Linux, or Apple &#8230;) world, it&#8217;s a <strong>really</strong> good idea to break out of your monoculture and experience something different.</p>


	<p>For the Microsoft folks, instead of attending a <span class="caps">PDC</span>, Tech Ed, VS Live!, or DevConnections conference every year, choose to attend a different conference with your conference dollars. Attend a RubyConf or a <a href="http://www.jaoo.org"><span class="caps">JAOO</span></a> or an <a href="conferences.oreillynet.com/oscon/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a>. <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> is hot this year, but something else will be hot next year.</p>


	<p>For me personally, I&#8217;ve spent way too long in the statically typed languages world. Last year at the <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/middleware2004/">Middleware</a> conference in Toronto, <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/">Steve Vinoski</a> and I had a great bonding moment when we recounted our recent experiences with <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. At <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span>, I had a chance to chat with some old-school <a href="http://www.squeak.org">Smalltalk</a> programmers (hello Jim!) who were more than happy to point out that most &#8220;new&#8221; language features in Python/Ruby were in existence long ago in Smalltalk. The same, of course, can be said for languages like C# as well :)</p>


	<p>That said, it&#8217;s still important to use the right tool for the job. The libraries in the .NET world are simply too useful to be ignored. Bridging this gap is an itch I have to scratch. More on that soon.</p>

    <p>Wow. It&#8217;s been busy. I finally got some time recently to restart this blog, and my first order of business was migrating to a new blog engine &#8211; <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a>. Typo is a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> powered blog engine.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to be posting much more regularly to this new blog. I plan on adopting the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen</a> like approach to publishing at least one new post each day. One of my first things to do is hack an article queue into the Typo engine.</p>
