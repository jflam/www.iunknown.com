    <p>One of the nice things that you get from putting up with the giant hassle of moving is an opportunity to simplify your life. I just finished packing up all of my &#8216;non-essential&#8217; computer gear. It&#8217;s remarkable how cathartic the experience was. I have a single computer running in the house right now (my MacBook Pro).</p> <p>I had a couple of servers running downstairs with a ridiculously complex networking setup involving multiple wireless access points, switches and firewalls. I&#8217;m down to a single <span class="caps">WRT</span>-54G access point running my wireless network, and I&#8217;m typing this thing on my Mac. I brought my Samsung ML-2150 laser printer up from the basement where it has lived for the past 2.5 years and will plug it into my Mac whenever I need to print (lots of last minute scanning / printing / emailing to do before we go). When I get to Seattle, I doubt that I&#8217;ll miss those servers one bit, as they&#8217;re going into storage while we figure out where we&#8217;re going to live.</p> <p>We&#8217;ll be moving into furnished&nbsp;temporary housing when we get to Seattle. All of the rest of our stuff will go into storage, only to re-emerge when we figure out where we&#8217;re going to live. So we&#8217;ll live for several months with nothing more than what we bring with us on the plane, and a couple of boxes of stuff that we&#8217;re going to ship to ourselves via <span class="caps">UPS</span>. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to see how little of our stuff we really need to live &#8211; <strong>especially</strong> the technology stuff.</p>

    <p>Almost all of my attention has been focused on our upcoming move to Redmond. As I mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s easily the most complicated thing that I&#8217;ve had to organize in my life. We&#8217;re in the end game now, and it&#8217;s&nbsp;feeling like it might actually happen!</p> <p>I&#8217;m finishing up a consulting project at <a href="http://www.husky.ca">Husky Injection Molding Systems</a>. These guys create the machines that make a lot of the plastic goods that we consume &#8211; ranging from pop bottles to laundry baskets. The guys that I work with are professional robot programmers &#8211; and they&#8217;re all over Microsoft&#8217;s recent annoucement of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/">Microsoft Robotics Studio</a>. </p> <p>Industrial robots are optimized for performance, and aren&#8217;t particularly intelligent &#8211; it&#8217;s all about maximizing efficiency in the production of the goods. And while I didn&#8217;t do any robotics programming myself, I&#8217;m amazed by what they can accomplish given the lack of sophistication in the tools that they use to program these things. Some decent tools would go a long ways in improving the lives of robotics programmers &#8211; and perhaps Robotics Studio is a step in the right direction.</p> <p>Jamie Cansdale is organizing a charity auction to raise money for a safe drinking water and irrigation project in Malawi. There&#8217;s lots of useful software that was graciously donated by various companies (and Jamie himself), so make sure you <a href="net-developer-software-charity-auction.aspx">drop by his blog to take a look.</a></p> <p>Finally, I decided to give <a href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1&nbsp;a">Windows Live Writer</a> spin, and am using it to post this blog entry. I was amazed by how seamless the setup experience was for my <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo-powered</a> blog. I simply entered my blog&#8217;s <span class="caps">URL</span>, and the username and password that I use to administer my blog. It auto-configured everything else. Color me impressed.</p>

    <p>I barely have enough time to sleep these days as the clock ticks down on our time here in Canada. We&#8217;re living in a state of perpetual cleanliness while we wait for our house to sell. I&#8217;m telling you &#8211; this is no way to live! There are an insane number of details involved with the move &#8211; from figuring out how to get our dog there (there&#8217;s a travel blackout for dogs on Air Canada over the holidays!) to the tax implications of the move itself. Not to mention doing all of those little things like opening a bank account, getting a social security number and a credit card and figuring out how to forward our mail to another country.</p>


	<p>At least the core details: where we&#8217;re going to initially live, how our stuff will get there, and who&#8217;s paying for all that stuff is taken care of by Microsoft. I&#8217;ve got a whole new level of respect for how difficult it must have been for my parents to move themselves (and me) to Canada all those years ago.</p>


	<p>Hopefully someday soon I&#8217;ll be able to get back to work on RubyCLR.</p>


	<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve been listening to a lecture series on my 100 mile daily commute to work. It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.longnow.org">Long Now</a> and there are many invited lectures on topics that require a long-term outlook (and by long-term, we&#8217;re talking centuries). It&#8217;s somewhat dark at times &#8211; theytackle difficult topics like depopulation and the environment, but there&#8217;s more than a glimmer of hope in all of it. Highly recommended, and a welcome break from just thinking about technology all the time.</p>

    <p>I was quite depressed listening to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> talk about Unicode and Ruby at RubyConf. While Tim did a wonderful job at explaining the problems, he didn&#8217;t really provide much in the way of a solution. Which is why I was quite happy when I read Julian Tarkhanov&#8217;s <a href=":http://www.fngtps.com/files/2/2006/06/rstm01-unicode_in_rails.pdf">slide deck</a> from his Unicode presentation at the <a href="http://www.fngtps.com/2006/05/rails-show-and-tell-meeting">Rails Show and Tell meeting in Amerstam</a> where he introduces his <a href="http://julik.textdriven.com/svn/tools/rails_plugins/unicode_hacks/">Unicode hacks</a> libraries.</p>


	<p>I really like his idea about using an accessor proxy on <code>String</code>:</p>


<pre><code>
name = 'Claus Müller'
puts name.reverse #=&gt; rell??M sualC
name.length #=&gt; 13

puts name.chars.reverse #=&gt; rellüM sualC
name.chars.length #=&gt; 12
</code></pre>

	<p>Notice how accessing the same string via the <code>chars</code> accessor correctly reverses the German string.</p>

    <p>This was a <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> to remember.

RubyConf this year was in Denver, and we even got a nice dusting of snow!</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve decided to stage a friendly takeover of Microsoft. As of January, 2007 my new work address will be Building 42 at Microsoft. I&#8217;ll be working in the <span class="caps">CLR</span> team to help bring the love of dynamic languages out to the statically typed heathens :)</p>


	<p>This all started back in August when I was dragged into various back rooms at <span class="caps">OSCON</span> and Lang.Net and presented with an offer that I could not refuse. At some point in your life, you realize that you have an opportunity to affect some real change in the world. <a href="http://www.rubyclr.com">RubyCLR</a> was one way to affect that change, and thanks to the gracious support of my partners Barry Gervin, Dave Lloyd, and Bruce Johnson over at <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com">ObjectSharp</a>, I was able to give folks a glimpse of what is possible. Thank you all for your generosity and your friendship.</p>


	<p>However, my platform and reach at ObjectSharp is limited. We&#8217;re a consulting company and while we do use Ruby to deliver value to our customers, it&#8217;s literally one developer at a time (hi Andrew!) It&#8217;s a whole other thing to work at a platform company whose reach extends out to millions of developers. That&#8217;s a remarkable opportunity, and a unique privilege.</p>


	<p>This is why I&#8217;m uprooting my family and moving all the way across the continent and to a different country. The timing is right since our kids are young enough that they won&#8217;t even notice (I was the same age as Matthew when I moved to Canada from Hong Kong). A big public thank-you to my wife, Carolyn, who has supported me since day one. I love you.</p>


	<p>So, now begins the next phase of my life. I know that some of you have questions, but I&#8217;m somewhat limited in what I can say about what comes next. I hope you can understand if my answers are somewhat evasive or vague. I merely ask for your patience as all will become apparent in due time. It really will. I wouldn&#8217;t have put my family on a one-way flight to Seattle if that weren&#8217;t the case &#8230;</p>


	<p>What&#8217;s going to happen to RubyCLR? It&#8217;s in reasonably good shape now, and I&#8217;m actively looking for people to help drive that project. There is still a couple of months before I start at Microsoft, so please contact me if you&#8217;re interested in helping out. The source code is released under the <span class="caps">MIT</span> license, so you are free to do with it as you wish if you don&#8217;t like the direction the project is taking.</p>


	<p>What am I going to do once I get to Microsoft? This is the part where I&#8217;m going to have to be evasive and vague. I can tell you what I&#8217;m not going to be doing: I&#8217;m not going to stop blogging, I&#8217;m not going to leave the Ruby community, and I&#8217;m not going to do evil things. I see my mission at Microsoft as helping to make developers happier; to give them tools that make programming fun. That&#8217;s why I program-I enjoy programming. I like to use tools that put a smile on my face. Perhaps what I&#8217;ll be making at Microsoft will put a smile on your face too. Just be patient &#8230;</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re at <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> this weekend and you&#8217;d like to talk in person about my move, make sure you come over to say hi. I&#8217;m the guy with the giant camera in the front row.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>There will be lots of exciting things happening at <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> this week. A few folks who are working on alternate Ruby implementations (JRuby, Ruby.NET, Sydney) will be at the conference, so we&#8217;ll have a chance to get together to swap some notes.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m still figuring out the story that I&#8217;ll be telling in my <a href="http://rubyconf.org/agenda_detail.html#you">You got your Ruby in my <span class="caps">CLR</span>!</a> talk. Right now the story focuses on how to get things done, both from my perspective as the implementor of RubyCLR, as well as from the perspective of developers who are using RubyCLR. I think that&#8217;s a good spine for the story &#8211; it lets me hang a lot of interesting ideas off of it.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why all of the radio silence, I&#8217;ve been <strong>really</strong> busy at a new consulting gig here in Toronto, which involves a long 2 hour commute. That barely leaves me enough time to answer email these days when I get back from the office. Hopefully things will ease up soon so that I can start putting some cycles back into RubyCLR.</p>
