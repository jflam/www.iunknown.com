<p>I used to have a chunk of code that looked like:</p>


<pre><code>
def new_clrobj(ctor_info, sig = null)
  sig = ctor_info.signature if sig == null
  newobj   "#{ctor_info.clr_type}(" + sig.join(',') + ')'
end
</code></pre>

	<p>It now looks like:</p>


<pre><code>
def new_clrobj(ctor_info, sig = ctor_info.signature)
  newobj   "#{ctor_info.clr_type}(" + sig.join(',') + ')'
end
</code></pre>

	<p>It was one of those &#8220;it just works&#8221; moments that makes me love this language.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve posted about Matthew:</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23649168@N00/84578490/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/84578490_119d64f19d.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>He&#8217;s almost 28 months old now, and he&#8217;s starting his new pre-school on Wednesday. He&#8217;s a pretty bright boy; he can read fairly elementary books completely on his own, and his vocabulary is growing by leaps and bounds. He was impressing his new pre-school teachers today by doing a &#8220;reverse&#8221; flash-card trick &#8211; that is predicting the letter on the other side (these were the simple alphabet flashcards that have a picture on one side and a single letter on the other side) based on the picture. I guess all of Daddy&#8217;s hard work creating his birthday present paid off! :)</p>


	<p>We got Matthew his first computer for Christmas this year. Well, it was really just one of Daddy&#8217;s older computers brought back to life with a <span class="caps">PCI 802</span>.11g wireless card. I was amazed by how quickly he learned how to use the mouse &#8211; it took <em>maybe</em> 2 days before he had it figured out. The hard part of course, is the fixed length of the cord, so you have to pick up the mouse or move it faster to get to where you want to go. We&#8217;re not using a wireless mouse so that the mouse doesn&#8217;t wander away.</p>


	<p>He figured out the Start button pretty quickly, so I had to lock down the options there (although he is running under a normal user account &#8211; no admin privileges quite yet :). He also figured out how to start Explorer without any options present under the Start menu, and today he demonstrated his virtuosity with drop-down combo boxes &#8211; I caught him browsing the <span class="caps">DVD</span> drive today.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;re working on typing skills next &#8211; Textpad appears to be his editor of choice right now. I think it will take some time before his hands get big enough to start using emacs :)</p>

<p><a href="http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2005/12/30/32204.aspx">Sam Gentile</a> was wondering about where Ruby is used in the &#8216;real world&#8217;, and where I&#8217;ve personally used Ruby.</p>


	<p>Sam, you can easily Google around to see where Ruby is being used in the real world. Check out the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails web site</a> for some pointers to some large web sites that are running on Rails.</p>


	<p>As for where I&#8217;ve personally used Ruby and Rails, we wrote a lot of Ruby code for my last customer. The product hasn&#8217;t been announced yet, so I still can&#8217;t talk about it, but suffice to say that it&#8217;s a high performance e-commerce web service with two very large customers running on top of it (and many more to come).</p>


	<p>We used Ruby to automate deploying the web service to our cluster. Ruby&#8217;s integration with <span class="caps">COM</span> made writing the <span class="caps">ADSI </span>+ WMI goo much more pleasant. I even toyed with rewriting the core web service (which is a .NET web service) in Ruby and was able to exploit an optimization that simply was not possible using .NET and <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server. There was an intermediate result set that could easily be cached in-memory using Ruby that wuold net us at least a 10X performance increase over the existing .NET application.</p>


	<p>To be fair, I could have done the same optimization using C#, but there would be no way that I could squeeze it down into 200 lines of very concise Ruby code. The other qualitative difference is that the caching optimization was just <strong>really obvious</strong> in the Ruby code; there was just so few lines of code to look at.</p>


	<p>We also built out a Rails web site to support the <span class="caps">API</span>. Developers using the web service could run live queries against our catalog using the site. The web site would also generate the application code for them in their programming language of choice: C#, VB.NET, Java or raw <span class="caps">SOAP</span> calls. It&#8217;s very similar in spirit to the <a href="http://www.awszone.com/">AWS Zone</a> site (even though I&#8217;m convinced that we have a much simpler query <span class="caps">API</span> than Amazon does).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m convinced that Ruby and meta-programming is a great way to approach modeling business applications. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m investing so much time building my <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2005/12/14/hello-rubyclr">Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge</a>.</p>

<p>A <strong>big</strong> thanks to everyone who sent along their best wishes to us!</p>


	<p>Carolyn made it out of the hospital much quicker (24 hours) than the last time around. She&#8217;s also feeling much stronger than she did after Matthew&#8217;s birth.</p>


	<p>Fortunately, since Ben&#8217;s birthday is so close to Christmas, we&#8217;ve got a house full of family to help us out as we adjust to having a toddler, a baby, a dog (and four other adults!) under the same roof.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here&#8217;s a photo of Ben that I made this afternoon:</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I&#8217;m addicted to <a href="http://www.redflagdeals.com">Red Flag Deals</a>. Thanks to their forums, I&#8217;ve gotten more than my fair share of good deals. One deal that I thought I&#8217;d pass along here is <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> hosting package for only $22 <span class="caps">USD</span> for the first year on a new registration.</p>


	<p>This is an <em>insanely</em> good deal. With that you get a free year&#8217;s registration on a domain name of your choice, 4.8GB disk space, and 120GB / month transfer. You can create shell accounts, host an unlimited number of MySQL databases, and of course run <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> web sites as well.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the <a href="http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=230288">original deal page</a> on  RedFlagDeals so that the props can go out to the appropriate folks.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2005/12/17/clr-object-lifetime">CLR object lifetime</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Sat, 17 Dec 2005 21:55:00 GMT">Sat, 17 Dec 2005 21:55:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>My Ruby <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge works by creating, on the fly, small <span class="caps">CIL</span> shims that invoke the appropriate method(s) on a <span class="caps">CLR</span> object. Today I want to talk about how I manage the lifetimes of those <span class="caps">CIL</span> shims.</p>


	<p>When you execute some code like <code>a = ArrayList.new</code> for the first time, I construct a new <code>ArrayList</code> Ruby class object on the fly. When you execute a method on a class instance such as <code>a.Sort</code>, I construct a <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim that knows how to invoke the <code>Sort</code> method on the <code>ArrayList</code> object. That <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is bound to the Ruby class object via a call to <code>rb_define_method</code>.</p>


	<p>The <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is created using the <code>DynamicMethod</code> API in <span class="caps">CLR 2</span>.0. After I finish defining the body of the dynamic method using my <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> API, I construct a delegate object that represents that method. These delegate objects are eligible for garbage collection, which means that I need to keep a reference to them. Now, when I said that the <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is bound to the Ruby class object, Ruby only knows about the function pointer to the delegate object that represents the <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim. That function pointer is only a <em>weak reference</em> to the delegate, which means that it cannot keep the delegate object from being collected by the <span class="caps">CLR GC</span>.</p>


	<p>To work around this problem, I&#8217;ve added a <code>List&lt;Delegate&gt;</code> object to the Ruby class object. Its job is to hold onto references to all of the dynamically created <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim delegate objects <em>for that class</em>. When the Ruby class object is garbage collected by <em>Ruby&#8217;s GC</em>, my automagical object reference cleanup code will <code>Free</code> the <code>GCHandle</code> object that I use to keep a reference to the <code>List&lt;Delegate&gt;</code> object.</p>


	<p>I actually had a far more complicated and convoluted mechanism for dealing with this problem in my initial implementation of the bridge. I&#8217;m much happier with the simplicity of this approach in V2.</p>

<p>I just figured out what Ruby was doing, because I forgot just how &#8220;meta&#8221; my programming was. Consider this code frag:</p>


<pre><code>
def const_missing(symbol)
  alias_const_missing(symbol) unless symbol == :ArrayList

  obj = create_clr_class_object
  # remember that the code below is in a string
  obj.class_eval %{
    def initialize(*params)
      create_safe_ruby_instance_method(
        self.class, 'initialize') do
        include     'System.Collections'
        declare     "#{symbol}", :obj
        ...
</code></pre>

	<p>Look at the last line of code and the <code>declare</code> statement. Notice how I&#8217;m referencing the <code>symbol</code> variable that is the input parameter to the <code>const_missing</code> method declaration on the first line? I have to escape that reference as a string to access that variable. Why? Because that code is embedded in a string (that&#8217;s what the funny <code>%{</code> means: it&#8217;s a begin string quotation symbol).</p>


	<p>Now this has interesting implications for other string manipulation functions that are inside of the <em>string</em> that is passed to <code>obj.class_eval</code>. For example consider this snippet of code.</p>


<pre><code>
sigs          = get_constructor_signatures("#{symbol}")
switch_labels = (1..sigs.length).collect { |i| ("l" + i.to_s).to_sym }
</code></pre>

	<p>I <em>really</em> wanted to write the string expression as:</p>


	<p><code>"l#{i}".to_sym</code></p>


	<p>But this cannot work since it would try and find an <code>i</code> variable defined in the enclosing method. So I wound up writing it in the somewhat more verbose way that I did to make it work. I wound up scratching my head about this behavior for quite a while before I realized that, doh! the code was executing <em>inside of a string</em>.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s how powerful Ruby&#8217;s metaprogramming facilities are: oftentimes you forget that you&#8217;re really programming at a meta level of abstraction instead of at the &#8220;concrete&#8221; level.</p>
