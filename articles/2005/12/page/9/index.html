<p>A <strong>big</strong> thanks to everyone who sent along their best wishes to us!</p>


	<p>Carolyn made it out of the hospital much quicker (24 hours) than the last time around. She&#8217;s also feeling much stronger than she did after Matthew&#8217;s birth.</p>


	<p>Fortunately, since Ben&#8217;s birthday is so close to Christmas, we&#8217;ve got a house full of family to help us out as we adjust to having a toddler, a baby, a dog (and four other adults!) under the same roof.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here&#8217;s a photo of Ben that I made this afternoon:</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I&#8217;m addicted to <a href="http://www.redflagdeals.com">Red Flag Deals</a>. Thanks to their forums, I&#8217;ve gotten more than my fair share of good deals.

	<p>This is an <em>insanely</em> good deal. With that you get a free year&#8217;s registration on a domain name of your choice, 4.8GB disk space, and 120GB / month transfer.

  <h2><a href="/articles/2005/12/17/clr-object-lifetime">CLR object lifetime</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Sat, 17 Dec 2005 21:55:00 GMT">Sat, 17 Dec 2005 21:55:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>My Ruby <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge works by creating, on the fly, small <span class="caps">CIL</span> shims that invoke the appropriate method(s) on a <span class="caps">CLR</span> object. Today I want to talk about how I manage the lifetimes of those <span class="caps">CIL</span> shims.</p>


	<p>When you execute some code like <code>a = ArrayList.new</code> for the first time, I construct a new <code>ArrayList</code> Ruby class object on the fly. When you execute a method on a class instance such as <code>a.Sort</code>, I construct a <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim that knows how to invoke the <code>Sort</code> method on the <code>ArrayList</code> object. That <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is bound to the Ruby class object via a call to <code>rb_define_method</code>.</p>


	<p>The <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is created using the <code>DynamicMethod</code> API in <span class="caps">CLR 2</span>.0. After I finish defining the body of the dynamic method using my <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> API, I construct a delegate object that represents that method. These delegate objects are eligible for garbage collection, which means that I need to keep a reference to them. Now, when I said that the <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is bound to the Ruby class object, Ruby only knows about the function pointer to the delegate object that represents the <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim. That function pointer is only a <em>weak reference</em> to the delegate, which means that it cannot keep the delegate object from being collected by the <span class="caps">CLR GC</span>.</p>


	<p>To work around this problem, I&#8217;ve added a <code>List&lt;Delegate&gt;</code> object to the Ruby class object. Its job is to hold onto references to all of the dynamically created <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim delegate objects <em>for that class</em>. When the Ruby class object is garbage collected by <em>Ruby&#8217;s GC</em>, my automagical object reference cleanup code will <code>Free</code> the <code>GCHandle</code> object that I use to keep a reference to the <code>List&lt;Delegate&gt;</code> object.</p>


	<p>I actually had a far more complicated and convoluted mechanism for dealing with this problem in my initial implementation of the bridge. I&#8217;m much happier with the simplicity of this approach in V2.</p>

<p>I just figured out what Ruby was doing, because I forgot just how &#8220;meta&#8221; my programming was. Consider this code frag:</p>


<pre><code>
def const_missing(symbol)
  alias_const_missing(symbol) unless symbol == :ArrayList

  obj = create_clr_class_object
  # remember that the code below is in a string
  obj.class_eval %{
    def initialize(*params)
      create_safe_ruby_instance_method(
        self.class, 'initialize') do
        include     'System.Collections'
        declare     "#{symbol}", :obj
        ...
</code></pre>

	<p>Look at the last line of code and the <code>declare</code> statement. Notice how I&#8217;m referencing the <code>symbol</code> variable that is the input parameter to the <code>const_missing</code> method declaration on the first line? I have to escape that reference as a string to access that variable. Why? Because that code is embedded in a string (that&#8217;s what the funny <code>%{</code> means: it&#8217;s a begin string quotation symbol).</p>


	<p>Now this has interesting implications for other string manipulation functions that are inside of the <em>string</em> that is passed to <code>obj.class_eval</code>. For example consider this snippet of code.</p>


<pre><code>
sigs          = get_constructor_signatures("#{symbol}")
switch_labels = (1..sigs.length).collect { |i| ("l" + i.to_s).to_sym }
</code></pre>

	<p>I <em>really</em> wanted to write the string expression as:</p>


	<p><code>"l#{i}".to_sym</code></p>


	<p>But this cannot work since it would try and find an <code>i</code> variable defined in the enclosing method. So I wound up writing it in the somewhat more verbose way that I did to make it work. I wound up scratching my head about this behavior for quite a while before I realized that, doh! the code was executing <em>inside of a string</em>.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s how powerful Ruby&#8217;s metaprogramming facilities are: oftentimes you forget that you&#8217;re really programming at a meta level of abstraction instead of at the &#8220;concrete&#8221; level.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2005/12/15/refactoring-cil">Refactoring CIL</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Thu, 15 Dec 2005 22:33:00 GMT">Thu, 15 Dec 2005 22:33:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>I had a great day today. I had one of those a-ha experiences where you get to benefit from an earlier decision in ways that you did not expect. I started down the path of generating constructor shims using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code>. I completed my first spike yesterday, when I successfully constructed <code>ArrayList</code> objects using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code>.</p>


	<p>Today, I wanted to make a slightly more generic constructor shim that would let me call both a default and a single argument constructor: <code>ArrayList()</code> and <code>ArrayList(Int32)</code>. While I was writing this code, I began to feel some <span class="caps">CIL</span> pain (it is, after all <strong>assembly language</strong>). So I did what came naturally: I began to refactor the code.</p>


	<p>This reminds me of the talk that I saw this year at <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span> where Ward Cunningham was refactoring assembly language using IntelliJ. In my case, I refactored <span class="caps">CIL</span> using emacs :) Here&#8217;s the end result:</p>


<pre><code>
def initialize(*params)
  create_ruby_instance_method(self.class, 'initialize') do
    include     'System.Collections'
    declare     "#{symbol}", :obj
    ldarg_0
    switch      [:zero_param, :one_param]
    br_s        :end_switch
    label       :zero_param
    newobj      '#{symbol}()'
    stloc_s     :obj
    br_s        :end_switch
    label       :one_param
    ld_rb_param 0, 'Int32'
    newobj      '#{symbol}(Int32)'
    stloc_s     :obj
    label       :end_switch
    ret_objref  :obj
  end
  initialize(*params)
end
</code></pre>

	<p>While this is mostly <span class="caps">CIL</span>, it also contains a number of macros and fun Ruby string stuff. The macros that I used are: <code>ld_rb_param</code>, <code>ret_objref</code>. As it turns out, these will be very common code fragments that will be used throughout the bridge. Writing those macros was even easier. Here&#8217;s a sample:</p>


<pre><code>
module RbDynamicMethodHelpers
  def ld_self
    ldarg_2
  end

  def ld_rb_param(index, type)
    ldarg_1
    case index
    when 1:
      ldc_i4_4
      add
    when 2:
      ldc_i4_8
      add
    else
      ldc_i4    index &lt;&lt; 2
      add
    end
    ldind_i4
    call      "static Marshal::To#{type}(VALUE)" 
  end

  def ret_objref(local_variable_name)
    ld_self
    ldloc_s  local_variable_name
    call     'static Marshal::AssignToClassInstance(VALUE, Object)'
    ret
  end
end
</pre></code>

	<p>It turned out it was a good thing that I left the method declarations as strings, since I could do some simple string manipulation to inject implement syntactic sugar methods such as <code>ld_rb_param</code> (which is actually a very efficient <span class="caps">CIL</span> implementation that is optimized for the common cases).</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, how much extra code did I have to add to <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to enable macros? I changed:</p>


	<p><code>object.extend RbDynamicMethod</code></p>


	<p>to:</p>


	<p><code>object.extend RbDynamicMethod, RbDynamicMethodHelpers</code></p>


	<p>Did I mention how much I love Ruby? :)</p>

<p>I spent most of yesterday and today hacking out the first spike of the Ruby rewrite of my original Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge. I wound up adding some additional code to <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to support some scenarios that I didn&#8217;t envision (nothing like having a &#8216;customer&#8217; to reveal deficiencies in an <span class="caps">API</span>!). I also spent a <strong>lot</strong> of time learning about how objects are constructed in Ruby. Here&#8217;s a very simplified explanation of Ruby&#8217;s object model; for a complete description, see Chapter 24 of Dave Thomas&#8217; excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514055/ref=nosim/iunknowncom-20">Programming Ruby</a>.</p>


	<p><br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514055/ref=nosim/iunknowncom-20"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0974514055.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<br></p>


	<p>In Ruby, objects are instances of classes. However, classes are also objects in Ruby, which means that a class is an instance of a class called <code>Class</code>. Let&#8217;s consider the following code fragment:</p>


<pre><code>
a = ArrayList.new
puts a.Count
</code></pre>

	<p>In the first line, we&#8217;ve created an instance of class <code>ArrayList</code> and assigned it to the variable <code>a</code>. Next, we invoke the <code>Count</code> instance method of the <code>ArrayList</code> object. So far so good, right?</p>


	<p>Next let&#8217;s see how Ruby invokes instance methods. Every Ruby object contains a reference to its class object. This is stored in an internal field called <code>klass</code>. When we invoke the <code>Count</code> method on the <code>ArrayList</code> object, Ruby follows the <code>klass</code> reference to find the <code>ArrayList</code> class object. It searches its method table, finds the <code>Count</code> method and invokes it.</p>


	<p>In my bridge, I delay binding to a method on a <span class="caps">CLR</span> object until it is called. When it is called, I build a small piece of <span class="caps">CIL</span> code using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to call the method and marshal data back to the caller. I can delay binding to the method using the <code>method_missing</code> instance method of the object. In the case of the call to the <code>Count</code> method, you could imagine a piece of code that looks like:</p>


<pre><code>
alias alias_method_missing method_missing

def method_missing(name, *params)
  alias_method_missing(name, *params) unless name == :Count

  create_ruby_instance_method(self.class, 'Count') do
    include  'System.Collections'
    ldarg_2
    call     'static Marshal::ToClrObject(VALUE)'
    call     'ArrayList::get_Count()'
    call     'static Marshal::ToRubyNumber(Int32)'
    ret
  end
  self.Count
end
</code></pre>

	<p>This is a hard-coded example that generates a shim for the <code>Count</code> method. The shim invokes the <code>get_Count</code> method to retrieve the value of the <code>Count</code> property of the <code>ArrayList</code> object. It marshals the return value (an <code>Int32</code>) back to the caller using the <code>Marshal::ToRubyNumber()</code> helper method in the <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> library.</p>


	<p>Where things get interesting is the first two lines of <span class="caps">CIL</span> code in the shim. Here, I reach into the Ruby object and pull out the actual <code>ArrayList</code> object reference that is stored in a <em>secret</em> field of the Ruby object. This secret field is completely inaccessible to Ruby code. Once I have the object reference, I can freely invoke the <code>get_Count</code> instance method using the <span class="caps">CIL </span><code>call</code> instruction.</p>


	<p>Notice that I&#8217;m defining an instance method called <code>Count</code> on the <code>ArrayList</code> class object. At the end of the <code>method_missing</code> method, I invoke the <code>Count</code> method that I just defined. However, all <em>subsequent</em> calls to the <code>Count</code> instance method will go directly to the <span class="caps">CIL</span> code that I just wrote (which of course will have been compiled into x86 code as well). This means that we will have excellent performance since we completely avoid having to use the <code>Reflection</code> APIs in the <span class="caps">CLR</span>.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering how the <code>ArrayList</code> object reference got stored in the secret field? I&#8217;ll talk about that in tomorrow&#8217;s installment of the story when we look at how objects get created in Ruby (and it&#8217;s nowhere near as simple as it looks!).</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?SignUpHere">DemoCamp</a> tonight and I saw a bunch of cool demos put on by folks working on startups here in Toronto.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.bubbleshare.com">BubbleShare</a> folks had a really cool demo of an upcoming feature of their photo sharing service. They&#8217;ve implemented the core interface of iPhoto using <span class="caps">AJAX </span>(you know the one: dragging a slider that dynamically resizes the thumbnails). You have to see it to believe it. Apparently this feature goes live on their site next week sometime.</li>
		<li>If you&#8217;re into ego surfing, you should definitely check out <a href="http://ehlist.ca/">Eh List</a>. Chris Nolan&#8217;s done a really good job of aggregating a bunch of services to show you just where you rank (or don&#8217;t) in the blogosphere.</li>
		<li>I&#8217;m continually amazed by how Randy Charles Morin is able to generate revenue from his various ventures. Tonight he demonstrated <a href="http://www.r-mail.org/">RMail</a> which is a service that emails you <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds. Randy monetizes this by including links within the blog entries that point back to his custom search engine.</li>
		<li>Sutha Kamal of <a href="http://www.ambientvector.com">Ambient Vector</a> demonstrated his social collaborative search engine that improves the quality of mobile search based on its analysis of your preferences and <em>your peer group&#8217;s preferences</em>. This is a really powerful idea that greatly improves the quality of recommendations, since you can think of search results as recommendations. This ties back into the idea that providing search context is a good thing.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>It was also cool to hang out with <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/">Reg Braithwaite</a> again. Tonight I got a great idea about building a Firefox extension based on his ideas about context-based recommendations. I <em>so</em> want to do something cool in this space.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="/images/RbDynamicMethod.zip">another drop</a> of <code>RbDynamicMethod</code>. New to this release is a custom implementation of <code>Type.GetMethod</code> that correctly finds overloaded generic methods. The .NET implementation of this method does not support resolving generic methods, so I wound up rolling my own. If you&#8217;re interested in its implementation you should check out <code>FindGenericMethodTemplate</code> in the sources.</p>


	<p>This is what using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to call a generic method looks like:</p>
