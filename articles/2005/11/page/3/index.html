<p>There was something <em>really</em> special about <a href="http://blog.zenspider.com/">Ryan Davis&#8217;</a> excellent ZenHacks talk at RubyConf 2005. It took me a while to figure out what was going on, but it initially looked to me like he was typing code into a command shell embedded in the middle of his Keynote slide deck. As it turned out, he was playing QuickTime movies from within his slide deck, which let him give the <em>feel</em> of a live coding session, but with better commentary since he didn&#8217;t have to think, talk and type at the same time.</p>


	<p>I decided to try the same approach for my talk tonight. However, I quickly ran into a large number of technical blocking issues. Here&#8217;s a set of notes to help anyone else that&#8217;s trying to use this technique.</p>


	<p>1) <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">Camtasia</a> rocks. I have a full license for <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/robodemo/">Captivate</a> but I think I&#8217;m going to pony up the cash for Camtasia as well. The main reason for the switch is the ability to create <span class="caps">WMV</span> files directly from Camtasia.</p>


	<p>2) Your screen cast video will look really crappy if it is scaled. The main problem with PowerPoint is that it <strong>insists</strong> on scaling your video to whatever your output device resolutiion is. One way to get around this is to force the slide show resolution to a fixed resolution (I used 1024&#215;768):</p>


	<p><img src="images/screen_resolution.png" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Next, you must force the size of your video clip to be a fixed size (7.8125&#8221; works for an 800&#215;600 movie using the default PowerPoint slide sizes).</p>


	<p>3). Setup your video to play automatically. This makes for a much more seamless experience when you land on a slide with a video. I had a really hard time making things work the way I wanted with <span class="caps">SWF</span> files generated by Captivate, which was a major reason why I&#8217;m considering ponying up the $$$ to buy Camtasia (it&#8217;s not cheap either, but a good deal cheaper than Captivate).</p>

<p>I just finished updating Matthew&#8217;s Birthday Present for the <span class="caps">RTM</span> release of .NET 2.0. I&#8217;ll be unveiling <a href="http://www.cttdnug.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=104">Matthew&#8217;s second birthday present</a> at the Canada Technology Triangle .NET User Group meeting Wednesday, November 30, 2005.</p>


	<p>It should be a really fun talk. You&#8217;ll see the culmination of several months of late night hacking. Among the things you will see are:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Indigo</li>
		<li>Avalon</li>
		<li>Managed C++</li>
		<li><span class="caps">CIL</span></li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
	</ul>


	<p>With the exception of <span class="caps">WWF</span>, it will be pretty much a lap around WinFX, but done using Ruby :)</p>


	<p>It looks like I&#8217;ll have quite the crowd there: <del>104</del> 113 registered as of right now. Hope to see you there!</p>

	<p>This was <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?TorCamp">TorCamp</a> weekend in Toronto. And what a weekend it was. For the longest time, it felt quite isolating to be a geek living in Toronto (at least relative to places like Seattle or San Francisco). Sure, there&#8217;s a vibrant .NET developer community in Toronto, but most of that community is focused on &#8220;corporate&#8221; apps, and far less on innovative uses of the technology (aka startups).</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.objectsharp.com">ObjectSharp</a> was proud to be a sponsor of the initial run of the conference. I met a lot of really interesting folks at the event that I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be having a lot more interesting follow-up conversations with in the near future. A <strong>big</strong> thanks goes out to <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a> for making this event happen.</p>


	<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/torcamp/">flickr group</a> for some images from the conference. I love the space that <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">teehan+lax</a> provided for hosting the conference.</p>


	<p>The best thing about this conference was the cross-fertilization of ideas that can happen when you get a bunch of folks from different walks of life having informed conversations and debates. <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2005/11/torcamp.html">Reg Braithwaite</a> gave a nice talk about the importance of context in applications ranging from search to advertising to project management(!). <a href="http://blog.davidjanes.com/">David Janes</a> gave a very cool demo about metadata, microcontent, blogging, and greasemonkey. I met Albert Lai, whose company, <a href="http://www.bubbleshare.com/about/">BubbleShare</a> is actually using Ruby and .NET to build their innovative photo sharing service. Lots of other interesting hallway conversations too numerous to recount here.</p>


	<p>I spent some time talking to a small group of folks about bridging Ruby and the <span class="caps">CLR </span>(this wasn&#8217;t really the right crowd to be giving a talk like this to). It started out small, but eventually turned into a 1:1 conversation between myself and <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Mike Shaver</a> of Mozilla about the difficulties of avoiding memory leaks in a process that is running multiple GC-based allocators based on his experience with Mono + Firefox. It&#8217;s definitely something that I need to spend some more time thinking about.</p>

<p>If you look at the code that I wrote to <a href="/images/flickr.cs">call flickr using Indigo</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that the flickr <span class="caps">API</span> call accepts a string and returns a string. This makes it trivial for me to interop with Ruby:</p>


<pre><code>
require 'RubyShim'
require 'builder'
require 'builder/xmlmarkup'
require 'rexml/document'

reference_file 'flickrlib.dll'

include FlickrLib
include Builder
include REXML

f = Flickr.new('83293ff34e3ab3d9935018480190319f')
puts f.Call('&lt;method&gt;flickr.people.findByEmail&lt;/method&gt;
             &lt;find_email&gt;jlam@iunknown.com&lt;/find_email&gt;')

# or if you prefer
xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new
xml.method     "flickr.people.findByEmail" 
xml.find_email "jlam@iunknown.com" 

d = Document.new(f.Call(xml.target!))
puts d.elements['//username'].text
</code></pre>

	<p>I&#8217;m not all that happy with sending mal-formed <span class="caps">XML</span> as an in-parameter, but it was a quick and easy hack to get it up and running.</p>

<span class="typo_date" title="Fri, 25 Nov 2005 20:22:00 GMT">Fri, 25 Nov 2005 20:22:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s post about the <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2005/11/24/indigo-and-flickr-not-happy-together">Flickr bug</a> I explained what was causing Indigo to be so unhappy. I spent some quality time with Google, and found <a href="http://www.douglasp.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e3c387b8-f397-4f4f-817c-75fceab651e7">the code samples</a> from Doug Purdy&#8217;s <span class="caps">PDC</span> presentation on how to make Indigo initiate <span class="caps">POX </span>(Plain Old <span class="caps">XML</span>) style calls. Now, flickr should really fix their <span class="caps">API</span>, but this led to an interesting educational trip into the world of <code>MessageEncoders</code> in Indigo.</p>


	<p>A <code>MessageEncoder</code> is responsible for marshaling a <code>Message</code> object to and from an Indigo transport. By writing my own <code>MessageEncoder</code>, I can set its <code>MediaType</code> property to <code>text/xml</code>, thereby ensuring that the Indigo plumbing accepts the mal-formed flickr response.</p>


	<p>Once you write your own <code>MessageEncoder</code>, you have to inject it into the Indigo stack. To do this, you&#8217;ll need to implement a custom <code>MessageEncoderFactory</code> and a custom <code>BindingElement</code>. This is fill-in-the-form style programming &#8211; you just have to override a few mandatory methods and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>


	<p>The really nice part of this exercise was how none of the rest of the code that I wrote yesterday had to change to make this happen. The only part that changed was replacing the reference to <code>TextMessageEncodingBindingElement</code> with my new <code>FlickrEncodingBindingElement</code>.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="/images/flickr.cs">source code</a> for my implementation (cleaned up a bit from the code that I posted yesterday).</p>


	<p>Thanks go out to <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/default.aspx">Don Box</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/yassers/">Yasser Shohoud</a> and <a href="http://www.kennyw.com/">Kenny Wolf</a> for pointing out the right way of making this happen.</p>

<p>Inspired by Mike Taulty&#8217;s <a href="http://mtaulty.com/blog/(z0uien45genrh0jdmtze0z45)/archive/2005/03/30/1721.aspx">A slightly different &#8216;hello, world&#8217; for Indigo</a> blog entry, I decided to create a low-level Indigo client that talks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api">flickr</a>.</p>


	<p>I wanted to understand how the Indigo plumbing worked, so I decided to forego the high-level APIs and write my code using nothing more than <code>ChannelFactory</code>, <code>Message</code>, <code>IRequestChannel</code> and friends. This code compiles and runs on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2005/11/18/494283.aspx">November <span class="caps">CTP</span></a> bits, so my code looks a bit different than Mike&#8217;s code on his blog. If you want to follow along, you&#8217;ll need the November <span class="caps">CTP</span> bits and the <span class="caps">SDK</span>, but be warned: the documentation has not stayed in sync with changes to the <span class="caps">API</span>. <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a> is your friend :)</p>


	<p>It all started innocently enough. Here&#8217;s the original version of my code:</p>


<pre><code>
    ChannelFactory&lt;IRequestChannel&gt; factory;
    using (factory = new ChannelFactory&lt;IRequestChannel&gt;(
           CreateBinding(),
           new EndpointAddress("http://www.flickr.com/services/soap/"))) {
      using (IRequestChannel channel = factory.CreateChannel()) {
        StringReader body =
          new StringReader(@"&lt;x:FlickrRequest xmlns:x='urn:flickr'&gt;
                             &lt;api_key&gt;83293ff34e3ab3d9935018480190319f&lt;/api_key&gt;
                             &lt;format&gt;soap2&lt;/format&gt;
                             &lt;method&gt;flickr.test.echo&lt;/method&gt;
                             &lt;name&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;
                           &lt;/x:FlickrRequest&gt;");
        XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader(body);
        Message message      = Message.CreateMessage(MessageVersion.Soap12Addressing1, 
                               "*", reader);
        Message response     = channel.Request(message);
        XmlDictionaryReader responseReader = response.GetReaderAtBodyContents();
        Console.Write(responseReader.ReadOuterXml());
      }
    }
</code></pre>

	<p>This code uses a <code>ChannelFactory</code> to create a request/response style channel to flickr. Next, I construct a <code>Message</code> object and inject some <span class="caps">XML</span> into the message body. The flickr <span class="caps">API</span> is really just a single method that takes an <span class="caps">XML</span> document and returns an <span class="caps">XML</span> document. See the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api">documentation</a> for more examples. Finally, I send my request <code>Message</code> via the channel, and it hands me back a response <code>Message</code> object that I serialize to the console. Simple enough, right?</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s when the fun began. There&#8217;s a bug in flickr, and apparently, I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.flickr.com/forums/bugs/14099/">not the first one to report this</a>. The flickr <span class="caps">SOAP API</span> returns a content-type of <code>text/xml</code> for a <span class="caps">SOAP 1</span>.2 message body, whereas the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part0-20030624/">spec</a> clearly states that the content-type should be <code>application/soap+xml</code>. Indigo is not happy at all with this, and throws a <code>ProtocolException</code> and aborts further processing of the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> response.</p>


	<p>The crux of the problem lies in the type of channel that I created using the <code>ChannelFactory</code> class. To understand how the channel is constructed, I have to show you the missing implementation of the <code>CreateBinding</code> method:</p>


<pre><code>
CustomBinding binding = new CustomBinding();
binding.Elements.Add(new TextMessageEncodingBindingElement(
  MessageVersion.Soap12Addressing1, Encoding.UTF8));
binding.Elements.Add(new HttpTransportBindingElement());
return binding;
</code></pre>

	<p>Here, I tell the <code>ChannelFactory</code> to construct a channel that uses an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> transport, and a text-based <span class="caps">XML</span> serializer that will generate a <span class="caps">SOAP 1</span>.2 message that is text encoded as <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8. Indigo will also check to make sure that the response from the server is a <span class="caps">SOAP 1</span>.2 message <strong>and</strong> the content-type is <code>application/soap+xml</code>. To see this checking in action, try sending a <span class="caps">SOAP 1</span>.1 <code>Message</code> using this channel.</p>


	<p>I spent some time spelunking around using Reflector, <code>TextMessageEncoder.IsContentTypeSupported</code> is where the <code>ProtocolException</code> gets thrown. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t find a way to change the <code>ContentType</code> property of this object. This left only one other option that I could see: write a custom <code>MessageEncoder</code>.</p>


	<p>More on how to do this tomorrow.</p>

<span class="typo_date" title="Wed, 23 Nov 2005 20:37:00 GMT">Wed, 23 Nov 2005 20:37:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>I spent some time this afternoon dealing with the breaking changes in my toy Avalon application between the September WinFX <span class="caps">CTP</span> and the November WinFX <span class="caps">CTP</span>.</p>


	<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/karstenj/archive/2005/11/18/494551.aspx">Karsten Januszewski</a> has kindly released <a href="http://winfx.members.winisp.net/files/introductionnovctp.mht">a draft of his upcoming article on the November <span class="caps">CTP</span></a> that is scheduled to appear on <span class="caps">MSDN</span> in December. Between that and the Avalon <span class="caps">XSD</span> schema, I was able to figure out how to port my application to the November <span class="caps">CTP</span>.</p>


	<p>The biggest problem that I had was remembering that the syntax of a <code>PropertyPath</code> is based on a dot-delimited list of (<em>type name</em>.<em>property name</em>) tuples. You can also specify indexers for the list tuples.</p>


	<p>In my app, I had a fairly complex property path that scrapes a property out of a 3D model:</p>


	<p><code>(Viewport3D.Children)[0].(ModelVisual3D.Content).(Model3DGroup.Children)[2].(Model3D.Transform).(RotateTransform3D.Rotation)</code></p>


	<p>There is a new <code>Children</code> element that hangs off of <code>Viewport3D</code> that tripped me up. The runtime exceptions that get thrown by the framework aren&#8217;t, um, helpful towards diagnosis of the problem. Spelunking via Intellisense was what helped me discover the new <code>Children</code> property (Karsten mentions it in his article as well).</p>

<p>Most of the work we do at <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com">ObjectSharp</a> is your standard line of business application. If you ever tried to introduce Ruby into such an environment, you&#8217;re bound to run into some resistence.</p>


	<p>At next week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com/oNewsUpdate/ReadingFullStory.aspx?StoryNum=-94">Architect&#8217;s Roundtable presentation</a>, I&#8217;m going to present the case for Ruby in the Enterprise. It&#8217;s an interesting story about how we can learn from the past, the importance of platforms, and how to sell productivity to customers.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re in the Toronto area, make sure you drop by to say hello!</p>
