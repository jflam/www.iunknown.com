  <h2><a href="/articles/2005/11/01/why-another-ruby-to-clr-bridge">Why another Ruby to CLR bridge?</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Tue, 01 Nov 2005 12:00:00 GMT">Tue, 01 Nov 2005 12:00:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>There are at least two other Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridges. There is the <a href="http://www.saltypickle.com/rubydotnet">Salty
Pickle bridge</a> written by John Pierce and Ben Schroeder, and there is another bridge
written by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubydotnet">Thomas Sondergaard</a>. These bridges heavily leverage the
existing <span class="caps">CLR </span>Reflection <span class="caps">API</span> and its dynamic method invocation
infrastructure.</p>


	<p>Because of this, these bridges are not particularly
efficient in either space or time. Reflective method invocation is a
very heavyweight operation, as <a href="http://www.saltypickle.com/RubyDotNet/20">these benchmarks</a> will bear
out. Furthermore, if value types are marshaled across the boundary,
these objects will be boxed and placed on the <span class="caps">CLR GC</span> heap, resulting
in an increase in memory pressure.</p>


	<p>Writing my own bridge lets me fix these problems, and it gave me an
excuse to study the Ruby extension interfaces and the <span class="caps">CLR V2</span>
lightweight code generation <span class="caps">API</span>. It also gave me an excuse to try out
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/slippman/">Stan Lippman&#8217;s</a> excellent work in fixing the Managed C++ syntax in
Whidbey.</p>


	<p>My bridge addresses method invocation performance by generating <span class="caps">CIL</span>
stubs on the fly using the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/80h6baz2.aspx">DynamicMethod</a> API in Whidbey. These
<span class="caps">CIL</span> stubs are directly bound to the Ruby object&#8217;s methods. So once
those <span class="caps">CIL</span> stubs have been JITed by the <span class="caps">CLR</span>, a method call from Ruby
goes <strong>directly</strong> into managed code. The only overhead is that incurred
by marshaling parameters from their Ruby representation to the
corresponding <span class="caps">CLR</span> representation.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>


	<p>From my comments, Anson Tsao mentioned a couple of other folks I should credit for the MC++ syntax:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>There are a couple of other folks you should credit for the C++/CLI design. <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/">Herb Sutter</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/branbray/">Brandon Bray</a>. Herb was responsible for much of the syntax innovations such as context sensitive keywords (ref class), and Brandon was responsible for writing the language specification and probably knows more about language design details than anyone else.</p>

<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Mon, 31 Oct 2005 12:00:00 GMT">Mon, 31 Oct 2005 12:00:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>Do databases rot the mind? Charles Petzold&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">post about Visual
Studio</a>
triggered this thought in the back of my mind.</p>


	<p>All too often when confronted with a &#8220;business&#8221; problem I, like many
other people I know, wind up reaching for my trusty database. Or, in a
more common scenario, someone hands you an existing schema and says
&#8220;solve my problem&#8221; using it. The reality, however, is that
relational databases are a lousy solution to many problems that we
commonly run across. In a recent e-commerce platform that I created
there was a 7-way join that had to be executed just to retrieve a list
of products to display to a customer. We did <span class="caps">LOTS</span> of performance
tuning of that database and our queries to make it go about as fast as
it could reasonably be expected to go under <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server.</p>


	<p>Just this week, I decided to do an experiment. I reimplemented the
core of our e-commerce platform by loading the entire database into a
custom in-memory data structure. It took me about 1 hour to write the
code to load the core tables into my custom data structure, and about
an additional 15 hours to tune the data structure and refactor the
code to my liking. Oh yeah, I wrote it using Ruby.</p>


	<p>My app was 201 lines of Ruby code (including liberal use of blank
lines to enhance readability). For sake of comparison, just one of the
dynamically generated <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries that it replaced was in the order of
150+ lines of <span class="caps">SQL</span>. And that, of course, doesn&#8217;t count all of the lines
of C# code required to generate, execute, and parse the results of the
<span class="caps">SQL</span> query.</p>


	<p>One more thing: it also ran <strong>100x</strong> faster.</p>


	<p>A bit of history: the original application that I inherited was on
the order of 20,000 lines of <span class="caps">SQL </span>+ C#. This was largely due to an
enormous amount of duplication of code due to the (ab)use of stored
procedures to handle queries. My rewrite of that application trimmed
it down to 4000 lines of <span class="caps">SQL </span>+ C#. My Ruby application, while not at
feature parity with the existing application, solved essentially all
of the &#8220;hard&#8221; problems. I would estimate that it duplicates >80%
of the functionality of the real application.</p>


	<p>The first version of the code was about 5x faster than the original
application. I then spent some time looking for optimizations. When
you only have about 100 lines of code to look through, optimizations
become pretty obvious. I was able to cache the results of a
(relatively) expensive O(M+N) algorithm that sat on the
rate-determining-step of the computation. This netted me a 20x
speedup. This optimization is simply not possible using <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server,
but is dead-simple when you get to implement your own query engine.</p>


	<p>I <em>love</em> the symmetry of my results: 1/100th the code and 100x the performance. It&#8217;s also much easier to maintain 200 lines of code than 20,000 lines of code. Testing was also much more straightforward.</p>


	<p>Now the code that I rewrote was tailor-made for this kind of
rewrite. It was a read-only database that was relatively (< 1GB) small in
size. If you have such an application lying around &#8211; try rewriting it
using in-memory data structures. If you&#8217;re a bit more adventurous, try
using a dynamically typed language to do this (might I suggest
Ruby?). You just might be surprised by the outcome and come away with
a new technique in your toolbox by doing so.</p>
