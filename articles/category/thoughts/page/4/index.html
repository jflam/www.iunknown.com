<p>I got events up and running last night. It was a bit harder than I anticipated, and there&#8217;s still a bit of work that needs to be done around marshaling, but this unit test now passes:</p>


<pre><code>
public ref class CallbackTests {
public:
  event EventHandler^ Event;

  void CallMeBack() {
    Event(nullptr, EventArgs::Empty);
  }
};

class EventTests &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_simple_event
    c = System::CallbackTests.new
    c.Event do |sender, args|
      assert_equal 1, 1
    end
    c.CallMeBack
  end
end
</code></pre>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2006/01/11/rubyclr-update">RubyCLR update</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Wed, 11 Jan 2006 18:30:00 GMT">Wed, 11 Jan 2006 18:30:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been spending a surprising amount of time working on my Ruby <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge. Ben sleeps on/around me for about 3 hours in the evening to give Carolyn 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep, and I&#8217;ve been using that time very productively to add features.</p>


	<p>The older version of the bridge that I had working was a grotesque hack &#8211; it was essentially a bunch of experiments cobbled together in a Frankenstein-esque contraption. Anyone who has a copy of that code is respectfully asked to destroy it once I ship any of these newer bits.</p>


	<p>One of the big things that I&#8217;ve been working on is getting a seamless array experience. I marshal data types between the <span class="caps">CLR</span> and Ruby by value where possible, and by reference in all other cases. So value types like floating point numbers and integers are marshaled by value (aka copied and converted) across the runtime boundaries. So code like this just works:</p>


<pre><code>
static array&lt;int&gt;^ StaticGetOneDimensionalArray() {
  return gcnew array&lt;int&gt; { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
}

a = MarshalerTests.StaticGetOneDimensionalArray
assert_equal 0, a[0]
assert_equal 4, a.Length
</code></pre>

	<p>As you can see, I marshal by reference the array from the C++ function. But all of the elements of the array are marshaled by value, which lets me treat them as if they were native Ruby numbers.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also done a ton of performance work in this release. If you&#8217;re calling a method that has overloads, I take a slower path where I have to lookup at runtime the correct method based on the parameters that you&#8217;re passing. However, if the method doesn&#8217;t have any overloads, I generate a different shim that doesn&#8217;t do any runtime lookups &#8211; it just pushes parameters onto the call stack and invokes the method. The array code that you see above calls <code>Array.Get</code> which is <strong>not</strong> overloaded (unlike <code>Array.GetValue</code> which is) which results in extremely fast <span class="caps">CLR</span> array element access from Ruby.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m punting on some hard problems like generics for the time being. I have to add support for events before I ship this release; if Ben cooperates that should be by the end of this week.</p>

<p>I used to have a chunk of code that looked like:</p>


<pre><code>
def new_clrobj(ctor_info, sig = null)
  sig = ctor_info.signature if sig == null
  newobj   "#{ctor_info.clr_type}(" + sig.join(',') + ')'

<p><a href="http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2005/12/30/32204.aspx">Sam Gentile</a> was wondering about where Ruby is used in the &#8216;real world&#8217;, and where I&#8217;ve personally used Ruby.</p>


	<p>Sam, you can easily Google around to see where Ruby is being used in the real world. Check out the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails web site</a> for some pointers to some large web sites that are running on Rails.</p>


	<p>As for where I&#8217;ve personally used Ruby and Rails, we wrote a lot of Ruby code for my last customer. The product hasn&#8217;t been announced yet, so I still can&#8217;t talk about it, but suffice to say that it&#8217;s a high performance e-commerce web service with two very large customers running on top of it (and many more to come).</p>


	<p>We used Ruby to automate deploying the web service to our cluster. Ruby&#8217;s integration with <span class="caps">COM</span> made writing the <span class="caps">ADSI </span>+ WMI goo much more pleasant. I even toyed with rewriting the core web service (which is a .NET web service) in Ruby and was able to exploit an optimization that simply was not possible using .NET and <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server. There was an intermediate result set that could easily be cached in-memory using Ruby that wuold net us at least a 10X performance increase over the existing .NET application.</p>


	<p>To be fair, I could have done the same optimization using C#, but there would be no way that I could squeeze it down into 200 lines of very concise Ruby code. The other qualitative difference is that the caching optimization was just <strong>really obvious</strong> in the Ruby code; there was just so few lines of code to look at.</p>


	<p>We also built out a Rails web site to support the <span class="caps">API</span>. Developers using the web service could run live queries against our catalog using the site. The web site would also generate the application code for them in their programming language of choice: C#, VB.NET, Java or raw <span class="caps">SOAP</span> calls. It&#8217;s very similar in spirit to the <a href="http://www.awszone.com/">AWS Zone</a> site (even though I&#8217;m convinced that we have a much simpler query <span class="caps">API</span> than Amazon does).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m convinced that Ruby and meta-programming is a great way to approach modeling business applications. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m investing so much time building my <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2005/12/14/hello-rubyclr">Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2005/12/17/clr-object-lifetime">CLR object lifetime</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Sat, 17 Dec 2005 21:55:00 GMT">Sat, 17 Dec 2005 21:55:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>My Ruby <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge works by creating, on the fly, small <span class="caps">CIL</span> shims that invoke the appropriate method(s) on a <span class="caps">CLR</span> object. Today I want to talk about how I manage the lifetimes of those <span class="caps">CIL</span> shims.</p>


	<p>When you execute some code like <code>a = ArrayList.new</code> for the first time, I construct a new <code>ArrayList</code> Ruby class object on the fly. When you execute a method on a class instance such as <code>a.Sort</code>, I construct a <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim that knows how to invoke the <code>Sort</code> method on the <code>ArrayList</code> object. That <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is bound to the Ruby class object via a call to <code>rb_define_method</code>.</p>


	<p>The <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is created using the <code>DynamicMethod</code> API in <span class="caps">CLR 2</span>.0. After I finish defining the body of the dynamic method using my <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> API, I construct a delegate object that represents that method. These delegate objects are eligible for garbage collection, which means that I need to keep a reference to them. Now, when I said that the <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim is bound to the Ruby class object, Ruby only knows about the function pointer to the delegate object that represents the <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim. That function pointer is only a <em>weak reference</em> to the delegate, which means that it cannot keep the delegate object from being collected by the <span class="caps">CLR GC</span>.</p>


	<p>To work around this problem, I&#8217;ve added a <code>List&lt;Delegate&gt;</code> object to the Ruby class object. Its job is to hold onto references to all of the dynamically created <span class="caps">CIL</span> shim delegate objects <em>for that class</em>. When the Ruby class object is garbage collected by <em>Ruby&#8217;s GC</em>, my automagical object reference cleanup code will <code>Free</code> the <code>GCHandle</code> object that I use to keep a reference to the <code>List&lt;Delegate&gt;</code> object.</p>


	<p>I actually had a far more complicated and convoluted mechanism for dealing with this problem in my initial implementation of the bridge. I&#8217;m much happier with the simplicity of this approach in V2.</p>

<p>I just figured out what Ruby was doing, because I forgot just how &#8220;meta&#8221; my programming was. Consider this code frag:</p>


<pre><code>
def const_missing(symbol)
  alias_const_missing(symbol) unless symbol == :ArrayList

  obj = create_clr_class_object
  # remember that the code below is in a string
  obj.class_eval %{
    def initialize(*params)
      create_safe_ruby_instance_method(
        self.class, 'initialize') do
        include     'System.Collections'
        declare     "#{symbol}", :obj
        ...
</code></pre>

	<p>Look at the last line of code and the <code>declare</code> statement. Notice how I&#8217;m referencing the <code>symbol</code> variable that is the input parameter to the <code>const_missing</code> method declaration on the first line? I have to escape that reference as a string to access that variable. Why? Because that code is embedded in a string (that&#8217;s what the funny <code>%{</code> means: it&#8217;s a begin string quotation symbol).</p>


	<p>Now this has interesting implications for other string manipulation functions that are inside of the <em>string</em> that is passed to <code>obj.class_eval</code>. For example consider this snippet of code.</p>


<pre><code>
sigs          = get_constructor_signatures("#{symbol}")
switch_labels = (1..sigs.length).collect { |i| ("l" + i.to_s).to_sym }
</code></pre>

	<p>I <em>really</em> wanted to write the string expression as:</p>


	<p><code>"l#{i}".to_sym</code></p>


	<p>But this cannot work since it would try and find an <code>i</code> variable defined in the enclosing method. So I wound up writing it in the somewhat more verbose way that I did to make it work. I wound up scratching my head about this behavior for quite a while before I realized that, doh! the code was executing <em>inside of a string</em>.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s how powerful Ruby&#8217;s metaprogramming facilities are: oftentimes you forget that you&#8217;re really programming at a meta level of abstraction instead of at the &#8220;concrete&#8221; level.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2005/12/15/refactoring-cil">Refactoring CIL</a></h2>
<p class="auth">Posted by <a href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</a>
<span class="typo_date" title="Thu, 15 Dec 2005 22:33:00 GMT">Thu, 15 Dec 2005 22:33:00 GMT</span></p>
<p>I had a great day today. I had one of those a-ha experiences where you get to benefit from an earlier decision in ways that you did not expect. I started down the path of generating constructor shims using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code>. I completed my first spike yesterday, when I successfully constructed <code>ArrayList</code> objects using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code>.</p>


	<p>Today, I wanted to make a slightly more generic constructor shim that would let me call both a default and a single argument constructor: <code>ArrayList()</code> and <code>ArrayList(Int32)</code>. While I was writing this code, I began to feel some <span class="caps">CIL</span> pain (it is, after all <strong>assembly language</strong>). So I did what came naturally: I began to refactor the code.</p>


	<p>This reminds me of the talk that I saw this year at <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span> where Ward Cunningham was refactoring assembly language using IntelliJ. In my case, I refactored <span class="caps">CIL</span> using emacs :) Here&#8217;s the end result:</p>


<pre><code>
def initialize(*params)
  create_ruby_instance_method(self.class, 'initialize') do
    include     'System.Collections'
    declare     "#{symbol}", :obj
    ldarg_0
    switch      [:zero_param, :one_param]
    br_s        :end_switch
    label       :zero_param
    newobj      '#{symbol}()'
    stloc_s     :obj
    br_s        :end_switch
    label       :one_param
    ld_rb_param 0, 'Int32'
    newobj      '#{symbol}(Int32)'
    stloc_s     :obj
    label       :end_switch
    ret_objref  :obj
  end
  initialize(*params)
end
</code></pre>

	<p>While this is mostly <span class="caps">CIL</span>, it also contains a number of macros and fun Ruby string stuff. The macros that I used are: <code>ld_rb_param</code>, <code>ret_objref</code>. As it turns out, these will be very common code fragments that will be used throughout the bridge. Writing those macros was even easier. Here&#8217;s a sample:</p>


<pre><code>
module RbDynamicMethodHelpers
  def ld_self
    ldarg_2
  end

  def ld_rb_param(index, type)
    ldarg_1
    case index
    when 1:
      ldc_i4_4
      add
    when 2:
      ldc_i4_8
      add
    else
      ldc_i4    index &lt;&lt; 2
      add
    end
    ldind_i4
    call      "static Marshal::To#{type}(VALUE)" 
  end

  def ret_objref(local_variable_name)
    ld_self
    ldloc_s  local_variable_name
    call     'static Marshal::AssignToClassInstance(VALUE, Object)'
    ret
  end
end
</pre></code>

	<p>It turned out it was a good thing that I left the method declarations as strings, since I could do some simple string manipulation to inject implement syntactic sugar methods such as <code>ld_rb_param</code> (which is actually a very efficient <span class="caps">CIL</span> implementation that is optimized for the common cases).</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, how much extra code did I have to add to <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to enable macros? I changed:</p>


	<p><code>object.extend RbDynamicMethod</code></p>


	<p>to:</p>


	<p><code>object.extend RbDynamicMethod, RbDynamicMethodHelpers</code></p>


	<p>Did I mention how much I love Ruby? :)</p>

<p>I spent most of yesterday and today hacking out the first spike of the Ruby rewrite of my original Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge. I wound up adding some additional code to <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to support some scenarios that I didn&#8217;t envision (nothing like having a &#8216;customer&#8217; to reveal deficiencies in an <span class="caps">API</span>!). I also spent a <strong>lot</strong> of time learning about how objects are constructed in Ruby. Here&#8217;s a very simplified explanation of Ruby&#8217;s object model; for a complete description, see Chapter 24 of Dave Thomas&#8217; excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514055/ref=nosim/iunknowncom-20">Programming Ruby</a>.</p>


	<p><br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514055/ref=nosim/iunknowncom-20"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0974514055.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<br></p>


	<p>In Ruby, objects are instances of classes. However, classes are also objects in Ruby, which means that a class is an instance of a class called <code>Class</code>. Let&#8217;s consider the following code fragment:</p>


<pre><code>
a = ArrayList.new
puts a.Count
</code></pre>

	<p>In the first line, we&#8217;ve created an instance of class <code>ArrayList</code> and assigned it to the variable <code>a</code>. Next, we invoke the <code>Count</code> instance method of the <code>ArrayList</code> object. So far so good, right?</p>


	<p>Next let&#8217;s see how Ruby invokes instance methods. Every Ruby object contains a reference to its class object. This is stored in an internal field called <code>klass</code>. When we invoke the <code>Count</code> method on the <code>ArrayList</code> object, Ruby follows the <code>klass</code> reference to find the <code>ArrayList</code> class object. It searches its method table, finds the <code>Count</code> method and invokes it.</p>


	<p>In my bridge, I delay binding to a method on a <span class="caps">CLR</span> object until it is called. When it is called, I build a small piece of <span class="caps">CIL</span> code using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to call the method and marshal data back to the caller. I can delay binding to the method using the <code>method_missing</code> instance method of the object. In the case of the call to the <code>Count</code> method, you could imagine a piece of code that looks like:</p>


<pre><code>
alias alias_method_missing method_missing

def method_missing(name, *params)
  alias_method_missing(name, *params) unless name == :Count

  create_ruby_instance_method(self.class, 'Count') do
    include  'System.Collections'
    ldarg_2
    call     'static Marshal::ToClrObject(VALUE)'
    call     'ArrayList::get_Count()'
    call     'static Marshal::ToRubyNumber(Int32)'
    ret
  end
  self.Count
end
</code></pre>

	<p>This is a hard-coded example that generates a shim for the <code>Count</code> method. The shim invokes the <code>get_Count</code> method to retrieve the value of the <code>Count</code> property of the <code>ArrayList</code> object. It marshals the return value (an <code>Int32</code>) back to the caller using the <code>Marshal::ToRubyNumber()</code> helper method in the <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> library.</p>


	<p>Where things get interesting is the first two lines of <span class="caps">CIL</span> code in the shim. Here, I reach into the Ruby object and pull out the actual <code>ArrayList</code> object reference that is stored in a <em>secret</em> field of the Ruby object. This secret field is completely inaccessible to Ruby code. Once I have the object reference, I can freely invoke the <code>get_Count</code> instance method using the <span class="caps">CIL </span><code>call</code> instruction.</p>


	<p>Notice that I&#8217;m defining an instance method called <code>Count</code> on the <code>ArrayList</code> class object. At the end of the <code>method_missing</code> method, I invoke the <code>Count</code> method that I just defined. However, all <em>subsequent</em> calls to the <code>Count</code> instance method will go directly to the <span class="caps">CIL</span> code that I just wrote (which of course will have been compiled into x86 code as well). This means that we will have excellent performance since we completely avoid having to use the <code>Reflection</code> APIs in the <span class="caps">CLR</span>.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering how the <code>ArrayList</code> object reference got stored in the secret field? I&#8217;ll talk about that in tomorrow&#8217;s installment of the story when we look at how objects get created in Ruby (and it&#8217;s nowhere near as simple as it looks!).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="/images/RbDynamicMethod.zip">another drop</a> of <code>RbDynamicMethod</code>. New to this release is a custom implementation of <code>Type.GetMethod</code> that correctly finds overloaded generic methods. The .NET implementation of this method does not support resolving generic methods, so I wound up rolling my own. If you&#8217;re interested in its implementation you should check out <code>FindGenericMethodTemplate</code> in the sources.</p>


	<p>This is what using <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> to call a generic method looks like:</p>


<pre><code>
create_ruby_module_function(RbDynamicMethod, 'call_generic_min_method') do
  include   'RbDynamicMethodTests'
  ldc_i4_3
  ldc_i4_2
  call      'static GenericMethodTests::Min&lt;Int32&gt;(Int32, Int32)'
  call      'static Marshal::ToRubyNumber(Int32)'
  ret
end
assert_equal 2, call_generic_min_method
</code></pre>

	<p>This should be the last drop of this library for the next little while since I think it&#8217;s good enough to begin building my new Ruby to <span class="caps">CLR</span> bridge on top of it.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="/images/RbDynamicMethod.zip">another drop</a> of my <code>RbDynamicMethod</code> library. Lots of things have changed since the <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2005/12/06/first-drop-of-rbdynamicmethod">first drop</a>:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>It now handles generic type references correctly (although it does <strong>not</strong> handle generic method references yet). </li>
		<li>There are a lot more tests in this drop, and major improvements in error reporting. </li>
		<li>The syntax is a bit cleaner than before, with liberal uses of Ruby symbols where appropriate.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Once again, comments and feedback are encouraged.</p>
