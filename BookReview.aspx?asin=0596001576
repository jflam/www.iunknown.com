                <span id="Label1">One of Java's most striking claims is that it provides a secure programming environment. Yet despite endless discussion, few people understand precisely what Java's claims mean and how it backs up those claims. If you're a developer, network administrator or anyone else who must understand or work with Java's security mechanisms, Java Security is the in-depth exploration you need.  The new second edition focuses on the basic platform features of Java that provide security--the class loader, the bytecode verifier, and the security manager--and recent additions to Java that enhance this security model: digital signatures, security providers, and the access controller. The book covers the security model of Java 2, Version 1.3, which is significantly different from that of Java 1.1. It has extensive coverage of the two new security APIs: JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) and JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension). Java Security, 2nd Edition, will give you a clear understanding of the architecture of Java's security model and how to use that model in both programming and administration.</span>

                    <span>This book was my first introduction to Java Security. After reading the book, I was able to gain exposure to many complex areas of the Java Security/JCA/JCE APIs to include Class loaders, Byte Code Verifiers, Policy Files, Security Manager, Access Controller, Permissions, Message Digests, Data Encryption, Key Agreements, Digital Signatures, and Digital Certificates. My only negative comment was that the author did not provide any examples using the Secure Sockets Library (SSL). I am currently working on implementing security related issues associated with B2B data exchange and felt that this book was extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this book for any serious Java Developer.</span>

                    <span>Java Security is a definitive guide. It covers all aspects of security in Java 2 in great depth and with technical accuracy. Be warned however, it is not light reading nor an introdutory book.</span>

                    <span>The term "security" means many different things. This book deals with the built-in security features of Java, which most programmers access through the Security Manager and Access Controller. Overall, I liked this book and found it a really good introduction to secutiry. However, for the price of this book, I expected a lot more infomation. For example, I would have liked it if the author explored the cryptographic package in depth and gave more real world examples of using ciphers and encryption. ALthough this is not technically what the book is about, most people think of cryptogrophy in terms of security.</span>

                    <span>Like the stimulating brew with which it shares its name, Java is a rich programming language that offers vast functionality. Many organizations have prohibited Java from their networks due to its supposed security risks. While Java does, of course, pose risks, such risks exist in every programming language. Anyone interested in taking an honest look at the risks of using Java to see whether it meets security needs should consider Java Security required reading. <P>Author Scott Oaks does an excellent job in showing the deep security functionality afforded by Java, taking the often abstract Java security concepts and explaining them in a clear and understandable style. As a senior software engineer with Sun Microsystems, Oaks has focused on Java for a number of years, and his expertise shows. <P>While directed at Java programmers, the book has significant value for any programmer or system administrator who needs to understand how Java security works. Those who may want to exploit Java's rich blend of features should gulp down this book.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for information about cryptography and examples on different implementation and usage of the API:s this is not you book.<BR>The author goes throught the standard stuff about the classloader and JVM security. There are very little examples and discussion for every day programmer. Most of the examples are for those planning to write their own classloaders and security managers. Furthermore, the areas of Cryptography is poorly covered, most of the text is just method explanation from the API documentation. There are very few examples that you migth be able to use.</span>
