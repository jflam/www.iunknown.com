                    <span>You need to have this book if you need to take mini-vacations away from your stressful routine. This is a wonderful book. Beautiful design, beautiful photos, excellent narrative. Of my 100+ design/decorating books, this is in my top 5 favorites, a position it has held for over 2 years. Like another reviewer, I also appreciate knowing the homeowners' names. Sometimes I see their homes showcased in other books published after this one, with different photo angles, or perhaps updated accessories, and I feel like I'm keeping in touch with old friends.</span>

                    <span>This is perhaps my favorite interior design book.  Each space featured has a warm, unique and personal style that is not usually seen in the typical glossy interior coffee table books.  Many of the homes are vacation or  weekend cottages but they all share a feeling of great comfort and  individual charm.  I not only enjoy the beautiful photographs but the text  reveals the personality of the owners and how the spaces reflect their  lives. "California Cottages" brings a refreshing view of  eclectic, somewhat bohemian living spaces that feel intimate and real.   It's also nice to have a West coast perspective among the many interior  design/style books that tend to favor East coast locales.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book on a whim about two years ago and thought it would be like most of the decorating books I own.  I would skim through it, read it, then put it away to take up space on my bookshelf.  Not so!  The book sits  on my coffee table in my small, adorable NYC apartment, which I rented  after being inspired by the homes in this book.  I have read every word in  this book at least three times and feel like I know the owners of each of  the homes pictured.  My favorites surprisingly change from time to time as  I spot things I never noticed before.  I recommend this book for anyone to  whom his home is his cottage.  It's wonderful.</span>

                    <span>What a beauty.  If you have any interest in cottages or 
small houses, whether they are in California or not, you 
should take a look at this book.  The photography of both 
 the interiors and exteriors (mostly the gardens) are
 spectacular and the accompaning text has stories about 
 the owners and what has been done to the cottages to make 
 them more livable. Great browsing book.</span>
