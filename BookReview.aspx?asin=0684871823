                <span id="Label1"><P> <I>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health</I> is the ultimate state of the art in men's health,  assembled into a single volume containing  a quarter-century's worth of hard-won knowledge -- knowledge that men need to lead longer, healthier lives. And it's assembled here because more than twenty-five years ago, researchers at Harvard Medical School and  the Harvard School of Public Health began what have become the largest aggregate studies ever of men's health: the Harvard Alumni Study, the Physicians' Health Study, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Tracking the behavior and health of more than 96,000 American men over decades, the studies have regularly generated front-page health news, such as demonstrating the health benefits of low-dose aspirin, documenting the reduction in heart disease enjoyed by men who consume large amounts of dietary fiber, scientifically proving the life-prolonging effects of regular exercise, showing which supplements help and which do more harm than good, and much, much more. These studies represent the ultimate resource on what keeps men healthy -- and what doesn't. And it's a resource that's never been needed more than today:  ? An American man will be diagnosed with prostate  cancer every three minutes this year. ? Two hundred thirty-five thousand men will die from heart disease during the year.  ?One-quarter of all sixty-five-year-olds have erectile  dysfunction. ?  More than half of all American men are overweight or obese.  ?  Every one of the ten leading causes of death in America is substantially more common in men than women. American women live nearly six years longer than American men.   What are men doing about it?  ?  One-quarter of American men say they handle worries about health by waiting as long as possible before seeking help. One-third do not have a regular doctor.  ?  One-half of all American men have not had a physical    exam or cholesterol test in the past year. Sixty percent of men older than fifty have not been tested for colon cancer in the past year, and 41 percent have not been tested for prostate cancer. <P> That's the problem. The solution is <I>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's </I><I>Health</I>. It features the best and most current information on the health-preserving functions of diet, exercise, and over-the-counter drugs and supplements -- the ones that really work, the ones that don't, and the ones that are dangerous. It gives straight answers on when drinking alcohol is beneficial and when it's not. It incorporates programs and advice on behavior modification and stress control. The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health is the most comprehensive, easy-to-use reference to the diseases that are particularly important to men, including prostate cancer and testicular cancer, erectile dysfunction, kidney and bladder problems, and more. And it even features an easy-to-navigate guide to the health-care system that can help men work with their doctors to achieve better health. With the authority that only the world's largest and best-known medical school can provide, and the lively, clear presentation that is the hallmark of Harvard Men's Health Watch, the monthly newsletter edited by Dr. Simon, <I>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's </I><I>Health</I> is an essential reference for every man -- and for everyone who cares about a man's health.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an excellent medical reference book for men. The information is very well organized into three separate parts: 1) what makes men different, 2) what makes men healthy, and 3) men's main diseases, how to prevent them, test for them, and treat them. The book is quite long at 470 pages. But, it reads easily. And, it makes for an excellent medical reference to go back to when you want specific scientific information on various men's health topics. <P>The best part about the book is that it is based on extensive medical studies. The advice provided is the result of statistically significant conclusions derived from these studies. Thus, the objectivity, integrity, and intelligence derived from this book is so much greater than from any of the medical authors positioning themselves as the current diet or health care guru.<P>The book confirms the value of EFV. The ultimately healthy lifestyle consists of a lot of Exercise with a diet that includes lots of Fruits and Vegetables. These three factors (exercise, fruits, vegetables) appear to be universal protectors against all age related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Similarly, the high risk factors regardless of the health risk considered seemed to be always the same, including: smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, lots of saturated fats and trans fats in the diet. <P>The book has a ton of information besides the self-evident basics mentioned above. There are lots of tables, graphs, and summaries that make the information easy to retrieve. These include info on BMI, PSA test levels, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, recommended frequencies of screening tests, recommended dosage and toxic levels of vitamins and minerals, Glycemic index, life expectancy charts, and lots more interesting stuff.<P>With the medical knowledge derived from this book, you will be in a far better position to take care of your health and initiate a mutually productive dialogue with your general practitioners and specialists. The World is getting increasingly complex. Technology and science evolve rapidly. Nowhere does this increasing complexity have a greater impact than on healthcare. This book will help you understand your health, risk factors, relevant testing, and cures to be considered.<P>As we age, we will invariably be faced with some challenging options and decisions. This book is a great road map to help us out along the way. If you are well informed, it takes a lot of anxiety out of the equation. That takes care of a major health risk already [stress and anxiety]. This book is good for you!<P>Along the same line of excellent health related information, I also strongly recommend another great book from Harvard Health Publications: "Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy" by Walter C. Willett. It is the best book on diet and nutrition I have ever read. And, that is also because it is based on scientific studies, and not on subjective opinions from egocentric blowhards.</span>

                    <span>Men are not inferior and have every capability to live as long as women,genetics not withstanding.However,too many men do not value their own health,especially in the working-class segment of society where poor diet and recreational drinking are commonplace.Many men also sacrifice their own health for the well-being of their families.To give my fellow gentlemen a little incentive,I`d like to point out that alot of man-haters are delighted at the statistics on the negative state of men`s health.They want to see the male population substantially reduced.They want to see men die early.Do you want to give them that satisfaction? Remember,no matter what women think,men can and do live long lives in many cases.I can cite many examples of north american men that have lived into their 90s and 100s.You can too.Just do your research,see your doctor without delay when you need help,watch your diet,exercise and learn to value your own body!Its the only one you`ve got! Get this book!</span>

                    <span>This book is packed with information on men's health. It covers everything from diet and exercise, through men's maladies (prostate, bladder and problems of the genitals). It covers everything in an easy-to-understand manner that includes many charts and diagrams. In particular I appreciated the section on exercise and stretching, and have revamped my exercise regimen based on this book. I am glad I got this book, and recommend it to all men.</span>

                    <span>I got the book to restore peace to my health club workouts. As my friends have turned 50, many have been asking "Dr. Joel" about prostate cancer. I'd be glad to answer, but it's not exactly my end of the body, since I'm a dentist. I read the two chapters on prostate cancer, but then I went back to read the rest of the book. I don't want to be an instant expert, but I now have a quick answer to all of the questions: read The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health for yourself. It's really an excellent book.</span>
