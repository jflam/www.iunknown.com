                    <span>I was really looking forward to reading this book. I am a nut for anything to do with the American Revolution. I'd read Brookhiser's short, concise bio on George Washington and enjoyed it very much.
<br />I was so disappointed with this book. Just looking at the cover and reading the blurbs made me expect too much I guess. 
<br />Morris was known for 3 things: losing his leg, writing the Constitution, and scoring with the ladies. How could his life be turned into a snoozefest? 
<br />Maybe it's the writing...I just finished reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton bigoraphy, which is 3 times longer than this Morris bio. It was absolutely riveting. I was sorry when I finished it; I just did not want it to end. I could not finish the Morris book fast enough; I ended up skipping pages here and there to get to Morris; he seems to be missing in his own biography. Brookhiser gave me no sense as to the kind of man Gouverneur Morris really was. 
<br />Very disappointing!</span>

                    <span>My biggest problem with the book is that I felt it was poorly written and conceived.  Morris definitely is an interesting character, and I give credit to Brookheiser for reviving his legacy, but the book has a tendency to simply relate the facts without going into background material or much analysis or synthesis.
<br />
<br />I  felt the book was rushed and not adequately researched.  Many areas need to be fleshed out better.  Morris definitely belonged to the Founding Fathers clique and had an interesting personal life.  If Brookheiser had simply delved into several periods or aspects of Morris' life, as Ellis did with American Sphinx, the book would have been better reading.
<br />
<br />Having said that, the only people who are likely to read this book are those who have already done some reading on the birth of the USA and are motivated and able to deal the way the book was written to learn about this interesting character who pops up in biographies on Hamilton, Washington, and Jefferson, etc.  </span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading Richard Brookhiser's concise character studies of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton.  Those two monumental founders have had huge numbers of biographies and studies of all kinds written about them.  This attention is well deserved, but in many ways they have become frozen monuments to the founding.  Not so Gouverneur Morris.  He is almost completely unknown outside those quite steeped in the history of the Revolution.  
<br />
<br />However, once you learn that it is his prose we read in our Constitution, that he played a vital role in financing the Revolution, and that he and his partner Robert Morris (no relation, but also a signer of the Declaration and the Constitution) actually and personally bailed out our country you will be shocked that he is so unknown to you (at least he was to me).  He was at Alexander Hamilton's bedside when he passed, he was present at the French Revolution and helped draft their constitution.  I could go on, but I will let you read the book and discover all he did and his influence in the early founding through the War of 1812.
<br />
<br />This book is a full, if concise, biography of this man who deserves to be better known.  There is a real advantage to reading about a founder who has as yet escaped becoming a marbleized image in the Pantheon of our collective imagination.  He kept a detailed journal and through it we learn much about his life, his thinking, his strengths, and very human weaknesses.  Of course, all of the founders were real flesh and blood men and women, but most have been assumed into history as much more than human.  It is good to read thoughts and words that are still quite mortal and enjoyably fallible.  
<br />
<br />I think Brookhiser has done a fine job with this book.  I do find the subtitle is a bit much, however.  Calling Gouverneur Morris a rake is more about selling books about an unknown man than telling us something essential about the man.  Yes, he did have affairs with married women who had indifferent or unfaithful husbands and did not marry until late in life.  But we really would not know about these activities without his very honest journal.  And judged by the way people live today (unfortunately), well, he was quite circumspect.
<br />
<br />You will enjoy this book.  It does have a good index and a helpful bibliography.</span>

                    <span>Most people know a little something about George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. But how many can tell you about the public life of Gouverneur Morris?
<br /> 
<br /> Whenever you quote golden words from the U.S. Constitution, chances are that you are quoting parts written by Gouverneur Morris. After many votes, the Constitutional Convention gave the task of turning the various resolutions into a cohesive, easy-to-read document. Gouverneur Morris bore the burden of doing this writing. Mr. Brookhiser did a nice job of showing the changes that Gouverneur Morris made . . . and I'm sure you will agree that they are improvements. The preamble, for example, was his: "We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility . . . ."
<br /> 
<br /> The American Revolution succeeded in large part because of the support provided by France's Louis XVI. As the French Revolution loomed, Gouverneur Morris found himself in the delicate position of being Ambassador to France. To whom was he supposed to pay attention? To whom was the United States to repay its bonds? What role could he play in trying to help friends of the American Revolution? In the process, Morris played a double role of trying to make friends with the ever-changing regimes during the French Revolution and helping America's friends avoid the guillotine. In his spare time, he courted his mistress who also played that role with the pivotal French political figure, Talleyrand. 
<br /> 
<br /> Upon his return to the United States, he found useful roles in important public projects like the Erie Canal and laying out the grid structure for New York City's streets and avenues. 
<br /> 
<br /> Morris suffered from two major physical disabilities, a withered arm as the result of being scalded as a youth and an amputated foot from a carriage accident. Despite these physical infirmities, he was able to play a continuing role in politics when he chose and to attract the wives of other men. 
<br /> 
<br /> In addition, he suffered a major mental disability, a love to hear his own voice . . . whether his ideas made sense or not. He was the most frequent orator at the Constitutional Convention, but his ideas sometimes made no sense. However, all admired his ability to turn a phrase. 
<br /> 
<br /> Although he played a role in putting the Constitution together to replace the Articles of Confederation, he also flirted with the New England secession movement during the French crisis. 
<br /> 
<br /> I would have preferred a book about Morris that went into more detail than this one did about his public life. For example, where did the language he wrote in the Constitution turn out to be important in later Supreme Court cases? What views that he expressed in all of those speeches seemed to have influenced others in close votes that occurred later? The material on his influence on the Erie Canal also seemed sketchy rather than comprehensive. 
<br /> 
<br /> There was also too much about his various private affairs compared to the public material.
<br /> 
<br /> Having just read Ron Chernow's brilliant biography of Alexander Hamilton, it was hard not to compare the two books to the detriment of this one. 
<br /> 
<br /> But if you know next to nothing about Gouverneur Morris, I'm not aware of a better book on the subject, so you should start your learning with this one.

                    </div>
                    <span>It is nice to see a new biography on a relatively neglected Founding Father, who has been portrayed (when mentioned at all) in other histories I have read as more or less a light-weight Good-Time Charlie.  Clearly a lightweight wouldn't have been entrusted to draft the Constitution, yet Morris has been left in the corner to gather dust for the last two centuries.<p>So a new biography is certainly welcome.  It is a well-written, brisk narrative, and is enjoyable enough to read, but I cannot bring myself to give it 4 stars, and it certainly doesn't merit 5 stars.  Simply put, it is just too damned short!  Not being well-acquainted with Morris, I would have hoped for a more thorough treatment, but in many ways, Morris' portrait remains half-completed in Brookhiser's hands.<p>I realize that Brookhiser is attempting to make his series on the Founding Fathers (incidentally, why only Federalists so far?) accessible to the general public, but as another reviewer observed, if you don't already have a good background in this period of history, you may be more confused than enlightened by the sparse detail in Brookhiser's treatment.<p>In this book's case, one needs to be well-versed in the history of both Revolutionary America AND Revolutionary France.  Morris' six years in France (1789-1795; Morris didn't return to the US until late 1798) gave him a unique perspective among the Founding Fathers (Monroe didn't arrive until 1794, nor Marshall until 1797) of watching the French Revolution devolve into the Reign of Terror.  In fact, Brookhiser devotes more space in his book to these six years, and if you don't know the difference between a Jacobin, a Girondist or a Montagnard you may be out of luck.<p>This is not to say that there isn't some good information in this book, especially where Morris' personal life is concerned.  The man certainly is not boring.  However, from Morris' return to the US in 1798 until his death 1816, it feels as though Brookhiser is rushing towards the finish, trying to wrap up a few loose ends as he goes along.  The period from 1798-1816 deals mostly with Morris' family life; even though Morris led the last charges of Federalism in the Senate from 1800-1803, it receives only passing notice from Brookhiser.<p>A little over 200 pages is just too condensed to be of any real use to anyone.  One doesn't need a weighty, 900-page tome to do Morris justice, but would it have killed Brookhiser to have expanded this biography to maybe 350 pages or so?</span>
