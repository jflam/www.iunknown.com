                    <span>An invaluable primary source. There are few first hand accounts of the American Revolutionary War and of those few, Martin's is the most famous. And justly so. It offers many insights into the attitudes of the day, for example when he describes the enmity that existed between the 'Yankees', such as himself, and the Pennsylvanians with which he served and says that he would as happily serve with a tribe of Western Indians as with those 'southerners'. Such comments remind us how concepts of race and nationhood evolve through the generations. There is much humour too, sometimes rather grim, such as the description of the 'tricks' that the men play on an unpopular officer, that come close to killing him. If the common soldiers' greatest enemies were hunger, cold and disease, it seems that the officers' greatest enemies were sometimes the men they commanded. It is important to remember that these are the memoirs of a man writing late in life about events in his youth, events that had already become mythologized. Half a century and a strong patriotic sense take their toll on objectivity. So this personal narrative is not a substitute for a sober academic history; it is an essential adjunct. And a damn fine read.</span>

                    <span>Joseph Plumb Martin who writes of his own experiences during the American Revolution is such an interesting and multifaceted character.  He is a true rarity as he left us a firsthand account of a private soldier in the Revolutionary War.  He is very human and suffers miserably under excruciating circumstances; yet, he is able to see the humorous side to things as well.  There seem to be so few personal accounts of the Revolutionary War, but I am thankful that his is one of the few.  Joseph is very intelligent as well, even philosophical at times.  He is gentleman enough to even have sympathy for individual British enemy soldiers who are wounded and/or dying.  He also thinks about the future and tries to give the reader many things to contemplate.  Just one of many examples are as follows:<br>"...I, with some of my comrades who were in the battle of the White plains in the year `76, one day took a ramble on the ground where we were then engaged with the British and took a survey of the place.  We saw a number of the graves of those who fell in that battle; some of the bodies had been so slightly buried that the dogs or hogs, or both, had dug them out of the ground.  The sculls [sic] and other bones, and hair were scattered about the place.  Here were Hessian sculls as thick as a bomb shell; ---poor fellows!  they were left unburied in a foreign land; ---they had, perhaps, as near and dear friends to lament their sad destiny as the Americans who lay buried near<br>them.  But they should have kept at home, we should then never have gone after them to kill them in their own country.  But, the reader will say, they were forced to come and be killed here;<br>forced by their rulers who have absolute power of life and death over their subjects.  Well then, reader, bless a kind Providence that has made such a distinction between your condition and<br>theirs.  And be careful too that you do not allow yourself ever to be brought to such an abject, servile and debased condition."<br>Please get this book and read it.  This should be required reading for every American citizen!</span>

                    <span>As someone who has sat spellbound reading the narratives of more Civil War soldiers than I can count this was my first for the Revolution. First of all and sadly, there simply are not very many. Thank God for this gem. Martin is funny. He is an excellent story-teller. He shares the hardships of the Continental (18th century vernacular for regular army) without whining. I cannot over recommend this very readable volume. As a living historian who will be presenting the struggle for independence to school kids this will be in the top five of my recommended reading lists.</span>

                    <span>It was so fun to read a book on the Revolutionary War that was from the view of the private. No huge battles here, just the day to day struggle on what he endured and why he endured all the hardships. Made me really admire the commitment they made.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the few historical accounts from a common<br>Revolutionary War soldier. Joseph Plumb Martin relates in detail <br>the events of our nation's longest war. From the winter at Valley Forge to the battle at Yorktown, the book is thrilling to read. Mr. Martin first published his narratives as Private Yankee Doodle. This book would be great for the library of those who love American history.</span>
