                <span id="Label1"><div>The passion to possess books has never been more widespread than it is today; indeed, obsessive book collecting remains the only hobby to have a disease named after it. A Gentle Madness, finalist for the 1995 National Book Critics Circle award, is an adventure among the afflicted. Richly anecdotal and fully documented, it combines the perspective of historical research with the immediacy of investigative journalism. Above all, it is a celebration of books and the people who have revered, gathered, and preserved them over the centuries.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Basbanes' book is a must for any serious bibliophile. It takes you, almost chronologically, through the history of creative collecting, from the ancient Greeks to the modern book maniac. Among others, you'll meet Samuel Pepys (he of the famous diary) and Princeton's William H. Scheide, a rich old coot who owns one of the few surviving Gutenberg Bibles. My favorites are the eccentrics, and there are plenty of them here. You know, the wackos whose houses are literally filled to the ceilings with books and nothing else. If I had the money and the chutzpah, that'd be me.</span>

                    <span>Literally anyone who enjoys reading will prize this book. I had mentioned and quoted briefly from the book on my personal page, and received questions about the work, as well as many people who said they too had the disease.<P>There is truly a Psychological condition that describes people obsessed with books, the condition is known as Bibliomania, derivatives include Bibliomaniac, and Bibliomane. The Author describes a condition of buying books you have no intention of reading. For most of us (I am afflicted) this means we buy and read books as much as we can. I have crossed over to collecting old books, and since they are in Latin, Greek, and other languages unknown to me, my defense that I will read them is weak.<P>You will read about a man who "collected" over 23,000 books from various libraries and other book outlets just to possess them. His library grew as he traveled around the Country adding to his collection. His taste was excellent and his library contained priceless volumes by the hundreds. His story illustrates how easy access is to rare books and further how they can be purloined. It is not a how to steal books section, just one amazing tale.<P>The book also documents the building/collection of some of the finest libraries in existence. The libraries are as varied as there are books. One women set out to build the definitive library of children's books, what she has collected will amaze you.<P>The attitudes of the caretakers of these works view themselves as just that, keepers for a time, their feelings about where books should be, and should never be will surprise you. What is done with many collections after the original assembler dies will also surprise you.<P>The book also educates the reader to the History of bookmaking, the few surviving Guttenberg Bibles, books from the cradle i.e. incunabula, produced prior to the year 1400ad.<P>This book will probably set you off to an antiquarian bookfair, for lovers of books it's a special experience. Hold a first edition by Galileo, see 1 page of a Guttenberg Bible that for $25,000-$30,000 can be yours. Or for the upscale shopper you can bid against Bill Gates for the Leicester Codex of Da Vinci, in round numbers bring about $40,000,000.<P>After you read the book, everything you read going forward will be enhanced. But tread carefully; the collection of old books is not an inexpensive hobby. On the other hand holding a book that is 500 years old can be a pretty heady experience.<P>Every library will be enhanced by this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Basbanes' beautifully produced book explores the sometimes strange world of book collectors throughout history - from Mark Antony's looting of 20,000 volumes from the library at Pergamum as a gift to Cleopatra's rival library in Alexandria, to the skilled career of Stephen Blumberg, who seldom washed but built his personal collection by stealing rare books from libraries all across the country. As of Basbanes' publication, he was due to get out of jail the following year.<P>In a lively anecdotal style equally reverent and irreverent, Basbanes devotes the first half of his book to the lore and history of book collections throughout the world and the second half to well-researched and even gossipy profiles of the world's foremost living collectors. A delightful book which will make a fine addition to any collection no matter how small.</span>

                    <span>And I do mean long! I thoroughly enjoyed reading about ancient/historic libraries and bibliophiles (Part One), but when I got into Part Two, I started wondering if I would ever finish the book. The stories of various book collectors and their quirks are fascinating, but they do seem to go on and on...and on. I'm tentatively looking forward to reading the next book on this theme, "Patience and Fortitude". I have the feeling that I'll need both these qualities to make it through!</span>

                    <span>It seems like such a waste of time. Any really good books will eventually be made into movies, or television specials, and you can save sooooooo much time by watching those instead. At least this book seems to agree that people who read books are stoopid or crazy, so that's pretty cool. You can just skim it and read about all the nuts who actually read books. Personally, I can't wait until this book is made into a movie, maybe starring J-Lo and Adam Sandler as two of the crazy egg-head book collectors.</span>
