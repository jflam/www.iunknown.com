                    <span>Although at first glance I was skeptical, this book provided great insight into running a meeting that participants will actually enjoy and get something out of.  It was not just a repeat of the things I already knew.  After reading this book and implementing some of the ideas, people noticed the improvements from clear agendas which stated the purpose, to the approach used during the meeting to make sure we were all aligned and in agreement on what we were to achieve.  I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I've used this book as a constant reference over the last six years while  a facilitator for BPR and Change Management projects. Although it may lack  a comprehensive array of practical exercies and techniques for all  situations that arise in meetings or during facilitated focus group  sessions, it is by far the best reference. Once you read, re-read, and  fully understand the basics that Doyle and Straus are presenting, you can  modify and add your own experience and methods.</span>
