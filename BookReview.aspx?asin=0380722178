Although labeled, at times, deaf, retarded, or disturbed, Donna Williams is autistic--afflicted by a baffling condition of heightened sensory perception that imprisons the sufferer in a private, almost hallucinatory universe of patterns and colors. <I>Nobody Nowhere </I>is Donna's story in her own words--a haunting, courageous memoir of the titanic struggles she has endured in her quest to merge "my world" with "the world."</span>

This woman becomes a teacher in the end, despite being discriminated against by one of the teachers. (The only teacher at the teacher's college who knows she has the disorder ,a cautionary tale to those who consider revealing their "disorders" to those who have power over them.)<BR>There is so much in depth information about what autism feels like and the way in which autistics and those whith disorders on the autistic spectrum see and experience life compared to the way in which others do.<BR>As a sufferer of Attention Deficit Disorder myself I could relate to the way in which Donna experienced the world differently from others even though my experiences and problems are different. My friend with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder also really related even though her problems are very different. So I would recommend these two books to anyone suffering with a neurological disability, learning disability or mental disorder.<BR>The reviewer who insists this book is about child abuse is very blinkered in their thinking.<BR>Williams makes it VERY clear that she does not belive that her mother's abuse caused her autistic symptoms and in fact says it is a blessing that her mother was not the type to hug her a lot because as an autistic with sensory troubles who finds touch very uncomfortable she finds hugs physically painful.<BR>Certainly a loving family could have helped her find help for her problems sooner however.</span>

                    <span>I read this book with no baggage - I don't know much about autism and don't know autictic people. I was simply interested in hearing about the disorder from the inside, so to speak.<P>I found her writing compelling. Her use of language is extraordinary - she seems to be bright and aware. And the narrative of her hideous home life as a child - and into her adult years as well - is the stuff of real tragedy.<P>But I was frustrated because I wanted to know WHY she did what she did, and I didn't feel that the book answered those questions. What drew her into her obsessive relationships, and why did she allow herself to drift into those manipulative and destructive sexual relationships? Lack of self-esteem doesn't tell the entire story - I wanted to know what was going through her mind when she allowed herself to be subjected again and again to pick-your-adjective abuse. There was a certain repetitiveness to her narrative, but it added heat, not light. Hence three stars.<P>In spite of that, I recommend this book to anyone with any interest at all in autism - Ms. Williams' willingness to expose the intimate details of her life inside her head is admirable and fascinating.</span>

                    <span>Wow! I have a son with high-functioning autism, so I read everything on the subject. I've read technical books, personal accounts and everything in-between. But NO book, before Nobody Nowhere, could tell me what it's really like to be autistic. Donna Williams has an amazing gift for writing and describing her experiences in living detail. I was so engrossed in this book; I could hardly put it down. Williams' is a haunting story, but one that now serves to help others. I am so grateful she wrote this book!</span>
