                    <span>I was thoroughly enthralled, gripped and engaged in this story of three generations of the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. The story begins in 1863 with the baptism of John Francis Fitzgerald in Boston and concludes almost 100 years later with the inauguration of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The families' roots are traced back to the great immigration following the Irish potato famine in the 1840's. From immigration to becoming the American royal family in just three generations is a remarkable achievement that is chronicled in fascinating detail in this comprehensive, definitive narrative. 
<br />
<br />Even though it is more than 800 pages, the book is not a dry history text, but rather an intriguing glimpse into the lives of the charmed and sometimes tragic lives of this huge Irish Catholic clan. Nothing is omitted, from the affairs of Joseph Kennedy, to the flirtations of Kathleen, the appalling lobotomy of Rosemary, and the sexual antics of John F. Kennedy. The political shenanigans of the elder Fitzgerald provide an interesting examination of Boston politics in the early 1900's...rife with graft and insider manipulation.  
<br />
<br />The author's writing style is rich, powerful and mesmerizing. For instance, to describe the ascent of JFK into the limelight of American politics, she writes: "For his capacity to arouse the questing imagination of his fellow citizens, and of much of the world beyond America's borders, was to elevate the family saga past the borders of mythology. By the beginning of the fifties he already contained all the elements which his leadership was to be compounded, forged in tumultuous experience, anchored and given direction by his often resented but always unbreakable links to his extraordinary family."
<br />
<br />The level of detail and insightful analysis into the complex characters and relationships in the family is well worth your investment of time in reading this tome. A book you won't soon forget. 
<br />

                    <span>This is by far the BEST book about the young Kennedys. It tells about the history of the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. Even if you haven't got the slightest interest in the Kennedys or dislike them, READ THIS BOOK! And if you like the Kennedys YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE THIS IN YOU COLLECTION! There are so cute and adorable photos!! Never seen them elsewhere! I really hope that Goodwin will write another book about the following years, because this book stops in 1960. This is such a good book!!<p>p.s. Buy the other edition, this one hasn't got any photos.</span>

                    <span>A note to Mr. Kerwick and to "thomasmcgauley" regarding their opinions of The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys: An American Saga -- to rate a book poorly based on your opinion of the author is not necessarily the purpose of these Spotlight reviews.  These reviews are intended to provide interested readers with information regarding the quality of the work -- and that's where an opinion is involved.  It sounds like you've prejudged this novel according your dislike of the author and subject.  How about an opinion of the book?  Was it well written?  Most certainly.  Was it informative?  You bet.  Would I recommend it to someone who didn't hate the author or the Kennedys and who wanted a riviting account of American history -- it's ups and downs and good and bad?  That's what the stars represent.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book, but also felt the author is a little to close to the subject, and has not much objectivity. Also, I think, being it's a book about the Fitzgeralds, she should have cribbed a few passages from The Great Gatsby. I would loved to have been reading about old Papa Kennedy conning Gloria Swanson, and discovered he had "temporarily lost interest in the abortve sorrows and short winded elations of men." If you're going to steal, Doris, might as well go the whole hog.</span>
