                    <span>I enjoyed this movie a lot... went to the IMAX theater 3 times to see it! The cinematography is terrific... some totally unbelievable views. Made me want to go and climb the thing (sabbatical coming next summer)! Anyone who likes the mountains/hiking/climbing should see it... go to the IMAX to see it first, then order the DVD.<P>I agree that they could have spent more time showing the climbers personal experiences. There was a "Naked Planet" special on Kili that was on PBS a couple of years ago, that did it much better.<P>Just a few clarifications to som of the other reviews: the approach is via the Machame Route, but the summit climb is via the Great Western Breach, which is the most difficult trekking route on the mountain. The route that is known as the Coca-cola route, is the Marangu route, which is the most popular route on the mountain, that also has the highest failure rate, because it ascends too fast.</span>

                    <span>This DVD makes climbing Kili look like a hike in the park, and those who think it is, should try summitting via Arrow Glacier. It does have beautiful scenic shots, though.</span>

                    <span>Having seen this film after climbing Kili I found it brought back great memories and I would recommend it for those having climbed and planning to climb. Potential climbers should not expect trekking tips but will get a sense of the mountain. I think that the more critical reviews of this film are unfair. The implication that anyone could summit given 6 weeks and a staff of 150 is true, but planned properly most normal people can as well. It should also be noted that film maker -David Breashears- has reached the summit of Everest at least 4 times so how 'clean' the climbers look needs to be kept in context. Kili is not a technical climb, in fact it's a relatively simple hike, whose challenge stems from each individuals reaction to the altitude. That accessibility makes Kili everyman's mountain. From age 12 to 72, if you have the bug to summit and impressive peak, are reasonably fit, and brave enough travel to the other side of the world, then Kili is the perfect adventure for you and this film should only serve to whet your appetite.</span>

                    <span>I climbed Kilimanjaro in November 2002 via the Machame route, which this film depicts. (One of the other reviewers referes to the Machame route as the "Coca-Cola" route, that is the Marangu route. I think it was a oversight.) <P>I found the film to bring back a lot of memories and did a good job of capturing the sights of the mountain. If you are climbing Kilimanjaro, it's a no-brainer. Buy this movie. <P>The movie does not do a good job at showing the difficulty of the climb. But, that's not why you should be buying this movie. If my memory serves me, it was filmed over 6 weeks and with a support crew of 150 people. My 82 year old grandmother could climb Kilimanjaro at that pace. <P>The reason to watch this movie is to learn about the mountain and so see some of the stunning sights. Breashears does and excellent job capturing the mountain's beauty.</span>

                    <span>I write this review as a recent trekker who successfully reached the top twice while leading groups up the easier Machame or Coca Cola Route. I saw the film with wonderful anticipation and was struck by the sheer majesty of the mountain, its surroundings and people-all nicely portrayed in the film. The images brought back wonderful memories of the two climbs and the sheer joy of reaching the top. <P>The film, however, was most disappointing because it did not convey the magnitude of the support team that went along with us carrying our food, water, cooking utensils and bedding. Only once or twice in the film did you catch a glimpse of the support team. We trekked with nearly three support personnel for each trekker. The accurate portrayal of the support team would have given real meaning to the scope of the climb.<P>The climbers themselves, for the most part, looked as if they stepped just out of the shower. This again tended to diminish the seriousness and difficulty of their accomplishment. At breathtaking altitude ,the pardon the pun, I rarely saw them gasping for air or working hard to reach the top.<P>Perhaps, I was not in the same shape as these people, but I must confess that after seeing more than 200 trekkers over the two climbs (we shared meals and stories at the base camps and passed each other going up and down the mountain), few if any looked as sparkling as these trekkers.<P>The story of the climbers appeared contrived and the scenery wondrous. My hats off to the individuals who made it to the top.</span>
