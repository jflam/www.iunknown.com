                    <span>I have been pushing the envelope of FrontPage's capabilities for the past several years on my website, www.TrainingCity.com .  
<br />
<br />Over the years I have become very familiar with FrontPage.  When a friend asked for a recommendation for a FrontPage book that could take a person from "beginner to expert" I looked at a number of possible texts.  
<br />
<br />After reviewing several I came to the conclusion that this text was the overall best book to buy and keep.  It covers everything Frontpage can do and provides a very well written set of explanations and examples.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a terrific manual for FrontPage 2003, good not only as a first book and introduction to the program for a new user, but also for more experienced authors looking for advanced instruction and advice for using more sophisticated techniques.  I find it to be an invaluable reference as I expand and add features to my website.</span>

                    <span>This book could be the most expensive doorstop I ever bought.  The Aurthur is probably a very competent programmer, but he is a horrible author.  My wife bought me this book and she thought it would be helpful because it had lots of pictures, but it turns out the pictures were merely screen shots of dialog boxes.  I guess the best way to catergorize this book is this:  There is a lot of information in this book, but very little knowledge.</span>

                    <span>I judge all technical books based upon return on investment. If a book saves me time, that has value. I assess the value at $25 per hour of time saved, so I break even on a $50 book if I save 2 hours. I broke even on this book before I left the bookstore. I chose 5 topics, looked them up in the index, and read the reference. I learned something new and useful on 2 out of the 5 topics, enough so that I immediately was able to accomplish a task that had stumped me. I looked at four other books while I was in the store and none addressed my 5 topics. I've had the book for a week and it's helped me move along on many other issues. Before I had the book, I was using online help, Microsoft's materials at the FrontPage site, and other sites around the Web, none of which helped. 'Inside Out' is a winner.</span>

                    <span>I found this book very helpful. I am new to web design (fairly large amount of prior computer experience) and have found that with your book, I have been able to get up and running very quickly in FrontPage. I am well on my way to developing a website for my existing bricks and mortar business and a site for a new web-based business, all in a few days working between my other obligations. Thanks for a great product.</span>
