                    <span>This should be a must-read for all people in their late 20's who are ready to take that next step into adulthood.  This book taught me a lot about myself and showed me the experiences and problems I've had lately have been problems people and organizations have gone through for years.  I learned to trust my intuition, go with my gut, understand my own feelings, and, most importantly, I now have a clear understanding of other people's feelings.  Emotions and feelings drive the human spirit, not formulas and procedures.  I had been trained that emotions were bad for decisions, but you can't make a decision without emotions.  Above all else, this book shows to be successful in life, IQ is helpful, but EQ is the secret.  THIS IS A MUST READ !!!!</span>

                    <span>I was very concerned, whether "Emotional Intelligence" can be descibed with words. Especially, when many authors tend to praise themselves and how important their subject is. However, this book is as good as it gets! Even chapters like "Intuitive Flow" are concrete and easy to understand. Furthermore, many examples and citations are taken from bussiness cases and really help to connect the topic with your working life.<p>Actually, I even bougth a second copy to give it to interested collegues.</span>

                    <span>I read the translation of this book in september 1997.  The thing I like about the book is the test (EQ map) - in fact, I recommend buying the book for taking the test.  The book itself isn't that great, especially the link between the test and the rest of the book is ratther weak (to say the least). A more extensive review can be found on my website, 7EQ.com. Conclusion: if you want to test your EQ, buy this book.  If you want to develop it, look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Robert Cooper's book is heads above all the other enmotional intelligence  books on the market. The others empahasize to much theory. This author is  heavy on practical proven approaches that are based on people be authentic  with one another and working together. Granted this book may not be for  those who don't have the guts to push themelves to grow to heights not even  mentioned in typical management theories. Honesty, putting the customer  first, being genuinine, etc... have all but become  extinct today. Robert  Cooper's book issue's a challenge to all of us. To be the best means  competing against your own standards so you can best serve your customers  first and making a profit helps you do that better. Bravo Dr. Cooper.</span>

                    <span>Reading through this book, I found myself repeatedly saying, "yes, that's exactly how I feel", or "ha! that's the way things ought to be.". This book clearly indicates what is wrong with the work  culture of today. It also explains why, despite making good money, people  still feel unsatisfied or incomplete. It gives you a good understanding of  how to be a more complete and honest person/employee/manager. A must read  for all those who are caught up in today's "intellectual and  rationality first" work culture.  A must read for all those who feel  they are doing good, challenging, rewarding work and yet feel an immense  sense of emptiness/hopelessness.  Damn good book.....!</span>
