                    <span>Colorado is a maze of 4x4 trails and a Mecca for four-wheelers from around the country. You could spend a bunch of time rounding up the maps to navigate the Colorado outback, but you'd still be shooting blind in many ways. Not only does Charles Wells give you detailed and accurate directions, he clues you in to the difficult spots on the trails and offers you advice on how to surmount them. This book picks up where Volume 1 of his Colorado guide leaves off, and between the two books, every trail worth 'wheeling in Colorado is documented. The only ones excluded are those that might have been opened after the book was published and a couple of the most hellish that are best left to rock buggies. As is usual for Wells, the book is easy to carry, easy to use and as accurate as a sharpshooter's rifle. I've four-wheeled Colorado extensively and when the opportunity came to review this book for a magazine story, I figured I could give this book a thorough "test drive." I did, and it passed with flying colors. It actually got to the point where I left all my other printed navigation aids behind when I went 'wheeling in Colorado and simply threw in my dog-eared copies of Colorado Backroads and 4-wheel Drive Trails, volumes 1 and 2. Consider these "one-stop shopping" for a useful guide to the Colorado 'wheeling hotspots.</span>

                    <span>I planned my entire Colorado vacation around the information in this book. It allowed me to see the Colorado that is not visible from the highway. The author's advice and trail difficulty ratings gave me the opportunity to explore a great number of ghost towns in a time frame that would not have otherwise been possible. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering leaving the road to see the real Colorado.</span>

                    <span>Generous use of B/W photos, excellent grid and area maps, and a very educational Introduction. Trails are listed by Area, Difficulty and Alphabetically including author's favorite trails. The Trail Descriptions are very detailed so you don't get lost. If you only buy one Guide, this is the one to get.</span>

                    <span>"Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails" is a must-have for 4-wheeling enthusiasts heading into the back country of Colorado. Charles Welles is a conscientous author that provides a "no surprises" description of Colorado trails. The desription of trails in this book have proven very accurate in my trips to Colorado trails. This book gives the reader a great awareness of the trail conditions and hazards. Charles Welles adds historical information and scenic attributes valuable for trail selection. The only improvement would be Mr. Welles leading the way!</span>
