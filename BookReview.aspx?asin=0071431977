                    <span>"Beyond the Shadow of the Senators'' is a must read for any serious student of baseball history. The author put a massive amount of research into this engaging account, of which I knew nothing even though I grew up in Washington not long after these events took place. This is an outstanding work in every regard. I have never met the author and I am not an African-American (not that anybody should care); I am just a fan of baseball and its history. If you are, too: Read this book. </span>

                    <span>This is a great, and true-to-life (i.e., "complex") story about the institution of 'Negro' League baseball and the various parties who profited and railed against it.<p>Key people that are introduced and brought to life are:<br>Buck Leonard, Satchel Paige, and Josh Gibson -- three of the greatest ballplayers who ever lived;<br>Clark Griffith -- the pioneering, penurious and controlling owner of the Washington Senators;<br>Sam Lacy -- the ahead-of-his-time, DC-native who tirelessly advocated for the integration of Major League Baseball; as well as<br>Cum(berland) Posey -- the shrewd owner of the Homestead Grays -- the dominant team of the loosely confederated Negro Leagues during the late 30's and 40's.<p>Tangential to this story are:<br>the decimation of the post 1933 Senators, mostly due to finances and an inadequate ballpark;<br>the relative prosperity of Washington DC during the years of the depression and WWII and the partial equality of African-American government workers that led to a vibrant culture and ability to spend on entertainment;<br>the move by Posey and his "partner" (many of the Negro League baseball teams were financed by numbers entreprenuers) to Washington from their Pittsburgh home and the welcome of their rental payments and gate pctgs. by Clark Griffith;<br>Judge Landis' death, the increasing awareness of America's incongruity in its fight for freedom and democracy in Europe while maintaining a virtual apartheid culture at home; and<br>the greed/opportunity of baseball owners to find the best talent at the lowest price which ultimately led to Rickey's "great experiment");<p>This book also fleshes out the background and conflict around Jackie Robinson, who was rightly judged to be a great man and the right vehicle for Rickey's efforst, and the shared opinions that he was a good, but not all-time great Negro baseball player.  [Check out how well a 42-yr old Satchel Paige pitched for the World Championship Indians in 1948.]<p>The shifts in attitude between "separate but equal" and complete integration by the various parties reveal primarily self-interest.  Judged by the standards of our time, I share many others' great respect for Sam Lacy and his tireless, moral advocacy and feel sorry for the Negro League baseball owners who were mostly left with nothing as they rarely had enforceable contracts that protected their relationship with their players.<p>Clark Griffith was an "innovator" in attracting inexpensive talent from Cuba.  Many of these players represented themselves well on the ballfield but would only be acceptable if they were of "Spanish" descent.<p>Utterly inconceivable now, but the norm for over 60 years (since Cap Anson helped institute the "gentleman's agreement" against employment of African Americans in the early 1880's) was to allow a Major or Minor League ballclup to employ pretty much anyone (Swedes, Germans, Irish, Italians, Jews, etc.) anyone, except African-Americans.<p>It has often been discussed that without Jackie Robinson (& the parts played by Branch Rickey, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Ben Chapman, etc.) the 1954 "Brown vs. Board of Education" decision would not have happened as quickly.<p>This book provides a wonderful companion story to the integration of major league baseball which, in my opinion, is one of the most significant stories of 20th Century United States.</span>

                    <span>After reading "Beyond the Shadow of the Senators", I'm ready for season's tickets and let's play ball!  While having only heard the names Monarchs, Homestead Grays, Stars and a few other teams, I really knew very little about them.  While not a Washingtonian, I have lived in this area for thirty years and missed seeing the Senators by just this much.  However, I think the team I really and truely missed seeing was the Homestead Grays.  And as I read through the book, one particular player became my favorite, Mr. Buck Leonard.  Mr Synder has provided an exceptional and thoroughly well researched book.  Yes, it is about the Grays, the Senators, Griffith, Posey, economics,  statistics and the integration of baseball, all made wonderfully readable, but Mr. Leonard stands out above them all.  He and his teammates are a living, breathing part of the history of Washington, DC.  And thank you to Mr Synder for giving them life once again.</span>

                    <span>Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.  Looking at the display window of the Stall and Dean store in Seattle, Washington, my eye was drawn by the magnificent photo of the Homestead Grays on the dust jacket of Brad Snyder's book, Beyond the Shadow of the Senators. I cannot honestly say that I recognized any of the players in the photo but the picture evoked a time when baseball, in both its black and white versions, was played exclusively on diamonds of grass and dirt in ballparks that did not shut out the sky. I went into the store and purchased the book.<br>     Brad Snyder's book focuses on black baseball in Washington D.C. from the arrival of the Homestead Grays from Pittsburgh in 1940 through and beyond the integration of the major leagues by Jackie Robinson in 1947. The push and shove to integrate baseball-- and a mighty push and shove it was-- is the main theme of the book. Black journalist Sam Lacy and others pushed to integrate the game and were met by the desperate shove of the baseball establishment to keep the major leagues white. Sadly when integration came to baseball, the Grays and the black newspapers that covered the team fell into  eclipse.<br>     Brad Snyder's main strength as a writer is his ability to portray three dimensional characters.  The best description of Branch Rickey I have ever read is on page 217 of Snyder's book: "Wesley Branch Rickey talked like a preacher and ran his baseball team like a card shark." The  main characters in the book, Clark Griffith, Sam Lacy, and Buck Leonard, all emerge as complex human beings rather than stick figure heroes or villians.<br> No one in his right mind would want to go back to the days of the Grays. That being said, something has been lost from a time when black people--- and for that matter even white people like Clark Griffith-- owned and ran baseball teams. That lost time, with its warts as well as its beauty, is  splendidly recreated in Brad Snyder's Beyond the Shadow of the Senators. I recommend that anyone, baseball fan or not, read his book.</span>
