                    <span>Explaining China is a favorite avocation of many Chinese in the West. They usually state that Chinese and Western values are opposed, and that Chinese values are not only different but superior. This fairly typical book can be straightforward and informative, particularly when the author discusses the decision-making process in China and warns that 'yes' and 'no' probably don't mean what the average, unsubtle American understands them to mean. But stay skeptical of the author's generalizations about Chinese (Dragon) and Western (Cowboy) motivations. He stresses the supposed "collective" disposition of Chinese, but anyone with China experience will wonder just how "collective" the Chinese really are. In an often-used saying, the Chinese compare themselves to grains of sand - to emphasize their difficulty in getting together and cooperating. Sometimes the book describes fact, and sometimes fantasy that Chinese wish were fact. It can be as useful to know a people's fantasies as it is to know their facts so, properly read, we find this book to be a useful addition to the bibliography on doing business in China. (There are, by the way, some annoying proofreading errors, most egregiously the erroneous pinyin spelling of the Chinese word for face.)</span>

                    <span>Dr. Lee offers thought provoking insights and recommendations on doing business in Asia, based upon years of personal experience. Interesting contrasts of Asian and Western cultures help to explain the different approaches to business. His advice on the important subjects of negotiation and conflict resolution provide valuable guidance on how to avoid common misunderstandings and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. This book is great for those interested in doing business in China and is recommended reading by the nation's top business school.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Lee covers a lot of subject matter in Cowboys and Dragrons. This is not a travel or "how to" book. This is a hands on reference piece that aims at breaking down cultural myths between the U.S. and China that have historically promulgated misunderstanding between the two countries. Dr. Lee emphasizes the necessity of having a historical and cultural understanding of the United States and China before entering into or embarking on business dealings between the two countries. He poses philisophical questions to the reader in order to uncover fundamental truths about human relationships. Furthermore, he provides practical advice on how to make a U.S./China business deal work to the benefit of BOTH sides.<P>If you ever wondered why Chinese bow and avoid direct eye contact versus the American norm of firm handshakes and looking someone squarely in the eye or how to better understand the nuances of business language among both cultures, this book will explain it all.<P>Cowboys and Dragons will surely become a must read among business school students, entrepreneurs, executives, and individuals that plan or or are currently doing business in China. Keep this book handy.</span>
