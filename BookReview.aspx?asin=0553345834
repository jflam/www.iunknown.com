                    <span>This is a great book that gives good insights on business acumen and common sense. Where the book falters, however, is at the central theme of the book. He claims "selling" is what they don't teach you at Harvard Business School. It is obvious that the author does not know whole lot about selling either. He tries to teach sales techniques that are amateurish and perhaps what they DO teach at Harvard Business School. Otherwise, it is a good book.</span>

                    <span>This book is somewhat over-rated. Some of the chapters are just common sense. But there are also some tricks in 'sales'. The book emphasizes on silence and importance of the silence in negotiation.</span>

                    <span>This is a story book! I usually give books the benefit of the doubt but this book flat out sux. All this guy talks about is how he is some hot shot sports agent and the lessons he supposedly learned through the years. Let me tell you something, this book got old after the 2nd chapter. Every F'in paragraph has to do with one of his golf clients and bla bla bla. Its ridiculous. The title is true, they dont teach this at Harvard because they're stories of an individuals life which completely put me to sleep. But im not going to leave without giving some positives, like saying you should check out Automatic millionaire and the 12 critical factors books. Those are worth reading. Peace in the middle east!</span>

                    <span>The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world. Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows. This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge.</span>

                    <span>This means reading people from the moment that you see or hear them, while you slow down, and place yourself fully in the moment, as you anticipate the future.<P>To do this you must have a good grip on who you are, and be more than okay with that.<P>While you have that, it's important to know the players involved in your business interaction - those present, and those not present. So, do your homework.<P>My favorite message, from this book, which I have used as a quote in published articles is, "If you alienate your peeers, you won't have to worry about corporate enemies."<P>Read this book to balance being yourself, and being a person amongst business people.</span>
