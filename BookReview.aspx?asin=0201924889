                <span id="Label1">This exceptionally useful text offers Scott Myers's expertise in C++ class design and programming tips. The second edition incorporates recent advances to C++ included in the ISO standard, including namespaces and built-in template classes, and is required reading for any working C++ developer.<p> The book opens with some hints for porting code from C to C++ and then moves on to the proper use of the <I>new</I> and <I>delete</I> operators in C++ for more robust memory management. The text then proceeds to class design, including the proper use of constructors, destructors, and overloaded operator functions for assignment within classes. (These guidelines ensure that you will create custom C++ classes that are fully functional data types, which can be copied and assigned just like built-in C++ classes.)<p> The author also provides a handful of suggestions for general class design, including strategies for using different types of inheritance and encapsulation. Never doctrinaire and always intelligent, these guidelines can make your C++ classes more robust and easier to maintain. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Memorize this book and it will take less time than all the wasted hours you spent debugging your C++ code.  Read this book to prepare for a job interview, and you will look like a Guru.  I have read this book three times, and it is emminently practical for making you a better programmer.
<br />
<br />The C++ programming language can be characterized as a language that gives you enough rope to hang yourself with.  Sometimes I wonder why I program in it at all.  But at least this book exists to help you do it right.
<br />
<br />The only criticism I have seen of the book is the often cited example of using the "this" pointer to have an object delete itself.  Okay, lots of people don't agree with Mr. Meyers attempt to justify this, but that is a small issue.  There is a ton of good advice.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most useful and knowledgeable books on the pitfalls of developing in C++ that I have ever read. This book is not for the beginner developer since most of the items covered here refer to advanced topics such as customer memory management and C++ object oriented best practices. I'd recommend reading some basic C++ syntax based books such as "C++ How to Program" or "C++ from the Ground Up" and then reading some OOAD conceptual books such as "The Object-Oriented Approach: Concepts, Systems Development, and Modeling with UML" or "The Rational Unified Process Made Easy: A Practitioner's Guide to Rational Unified Process" to get introduced to concepts. This book goes great with its follow-up book "More Effective C++".</span>

                    <span>Simply put, one of the best, if not THE best, books I have ever read on C++ (or any language).  Assumes the reader knows the basics of the language.  The writing style is engaging and witty.  The material is immediately useful in any C++ development and is quantized into easily digestible chunks.  I have been reading one or two sections ("items") each day at work.  I look forward to reading Volume 2.</span>
