                    <span>This grammar handbook is concise and so EASY TO USE! It has all the essential reference information that you need when you are writing an essay or professional letter. Everything is clearly laid out and well-explained. Many grammar books are thick, heavy, and intimidating--filled with information that will never be read. Who wants to read a grammar book? They are for reference, not reading! This is a small paperback with a spiral binding so it lays flat. I teach freshman composition and introduction to literature classes, and I always assign this book to my students. P.S. If you want a small grammar book that you can actually read, check out THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF COLLEGE WRITING by Michael Harvey. I have my students buy both; Hacker for reference, and Harvey to read.</span>

                    <span>`The Pocket Style Manual' compiled by Diana Hacker is one of the most useful tools for student and professional writing available.  One of the more confusing aspects of writing for many students (and those beyond student level) is the range of styles for citation, organisation and structure in texts.  Different schools and different professions expect their own styles to be applied - just what is the difference between MLA (Modern Language Association) and APA (American Psychological Association) style, anyway?  This book provides the answer in short, easy-to-use fashion.<p>The first section of Hacker's text goes over the basics of good writing - grammar, clarity, punctuation, and essential mechanics such as capitalisation, abbreviation, numbers, etc.  This is not a guide that will teach the reader, but rather serve as a reminder, refresher, and quick ready-reference guide for those who (usually at the deadline and in a hurry) need information quickly to finish their assignments and projects.<p>The three primary styles presented for organising and documenting a research paper are MLA, APA and Chicago - the majority of papers done in sciences, social sciences, humanities and arts are expected to be done in one of these three styles (there are yet other styles, lesser used, as well as foreign styles, but these are relatively rare in the United States).  Each section of style shows cover pages, sample pages of text, footnote/endnote formats, as well as the many levels of documentation and citation of sources required.  Even with the dozens of documentary examples for sources from books, articles, journals, newspapers, videos, lectures, internet and more, there are always new situations arising that make documentation problematic.  This guide does not solve every citation problem, but will solve the vast majority of them.<p>In the conclusion, there are glossaries of usage, grammatical terms, and a list of style manuals for more in-depth work.  Perhaps the one omission here (somewhat surprising to me, given its wide usage in colleges) is that Turabian's `Manual for Writers of Term Papers' is not included in this list.<p>Overall, the design and format of this book is very useful, incredibly handy, and makes it one that I keep readily available for consultation whenever I write for academic purposes.</span>

                    <span>I have taught high school junior English for 16 years, and Hacker's manual is the best I've found...by far.  <p>First, since many schools have abandoned grammar altogether, many students have little grasp on basic skills.  This manual allows students to take a refresher course, complete with detailed examples.  Also, this manual helps students with tedious writing strategies that are not taught in some schools. For example, voice, tense, person and tone are all covered, as well as transitions, introductions and effective conclusions.  It's easy to read and understand.  Finally, in the area of research, MLA, APA and Chicago are all covered.  In this fashion, one can compare and easily see the differences each style requires.  Often, a student is taking 3 different classes that require 3 different formats.  This book succinctly transcends from one to the next.<p>An invaluable section is that of citations.  It teaches how to cite, how to avoid plagiarism, and also how to integrate quotations into your paper.  Many students don't know how to paraphrase, as some teachers allow copying straight from the encyclopedia to the notebook paper!   This book show you how!Finally, for the visually dependent, Hacker includes a sample page of a title page,works cited page, and a first page.  <p>A final note in this computer age, Hacker keeps up with the Internet and helps the student with any and all websites and databases.  This alone is invaluable.  Be sure you get the most updated version.  This is the third edition, and I have all my juniors use it.  I call it our "mini bible."</span>

                    <span>Lets say you're a business or a psychology major and you're working on a history minor.  Did you know these academic disciplines all write in different styles?  What to do? Get this book!  While some professors will let you cite in your field, they're more likely to give you a better grade if you cite in the style of their discipline.<p>Therefore, you're only going to benefit by having this manual.  Whatever style you end up writing in, all the writing formats are easily spelled out for you.  Furthermore, if you're a visual learner, there are sample papers at the end of each section for clarification.<p>In addition to being a reference manual for the different styles, "A Pocket Style Manual," also includes sections on clarity, grammar, punctuation, mechanics, research sources, usage and grammatical terms.  All are in an easily to find, readable and understandable formats.<p>Overall, an excellent choice for undergraduate students who will be taking courses in many different disciplines.</span>

                    <span>Good little book, but I'll take her full version any day for upper COLLEGE LEVEL and grad school level work ("A Writer's Reference"), even at twice the price.  It's been worth every dollar I paid for it and then some!  I've used many ref guides: Ms. Hacker outstrips them all by light years.<br>But this little guy is very handy, and will get you where you need to go with citations and such as long as you're into basics. PERFECT for high schoolers and for freshmen/sophs in college, but beyond that:  GET THE BIG BOOK ("A Writer's Reference")! It's too good to pass up!</span>
