                    <span>I have read over a dozen books on the java and this by far the best one for learning the language in its entirety.  Obviously, this book can't cover everything but it gives a very thorough and in-depth introduction.  If you can only have one book on java 2, make this the one you pick. Many other books on the subject waste tons of space with simple examples that aren't very informative.  This book cuts through the nonsense and gives you all it can in its 700 pages.  Great explanations, Great Code Samples, all around top notch.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a very useful resource for the Certification. The questions and mock exam were closer in quality and difficulty to the actual exam compared to other mock exams.  I found quite a few other mock exams on the web to be misleading about how difficult the exam would be and also about what type of questions would be asked.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book in addition to another Java cert book (The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide). While the other book was like a Java Cert for dummies and was straight to the point (gave u just what u need and nothing more), this book was more like a java textbook geared around certification. It had alot more indepth info than was needed for the exam. If your a true java nerd and you enjoy reading textbook type books, this is your certification book. If your someone in a hurry and just wanna pass the exam with a superfical knowledge of exam material, then some of the other books might be a better option. <p>Overall, Good book. Gave info needed to pass the exam, and will be kept on the bookshelf nearby now that exam is over.</span>

                    <span>This is the most technical book I have read on the Java programming language.  The book has only a few typos which is<br>pretty amazing since it is so technical.  I do not recommend using this as an initial learning tool, however, once you have read the basic intro stuff, this book will get you to the other side.  Great book for the exam too.</span>

                    <span>Like many reviewers here, I passed Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 1.4 Platform exam yesterday on the first try - thanks to this book. It's an excellent resource in preparation for the exam. Very thorough coverage of all required aspects.<p>The book even goes beyond exam objectives as it covers advanced topics extensively (enjoyed inner classes coverage). Test question s at the end of each topic are tough but really test your understanding of the material.<p>For 1.4 exam, make sure to get a chapter on assertions from book's web site.<br> Book's mock engine is a little tougher than one on the actual exam - make sure you score high on mock engine before taking the real test.<p>This was the only book I used in preparation for the exam and it was enough. To succeed on the exam, take lots of online test simulators - that's the key!<p>In my opinion, to befefit the most from the book you need to have some programming experience as this is not an entry level book.<p>Will definitely keep this book as a reference resource.<p>Michael</span>
