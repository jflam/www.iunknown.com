                    <span>If you like filling lists and pro-forma negotiating "tools" go ahead, plenty of scope for a stiff wrist here, but if you are looking for a book that will really prepare you for a negotiation, forget it. <p>The problem with books on negotiation is that most are either desriptions of the deals the author(s) clinched (self-aggrandizing), where a common fallacy is made ("It worked for me, therefore it will work for you") or soooo boring and uninspiring, that you would rather read a bus timetable to get some inspiration and motivation (without which you will not be a good negotiator, despite hundreds of check-lists you may make).<p>This work fits into the second category. I suspect,as with most "workbooks" and sequels to relatively successful first works (such as "Getting to Yes"), that these quick follow-ups are mostly an attempt to capitalize and piggy-back on the previous work and "strike while the iron is hot" by regurgitating the same idea over and over.<p>Read it (pardon, fill it in) if you have nothing better to do.</span>

                    <span>Although many of the strategies and prinicples in the book point out obvious everyday issues, it is helpful to see them in black & white.  The book's techniques are actually quite simple and useful, but you must  have determination for it to be effective.  Confidence is something you  can't gain just by reading a book; however, at least you can avoid some  basic mistakes.  Overall a very good book.</span>
