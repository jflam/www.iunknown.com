                    <span>This phrasebook is better than most for people who know no Russian (or very little) and who want to try to communicate with Russians. It is full of positive messages about trying, and it opens with a concise explanation of Russian grammar. Russian grammar is not something you can just master easily, but it helps to at least have an idea of how the language works - it makes more sense than just blindly memorizing phrases. The main advantage of this phrasebook it that it truly tells you the easiest way to get your point across. These are phrases that beginners actually can learn and use. Many phrasebooks are full of long sentences that are difficult to reproduce if you have little knowledge of the language, but Lonely Planet is not one of them. It also gives helpful information on how to make substitutions in the book's stock phrases, and it encourages you to put together your own word combinations. Two other good points: it's relatively low cost (a good price to value ratio) and it's pocket sized, so you can easily take it around with you on a trip. The topics covered are useful, everyday ones. In fact, there is more packed into this small book than most people will need. The dictionary is also pretty extensive. Two other things to take into consideration before purchasing this phrasebook: 1) the Lonely Planet series is geared up for young people - many of the expressions and words in the book are clearly targeted to college students and other young folks, which may be off-putting to older users, and 2) there are MANY typos and reversals in the phrasebook (did anyone actually proofread it? ). If you know absolutely no Russian, you will not recognize that these are typos and/or wrong words. This may leave you saying something other than what you think you are saying!</span>

                    <span>If you're going on a trip to Russia and only want to take one book, this would be it. It has a small dictionary, information on aspects of Russian society, things to be wary of and even a page of "bad Russian"! Another nice aspect is that unlike some resources for travellers this actually fits in your pocket.<P>At the price it's a screaming bargain.</span>

                    <span>Okay, so I haven't left for Russia yet, but I'm looking through the book and nowhere in the book does it deal with passports, declarations, or registration, which has to be done once you enter Russia. Since you legally *have* to register within 72 hours of arriving in Russia, and presumably the only reason you'd get a phrasebook is if you were staying longer than a couple of days, it seems natural that they would at least have put to word "registration" in the dictionary. But *no*.<P>Other than that, I mean, the phrase book looks great. I'll be able to pick up a hot Russian policewoman after being dragged off to the jail for failing to register. :-)</span>

                    <span>OK, you are not going to learn Russian from this book. You are NOT even going to have simple conversations using it. What it will enable the non-speaking traveler to do is to survive in Russia by being able to look up and correctly speak ONE SENTENCE questions and statements (phrases).....<P>However, if the person you are talking with responds semi-fast and in normal fashion(i.e., not simple sentences ), the book will not really help your listening comprehension, and you will usually be lost.<P>On the other hand, if you already know some Russian, then such a book is really useful as a quick reference and handy dictionary, and at the price, it is truly a bargain. The wide range of topics do really cover most of what a tourist would need (and then some, with topics on dating, swearing, and the Russian gay community) In addition, the pronunciation/stress of the words is correctly given.<P>However, a word of warning for the non-speakers...the authors have given preference to simplicity of phrases and ease in learning rather than correct meaning. The meanings they give for a phrase are not always, strictly speaking, correct, but are often only approximations...but this is certainly understandable since this is a phrase book only.<P>For example, on the inside cover, they give a "Quick Reference" list of phrases...The phrase for "I'd like" is given as "mne nada", which is close, but not exactly correct. Correctly translated, this is "I need" (Literally, "for me, necessary")...This is a considerably less polite way to ask for something than the correct "ya ha tele be" which in fact means "I would like", but which is perhaps more complex to learn and remember.<BR>The authors have a section on "bad Russian" (swearing), which is nice, but what the tourist needs more is a section on "polite Russian", because really a Native or Local is more likely to respond to a kind and polite request from a struggling tourist rather than a gruff, impolite phrase...</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for my brother, a college student who was going to St. Petersburg. He says that the book was great for his trip. I also liked the size of the book, small enough to fit into a pocket, and the sturdy binding. I also appreciated the fact that it had some "younger" russian in it for someone of his age.</span>
