                <span id="Label1">The acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Black Hawk Down</i> is "a shocking account of modern warfare . . . gripping and horrifying" (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>) <br><br>Destined to become a classic of war reporting, <i>Black Hawk Down</i> is Mark Bowden's brilliant account of the longest sustained firefight involving American troops since the Vietnam War. On October 3rd, 1993, about a hundred elite U.S. soldiers were dropped by helicopter into the teeming market in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take an hour. Instead they found themselves pinned down through a long and terrible night fighting against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. The following morning, eighteen Americans were dead and more than seventy had been badly injured.<br><br>Drawing on interviews from both sides, army records, audiotapes, and videos (some of the material is still classified), Bowden's minute-by-minute narrative is one of the most exciting accounts of modern combat ever written--a riveting story that captures the heroism, courage, and brutality of battle.<br><br>"<i>Black Hawk Down</i> ranks among the best books ever written about infantry combat. . . . A descendent of books like <i>The Killer Angels</i> and <i>We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young</i>."-- Bob Shacochis, <i>The New York Observer</i><br><br>"If <i>Black Hawk Down</i> were fiction we'd rank it up there with the best war novels: <i>The Naked</i> and <i>the Dead</i> by Norman Mailer, or <i>The Things They Carried</i>, by Tim O'Brien."-- Tom Walker, <i>The Denver Post</i><br><br>"Stands in a league with Shelby Foote's stirring Civil War Diary, <i>Shiloh</i>."-- Jim Haner, <i>The Baltimore Sun</i><br><br>"One of the most gripping and authoritative accounts of combat ever written."-- Kirk Spitzer, <i>USA Today</i><br><br>"Amazing . . . One of the most intense, visceral reading experiences imaginable."-- <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br> A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller for 14 weeks<br> Bowden's <i>Black Hawk Down</i> series, which appeared in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> was awarded the Overseas Press Club's Hal Boyle Award for best foreign reporting</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book.<P>Working from hundreds of interviews, the author has captured a soldier's view of the Battle in Mogadishu, Somalia. This two day fire fight cost a dozen and a half American soldiers their lives -- and sent our country packing from the god-forsaken mess of a non-functioning entity that was early 1990's Somalia.<P>This is a ground level, violent, confused battle book. The book hardly mentions the larger mission and dwells not on why we were there. It is a group biography of young Americans who made up the Ranger, Delta Force and helicopter fighters stationed on the east coast of Africa in support of a United Nations feeding and pacification exercise.<P>What started off as a mission to grab the chief lieutenants of a local strongman disintegrated into a bloody mess after thousands of Somali's rose in opposition and defiance. The American team was pinned to their urban location after two Black Hawk helicopters went down from enemy fire. What was supposed to be an hour hit and run strike drag out over two days by the need to get to and secure the crash sites and the surviving crew and passengers. <P>The book is fast paced and cuts quickly between several dozen characters. It can be confusing and hard to follow at times, but this has the effect of illustrating well how confused and disoriented our soldiers were (and probably how most battles are). The tremendous amount of time and effort that went into the hundreds of interviews conducted by the author produce a vivid first person account of battle. It illustrates well the point made by one veteran in the book that "young soldiers can't wait to get into their first war. Veteran soldiers can't wait to get away from war."<P>First rate, exciting and a tremendous tribute to our fighting men, if not to the political decisions that put them there.</span>

                    <span>It was incredible book but Mr. Bowden completely ignored and downplayed the role of the QRF (2-14 Infantry and its attachments.) I realize that Mark was telling the story of the rangers but it seemed like he didn't want to acknowledge the QRF except were he had no choice. readers please keep in mind that the QRF suffered 2 KIA and 28 WIA and yet there was barely a mention of it. consider the consequences had they failed (much more than 18 dead, I assure you) Mark interviewed many, many rangers yet only 4 or 5 of the 300 QRF soldiers involved. Certainly not a "complete" account of the battle. He also could have interviewed some of the Malaysians and Pakastani soldiers, who probably saved ALL our lives with their tanks and APC's Other than my complaining, it was an extremely well detailed book that brought back tons of memories and insights into a bizarre chapter of my life. I just don't understand Mark's ignorance of the QRF. They were the most disciplined and hard-core unit I ever saw, far from the "incompetent, civilian-like schmoes" he described us as!</span>

                    <span>Mark Bowden has done an outstanding job of telling the story of the battle of Mogadishu. U.S. army rangers and delta forces were in Mogadishu trying to kill or capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a local warlord, leader of the Habr Gidr clan, who was preventing international relief agencies from properly distributing food in famine-decimated Somalia. <P>Trying to pluck one well-hidden person from the midst of a very sympathetic populace is not so easy, as we learned then and have re-learned in the case of Ossama bin Ladin. The U.S. began to settle for picking off top Aidid aids. <P>This battle bagan when U.S. forces learned that two Aidid lieutenants were meeting in a building near the center of the Aidid-controlled section of Mogadishu. The plan called for Delta forces to take the building and capture the men, for army rangers to secure the corners of the block containing the target building, and for black Hawk helicopters to provide overhead cover for the rangers. <P>It was a reasonably good plan, but it had one very serious weakness. It turned out that the Black Hawks were very vulnerable to fire from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), a cheap and reliable Soviet made weapons system. RPGs are as common as dirt in third world countries, and Aidid's forces had plenty of them. Two of the Black Hawks were shot down by RPG fire, and two more were damaged so badly that they had to crash land back at the U.S. base. In trying to retrieve the downed Black Hawk pilots and crews (or their bodies), the rangers and Delta forces got shot to hell by an extremely hostile city full of AK-47-toting Somalis. <P>It is an amazing story, well told by Mark Bowden. Part of the irony and horror of the situation is that we were only trying to help, we were only trying to do good. Yet we ended up getting 19 of our own boys killed and 70 others wounded, and killing perhaps (no one knows for sure) 500 Somalis. The moral to the story is that if you're trying to do good, send missionaries. The army is not a missionary force. The purpose of the army is to kill people, and it should never be deployed unless U.S. national security is implicated, which it was not in Somalia.</span>

                    <span>I first hear about this book years ago when someone suggested it on tv. But I did not pay it any attention until I saw the movie. Once I saw the movie I wanted to know more about what happened with those soldiers. What I loved about the book was Mark Bowden's attention to detail. It is as if you are reading a very long but very interesting news article. I did not sense any bias, as if Mr. Bowden was trying to lead me to see only one side of this story. Needless to say, the book is very informative and has given me a new favorite author. I am reading his other book "Killing Pablo" now and loving it. Read Blackhawk Down.</span>

                    <span>Mark Bowden's story is an excellent retelling of the events of that day in 1993, but it only tells half the story. I don't think he even realized he was telling only part, even though he did try to get Somali voices in it. The real other half, which he does not seem to have a clue about, is that the whole event was a trap, an ambush coordinated and managed by Bin Laden and the Islamists in Sudan and Iran (see Y. Bodansky's book, Bin Laden, The Man Who Declared War on America). Isn't the author even curious about how, without any warning, all of these snipers and other armed individuals knew to be where the US soldiers were at that particular time? Mogadishu was and is a pretty lawless place, but even there I doubt that most areas have that many RPG launchers in one place all the time, just in case US soldiers drop in. The lack of adequate intelligence then and now, has led to the vulnerability of Western nations to terrorism. That and an unwillingness to admit that anyone could hate the US enough to ambush its soldiers, as well as putting hundreds of innocent civilians in the line of fire. Unfortunately, the US did not learn in Mogadishu, at the Khobar Towers, on the USS Cole, or even the WTC bombing in 1993. But it did learn on Sept. 11th.<P>This book is very good in many ways. But the complete story of these events in Mogadishu has yet to be told.</span>
