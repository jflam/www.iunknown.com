                    <span>You have to give writer Chris Nickson credit for trying -- he's written a few tell-alls, "unathorized" biographies and even tried his hand at music criticism.  Unfortunately for both his subjects and readers, his writing style tends towards the dull and trite, betrays no sense of taste or history and provides very little insight into his subjects.  For the completist only.   (Contrary to other reviews on this site, the author hails from the UK (although he lives in America.) </span>

                    <span>I'm enjoying this book but find that it's a bit too short and because it's written by an American author it has a US slant on it (e.g box office takings of films are all in dollars and release dates are different too).   Otherwise, I find the little snippets of fun information about the films  he's worked on very interesting.</span>

                    <span>This is a really good book.  It's very informative.  Not only does it give information about Ewan but also about his movies which is nice when trying to convince one's mother to let them see a movie. It wasn't written in  American english but not hard to read.  It was a good book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an awesome book with a lot of info for a small book.  The draw back is the begining is hard to get into, the lack of photos and that fact that they're black and white, and that it's more about McGregor's movies,  etc. instead of McGregor himself.  Not great, not bad, but lots of info.</span>

                    <span>The book is good, but it isn't in American english so it can be a little funny,  I wouldn't do a book reort on it ether it was hard.</span>
