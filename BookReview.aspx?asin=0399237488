                    <span>There it is again.  That old familiar cynicism that comes when I see a virtually unknown book win a prestigious award.  In this particular case I'm referring to "Coming On Home Soon" by Jacqueline Woodson.  A touching intimate portrait of a girl suffering a separation from her parent, the book won the enviable Caldecott Honor.  So does it deserve it?  Which is to say, does it deserve to be remembered, in some part, for decades to come? Well, let's just say that my cynical first viewing of the story revealed this to be a surprisingly sensitive picture book.  This is one of those perfect meldings of picture and language.  A truly touching and lovely work to enjoy.
<br />	
<br />In the midst of World War II, black women have an unprecedented chance to work various jobs up North in Chicago while the men are away fighting.  So Ada Ruth's mama is off to take a chance.  She's leaving her daughter with Grandma and will be back when she's made enough money for the three of them.  This is hard on her little daughter but she writes regularly to her mother and hopes for the best.  She even finds a kitten to adopt, though Grandma keeps telling her not to get too attached to it.  Through the rain, then the snow, as the months pass and time goes by Ada Ruth keeps track of the time and is finally rewarded, one day, with a most precious letter.
<br />	
<br />It's odd for me to write out the plot of the story.  Having read through it, I was under the distinct impression that it was a deeply involved story.  And to some extent, it is.  But it's not easy to summarize.  Maybe that's because Woodson's prose is so deft and practical.  She peppers the story with emotional moments and unconscious details of what it was like to live in the past.  There are gutsy choices in the text as well.  In one two-page spread we see Ada Ruth lying on her side with her kitten and just two little words, "Time passes".  There's a sentimentality here that never becomes cloying or too cute.  This is an author who has figured out how to be touching without striking a single dishonest chord.  If you find yourself unaccountably moved by the end, it really shouldn't strike you as peculiar, considering the Woodson's talent.
<br />	
<br />And of course there are the illustrations of E.B. White (no, not the "Charlotte's Web" author) to contend with.  This entire story could be defined simply through White's use of light.  When mama is preparing to leave, it's raining outside, giving the scene a damp chill glow.  When Ada and grandma are walking outside in the snow, the overcast sky dapples everything a uniform gray.  And when Ada sits at her little table with a comforting cup of hot cocoa and two biscuits before her, the sunlight through the window is bright and cheery.  But my favorite image in the book is the last.  Though we never see the tearful reunion between mama and her relatives, the last picture shows her approaching the run down but sturdy home in the snow.  There's something about the house and the setting and the small figure of mama that I am certain will be deeply burned into many a youngster's brain for years and years to come.  It's the happy ending they'll all want, but within a shockingly realistic setting.
<br />	
<br />So a big round of applause to the Caldecott committee for selecting this lovely little winner.  If you're looking for a picture book of historical fiction, I can think of no better tale than the winning, "Coming On Home Soon".  As enjoyable to read as it is stunning to page through.  A true bit of picture book class.
