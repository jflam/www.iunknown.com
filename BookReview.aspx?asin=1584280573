                    <span>J.D. Wacker, one of the country's formost portrait photographers, has put together a book that redirects photographers back to the essentials of their craft. Too many books and articles today teach tricks and techniques that rely on fads or the latest (but soon to be obsolete)equipment. They forget that the most important aspect of photographic success is the photographer's own perception and insight into his subject's personality, not the equipment that he is using. This is the joy in reading this book. Nothing gets between you and the subject.<P>Mr. Wacker covers posing children, high school seniors, women, men, groups, action, among other things. Unlike other books on the subject, he also covers problem situations. Things do not always go as smoothly in real life as they do in predesigned examples. His book is filled with practical tips, from how to keep a baby happy to how to pose an executive. (A hint, they both have to be photographed quickly, but the executive will probably not respond as well to the bubbles.)<P>I recommend this book to anyone who's photography concentrates on people. Although it is written primarily for professional photographers, it is refreshingly free of jargon and would be useful for anyone who wants better photographs of their friends and relatives. I guarantee that the information in this book will make a difference.</span>

                    <span>The author explained very detail about posing basic. It's good book to learn about posing. This book is good to read for beginner in this business. It's also have posing in practise for Children, High School Senior, Men, Women, Weddings, Models, Couples, Families, Teams, Groups, and Pets. But there are no explanations about Lighting; you must read another book about it.</span>

                    <span>This is a beginners book. Giving very general ideas on what type of poses you might use but no specifics. Talk generally about the common mistakes for different situation. Not a bad book, just simple.</span>

                    <span>Wacker's guide successfully explains the basic geometry of posing people. He discusses orienting individual faces and body parts, positioning the body as a whole, and grouping individuals together. His writing is clear and well organized. However, the book is not very detailed, something I would expect from a book with "Master" in the title. <P>The guide strongly conveys its upper-midwest aesthetic. This is evident not just in the portraiture, but in his advice on dealing with subjects as well. If your goal is to run a suburban commercial portrait studio, then this book will be of some value to you. If not, I recommend looking elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>If you've moved beyond the very basic of photography - the rules of thirds, getting on the floor to photograph the baby at eye level, then this book is for you. It explains how to see relationships of the body, i.e. shoulders as a base to head. How to slim down a heavy person by twisting the hip and moving arms away from body. The book covers detail to body parts such as hands, feet, legs, and how to posture them. Author is heavy on the 80% mental / 20 % technical, which is true. Heavy emphasis on communication with subjects - which makes for better posing / relationship with the camera and photographer. Useless are the books with picture after picture of excellent posing. They don't teach you how to look at the person first and then feel out the best poses for person to strike. I found it more effective use of my time to use knowledge gained from this book, rather than trying to copycat poses from other books. Drawback of the book? Doesn't elaborate on technical terms like Rules of Thirds, and at times does not draw diagram to illustrate: "...a line running through the pit of the neck and drawn perpendicular to the floor shows where the feet must be placed in order ..." However there are a lot of photographs that serve as examples - the bad paired with good to illustrate the book's advice / concept .</span>
