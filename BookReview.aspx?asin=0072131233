                <span id="Label1">While strong encryption methods exist that offer plenty of security for commercial-level protection, issues such as identification, authorization, and reliable issuance of digital signatures require a broader set of standards. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is just such a framework, addressing all of the issues for complete solutions.<p>  Authored by four RSA Security experts in the field, <I>PKI: Implementing and Managing E-Security</I> aims to explain the vulnerabilities of encryption in today's Internet-based business universe and lay out how the application of PKI can help. The authors frankly point out the areas where PKI is still immature in the real world and try to inspire their readers with their zeal to solve the remaining problems.<p>  The book begins with an exploration of cryptography and, in particular, public key cryptography--the accepted approach for most of today's security systems. The text moves quickly into precise security terminology but makes excellent use of creative diagrams to illustrate configurations and scenarios. These diagrams often beg a bit of reflection since they are frequently used to point out vulnerabilities that may not be immediately apparent.<p>  The heart of the book examines the management of keys and certificates, authentication, and the establishment of trust models. There are overviews of current technologies that implement PKI, but the focus of the book is to encourage readers to construct their own fully compliant solutions. <p>  <I>PKI: Implementing and Managing E-Security</I> is not light reading. However, it serves double duty as both an overview of the sticky issues of securing information delivery over the Net as well as a comprehensive look at the scope of PKI for those considering a full-fledged solution for their extranets and e-commerce sites. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, hashes and digital signatures, digital certificates, PKI basics, PKI services, key and certificate life cycles, PKIX, protocols and formatting standards, trust models, authentication methods, deployment and operation, and return on investment calculations.</span>

                    <span>The author has a unique ability to explain PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) in a way that is detailed and clear. PKI is a very complex topic and requires a knowledge of many other fieds including technology and security to even begin. It is beyond the grasp of the average Internet user today. After reading many other PKI books and doing hours of research on the Internet regarding PKI, I had been able to piece together the processes and basics on PKI. But after only reading the first 2 chapters of this book, I felt I understood concepts better than any other source. <BR><P>The only criticism I have is that the author uses too much levity in explaining his points. The jokes are not that funny but unfortunately they keep coming.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for those fairly new to PKI. I needed to find out about PKI quickly, and this book explained it in clear terms. It begins by explaining encryption techniques and algorithms, and you don't have to have PhD in mathematics to understand it. Then it introduces PKI in logical pieces and concepts. Each chapter builds on the previous chapter, so it is really easy to understand. It shows how various applications can use PKI (SSL, SMIME, etc) as well as how a PKI can be implemented. <P>If you are new to PKI and need to get a handle on it quickly, then I highly recommend reading this book. It is well worth the money.</span>

                    <span>I've read quite a few books on PKI now, one of the best being Schneier's Secrets and Lies, which is fairly negative on the technology over all, and appropriately so.<P>This book is a good deal more positive on the technology, but is not pollyanna. I think that Schneier realizes that the technology is a helpful tool, though it does not solve the human engineering problems that need o be solved to implement "real" security. This book helps you understand how to do that, and gives you a feel for where the bodies are buried.<P>The biggest skeleton in PKI's closed has always been authentication, which PKI does not solve, but vendors would have you believe it does. This is the first book by from a PKI house that lays those cards on the table. OF course, RSA *does* make most of its dough from selling securIDs...<P>But I think this one is a keeper.</span>
