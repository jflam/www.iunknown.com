                    <span>As a new student of golf, I've read over a dozen books to improve my swing and this book is by far the best! It helps the reader develop a real feel for the golf swing in the most natural, developmental way I can imagine. Starting with hands and arms and then moving through each part of the body, it describes how the swing should feel. Best of all, the authors have designed numerous drills and exercises for the reader to actually FEEL the swing in each part of the body. While this description sounds mechanical, it produces a swing that is anything but. Not only has my swing become more fluid, controlled and consistent, my golf scores have improved significantly as well. I highly recommend this book for both beginning golfers and teachers of the game.</span>

                    <span>This book not only informs you of where your hands, head, feet, clubhead, etc. should be at a given time, but how the swing should "feel" at that time as well. For example, I found I was gripping the club too tight just from their descriptions of what the grip should feel like. This book along with Bob Rotella's book on "Golf is not a game of perfect" should be on any golfer's reading list, if they seek improvement in the mental and the sensory aspects of the game...</span>

                    <span>I did not like this book. It does not explain the golf swing sufficiently for the user to perform the swing correctly. There are certain aspects that I believe leave the reader unclear. For example, the book says that you need to imagine the inside path to the ball in the downswing as a slide going down to the ball. It does not say how the reader should actually perform this move.<P>I found there is very little in this book that I found to help my game. There are defiantly many fundamentals of the golf swing that this book doesn't even start to discuss. I also don't like the way that the book recommends that you learn how the hands/arms use before learning how the entire body should be used. The book even says that you can swing well without even reading the body/hips section. IMO this will turn the reader into a very "handsy" type of player. It is my belief that the swing is a blend of the entire body and advocating that it is possible to learn how the hands move without even addressing the hips and body is wrong.<P>There are better books around such as the LAWS of Golf, and Four Magic Moves to Winning Golf.</span>

                    <span>A great golf instructional book! I think it would be especially helpful to the beginner. The book was written in a very logical sequence and in the order of importance to help reader understand the entire golf swing. Drills in each chapter were simple to perform and effective.</span>

                    <span>After many lessons and lots of soul searching and bad adjustments made to my swing, this book really sets out the priorities of what makes a good swing. I supposedly swing outside in and have a slice. I have tried to use my legs, swing inside out with the clock method, swing slower, have a stronger grip, etc., etc. In frustration I locked my wrists and could manage a 23 handicap with mainly shoulder action. Finally this book tells how the hands lead, then the arms and the shoulders only follow. I also concentrated on a good follow through, but now know that it will be better when every thing else gets in the right order. Now that I have concentrated just on the hands for a while without any other movement, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Hitting is a lot easier on the body and when I do get things right it goes pretty far! Hooray.</span>
