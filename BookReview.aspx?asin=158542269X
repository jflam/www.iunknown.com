                    <span>I have Stephen Mitchell's version of the Tao Te Ching which I just received and read today and I have to say I was VERY disappointed in it. I would say it's not so much a translation as a paraphrase of his own thoughts with some of those of Lao Tzu blended in to make it seem like a translation of the Tao Te Ching. This is a much, much better version.</span>

                    <span>This book is three in one - a graceful and seemingly accurate translation of the text into English, a literal character by character rendering with glossary, and reference material including some commentary, samples of other translations and bibliography.
<br />
<br />Unlike typical approaches, these are separated so that reading for one purpose does not entangle one in footnotes and parenthesized comments best suited for another.
<br />
<br />It might even serve as an introduction to written Chinese for those so inclined.
<br />
<br />It seems of great value, particularly at the low price of this edition.

                    <span>What began as a recording of simple lessons to better live and understand life spawned a religious and philosophical movement that endured 2,000 years of war and strife in China, and continues to make its effect on the world today.  The Tao Te Ching is the basis for the combination philosophy/religion known as Taoism, which has over 30 million followers worldwide.  
<br />
<br />Before I start my review on this particular translation, let me point out that regardless of religious background or belief, the Tao Te Ching is an excellent read for ANYONE.  I myself am a Christian, yet the teachings of Lao Tze (or whatever other scholars contributed to the text) have enriched my life and given me added peace and comfort.  Regardless if you're a follower of Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, or (obviously) Taoism, the Tao Te Ching is one of the most philosophically rich works in history.  Keep an open mind and there is much the Tao Te Ching can teach you.  There's a reason it's second only to the Bible in the number of times it's been translated into different languages.
<br />
<br />Part of the difficulty of translating a Chinese text like the Tao Te Ching is that the Chinese language is so much different from other languages, particularly English.  While English by comparison is very specific and literal, the characters of Chinese language are more open to definition, allowing the readers to make their own interpretations.  Fittingly, the lessons of the Tao Te Ching are similar in nature: each person's view of it and what it means will be different.  There is no right or wrong way to practice or integrate Taoism into life, which is part of the beauty of the philosophy.
<br />
<br />That's why this translation of the Tao Te Ching offers a separate section with all the meanings of the Chinese characters.  It works best if you choose the words you think are right, and then record them on a computer or a piece of paper.  That way, you can create your own original translation, if you're willing to do the work.  This is just one of the great things about Jonathan Star's edition of the Tao Te Ching.
<br />
<br />Star also offers his own unique translation, for those not dedicated enough to use the separate section.  The last decent translation of the TTC that I read was the Ganson translation I got off the Internet.  Star's translation completely blows it out of the water.  The words are perfect.  They're not too simple, they're not too complicated.  They're just...right.  And that's a central principle about Taoism: not resorting to extremes and just getting things right.
<br />
<br />There's also a separate section for notes on the different verses, and an entirely separate section just for verse one.  If you're looking for the truly definitive Tao Te Ching translation, this is it!

                    <span>There are so many translations of the Tao Te Ching that choosing one may be difficult.  I like Jonathan Star's translation the most, for two reasons: first, because I feel it's a good translation, and second, because the entire text of the Tao Te Ching is included, word for word, in the original chinese, with word for word translations.  This gives the reader some insight into the original text.  Also included is some commentary and history.  I highly recommend this translation.  Also recommended is the translation by Brian Browne Walker.</span>
