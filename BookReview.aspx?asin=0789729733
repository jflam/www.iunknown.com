                    <span>I highly recomend this book for 4 year olds and 80 year olds.  This book addresses concepts only and then at the most simplistic of levels.  I am not technical and was not looking for a book targeted to programmers. I simply wanted a book that would provide a modicum of information to satisfy a curious mind and give some substantive explanations as to how the internet works.  This taught me nothing and is falsey advertised.</span>

                    <span>I work in the IT / Computer Repair industry, and I personally feel that this book is very helpful to most individuals who have little familiarity with The Internet and all the intricacies of email, firewalls, modems, Instant Messaging, etc.<br>This book is very, very Basic..., yet I can guarantee you, as a Help-Desk Agent, that many adults (including myself) can gather useful information from this book.  The old saying is true: "a picture is worth a thousand words."  In this book, that is mostly what you get...a lot of illustrations.<br>There is much reiteration of the same material throughout the book, which creates Filler, but the Illustrations are very helpful to the average beginning Internet user.<br>This book is not designed to be the Ultimate Internet Guide, but it IS a wonderful book to read through and donate to your local library, or to give your parents or grandparents to help them understand the Wonderful World of the Web.<br>Most people generally tend to forget that not everyone is hip to the Internet technology and terminology.  This book caters to individuals who are struggling to incorporate all this new-fangled gadgetry into their lives.  I wouldn't recommend this book to Techs, but I would certainly recommend it to anyone trying to integrate with the rest of society, online.</span>

                    <span>Normally I don't review books but because this one is so GREAT I find myself compelled to . I teach HW classes and this book has been a great reference materiel. also for people who want to get a basic <br>understanding of "How the internet Works". my classes are a little high level and not for everyone but this book is. I have told many people to read it. The Illustrations are the best I have ever seen.</span>

For a guy which is already working on this field will result extremly basic, maybe shall look for something else more formal<br>bye</span>
