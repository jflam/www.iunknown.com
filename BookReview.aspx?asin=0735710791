                <span id="Label1">The most influential web design book ever written, completely updated to cover motion graphics, broadband interactive design, and more. Since it was first published in 1995, designing web graphics has been the seminal resource for web designers to learn the basics and then the nuances of solid design for the web. Lynda Weinman has been updating the book to reflect changes in the technologies affecting web design, but dwg.4 has been largely rewritten from the ground up. Included is coverage of motion graphics made possible by the Flash phenomenon, broadband-enabled graphics issues, usability, and more. Lynda is rewriting the book so that all coverage of specific tools is focused on the essential functionality of these programs (Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash, etc.) and not on version-specific attributes of the software, making the book relevant longer for more users.</span>

                    <span>I'm quite amazed by the positive reviews, because this is one of the worst web related books I've ever seen. The techniques presented in this book are often outdated and I could not believe my eyes when I saw the book has been published in 2002. Tricks like using the <pre> tag to increase leading apparently did not die in the 90's.<P>Even worse, it's plagued with errors --- I found about six huge errors (not typos!) on four pages.<P>Hands off this one.</span>

                    <span>I've bought two of Lynda's books and will probably get more because they are very clear and easy to follow. Combining well-written but concise text with screen shots, this book is great for web design newbies (like me!).<P>The book doesn't attempt to be the web graphics bible. Some of its topics only skim the surface. But there is enough information there to send you off on a fact-finding mission elsewhere. (Ya gotta start somewhere, right? Lynda Weinman gives great introductions to sophisticated web topics.)<P>Of particular use to me are the chapters on information architecture, browser-safe colors (with a color chart!), and cascading style sheets. My only pet peeve is that books like this always include one or two chapters on frames -- if everyone discourages them so much, why dedicate so much precious space to them??!<P>"Designing Web Graphics" is a great resource for me. As I've been learning Dreamweaver and planning a redesign of my site, I find myself opening Weinman's book often.</span>

                    <span>This is 500 pages spanning 30 chapters that are not very technical at all but explain a lot of facts relating to designing web graphics and websites. <P>If you even remotely work with websites, you will find this book an invaluable reference to understanding various aspects of designing web graphics and designing websites. The topics are very well organized and cover almost anything you may encounter. Here are some important chapters whose topics you may recognize - Web Aesthetics, Browser-Safe Color, Navigation, Planning Web Projects, Frames, Cascading Style Sheets, Animation & Audio, Creating Community, and Web File Formats. <P>The facts presented in each chapter are done so in an easy to understand writing style but possess breadth and depth on the topic. At the end of each chapter, there is a 1 page summary of the highlights learned in the chapter. The author doesn't assume that you are an advanced reader and hence explains everything in great detail. It is more than likely that you will understand almost any topic in this book (if you read it fully) even if you are just a beginner. This was the biggest appeal to me as I am a Technical Project Manager that has to know a little bit of everything. This book definitely met that goal and more. <P>You may hesitate at the price but the chances are high that you will not regret purchasing this book. This is one of the most referenced books in my book collection as there seems to be no end to the knowledge gained from this book. I hope you have a similar experience with this book. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>If I didn't damage my book upon receipt, I would have returned it. I'm an intranet developer with very little graphics experience. I purchased this book because of Linda's status in the graphic design world and assumed it would help me add some "umph" to my web designs. Unfortunately, this book didn't expound enough on any one subject to make it worth my effort. The book is good for basic information and can be used for a reference on some design basics. However, it did not provide substantial knowledge for developers with more than 6 months experience. I give it three stars for it being a useful beginner book. I would give it 2 stars if you have any experience at all in web design. Linda Weinman just didn't live up to her billing in my opinion. I'm sure she has the experience and ability. I just wish she would have given us more of that in this book.</span>

                    <span>Out of all the books in the <designing web graphics> series, I think that this is the best. It covers the additional process and requirements that the Designer and Web team are ultimately responsible for - not only design expertise and look and feel, but also under-the-surface work like the Creative Brief and Style Guide. It even covers urgent topics like usability and accessibility, which are extremely helpful! I've always referred to Lynda's teaching manuals because they're smart and personable. I really enjoy having a guide like this to refer to when starting a new project or when I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of one.</span>
