                <span id="Label1">The beauty of former Negro League star Buck O'Neil's autobiography is its tone: it's filled with thankfulness for the life he's had. Born into an era of racial segregation, O'Neil--truly an  inspirational presence in the Ken Burns documentary <i>Baseball</i>--has a right to be bitter for the opportunities denied him; instead, he is at peace with the opportunities he took. A man of unmistakable dignity, O'Neil is a marvelous storyteller, and <i>I Was Right On Time</i>  reads like a fireside chat. He spins tales of baseball's barnstorming era, offers memories of his all-time Negro League all-star team, and weaves deft portraits of the stars he played with (and against), most affectionately his good friend and long-time teammate Satchel Paige. Still, O'Neil doesn't whitewash the past. He has stared down injustice and confronted insult, yet instead of lecturing, he opts to inform. Now in his 80s, O'Neil, as chairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, remains a living part of baseball memory. <i>I Was Right On Time</i> gives that memory a rich, resonant voice.</span>

                    <span>   I was lucky enought to attend an All Star game a few years ago. When i was their i wanted to get an autograph i saw a group of guys around one man so i went up got an autograph not knowing who he is. After i saw the signed baseball i made out the name Buck O'neil. I looked him up online and saw he was a negro league player and first black coach in the majors. I then stumbled across his book on here and decided to order it and that turned out to be a great decision as i loved this book.
<br />   I came many decades later after the negro leagues so before i had no idea what it was like, Buck O'neil does a great job in making one feel like they were there. You not only feel like you where on the team but that you are friends with Buck. I couldnt stop reading and read it cover to cover right after it came in the mail. I would say for anyone looking for a good read about the negro leagues and a great individual i would recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I knew about Buck O'Neil from Ken Burns, Baseball series.  Unfortunately, I did not see much of it.  The past month I heard an interview with Buck O'Neil on the radio.  He was such a gracious man and kind.  I knew I wanted to read his book.  
<br />His book is wonderful.  It is great to get insights and details of the negro leagues of the past.  Like all of us, past memories tend to change and brighten over the passage of time.  I see this book as an uplift.  His attitude is wonderful and is an inspiration to everyone.  No matter where we are or when we are born, we are "right on time".  We all are serving a purpose for a greater good. 
<br />The book does read like you are sitting right next to Buck and he is talking with you.  I highly recommend this book to all baseball fans as it gives a glimpse into the baseball history.   The negro leagues are such a big part of this history.  I do believe some of the greatest players were in the negro leagues.  As a baseball fan, I plan to read other books on the negro leagues to learn more about it.  I became a member of the Negro League Baseball Museum because of this book.  I hope to get a chance to see it someday.  You can't help getting touched by this book and the simple message of graciousness and love it has throughout.

                    <span>I was impressed with this book and its author long before I had the honor of meeting Buck O'Neil.Mr. O'Neil gave up a $4.000.00 speaking engagement to come to Humboldt,Kansas and speak free of charge.The author writes of his years playing and managing the Kansas City Monarchs.He tells stories about Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson.There is no one better qualified to write this book about his life and how segregated baseball and life was then.Mr O'Neil helped found and lead the Negro League Baseball Museuem In Kansas City, Missouri.Mr O'Neil is one of only about 300 Negro League ballplayers still living and one of only about four still living who played in the Negro Leagues in the 1930s.Mr O'Neil is a treasure and his book tells the story.</span>

                    <span>Buck O'Neil is a man with a story to tell - one of courage, hard work, joy, love, and history.  Homespun, told as if Buck was sitting across from the reader, O'Neil reveals the bright side of a very sad period of history where great players were denied the opportunity to compete in the Major Leagues simply because of the color of their skin, but where great competition and inspiration occurred on the backroads and big cities of America as members of the Negro Leagues played all over the Western Hemisphere.<p>Buck refuses to be sad over the lost opportunity of playing in the Majors, but instead revels in being able to play with and against some of the finest players in the history of baseball.  Because so many of his contemporaries had this same spirit, they enjoyed their lives and ended up paving the way for the Major Leagues to be integrated.  This event is so much more than a mere baseball event, but an event that changed America in a great and grand way!<p>Reading this book was inspirational to me, and let me see that no matter what the circumstances, good can be found if you look for it.  Buck is a person who reveals the secret of life - love others.</span>
