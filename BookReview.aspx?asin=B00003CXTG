                <span id="Label1">To call <I>Pearl Harbor</I> a throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#233; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (<I>Braveheart</I>) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened. <p>  For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo from <I>Titanic</I> (a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else in <I>Pearl Harbor</I>--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold, <I>Pearl Harbor</I> is quite a thrilling ride. <I>--Mark Englehart</I> </span>

                    <span>Pearl Harbor is enjoyable, entertaining, and overall very well done. Among the notable performances was that of the actor who portrayed President Rosevelt-marvelous job! The scenes of the actual attack are powerful and realistic. Few historical inaccuracies do not take away from the impact of the movie-it is a deep emotional reminder of the devastation, death and destruction that took place in Pearl Harbor. Thankfully, the viewer is spared the graphic and morbid scenes found in Saving Private Ryan which left nothing to the imagination.<P>The movie includes an obligatory love story which is very trite and predictable, however the relationship between Ben Affleck and other leading characters provides diversion in the way of romance and humor. <P>Cuba Gooding Jr. was a bit of a disappointment-no fault of his own, just poorly cast for a very minor supporting role. Difficult to understand why he was wandering the depths and bowels of the USS Arizona still carrying a silver tea platter and cups while planes were obviously bombing in very close proximity. Additionally hard to believe was the fact that although Honolulu was to suffer a "surprise" attack while the island was "sleeping", the entire naval fleet were still in their bunks in the wee hours of the morn yet young boys were enjoying a baseball game and mothers were accompanying their children to church. Just didn't fit....<P>Ben Affleck and his leading lady were believable even if corny. There was just enough chemistry to make hearts go pitter patter!<P>The movie is definitely worth $7.50 and could even be nominated for some academy awards!</span>

                    <span>This is the DVD to get, it has the deleted scenes of the love affair between Doolittle (played by Baldwin) and Beckinsale - the child Beckinsale carries was actually Doolittle's, not Josh Harnett's - in this restored, original version</span>

                    <span>This is a good movie but not great. It's way too long and the actors are not really that good. The special effects are amazing to look at but it gets boring after a while. Jennifer Garner had a very small role in the movie. Why didn't she got a bigger part is beyond me. This unrated version is not that special only has a lot more gore/violence. Why did I waste time and money on this one I really don't know. If you love violence movies buy this now if now avoid it at all costs.</span>

                    <span>I must say that, when I saw this film. I was expecting a high intensity build towards the ultimate climax of the attack itself. Instead, we get the usual Hollywood love fest, Hollywood liberties on the truth (though I am not bothered by the liberties themselves, but sometimes the liberties are too ridiculous!) For example, some of the ships used in the movie to be hit by torpedoes are woefully modern, IE not of WWII time period. The Doolittle Raid, look at the aircraft carrier, it shows an angle that only modern nuclear ACC's have, back then the ACC's were long rectangler shaped vessels. <P>Lastly, I just found it boring and it was like the director was attempting to do a Titanic style story with fictional characters caught in a love triangle all the while the story builds towards the attack as a secondary mentioning. Just way too much Hollywood liberties taken against one of the darkest times for America, and I can't help but feel that the veterans, especially those who were there, should have been given something that respected them more. <P>I will say though, the attack itself is stunning, why I give it two stars... other than that this movie falls flat for me.</span>

                    <span>This film is an amazing story which will make u smile, cry and route on the americans all the way through. The story of two best friends Raffe and Danny and their shared love for evelyn, has toucing moments at every point. This dvd is definately worth buying and is one of the best films i ever invested in. This film will make you want to watch it again and again, its brilliant!! Hats off to Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnet and Kate Beckinsdale for their top class performances! This really is a worthwhile buy!</span>
