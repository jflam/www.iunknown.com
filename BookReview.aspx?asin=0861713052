                    <span>Dogen is one of the most sophisticated and down-to-earth of the Japanese zen patriarchs. He certainly would have appreciated the appropriately brief and helpful footnotes which accompany the talks. These talks were originally intended for aspiring monks, not for laypersons. So unless one is already thoroughly familiar with the fundamental principles of buddhism and Zen Buddhism in particular, the endlessly rewarding complexity and richness of the talks may pass you by.   </span>

                    <span>Dogen's Extensive Record, here translated by Taigen Dan Leighton et al, is an incredible accomplishment in translation and understanding this seminal figure in the history of Zen, and Japanese Zen. These records were mostly recorded later in his teaching career and reflect an intimacy not seen as often in his more popularly known work., SHobogenzo, despite others thinking to the contrary. Dogen here inspires, instructs, challenges and presents in a way that EVERY zen student will find inspiring and challenging. Whereas Lin Chi didn't have a lyrical bone in his body, despite being an exceptional teacher, Dogen is highly lyrical and poetic. Taigen's introduction is worth the reading as well, as it contextualizes and lays out a context in which to read this Extensive Record. 
<br />Taigen Leighton has to be the foremost Dogen scholar in our time, and as an ordained Soto priest in the line of Shunryu Suzuki roshi,  gives play to his love for the founder of Soto Zen in Japan.  
<br />Dogen is such an important figure that he transcends Zen and Buddhism and is considered one of the great literary and philosophical figures in  Japanese history.
<br />This is a book you will come back to over and over again, tasting  Dogen in ways that stay with you, that challenge you, as all good zen teachers do.</span>
