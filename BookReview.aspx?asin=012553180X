                    <span>Although it is not possible here, I am fairly sure this book deserves such rating. This is truly remarkable work and is likely to become a classic text in the field of computer graphics. 
<br />
<br />It is not a survey-type book, instead of trying to describe every possible method out there, the authors have concentrated on a few selected techniques, that are not only good (modern, fast, easy to implement, etc.), but also have some pedagogical merits and can serve as a gentle introduction to the world of ray tracing and digital image synthesis. Despite focusing on selected areas, the authors managed to squeeze here in an amazing amount of material. Among other topics, this book covers: subdivision surfaces, ray-primitive intersection acceleration techniques (3D DDA and kd-tree), color and radiometry, anti-aliasing, tone mapping, physically based reflection models, texture mapping (including texture anti-aliasing using ray differentials), area lights and HDR Image Based Lighting, volume scattering and much more.
<br />
<br />A large part of the book has been devoted to the light transport and Monte Carlo techniques. One can find there an introduction to the theory of Monte Carlo estimation (including selected methods for reducing variance and computation time, like Russian roulette, multiple importance sampling or stratified sampling) and explanation of important light transport equations (rendering and transfer equations). 
<br />
<br />Finally the authors have described (and implemented) several solutions for the rendering equation: Whitted-style recursive ray tracing, direct illumination estimation, path tracing, irradiance caching and photon mapping.
<br />
<br />However, it is not only the vastness of the material covered in this book, that causes this volume should be praised so highly. Perhaps, the style, in which this book has been written, is even more impressive. For each of the topics, the authors start with what is usually known as "dry math and theory", and then show how it is supposed to work as an algorithm (including its dirty details) and finally they explain how to turn this algorithm into a C++ code. Each of these transitions concentrates on a small portion of the whole problem, so it is still easy to understand. Everyone, who had to turn a SIGGRAPH paper into something that works, will immediately recognize what kind of gem this book is - it actually shows how to do it!
<br />
<br />This brilliant blend of theory and practice is one of its brightest spots, for learning the theory and math formulas is one thing, but writing a working, robust implementation is completely another.
<br />
<br />Those, who prefer studying sources, will get source code of a very good, physically based, extensible ray tracer (called pbrt) with the best documentation one could ever imagine. Documentation that gives the rationale for almost every line of code. It shows not only how they did it, but also why they did it that way.
<br />
<br />It is not the only book, that one will ever need - computer graphics is a vast topic - too big to be covered in a single volume, even as huge as this one. However, it is certainly one of the books that everyone interested in photorealistic rendering should buy. The price of this book is really low, if you think about it as of an excellent, first-rate computer graphics course.
<br />
<br />Aimed at students, researchers and people interested in computer graphics algorithms, it is an indispensable book for anyone willing to write his own photorealistic (not necessarily physically based!) ray tracer and learn more about computer image synthesis. </span>

                    <span>This book covers everything you need to know to write a ray tracer with
<br />advanced features like photon mapping, volume scattering, path tracing,
<br />etc.  The scope of the material it covers is stunning.  It starts from the
<br />basics of topics like 3D geometry and ray/object intersections and then
<br />builds up to explain reflection models, advanced texturing techniques, and
<br />then light transport algorithms.
<br />
<br />It has excellent discussions of the theory and underlying math of physical
<br />rendering blended (rather well) with very very useful practical
<br />implementations of the theory.  The leap from theory to implementation is
<br />often difficult to do, and to do well or efficiently even more difficult.
<br />(The ray acceleration code alone is worth it's weight in gold.)  This is an
<br />indispensable book for anyone who wants to write their own ray tracer or
<br />learn more about the latest techniques used in photorealistic rendering.</span>

                    <span>I've been working on a parallel renderer in my spare time for a bit and without a doubt - this book is a definate keeper in my library.  A solid introduction, as well as providing more intermediate material- this book also provides a ray tracing system that is immediately extensible for your own experiments.  
<br />This book has enough material and ideas to keep a ray tracing programmer busy for years.</span>

                    <span>The key to realistic looking computer graphics is rendering. And if you really want to spend some money, go look at the cost of rendering software. This book is really three things in one. 
<br />
<br />First, there is a very good basic overview of the theory of rendering. Second is on the implementation of rendering in the real world. And Finally there is a complete rendering system suitable for use with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. 
<br />
<br />The authors are Matt Pharr, a member of the technical staff at NVIDIA, the manufacturer of the state of the art in high end graphics processing chips; and Greg Humphreys an assistant professor of computer sciende at the University of Virginia. 
<br />
<br />The book is well written and provides what is probably the most complete and comprehensive book available for understanding, designing, and building physically realistic rendering systems.</span>
