                <span id="Label1"><p>The age for using a simple text editor is long gone. The ever-growing complexity of Java and J2EE creates a need for Java development tools that offer more. If you want to be more productive with Java, you need a Java IDE. Oracle JDeveloper 10<i>g</i> is an IDE that enables you to develop Java applications with minimal effort. JDeveloper can do wonders for your Swing, JSP, Servlets, Struts, EJBs, and Web Services developments.</p>  <p>In this indispensable guide, renowned author Harshad Oak puts the technology first, enhancing the text with sample applications that demonstrate how JDeveloper can simplify your developments using the technology. Oak also focuses on the new Application Development Framework (ADF) that comes with JDeveloper 10<i>g</i>&#151;a framework that will get your applications up and running fast.</p>  <p>The book also delves into Jdeveloper&#146;s many code optimization tools, demonstrating how to use them to find improper or resource-hungry code thats requires your immediate attention. Oak continues on to discuss JDeveloper extensions that add even more value to JDeveloper. </p></span>

                    <span>I found the book useful as it provided good J2EE grounding to get me on my way with what is a very complex subject. The changed version from the version used is a minus for the book. However using the source code available on the book's official page made using the book simple and useful. 
<br />If you a beginner / intermediate level j2ee and jdeveloper user, I think this book will be very useful. If you are already a J2EE expert, then this might be a little on the simpler side.</span>

                    <span>This book is another example of sloppy workmanship being rushed into print without competent editing or proofing. The presentation is uneven and disorganized and over half of the examples do not work correctly. The author apparently used an early beta version of 10g - so the screen shots and directions do not correspond to the actual product; with patience one can follow the examples. However publishing a technical book that is so replete with errors that some of the examples will not even compile is in my opinion just inexcusable. Apress should be ashamed to have published this.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because flicking through the pages at the local book store, it looked like it had everything I needed to get a quick jump start into web services & JDeveloper. I wanted a book that would walk me through the steps of creating a webservice, deploying it and then using it. Sadly, it was no help - it lacks important steps, and conveniently skips over important topics such as configuring JDeveloper to connect to your application server so you can actually deploy your webservices.... 
<br />
<br />In summary, a simple book that could have been written by someone who has seen but not actually used JDeveloper! </span>

                    <span>I am hesitant to write a really bad review, but some books deserve it. 
<br />
<br />The point of a book like this is to teach you how to use a tool. The problem is that this book doesn't do it. The authors do not fully explain the examples. For example, on page 45 they display a dialog box, but never tell you how to get to it. The examples don't work; on another page we are told that if you double click on a combo box that certain code will be generated. JDev doesn't generate the code. The book is also based on a beta release of JDev!!! I am not sure why anyone would base a book on beta software. 
<br />
<br />After struggling with the book for hours I gave up. This was really a disappointment for me.

                    <span>This work was based on an earlier, beta I guess, version of 10g.  When working through the examples on the REAL 10g I was severely challenged to figure out what the author was talking about versus what Oracle had actually included in the final version.  In one area even the downloaded routines didn't work.
<br />The good thing I can say is that this author seems to be the only one to produce a book of this kind!  I'm still waiting for my (pre-publication order) copy of the official Oracle Handbook.</span>
