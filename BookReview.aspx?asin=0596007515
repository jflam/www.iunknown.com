                    <span>This is basically a book on how to get the most out of PayPal.  Whether you are trying to make a purchase, sell and item, or setup a complete e-Commerce solution based on PayPal you will find the information on how to do it here.  Some of the information in the book includes how to create an account, what to do when you forget your password, how to get things fixed if your account has been limited, how to pay from a cell phone, dispute a payment, receive money, upgrade your account, lower seller fees, hack-proof your payment buttons, and even encryption.  It even has information on the PayPal webservices API and putting a PayPal payment button in an email.
<br />
<br />This is an excellent and detailed course on how to use the intricacies of PayPal.  PayPal Hacks:  100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools is highly recommended to everyone who shops or sells on the Internet as well as anyone who programs sites to use PayPal. </span>

                    <span>Don't waste your money unless you are one of the minority of webmasters that work exclusively in a Windows environment.
<br />
<br />This book could have been useful if the authors had not insisted on showing all examples in asp, VBscript and .net which are used by only about 20% of all web servers and shown them in perl or php which are available for virtually every web server platform.</span>

                    <span>This is a really easy book to provide feedback on.  How quickly will it pay for its cover price?  If you are a seller with any kind of volume, the answer is quickly (if you aren't already following the suggestions).  The tip on the debit card is great, as are the tips for reducing fees.
<br />
<br />There are also great suggestions for subscriptions, donations and even setting up a simple affiliate scheme.  As an aside, this book is a "must have" if your setting up a not for profit web site.
<br />
<br />There are also some great marketing tips and advice on minimizing chargebacks.
<br />
<br />This isn't a windows specific book - it uses PERL, C++, ASP and has plenty of HTML only tips.  Very unfair to describe this book as Windows centric (the maximum lenth of the code provided is only a few sides - longest source listings are for PayPal API chapter; if your running a UNIX box then use the listing as Pseudo Code and port to your platform  - not hard for a half decent programmer.  The code provided is well documented.  Microsoft has a vey sizeable slice of the e-commerce server market and shouldn't be ignored.
<br />
<br />Excellent book for sellers using PayPal.</span>

                    <span>I really like the content in this book, especially the basics that it covers. I've never really understood some of the intricacies of PayPal, and I do need to know about it, so that's good. Unlike most O'Reilly books which have the opportunity to be somewhat language-neutral, however, this one fails at that important aspect. Many similar books from O'Reilly attempt to give examples in several languages, for instance, Perl, PHP, Python, Visual Basic, Java, etc. But this book only offers its wealth of examples in ASP.NET. Which is such a shame. Shame on you O'Reilly! It could have been so useful!!!</span>
