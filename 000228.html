<h3 class="title">Introducing Kobe</h3>

<p><P>My extremely low blogging frequency of late can be partially explained by this snapshot:</P><SPAN><br />
<CENTER><IMG height=600 alt=[Image] hspace=4 src="Images/Kobe_with_toy_medium.jpg" width=800 border=0 cd:pos="0"><BR clear=all></CENTER></SPAN><SPAN><br />
<P><BR clear=all>This is our new puppy; his name is Kobe. He's a black Labrador Retriever that we brought home from <A href="http://www.bralexlabradors.ca">Bralex Labradors</A>. For some earlier pictures of Kobe (and his littermates),&nbsp;<A href="http://www.bralexlabradors.ca/puppies.html">look here</A> (this link will&nbsp;probably be obsolete in a few days when <A href="http://www.bralexlabradors.ca/upcomming.html#litters">Darbi's puppies arrive</A>).&nbsp;We visited Bralex several times before finally picking up Kobe last Saturday. He had the sweetest temperment amongst his littermates, and took to us instantly.</P><br />
<P>As new parents, Carolyn and I have had a few sleep-deprived nights as we struggled to understand Kobe and how to communicate with him. Crate training has really helped to housebreak him. So far there have only been a few isolated accidents as we're learning his signals to us. </P><br />
<P></SPAN><SPAN>He's got a <EM>really </EM>great temperment. He loves meeting new people, and is absolutely the star of our apartment building. His fan club becomes bigger every time we take him outside to go potty. </SPAN></P><br />
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>We took Kobe for his first visit to his vet, Dr. Al Moroz of the Animal Hospital of High Park, this afternoon. Al's a tremendous vet; we were so impressed by how well he handled Kobe and how he was able to settle down his anxious parents! Al's got a new black Lab puppy as well, who's just a week younger than Kobe. His stories about his dog and how she gets along with him really helped us out in understanding black Lab behavior. I can't recommend Al enough as a vet.</SPAN></P><br />
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Kobe's a big puppy already. Born on January 5, he already weighs a whopping 17 pounds as a 9-week old! To put that growth spurt in perspective, he weighed 9 pounds on Februrary 18 ...&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>Al figures he's going to be a really big dog when he's full-grown. His best guess right now is 90+ pounds. </SPAN><SPAN></P></SPAN></p>

<p>Cute picture reinforcing the fact that I think all the labradors we've had have been chewers to various degrees as puppies. They're so much hard work at this age and yet so rewardingly cuddly.<br />
Make the most of it because it doesn't take long before they're too big to sit on your lap, or if they're like my 7 year old border collie, too big to sit on your lap and you still be able to see to type and read the screen ;o).</p>

<p>Our black lab spent plenty of time chewing on our children, almost to the point of exile. It took about 6 months before she stopped "getting into trouble". She's now about 13 months old and what we consider the perfect dog! Just a little advice, hang in there. </p>

<p>Ahhh... the joys of new puppy ownership.  It took us about 5 months before our new terrier stoped waking me up between 2-4 am to go out...<br />
Glad she has out grown that... and thank *god* for the crate =)<br />
Enjoy</p>

<p>Why oh why isn't Ramses (our beloved Labrador) still not clean (he's nearly 20month already)... We had him when he was like 4 month old, might be the reason...<br />
However, lemme state that having a huge labrador on his lap with dual screen is not feasible. That's why i have my feets on him when coding <br />
I should post pictures of Ramses and lady (our second dog) on my blog too...<br />
Is that a coder thing about having labradors and dual screens??<br />

<p>congrats! I just got a black lab puppy in Oct 2003 she's now about 8mos. old and loves to bark chew and be a lil monster in general. Will she ever grow out of it? She's driving me crazy. She is definately full of energy and smart enough to blatently disobey me if she thinks she can get away w/ it. Any suggestions?</p>
