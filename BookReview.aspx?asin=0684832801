                <span id="Label1">To gain a better understanding of contemporary Middle Eastern culture and society, which is steeped in tradition, one should look closely at its history. Bernard Lewis, Professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University, considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the Middle East, spans 2000 years of this region's history, searching in the past for answers to questions that will inevitably arise in the future. <p>  Drawing on material from a multitude of sources, including the work of archaeologists and scholars, Lewis chronologically traces the political, economical, social, and cultural development of the Middle East, from Hellenization in antiquity to the impact of westernization on Islamic culture. Meticulously researched, this enlightening narrative explores the patterns of history that have repeated themselves in the Middle East. <p>  From the ancient conflicts to the current geographical and religious disputes between the Arabs and the Israelis, Lewis examines the ability of this region to unite and solve its problems and asks if, in the future, these unresolved conflicts will ultimately lead to the ethnic and cultural factionalism that tore apart the former Yugoslavia.</span>

                    <span>Lewis is the Daniel Boorstin of Middle East historians. He brings the same sort of encyclopaedic knowledge to his subject. The vast scope of his erudition is evident on every page in this volume. In fact, if there is anything to quibble about, it may be that few readers will be able to keep pace with him as he traverses Middle-Eastern history and landscape. <P> Part of the difficulty in keeping up comes from the way in which Lewis presents his information. This is not your typical linear narrative, starting at a particular era and then ploughing forward through time. Though there is an overall progression (we start out in the Roman era and end up in current times), the author also often backtracks when discussing different aspects of the civilizations he covers. So while the book starts out in a relatively chronological manner in the first few chapters(Romans>Byzantines-Crusades>Mongol Invasions>Turkic Ascendency-Ottomans), we suddenly detour to Part IV of the book, entitled "Cross-Sections." Lewis then proceeds to break down different societal components such as "The State," "The Economy," "The Elites," etc. in which he backtracks to provide additional details about groups he has earlier portrayed. This is where I for one, who am looking for enlightenment on these subjects and have no real background scholastically speaking, had a hard time keeping track. I consider myself at least a moderately attentive reader, and a lover of history from Herodotus to Gibbon to Parkman to Tuchman, but felt swamped at times here from the sheer wealth and breadth of information. One also had better be up on their geography from about six different eras in that part of the world. Though there are a series of maps in the appendix, obscure towns, countries and dynasties are paraded forth at a rate that is taxing for the general reader. While we may be familiar with place-names such as Mecca, Medina or even Basra, how many western readers are going to have a mental image of the area that Yathrib sits in? or Nishapur? or Bukhara? The maps don't really help either, as the regions that have the most obscure towns are in areas that are the most darkly shaded, and the print is so fine, it's impossible to make the names out. <P> All that said, if you want to learn about a region that up until recently not many westerners were really all that interested in, Lewis is an excellent teacher. Just be warned that he is rather a dry lecturer. He's not a "school of color" historian. He's an academic and a pure scholar. There are vitually no anecdotal details. No human interest. No exciting passages or descriptions of great battles. He is a purveyor of information and you will come away from reading <The Middle East> with a lot more information than you came in with. If, like me, you think being at least reasonably well-informed at times such as these is important, you will want to investigate this book.</span>

                    <span>Contrary to previous reviewers, this book is NOT banal or dull. Bernard Lewis is the preeminent English-writing historian on the world's powderkeg region of today and has a wealth of knowledge on the area and its culture. For the average non-fiction reader, the text is not tough to read and has quite a bit of life to it, but if all you read is Oprah's Book of the Month, it may be a bit tedious.<P>However, I can only give it three stars because, although it's subtitled "A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years," it was a bit too brief for my literary palate. I anxiously devoured the work eager to learn about Suleyman the Magnificent and Ataturk; instead I learned that the eggplant comes from the Middle East and a peach, at one time, was known as a Persian apple.<P>And that's my biggest gripe with the book. Lewis titles it as an overview of the region giving prospective readers the idea it will cover famous Middle East leaders, its countries and their origins, and the timeless religious conflicts. Instead, the book takes a Howard Zinn approach to the region and covers in great detail the inhabitants and their religion, culture, economy, social castes, judicial systems, agriculture, etc. Over one-third of the book entitled "Cross-Sections" is on this subject matter, And although informative, it is impertinent to the political history of the Muslim world, which the title of the book implies it is about.<BR>The only historical figure garnering a significant amount of ink in the book is, for obvious reasons, Muhammad. Lewis' basic explanation of the Muslim religion in his section "The Dawn and Noon of Islam," is an engrossing look into one of the major religions of the world and would be quite helpful to someone who is new to the subject matter. Lewis has a number of other books solely devoted to the subject matter but gives a good overview in this work.<BR>With the large sections on culture and religion, there is little room left in the book on the political history itself. Lewis gives brief synopsis' on Iran's early history and the reign of the Ottoman Empire but little else. The 20th century info is contained in just 40 pages at the end of the last chapter.<BR>Lewis does deserve extra credit for two helpful tools in the back with the reader-friendly chronology and informative maps.<P>In conclusion, ask yourself what most interests you as the reader about the Middle East? If one is interested in the culture and everyday life, this book is a great start. If one wants the political history about the rulers and military leaders, I'd look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book because it was the only one at Borders that seemed to be "history" on a larger perspective than the past hundred years or history since the dawn of Islam. Unfortunately, I had very little prior knowledge of the area and the people, so a lot of things he talks about that many would take for granted and maybe get something out of - left me clueless (computer teacher: pick up your mouse - nubee student: what's a mouse?) Going back now and looking at it after having acquainted myself through some other books (War without End by La Guardia is nice, and is rather unbiased - it seems rather pro-Israeli at first, but if you keep reading, you find a gem of a book) (not that I'm anti-Israeli - I just mean to imply it's an unbiased look at the Israeli-Palestinian question, which, eventually, evelopes a whole study of southwest Asia). As far as this authors particular bias, and especially in regards to this book, I don't know enough to detect a lot of it in the ideas of earlier time, because I haven't read enough to compare it, and I haven't gotten to the end, so I don't know how he views the modern shape of things. And they wouldn't be very modern - this book came out in 1995, the year in which a majority of the events in Baer's See no Evil take place. Matter of fact, read that one first - it reads quickly and gives an introduction to things - keep Dilip Hiro's "Essential Middle East" by your side for referrence. Then come back to Amazon and look up the titles you see at your book store, and see who likes it, who doesn't, and what gets recommended instead. 2 stars for this book - it's hard to get through if your new, and I recommended three other books in this review.</span>

                    <span>For people not well versed in the history of the Middle East (and there are many of us in the West), this book is an outstanding introduction to the topic. Bernard Lewis gives readers an overview of the region from the days before Islam up to the end of the 20th century. He presents excellent details without resulting in an excessively long book. Perhaps best of all, the book is completely free of any ideological bias. It is simply a recitation of history as pure fact, with appropriate analysis where helpful. It is difficult to imagine that there is a better book out there on this subject.</span>

                    <span>Countering some of the past reviews of this work, I am giving it high praise. I found this book remarkable. True, it is a lot of time to fit into some 400 pages, and it does contain a great amount of detail, but those with a modicum of background on Middle Eastern and Islamic civilization, I think will find this a very good book. Lewis is a serious and intelligent scholar, and it is obvious that his knowledge is vast in its breadth.<P>It is broken into four parts: Foundations, Early Islam, Cross-Sections, and the Challenge of Modernity. I have seen that many criticize the disruption to the flow of the work that the Cross-Sections represents, which focuses on things like culture, state, religion and law, etc. But I disagree. If one thing is clear it is that there is a clear break in Islamic civilization between its past glory and its present malaise. Lewis objectively examines this in a very factual and fair manner. The last section, which talks about Challenge, Change, War, etc. is really the story of how and why Islamic civilization declined relative to Europe after having experienced such great power and wealth. Also, the Cross-Sections offers a glimpse into the personal history of the region. It's focus on the internal structures and constructs of society is a great counter-balance to the history of conquests and defeats, the official 'history' which is really always about the ruling elite.<P>Lewis carefully describes the environment prior to the coming of Islam, the condition of Byzantium, and the environment of Arabia before Muhammad. A nomadic, tribal civilization, within 100 years, had been transformed into a vast Empire stretching from India to Spain, patronizing the arts, building breathtaking mosques, and learning the classical history of the West! That in itself is a respectable accomplishment. At its early ages, Islam was far more tolerant than Christianity; Muslims generally did not force the conversion of Christians and Jews (although they did to other peoples at times) and so-called 'heretical' Christians received much better treatment than under the orthodox nature of the Byzantine state. The also were freer to acquire land and use it to better their livelihood. <P>Islam took root at the center of the Old World. Largely due to this, they were continually threatened on the west by Europe and on the south and east by Turks and Mongols. This was bound to cause trouble of course, but the Islamic tradition proved powerful enough to convert the pagan conquerors; within 100 years, the Mongols were Muslims. Chaos and uncertainty of course occurred, but it proved transitory. <P>A complete account of what life was actually like for Muslims of the time is contained in the Cross-Sections. You will read about the great age of Arabic love poetry, the brilliant accomplishments in architecture and science, the practical implications of the split between Sunni and Shiite. And most interestingly, for myself, the emergence of the Sufi mystical tradition, which had popular appeal among the commonality. A mystical, ecstatic tradition, it sought closeness with the unity of God through personal transcendent experience. The tradition combined aspects of older religions, Christianity, central Asian shamanism, Egyptian rituals, for example. Brotherhoods of Sufi dervishes were to become very important, particularly in the Ottoman Empire.<P>The final section deals with the decline of the Middle East. Economic decline was accompanied by border conflicts for both the Ottomans and the Iranian Safavids, as both Russia and Europe began rising militarily and conquering strategic lands very valuable for their resources and/or access to international trading routes. The rise of nationalism, an import from Europe, proved unmanageable for the Ottoman Empire and disintegration of the peoples inevitably followed. The resources required for true industrialization were not in as great numbers as in Europe nor were they effectively utilized. Also, in companionship with the late Roman Empire, a qualitative decrease in the military ability of the Janissaries and reduced discipline led to a pattern of military defeat. The death knell, of course was WW1. Due to historical accidents, the Ottoman Empire became aligned with Germany. When Germany lost, so did the Ottoman Empire and Britain and France carved nations out of the fallen empire, and the struggle to adapt to that idea continues to this day. But, things are changing for the better. At the time of this writing there are many positive signals of democratic reform coming from Iran; more power to the Iranians.<P>This book may be a bit dense, but it's very good. I have read several sections a couple of times.</span>
