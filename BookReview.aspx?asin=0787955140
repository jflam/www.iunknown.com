I personally own just about every book Alan Weiss has written. He is not only a consultant's consultant, but he is also a gifted writer as well.

                    <span>It has always seemed to me that when quite a few 5-star reviews are accompanied by a couple of one and two-star reviews, something is worth reading. I found this book to be exceptional in that it: addresses finding new targets of opportunity; discusses a variety of ways to get to the buyer; examines behavioral predispositions; provides sample objections and rebuttals; teaches how to deal with committees; and a great deal more. The 5-star reviews are based on this kind of pragmatic detail and the one-stars on clear resentment of Dr. Weiss's success, apparently. In any case, if you're trying to sell professional services, buy this book. The sections on how to provide value early in the sales process and a dozen new sources of business are worth it alone.</span>

                    <span>There is little to nothing new here that hasn't already been covered within Alan's incredible "Million Dollar Consulting." Based upon my very positive experience with "Million Dollar Consulting," I made a significant investment to purchase most of the titles within the "Ultimate Consulting" series of books. Unfortunately, with rare exception, each of these books is little more than an expanded excerpt from "Million Dollar Consulting."  My advice?  Buy, borrow, beg or steal a copy of Alan's incredible "Million Dollar Consulting."  If you already own it, save the money that you would have otherwise spent on this or other books within the "Ultimate Consulting" series to invest elsewhere in your practice.  Good luck.</span>

                    <span>When it comes to the consulting business, Alan Weiss has been there, done that and probably consulted for the T-shirt company that sold you the T-shirt. So what does a consultant do when he's mastered the consulting business? Why, he becomes a consultant to consultants of course. Weiss has perfected his craft. His book takes you into the buyer's office, a rarified atmosphere where being too anxious to please can cost you business fast. Weiss has an instinctive understanding of the relationship between prospect and consultant, and an uncanny ability to communicate it. He makes you feel empowered to strike out and start your own seven-figure consultancy - except you'd be competing against the likes of Alan Weiss. We from getAbstract strongly recommend his book to both veteran consultants and neophytes.</span>

                    <span>Alan faces off against the number one consulting killer...success. How to Acquire Clients provides practical advice on all areas of a practice: stealing clients, negotiating, dealing with buyer barriers, committees, etc. The best aspect of the book for me is that none of the aspects are impossible to implement. You can buy the book today and immediately put the strategies into action.</span>
