                <span id="Label1">It has taken four years, but with <I>Head First Java</I> the introductory Java book category has finally come of age. This is an excellent book, far more capable than any of the scores of Java-for-novices books that have come before it. Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates deserve rich kudos--and big sales--for developing this book's new way of teaching the Java programming language, because any reader with even a little bit of discipline will come away with true understanding of how the language works. Perhaps best of all, this is no protracted "Hello, World" introductory guide. Readers get substantial exposure to object-oriented design and implementation, serialization, neatwork programming, threads, and Remote Method Invocation (RMI).<p>  Key to the authors' teaching style are carefully designed graphics. Rather than explain class inheritance (to cite one example) primarily with text, the authors use a series of tree diagrams that clarify the mechanism far more succinctly. The diagrams are carefully annotated with arrows and notes. Also characteristic of the unique teaching strategy is heavy reliance on exercises, in which the reader is asked to complete partial classes, write whole new code segments and do design work. Though there's little discussion of why the exercises' correct answers are what they are, it's clear that the practice work was carefully designed to reinforce the lesson at hand. If you've waited this long to give Java a try, this book is a great choice. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: The Java programming language for people with no Java experience, and even people with no programming experience at all. Key concepts read like a list of Java features: Object oriented design, variable type and scope, object properties and methods, inheritance and polymorphism, exceptions, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), network connectivity, Java archives (JAR files), and Remote Method Invocation (RMI).</span>

                    <span>I have been working with Java programming language for 5 years. I successfully passed several certification exams. So I know the details of The Java World. Even so I have recently bought Head First Java book (which looks like being intended especially for beginners) and I found out new funny ways how very simply and effectively learn Java.
<br />Believe me. It is very effective book and besides it you will have a lot of fun. That is what I usually miss at my work place :-)
<br />The book uses a lot of pictures and graphics. At first sight you could think (as I did) that is not worth of it at all ! But the contrary is true and you will learn Java very easily and deeply. I own second book from K.Sierra and B.Bates - Head First EJB. Same way of learning. Same recommendation.
<br />I strongly recommend it to everyone and I little bit regret I had not bought it earlier.

                    <span>Not only does this book give a beginner a comprehensive tutorial in Java, it also highlights Object Oriented Concepts that are essential to good Java programming.  I would have given this book a five star rating, if it wasn't for bad editing (errors in examples, etc.)  But, at least, there are less errors than the first edition.  This is the first book on learning Java that I have been able to actually sit down and make my way through.  Rather than use the basic Java compiler, I would recommend using the Eclipse product (download free at www.eclipse.org) since that is the new emerging standard in Java (and other lanugages) programming.  Learning Eclipse while you are learning Java would only help.</span>

                    <span>Well...this book is very perfect for those newbies who want to really gain understanding in Java. Sierra and Bates are just awesome in detailing the theory of Java. They both know how to make Java looked a little bit chilled. If my suggestion is allowed, I would really suggest them to write more codes in their book. Somehow, their theory is great, but I feel programming needs more example to foster our understanding and experience on the codes. Overall, this book is RECOMMENDED for OO Java programming. </span>

                    <span>I had tried learning java. After several false starts with various books, I finally got to know about Head First Java. This book was amazing. I feel confident that I will never ever forget the concepts. Actually the concepts also help me to clear the SCJP exam with 91%, all this within 2 months of learning Java !!! I strongly recommend this book for people who want to learn java. All the essential concepts are covered. May be later you can upgrade to a full fledged reference, but this builds your fundamentals. Now I am learning Servlets and JSP from Head First Servlets and JSP. The fun in learning continues !!!</span>

                    <span>'Head First Java' is easily the best learner's text for Java I've looked through. Not only have Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates produced a coherent text that is also fun and engaging: their particular approach has also been very thoughtful. They take time to consider how the format of the book assists the reader's grasp of the material, and then religiously follow through on this concrete rationale to educating. And mark my words: you will be educated. 'Head First Java' will take you swiftly through important Java concepts and formulae, covering (lucidly) in twenty pages what other books dawdle over in forty. 
<br />
<br />I only fault this books usefulness to true computing novices, as it makes assumptions about the extent of the readers' knowledge prior to opening the first page. Used in conjuction with a less-assuming and cleaner text, though, 'Head First Java' will almost certainly concretize the education of as many novice programmers as it will independently accentuate the knowledge of Java converts.
<br />
<br />Put this one back on the bookshelf at your own peril.</span>
