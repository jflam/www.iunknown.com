                <span id="Label1">Wildly successful hoops coach Rick Pitino takes a time-out from the rigors of the NBA to outline his approach and techniques for motivating individuals.  The paperback edition contains an all-new foreword written since Pitino's departure from the Kentucky Wildcats and the 1997 national championship season. His plan for excellence in all aspects of life, including sports and business, is more than goal achievement; this is the guidebook for goal <I>over</I>achievement!  Pitino presents 10 crucial steps for success, drawing examples from his 20-plus years in the basketball trenches to inspire readers.</span>

                    <span>  People who read Rick Pitino's Success is a Choice book will find it to be a pretty well-written motivational book. In the book, Pitino bases his success around 10 simple steps, in which he explains in a detailed manner that we all can understand.  Pitino's book gave me a clue on how to go about long-term success and also on how to keep it. He explains that once you reach your goals, to look back at the steps you took to get there.</span>

                    <span>Rick Pitino's book on how to overachieve in the business world is nothing that anybody with any common sense hasn't heard before.  The book was written because Pitino is trying to tell his story of his basketball career.  He will make a germane point with the first paragraph at the beginning of the chapter, and then will belabor the simple point into 20 pages.  This is a good book to read, buy you don't need to read the whole thing, you need to read the first few points of the chapter, where Pitino makes his point, and the summary of the main points at the end of the chapter, and you will learn just as much as somebody who read the whole book.  It is a decent piece of literature, but combined with a biography of Pitino's career makes the entire work way to redundant.</span>

                    <span>Success is a Choice is a book I wish I had read years ago. Oh wait, actually I did. My dad thrust it into my hands the summer before my junior year of college, which was six years ago. Coming away with a renewed "can-do" attitude and all the sense that this book made, I returned to school that fall weighing ten pounds less and committed to studying harder and making better grades. 
<br />At that time, I had much different goals than I do today. Reading it then, I had little clue about the corporate world and couldn't truly identify with those success-sabotaging scenarious Pitino describes that we can often let happen to us in the workplace. I am so thankful I decided to once again return to this incredible book for a refresher course in self-motivation and overachievement. Now as a young working adult faced directly with new challenges, I am  so much more appreciative of what Pitino is talking about.   
<br />In today's environment Pitino's ideas are needed more than ever. I wish this book could somehow be re-introduced and read by all the good citizens of the world. I wish that even those who read it when it was first published would read it again. This book is empowering and dynamic. Through reading it and choosing to closely follow its principles, your life and the lives of those around you REALLY CAN dramatically change for the better.

                    <span>There is nothing here that hasn't been written elsewhere, and better. But the biggest problem is the titular idea that "success is a choice." Hogwash! If success is a choice, why didn't Mr Pitino "choose" to succeed as coach of the Boston Celtics instead of failing miserably? It's abjectly self-serving to win a college championship and then write a huge pat on your own back congratulating yourself on having "chosen" to win. Where is the book after the Celtics fiasco? In point of fact, most of our successes or failures in life are determined by forces completely out of our control. In the words of the old adage, people like Pitino are born on third base and spend their lives thinking they hit a triple. Worse, such an attitude allows the haves to blame the have-nots for their own plight, instead of recognizing the systemic obstacles standing in the way of universal socio-economic enfranchisement.</span>
