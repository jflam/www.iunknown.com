                    <span>This set of CDs talks about how the lack of being present-to-life shows up in our personal lives.  I have been working on personal growth work for years and I have listened to dozens of authors.  This one CD is packed with clues about where I can become more conscious and improve my experience in life.  Anyone truly interested in personal introspection and willing to confront the negative aspects of their life will find this to be an excellent self-help tool.</span>

                    <span>Having read some of the reviews and ideas I am afraid I have to agree about the way Tolle is marketing himself. He says that on enlightenment 80 % of his thought processes disappeared. He is a lovely and simple and inspiring guy and I have sent copies of his book to many people, and the CD Even the Sun will Die, but I would love to know why he feels this need to keep saying the same thing over and over and use his enlightenment like so many others to make a buck or two. <br>Is there no other way to be....do we have to earn a living by marketing  our spiritual awareness...how many CD's did Gandhi publish....? Will we have Tolle key rings next with NOW written on them?<br>Please Tolle take this to heart...you are a lovely lovely man with a wonderful and simple message....do you do this for the love or the money?</span>

                    <span>This CD helped me put into practice more deeply the teachings in the book "The Power of Now". It also clarified a lot of things that I didn't fully understand or needed expanding. This is an excellent companion to the book and I highly recommend it to anyone.<br>Please do not pay any attention to the 'reviewers' that rated this CD as anything but 5 stars. Their problem probably wasn't about the material itself. It is top notch.</span>

                    <span>From my perspective, I must disagree with a previous review and say that I listened to this (mine was a cassette tape) before the book and it engaged me in Tolle's concepts very easily. Listening is a good vehicle for me to learn and it actually helped me understand the book better!<br>Tolle's concept of the "pain body" is one that is easily identifiable in one's everyday experience. It has especially helped as an anchor for my husband and me to communicate during times of conflict.</span>

                    <span>I must rescind the shot I took at Sounds True in my earlier review.  I have since e mailed them about my dissatisfaction and they have offered me a full refund, although I purchased the product from Amazon.  I still have concerns about the marketing of some of Tolle's stuff, but  the tape IS very good and the publishers (Sounds True) are more than fair and receptive in their business practices.</span>
