                    <span>My husband and I were longing to spend our weekends introducing our two children, ages four and two, to the great outdoors. I turned to the web to research our options and find out about the campgrounds in our area. My search led to frustration as I found scattered details here and there and no comprehensive information that would aid in my choosing our weekend destinations. After many dead ends I finally hit the jackpot with my web search, a site that recommended Tom's book! I purchased the book and was so impressed with all of the information that less than 24 hours after it first hit my hands, I felt compelled to write to Tom and thank him for providing such a wonderful resource to those looking to camp in California. Camping with two small children, I need specific details on campsites and the activities surrounding them. This book has provided that and much, much more. I feel like our camping opportunities have been vastly expanded, and this book was well worth the investment. <P>I highly recommend this book! Thank you again Tom!</span>

                    <span>This book proves to be an excellent resource for locating campgrounds. The facts are generally accurate, for example, you can easily tell if a campground accomodates an RV or pets or has piped water. However, the notes based on opinion, such as seneic rating and the extra "trip notes" are just that--the opinion of the author--and sometimes are radically different than what I would assign the campground. We have visited many wonderful, remote campgrounds that have secnic ratings of "4." It's best not to let these numbers influence your selection of a particular campground. But overall, a MUST for any California camper.</span>

                    <span>We tent camp several times a year in different locations and have used past editions of this book. This new edition is the best. The maps and directions are very good. The author continues to use the "5%" icon which indicates a campground that is used by less than 5% of campers and typically is more remote. These are our favorite locations. I don't always agree with the ratings but we've learned that we're usually always pleased with a 5% site. This year we selected a site, hated it (too crowded), and found another wonderful location within 30 miles. There is no way we could have done this without the guide. We don't leave for a camping trip without it.</span>

                    <span>I have used this book for several years, have a couple editions, and believe the latest incarnation is the best outdoor book I have ever used. So, in response to the guy who said he couldn't find any good spots! HAH! Since all the spots are here, you'd have to be clueless not to be able to find ones that fit what you want. My husband and me would never go out on a trip without this book in our car.</span>

                    <span>I don't believe Tom Stienstra has visited many of the campgrounds he recommends. Twice I have stayed at campgrounds given 9 (out of ten) which were awful. For example, he never mentions that Shelter Cove's campground is basically a parking lot with no privacy and no space.<P>It is a good list of all the campgrounds in CA but not a guide.</span>
