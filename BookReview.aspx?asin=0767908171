                <span id="Label1">From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <I>A Short History of  Nearly Everything</I> reports what happened and how humans figured it  out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses  hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with  luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who  rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how  we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the  unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style  and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably. Though <I>A Short History</I> clocks  in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every  science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed  novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a  topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters  are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and  "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of  <I>Life</I> and <I>Trilobite</I>)  and these interviews are charming. But it's when Bryson dives into some  of science's best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway  Morris vs. Gould--that  he finds literary gold. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>A Short History of Nearly Everything is a wonderful blend of science, history, politics, and psychology. The book delivers exactly what it promises, a text that allows you to "understand and appreciate-marvel at, enjoy, even- the wonder and accomplishments of science at a level that isn't too technical or demanding, but that isn't entirely superficial either."<P>Beginning at the beginning, Bryson starts with the dawn of the universe...the big bang. He impresses upon us the unimaginable vastness and grandeur of space, the unique series of coincidences and the miracle of our mere existence and then proceeds to chronicle the history of scientific discovery and hijinx that form our collective knowledge, notions and misconceptions about the universe.<P>Throughout the book Bryson balances witty sarcasm with shear awe at the genius and the amazing coincidences that have advanced science and mankind. This is a must read for the intellectually curious.</span>

                    <span>I think a lot of people have a great deal of appreciation and respect for the sciences, but like most of us, it IS easy to get lost in those old textbooks that read like a dry explanation of paint drying.<P>It's comforting to find that the author himself has been and still is perplexed and awestruck by the questions from the scientific world. From microorganisms to the double helix and E=mc2 to geology, Bryson makes sense of it all, well, at least most of it. (Granted, fungus, I thought, weren't all that great [granted, still isn't ;)] and continues to be a bit confusing; however, Bryson makes it fun and not too complicated.) He really knows how to break concepts of physics to a level that an average high school student can understand and GASP! enjoy. You must be thinking that something is quite wrong here. I know that's what I thought the first time I read it.<P>Bryson delves into the science itself but gives a rich history and account of man's discoveries. He gives some great facts and ironic stories of discovery whilst juxtaposing honest candor throughout the whole book. It's a huge thick book and can be quite daunting. But, it's something that I'll read over and over again. It's a great reference piece that I know I'll use. There are names you've heard and stories you'll be familiar with and many anecdotes that make you chuckle but also makes you cringe regarding humanity's great follies and parochial tunnel vision.<P>At the end of book, there is a list of all his sources as well as pretty good index of the major topics he discussed. Mind you, it's not very comprehensive and you may find yourself leafing the whole section of one chapter to find the name or reference that's NOT in the index. It does get a bit vexing; but, it's well worth it. Just read it again; in fact, you'll appreciate it better and remember things too.</span>

                    <span>This book is aimed at people who either know very little about science, or who studied it in school and then forgot it all (my case). I read some of the reviews here and was shocked at how people criticize Bryson, especially saying he got scientific terms mixed up or had errors in his book. He is not a scientist and in my opinion that makes this book that much more impressive! Bryson devoted years of his life to learn this material, and to think we can take it all in by reading a book.. well it just doesn't seem fair! I was sad when I reached the end of the book, I wanted it to continue. I learned so much from this book, and it's interesting how many times the subject material in this book comes up in every day conversations. <P>Bryson approaches history from two angles: Astronomy and what we know about the universe, and Evolution and what we know about life on Earth. I learned so many things I didn't know. Fascinating facts such as that meteorites are used to date the earth with carbon dating (they're the same age). Meteorites contain proteins needed to build life. Human like species have been on Earth for 1 million years. After finishing this book, I find myself thinking about topics like these during my free time. That's how impressive this book is. If you love science, this won't be a book you just read and forget. It's a book that will teach you things you'll be thinking about for a long time. <P>Honestly I cannot recommend this book highly enough. If you're interested in science, it is a must read.<P>Michael</span>

                    <span>The book's title is very gripping but somewhat misleading - it is in fact a book of science tabloids - in a good way. It covers basic findings and histories of almost all major areas of natural sciences in a shallow but easy to follow manner. It is not intended to be introductory to science and science history (find a textbook instead), it is a fun-fact book of science and science history.<P>This book is full of interesting anecdotes of science and scientists behind scene, which makes the reading stimulating and gives the readers a joyful sense of "discovery". Here are just a few examples top of my mind:<P>- Components of your daily household cleaning powders like Comet and Ajax are made from the huge ash deposit in eastern Nebraska - they are leftover volcanic ashes from the ancient monstrous eruption of Yellowstone.<P>- Marie Curie, the only person to win Nobel prize in both chemistry and physics, was never elected to the French academy of sciences largely because she had an affair with a married fellow physicist after Pierre Curie died in a traffic accident. Madame Curie eventually died of leukemia and her papers and lab books (even her cookbooks) are so dangerously contaminated by radiation that those who wish to see them must wear protective clothing.<P>- Clair Patterson (a University of Chicago alumnus), who in 1953 gave the definitive measurement of the age of the Earth (4,550 million years - plus or minus 70 millions) by analyzing lead/uranium ratios in old rocks and meteorites, was also the leading expert in atmospheric lead poisoning and the early advocate of cleaning lead additives from manmade product. To his credit, Clean Air Act 1970 eventually led to the ban of leaded gasoline in United States in 1986. Almost immediately the blood lead level in Americans dropped 80%.<P>Informative tabloids like these are all over the book. Bryson did a perfect job of bringing dull facts in history of science into fun everyday life experience. He compiled a huge amount of anecdotes from otherwise hard to find sources and weaved them together seamlessly in fluid and humorous writing. It makes the reading of science fun.</span>

                    <span>By reading this book you realize how lucky you are to be here right now. To be reading this in front of your computer is an acomplishment that you may not realize. It shows how much we know about ourselves and the enviroment around us. "A Short History of Nearly Everything" explains in full detail how we became who we are, how we survived, and how impossible it is to do so. If you are interested in science and are looking for something to read, this well-written story is a great page-turner.</span>
