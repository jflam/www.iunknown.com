                    <span>"Mother Night" is one of Vonnegut's most complex and intellectually stimulating novels. It is the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr., Nazi propagandist and secret agent for the United States. His high profile work for the Nazis was meant to provide him with an opportunity to safely broadcast secret information to awaiting American agents, but he was so good at his job that at the same time he was working against the Nazis he was strengthening their popularity. When Hitler fell to the Allies, he was arrested as a war criminal and now faces trial for his actions, having been disavowed by the US government.
<br />
<br />As with all of Vonnegut's work, the narrative style of "Mother Night" can be best described as disjointed. There is no continuity of time or space, the reader flies through Campbell's stream of consciousness at a breakneck pace, always in suspense of the next destination. Much like the work of William Faulkner, this format allows the author to fully explore the ambiguous motivations of his protagonist without the restrictiveness of a linear plot. We are shown the highest and lowest points of Campbell's life, his great artistic achievements as well as his ever increasing lust and greed.
<br />
<br />While the subject matter is heavy, the story keeps the sharp but shadowy wit of it's author. Much like "Slaughterhouse Five", the novel uses humor to ease the bitter medicine of war and self-realization. The more palpable the shell, the more jarring it's contents can be. As Mark Twain before him, he operates with sweet words that slice like razors into the reader's consciousness.
<br />
<br />The story is a darkly humorous morality play, an apparent attempt to analyze the difference between intentions and actions. Vonnegut refuses to pass judgement on Campbell but instead provides an almost scientific dissection of his life, leading from before the war to his last days in prison. In the end, the reader is left to make his own assessment of Campbell's life, a choice that demands a careful consideration of one's own beliefs. In the end that it Vonnegut's deeper purpose, to confront the morality not of the characters in his book but of his readers. Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Vonnegut, but very much on my mind since I purchased it off Amazon is "The Losers' Club" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite Vonnegut novels.  The overall story is somewhat sad, frustrating, and depressing, but, Vonnegut still somehow finds ways to insert humor, beauty, etc....so that ultimately, Mother Night in no way bogs down the reader, or puts you in a sour mood. I'm amazed at how Vonnegut can, at times, find gems of beauty in ugly situations.  His unique description of the dream-like stairway to a roofless night sky in a ravaged, war-torn land stands out in my mind vividly to this day.  
<br />
<br />Excellent writing throughout... highly recommended reading.</span>

                    <span>Here is the fictional autobiography of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., as given by the awesome Vonnegut. 
<br />Without giving away key plot points, I'll recommend this book right off the bat. Here is Vonnegut, yes if you can believe it, decrying the state of humanity, witfully and ironically too. There is a given moral sense to Mother Night, which Vonnegut states in the Introduction: "We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be."
<br />And Mother Night is a story of how Howard W. Campbell, Jr. and his associates must and do and will deal with said moral. 
<br />Mother Night is quite moving, in the way that so much Vonnegut is; in that here is a hero or anti-hero, a lead if you will, who is shaped rather than shapes his or her time. And how that shaping baffles, sparkles, crushes, devoures, stimulates and paralyzes. 
<br />Given an opportunity to be someone else, and taken to the fullest, for a good cause (or not), where are you then? You only have yourself....in the end....to blame....
<br />Again, highly recommended. </span>

                    <span>Authors have long had a great flaw in portraing good and evil in humans. The characters portrayed in art almost always seem to be either good or evil. Vonnegut, one of the best observers of human nature manages in this book to portray we humans as we really are, a composite of many things.
<br />
<br />Our hero, Howard, is a American spy in Germany during WWII. A profession that would be the most nobel and great characters in anything but a Vonnegut work. Here he faces a delema, his cover is that of a Nazi propagandist. He is in fact the finist most convincing Nazi propagandist. The question is which side did he help more.
<br />
<br />On the other side of the coin is a absurdly insane American Nazi dentist/embalmer. Yet oddly enough this character has gaps his his racist record. He never writes his insane essays about the inferior teeth of jews and blacks while he's married and loved.
<br />
<br />There is an American war hero turned alcoholic who's drivin to take what little joy in Howards life away from him.
<br />
<br />A Jew who survives Hitler by forging papers and joining the SS.
<br />
<br />A camp survivor who wishes nothing more then forget the whole bloody thing and get on with his life and his mother who gains wisdom through her suffering.
<br />
<br />Vonnegut turns the world inside out in what I consider the best literary treatment of human morality ever written</span>

                    <span>Vonnegut did an excellent job in this story. There wasn't any science fiction in this book like many of his others, but the character Howard Campbell was great. The story has great twists to it and it makes for quick reading. I had a hard trying to put this one down, and I think it is a must read for any Vonnegut fan.</span>
