                    <span>David J. Lieberman, Ph.D. is a recognized expert in the field of human behavior. With multiple books translated in multiple languages this is yet another fine example of his ability to give sound advice in a down to earth and useful manner. He divides the book into the five following general sections. <P>Section 1 relates to building rapport both instant rapport and keeping it over long periods. It covers everything from first impressions, to getting someone to like you, to appearing confident, and many other items. <P>Section 2 relates to detecting if someone is lying or manipulating you. <P>Section 3 relates to taking control of a situation and getting people to actually do something. Getting someone to actually take your advice, follow through on a commitment, do a favor, get along together, etc. are all covered in this section. <P>Section 4 relates to winning at a competition. Possible competitions include not only a game but job interviews, dating and similar. <P>Section 5 relates to dealing with life's normal annoying, difficult situations. For example, people who won't return phone calls, forgiveness, breaking bad news, dealing with rumors, dealing with a complaint, dealing with jealousy, etc. <P>It is easy to read the title to the book and assume that inside are the secrets to manipulating others and allowing you to take advantage of them. This is not the case at all as Dr. Lieberman starts on page one with the comment that these techniques are not "ways to manipulate other people into liking you". Are you going to get someone who can't stand your personality to suddenly like you and stand in line for the opportunity to do you a favor? Not likely. However, in the hectic world of today just getting someone to slow down enough to even notice you can be quite a chore. This sort of situation is where these techniques are valuable. <P>Also if you feel manipulated by someone and don't know how to avoid it or get out of the trap then the information can be very valuable. Recognizing when you are not in control of your own desires is the first step to changing the situation. This book can help you to understand what is happening and why you feel the way you do and then it goes one step further in showing you how you can change the situation.<P>The bottom line is that everyone should know these techniques not only so that they can recognize when they are being manipulated and can do something about it, but also so they can tell when strong feelings are not what they seem but are the result of some basic principle such as the law of association or reciprocal affection or something similar. How to make a good impression, how to change a bad one, how to stop being manipulated, how to regain control of your life, how to handle the problems of life, how to examine your feelings about someone and know if you really feel positive (or negative) about them or if it is just the normal reaction to various stimuli, it is all pretty much here in this book. If there were a great book that gave an overview of these principles this one is it. There are other great books that deal with one or two of these topics in greater detail, but none that I have read that expose you to the whole gamut of psychological principles with persuading, motivating, or getting others to at least accept your opinion as valid. A must on the bookshelf of anyone but the most recalcitrant hermit.</span>

                    <span>David J. Lieberman, Ph.D., holds a degree in psychology and is the creator of Neural-Dynamic Analysis, a short-term therapy technique. He is a speaker and consultant. He has also written two other books: Never Be Lied To Again, and Instant Analysis.<P>This 185-page book has no index, but it does have a bibliography. It is divided into five main sections: (1) how to get people to like you; (2) how to avoid being manipulated and lied to; (3) how to get anyone to do anything; (4) how to win in competitions; (5) how to get the upper hand in difficult situations.<P>Dr. Lieberman writes in a clear, direct, easy-to-understand style. While he doesn't provide any footnotes for the studies he refers to, the suggestions he offers are for the most part very valid according to other sources I've read discussing similar topics. <P>There are plenty of techniques here to try in order to improve personal and professional relationships in which you feel powerless in some way; most are not complicated, and they are very likely to work.<P>However...there is a vital issue lurking behind the idea of getting anyone to do "anything" that I must bring up: the information in this book can just as easily be used for destructive purposes as constructive ones. That is, if you learn the methods it suggests very well, you will become a master at conniving in order to fulfill your needs at other people's expense. There is zero discussion in this book of the need for ethics when using persuasion. In fact, the only value Dr. Lieberman seems to espouse is the complete egocentrism of "looking out for number one" at all times.<P>Further warning: in my opinion, the people who are most likely to devour this book are salespersons since it is very much in the tradition of the bible of sales, How To Win Friends and Influence People. Imagine how much more easily someone who studies Dr. Lieberman's ideas will be able to steamroll the unsuspecting into buying things they don't need or want!<P>I also worry what anti-social types could do with this knowledge. In particular, if a predator were to combine what is contained in the section on getting people to like you and the section on getting people to do what you want, they could greatly increase their chance of "success" at victimizing others without use of violence. In particular, this is a crucial issue in the matter of date rape. In this country, if violence is not used when a man induces a woman to have sex against her will, it is very difficult for her to establish legally that she was raped. Tragically, surrendering to callous manipulation and engaging in emotionally non-consensual sex (sex a woman does not truly want) can destroy her self-esteem and lead to depression. Often so deep, the woman becomes suicidal. <P>In short, a man who "persuades" a woman this way has achieved a sense of personal power by completely destroying the personal power of another human being.<P>Having said all that, I think that realizing how dangerous this information could be in the wrong hands is not a reason to run from this book. On the contrary, it gives a potential reader a strong motivation to buy it: it behooves all of us to not only understand how to use these formulas for healthy purposes, but to know how destructive people could apply them to hurt us and the people we love.</span>

                    <span>Since I just finished it, I can't say that this book has somehow made some dramatic impact in my own life. However, I will review it from a different perspective than a "practical" application manual in taking control of your life.<P>If you are a writer, or a struggling writer, a book like this can be an invaluable resource on day-to-day human psychology and interaction. You can see situations, interactions, and even conversations develop for your characters based on Lieberman's insights and examples. This book can potentially break writer's block, if you're stuck in a scene, you know what your characters want but don't know how to show it (a man coming off too strong to a woman, someone trying to break bad news to a loved one, someone wanting to manipulate a favor out of someone else, ect.), this book offers suggestions on how your characters should act, or more importantly, how they *shouldn't* act. Since Lieberman's observations based on real life, learning and internalizing the positive and negative consequences of the behaviors described in this book can add some realism to your short stories or novels.<P>As for the lessons themselves, I now see how in many times in my life I have done the wrong thing, and this book explains why I just made things worse, like in past relationships, in job interviews...mistakes we have all probably made. Beyond any practical applications, this is just a fascinating book for those who are interested in human interaction.</span>

                    <span>I originally got this book while looking for reverse psychology techniques, and most of the secrets in this book work on almost anyone. Includes ways to make a great first impression, get anyone to like you, get the upper hand in an arguement, catch someone in a lie, get anyone to do a favor for you plus lots more! Some of the techniques I would classify as reverse psychology. This book is an invaluable addition to my library!</span>

                    <span>David J. Lieberman has written one great book. After reading this book I look at the world entirely different. Almost every time I see a commercial I spot a technique used in this book. One of the things I like best about it is how it is set up. If you want to get someone to do something for you, you just flip to the appropriate chapter and you're set! In fact, I used one of the techniques on my mom to get her to buy me another one of his books!</span>
