                <span id="Label1">Today's web sites have moved far beyond "brochureware". They are larger and more complex, have great strategic value to their sponsors, and their users are busier and less forgiving. Designers, information architects, and web site managers are required to juggle vast amounts of information, frequent changes, new technologies, and sometimes even multiple objectives, making some web sites look like a fast-growing but poorly planned city-roads everywhere, but impossible to navigate.  <i>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</i>, 2nd Edition, shows you how to blend aesthetics and mechanics for distinctive, cohesive web sites that work. Most books on web development concentrate on either the graphics or the technical issues of a site. This book focuses on the framework that holds the two together.  By applying the principles outlined in this completely updated classic, you'll build web sites and intranets that are easier to navigate and appealing to your users, as well as scalable and simple to maintain.</span>

                    <span>Information architecture sounds impressive, but it's a new title for a subject I've been pushing with software developers since before there WAS a world wide web, or at least since before most people knew it existed.  It's a matter of usability, and appearance.  A website must be both good-looking, and easy-to-use.  And this book tells you exactly what that does (and doesn't) mean.
<br />
<br />If you design or write websites, please, for the sake of all your visitors, READ THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>This is a classic book to have on the importance of planning, and the art of researching towards easier implementation. It gives excellent review on the various tasks a large-scale project should work through. <br>This book is mostly targetted for IA wanna-be. Web developers and project managers will benefit only from 7-8 chapters. <p>I think the authors had focused too much on why IA is important, rather then how to implement it correctly. A large percentage of the ink was wasted on what is IA and how you should sell it. I would love to see another case study or two. <p>All in all, this is a nice book to have. The chapters I liked most was on the labels, grouping, controlled vocabularies and case studies.</span>

                    <span>I used this book to get started in the design of a coporate accounting portal in a fortune-500 company.  Prior to reading, I was too focused on what my page would look like and found that afterwards, my site was much better geared to the customer-base it was intended to serve.  This is an important read for web-page designers that still think of site development in terms of the number of web-pages.</span>

                    <span>I think the authors have fellen for too much of their own hype.<p>The first edition (which essentially forms the first half of the second edition) comes over as a book written by two shy and studious librarians, trying to apply their scholarly approach to the strange new world of the web.  They are careful and tentative in their suggestions, and reserved in their presentation.  The book is a bit at odds with most web design tomes, but interesting and thought-provoking, none the less.<p>The second edition reads like a desparate attempt to "puff up" a bunch of practices and approaches that they have been using over the last few years, but have forgotten why they chose to do them in the first place.  It's assertive, strident and often superficial.<p>I'm not surprised their consultancy operation went out of business.  The two shy librarians, seduced by the bright lights of the dot-com boom, have been left in the gutter with nothing but an expensive suit and a hangover.<p>The classic Greek Tragedy.  Pride comes before the fall.<p>I got dispirited, and had to take a break.  My solution was to re-read my copy of Krug's "Don't Make Me Think!", still my top recommendation of all the web design books I've read; concise, practical, enjoyable.  That cheered me up :)</span>
