                    <span>Travel books can be a mixed bag, with the narrators themselves sometimes making for unpleasant company on the armchair journey. That is not a problem with "Sahara Unveiled," where author William Langewiesche submerges himself well beneath the thread of the story.<P>Langewiesche, a reporter for "Atlantic Monthly" best known today for his "American Ground" series of pieces on the aftermath of the World Trade Center's destruction, writes in a lean, spare, slightly alkaline style reminiscent of Hemingway that seems to suit his subject, the world's biggest and perhaps most ferocious desert, quite well. It puts one in mind of William Least Heat Moon's travel writing, notably "Blue Highways," with its cultural detours and picaresque, ever-changing cast of characters.<P>Langewiesche starts off by quickly dispelling any myths his readers might have about the subject of the Sahara: "Do not regret the passing of the camel and the caravan. The Sahara has changed, but it remains a desert without compromise, the world in its extreme." He goes on to demonstrate this by trekking through the desert's endless mass and then west to the Atlantic primarily by taxi, bus, and riverboat.<P>It's not clear to me why Langewiesche was doing this (Least Heat Moon had similarly opaque motives), and the locals have questions, too. During one layover in the Algerian town of M'Zab, what he calls "the diving board for the deep Sahara," there is the following exchange as Langewiesche looks for ground transport farther south:<P>"He said: 'Why don't you fly?'<P>'Because I want to see the desert up close.'<P>'Buy a postcard.'<P>'But I want to feel the desert.'<P>'It feels bad.'<P>Indeed it does. Sometimes it can even be fatal. Death, human and otherwise, is of no importance to the Sahara, devourer of whole towns and caravans. "The Sahara is not cruel, but it is indifferent," he writes. And it produces a sometimes indifferent people, hard, lean, and fatalistic.<P>People who attack Langewiesche for a lack of political correctness in depicting the Arabs, Berbers, Tauregs, Moors, and others he describes in these pages pay a glowing tribute without knowing it. Langewiesche is one tough writer, unsentimental, not macho but not running for office, either. When he has cause to describe the generosity and kindness of people he meets, he does so. When he runs into less decent folk, he doesn't mince words. He doesn't waste them, either, on emotional outbursts or self-righteousness. As I said at the beginning, he's one author who doesn't get in the way of what he's talking about.<P>His take on the Europeans who come to the Sahara are sharp and cutting. He notes meeting a miserable French couple collecting scorpions and tales of injured superiority in Algeria, a former French colony: "She was a Parisian, and too young to remember the old Algerian war. But she had picked up the old colonial habit of talking about the Algerians as if they were not present or didn't understand French. Similarly, she wore a short skirt and a sleeveless shirt, and through the thin fabric displayed her nipples in disregard of local sentiment. And now she sat drinking French wine. These were not acts of indifference, but aggression. And Algerians understood the difference."<P>The best thing about "Sahara Unveiled" is it never sits still for long. Langewiesche can spend a few pages talking about the fate of a misguided missionary in the 1800s, then bring things back to the present day with an analysis of Taureg separatist violence. He analyzes the different types of dunes formed by Saharan sand, how the desert resembles an ocean, and how it does not. He relates folk tales and the anatomy of a camel. Using plainspoken and approachable prose, he manages to take deep stock of a variety of subjects, make his point, and move on.<P>The last leg of the journey is a quick one, perhaps because Langewiesche was taken ill (from drinking the water, a classic tourist mistake). He doesn't wrap it up as well as he should have, but the rest of the book is too good to begrudge him anything for that. Complaining the author left you wanting more is not much of a complaint, is it?<P>You will enjoy this account of nature at its extreme, and the people who live in it. It is an armchair journey worth taking.</span>

                    <span>"Sahara Unveiled" is extremely informative and entertaining when talking about the Western Sahara and the Sahel. When discussing the geography, weather, transportaion in hostile and impoverished enviroments, and deep thirst, Langewiesche's tale is nearly as well written as one of John MacPhee's essays.<P>But, and it is a big But, when talking about people, this is a very marginal story. Everyone Langewiesche met on his travels is portrayed as pathetic in one way or another. Examples? Judge Moulay Yazid is described in the most glowing terms of the whole book, and he is described as a fatalist time server, who idolizes an elderly, illiterate farmer who has only left the Sahara for two months in his entire life. Another? A German woman Langewiesche is introduced to is described as "trim, tanned, tennis-playing, cuckolding type" Cuckolding type? Pretty arrogant and sexist, in my view. Everyone else in the book is as bad or worse, in the author's eyes. As I read the book, I was struck by a sense of familiarity. Suddenly, it occured to me, that while this is written using politically correct language, this is basically a travel book in the vein of the Victorian travel writers, where the white author survives by courage and superior intelligence, facing down the natives.</span>

                    <span>I think the book is good (although not quite objective) from the educational point of view. A lot of down-to-earth experiences and descriptions are presented here.<BR>Things to keep in mind: the author mingles mostly with local 'elite' (if you can call it that). The author has mostly negative feelings towards anything Western (culture, people, etc), forgetting that the techology designed (and for the most part) built in the West is running majority of the countries he went through.<P>If you would like to have a context in which to read this book, consider:<BR>"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations", by David Landes and "The Clash of Civilizations", by Samuel Huntington.</span>

                    <span>I became interested in this book when I read an excerpt in The Atlantic--the macabre section on people (usually Europeans) who lost their way in the Sahara and died of thirst has stayed with me ever since. For example, there are names for the stages of thirst that are based on the liquid you're willing to drink, descending from urine to gasoline and antifreeze. Not all of the book is like that, of course, but that's the kind of detail that Langewiesche has at his disposal. He makes you see and feel the desert. You learn about the Sahara in all of its beauty and ugliness. Some passages remind me of Ondaaje's The English Patient, they paint such a forceful picture of the landscape.</span>

                    <span>I have to agree with the reviewer who comments that Langewiesche scores well on his description of the land but poorly with the people.<P>This was an enjoyable read and visit through the Sahara but all the while I kept thinking that he had a chip on his shoulder regarding the Tuareg/Tamashek people. He refers to the Tuareg as a culture inappropriately romanticized by the Europeans. And while he explores their struggle to retain their customs and independence, he spends little time examining the impact of the creation of boundaries across the lands which they traversed.<P>Beware as well that while the journey is depicted as making it all the way to Dakar, the focus of his writing is on time spent in Algeria.<P>Use this book as a good introduction to the desert. But look farther to learn more about the Kel Tamashek.</span>
