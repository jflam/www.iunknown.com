                    <span>One of the better Dover books I've picked up... but keep in mind it is a (very basic) introduction.
<br />
<br />The book gives an introduction to graph theory (take the "introduction to" part of the title very seriously).  To give an idea of the depth of this book, I read this book in about 6 hours prior to taking a course in graph theory (an undergraduate and graduate student mixed course), and the material in the book was covered in class in about 4 lectures (there were about 30 lectures in the course).  This isn't to say the book isn't good (because it is), but I just have to emphasize it is a basic introduction.
<br />
<br />What gives this book 5 stars is that it was written very well and made the material very interesting.  I would recommend this book to someone looking to understand the very basics of graph theory, but I would not to someone looking for a thorough introduction to graph theory.
<br />
<br />For reference, titles of chapters: 1) Pure Mathematics; 2) Graphs; 3) Planar Graphs; 4) Euler's Formula; 5) Platonic Graphs; 6) Coloring; 7) The Genus of a Graph; 8) Euler Walks and Hamilton Walks.</span>

                    <span>Chapter on planar graphs is superbly done, with very easy to understand proofs and plenty of illustrations. Overall, a great introductory text</span>

                    <span>This book make you want to know more about graph theory. The concepts are first intuitively explained and then formally stated. The numerous examples are completely treated and then easy to follow. R. Trudeau devoted a large  part of the book to the puzzling problems of planar graphs and coloring and  explains them in a very pleasant manner. As a result, these problems almost  appear as trivial (which of course is not the case).<p>The main criticism I  would make is the following. This book is a corrected and enlarged version  of another book. Unfortunately, the updating is not very convincing when  the "four color problem" is a conjecture in the body of the book  and a theorem in footnotes and afterwords.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Trudeau has done a fabulous job of introducing graph theory in a way which is understandable and intellectually provocative. He mentions that some of the problems are easy, and that some have been unsolved. In both  cases, they both are fully illustrative of the subject matter. If you want  to begin exploring graph theory, this book is for you!</span>
