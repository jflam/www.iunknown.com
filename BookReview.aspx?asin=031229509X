                    <span>Once in a while a book can change one's whole perspective, set things clear that have been obfuscated and clarify many contradictions. David Brazier's "The Feeling Buddha" certainly does that.  As a  long-time buddhist practitioner I had always been struck by some of the  contradictions in doctrine:  How is it possible to be compassionate without  grasping and avoiding?  Is buddhism stilted and emotionless?  We seem to be  biologically designed to have strong preferences and emotions, how to  handle these without increasing suffering?  This book explains it all in a  clear and practical way.  If you are interested in Buddhism and psychology,  you really must read this.</span>

                    <span>I was very excited when I located a course in Buddhist psychology at Shipensburg University.    Unfortunately it is not offered on the net, and would cost $1300 US if it was.  So I have contented myself, and temporarily  placated my monkey mind which I love and cultivate, by reading the  recommended material including The Feeling Buddha. <p>Brazier's  interpretation of Buddha's teaching is unconventional, challenging the idea  that one can "overcome" suffering, so it is interesting that this  interpretation fits with my own experience of Zen practice better than many  more traditional works.  There are similarities between existential thought  and therapy and Buddhist thought and therapy that are nicely illustrated by  this text, but if you don't give two hoots about existentialism or therapy  this is still a very stimulating and not too difficult read.  It will  strike a chord with many "meditators" who don't identify as  Buddhist or any "ist."<p>David Brazier is a psychotherapist, has  practised Zen Buddhism for 30 years, spent some time as a Zen monk, and has  studied original Buddhist scriptures for many years.  He endeared himself  to me early on in the book, by stating that much though we want to blame  someone for our problems "In Buddhism there is no God to call to  account.  Suffering simply is."  (Brazier goes to great lengths to use  alternative terms rather than simply "suffering," read the book  to find out why.)  Later on he agrees with other Buddhist teachers that  belief in rebirth is beside the point.  He states, as have others, that the  idea of the wheel of life with recurring death and rebirth is Hindu:  not  an original Buddhist idea.  He is interested in Buddhist teachings and Zen  practice as practical tools for making the most of this life, and so am  I.<p>Brazier points out that suffering really cannot be overcome: physical  and emotional pain is a recurring part of any life, and must be  experienced.  He suggests that taking the traditional approach, that  Buddhist practice overcomes suffering, may make us ashamed of our  suffering, thus adding to our problems instead of resolving them.  He  suggests paying attention to the terms "noble" and  "truth" as used by Buddha.  In his view Buddha was urging his  followers to live noble lives, to accept the wounding reality of suffering  with warrior like fortitude, not to overcome it.  In his view, the term  truth, as in noble truth, reinforced the inescapable reality of suffering  and our reactions to it. Given this view of suffering, the first truth is  enough to "revolutionise our lives, " the second, third, and  fourth noble truths are "elaborations."  <p>The second noble  truth, interpreted by Brazier, says there is no shame in the feelings that  arise in us as a result of suffering, it is natural to want to sate thirst  and hunger, end pain and so on.  The natural response to suffering is noble  ("respectable") and true ("real".)  As Brazier puts it  "The unrealistic attempt to extinguish affliction permanently, just  like the leper who extinguishes the itch by burning his arm, does great  damage.  The acceptance of the noble reality of our passion, however, can  be a great cleansing: a catharsis that helps us make something of our  life."  This ties in well with the more traditional idea of the second  truth as something like "understanding suffering".<p>Brazier  takes us back to the word Nirodha, used to express the third noble truth,  and it is worth the trip.  Nirodha is an earth bank confining and  protecting a fire, preventing it from being spread by the wind.  In its  most effective form, it is an oven wall.  It also alludes to a sacred fire.   Nirvana then means "safe from the wind," where the wind is  greed, hate and delusion, which respectively dissipate the fire by using  the fuel too fast, cause damage, and put the fire out.  To "have  spirit" Brazier says we must have fire, but use and direct it well,  "riding the dragon", not killing it as in western fairy stories.  <p>The fourth noble truth is a path to follow to protect the fire from the  wind.  The middle path involves doing what we can, and not giving up  because what we can do seems so small compared to all the things that are  beyond our control.  Brazier suggests facing our own despair as a place to  start.  <p>Despair has an important place for Brazier.  He says  "despair is Samudaya."   Samudaya is the second noble truth: that  which arises from suffering, the fire we must control.  He calls on members  of Dharma practice communities to "be willing in our Dharma  discussions to share these feelings and listen deeply to one another."   In his view, Dharma practice can continuously convert suffering to bliss.   Here is a strong tie to the more traditional interpretation of Buddhist  teaching, we may not overcome suffering, but converting it to bliss changes  everything.</span>

                    <span>I really have no idea whether David Brazier succeeded in one of his goals for this book. Namely, to reconstruct what the Buddha really meant when he gave his first sermon around 2500 years ago. Given all of the inherent  difficulties with such an undertaking, it seems to me that no one can ever  know for sure what the Buddha really said or meant. Brazier's arguments are  not always rigorous. For example, he indugles in a little hand-waving when  he writes, on page 98, 'This seems both improbable and out of kilter with  the general tone of the Buddha's teaching'. But the book stands on its own  with a profound, thoughtful, and deeply important message to the rest of  humanity: that the one thing we can do in this difficult and mysterious  life to give it real meaning and dignity, regardless (and because of) the  circumstances, is to live Nobly. The perosn who lives the Noble Life  accepts the inevitable difficulties in life, the passions that arise in  response to these difficulties, and finds a way to use those passions in  ways that are constructive, courageous, compassionate, and selfless. Such a  person does not chase after solace in toys, intoxication, sex, or other  such pleasures, but enjoys them for what they are while finding real  happiness and meaning in the Noble Life. The Noble Life is certainly no  easy goal-- not what many a weary and world-worn soul may wish to hear. But  Brazier's book rings of gentle and inspirational truth for me, and I rank  it as my most cherished book on the human condition. I have recommended it  to dozens of friends and family members, and I recommend it to you, too.  The book itself is a wonderful demonstration of how to live the Noble Life.  If you're looking for a nuts-and-bolts handbook for practice, look  elsewhere (such as 'Mindfulness in Plain English', by Venerable Henepola  Gunaratana; or 'Breath by Breath', by Larry Rosenberg; or 'Start Where You  Are', by Pema Chodron), but read this book too!</span>

                    <span>I have read the entire text of A Course in Miracles, several books on Buddhism, Christian, Eastern and Pagan mystic teachings. Nothing I have read has impacted my daily thoughts and behavior as this book has. For all  it's simplicity, it's (the book's) suggested path is not easy and somehow  that seems perfect. I highly recomend this book for people who have  experienced great pain in their lives and for those going through it. Even  those experiancing "little" sorrows will see the wisdom of these  reinterpreted teachings.</span>

                    <span>I'm just completely amazed about Buddhism. I'm wondering why I never took a Buddhism book before. I have the impulse since I was 16 (now I'm 25), but probably because I was afraid of change (like 99% of people) I just give up  the idea everytime it arised. Recently despair made me read and talk about  philosophy; finally, the first two (of the four) noble truths that Buddha  tougth exploded in my mind after reading it a in text, despair just  vanished. After reading The Art of Happiness (I recommend this book) I  started reading The Feeling Buddha. Well, this is really a piece of work of  book. Using Brazier's Buddhist methods you will discover things that never  tougth that were in your mind. My life become now an almost constant  meditation - like the same Dalai Lama itself suggest - you feel and  incredible joy to understand things as they happen. What made me write this  review is the suddenly discovery of a feeling I had for years and I never  ever analized before. I'll share this with you.  Everytime I have readed  any psicological text... in any book, just anything, I have an anoying  feeling inside of me. I was always completely apathic and spectic about  psicology. The funny thing is that when I choosed my career (software  engineering) I had Psicology in mind, because I really love it, even now  being software engineering I would like to be Psicologist...so.. I suppose  you got the deal here... :) Envy. I envy Psicologists!, because they are  Psicologists and I'm not....How I discovered this? Reading the Minnesota  Driver's manual, in a part that starts talking about conscience,  concentration, etc...  That's Buddhism about... enligthment anytime, any  moment, and any situation in your life. Analize any feeling, good or bad,  in the same moment of arising. It's a completely practice philosophy, it  will just change your life 180º. Still you doesn't believe this is  possible? Well... it's shame, you are a wonderful human being, and you are  probably loosing the chance to live a mindfull life.</span>
