                <span id="Label1">This edition continues to react to changes and expected changes in the information technology domain including Year 2000 (Y2K) compatibility, client/server computing, the Internet, intranets, and extranets.  Finally, there are exciting systems analysis and design challenges with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications (such as SAP), systems integration, and business process redesign. Today&#8217;s students want to &#8220;practice&#8221; the application of  concepts, not just study them. As with the previous editions of this book, the authors wrote it to:  1) Balance the coverage of concepts, tools, techniques, and their applications 2) Provide the most examples of system analysis and design deliverables available in any book 3) Balance the coverage of classical methods (such as structured analysis and information engineering) and emerging methods (e.g., object-oriented analysis and rapid application development).   Additionally, the textbook can serve the reader as a post-course, professional refer-ence for best current practices.   </span>

                    <span>This review is for the 6th edition. The 6th edition makes very good improvement from the 5th. Otherwise my review may be quite different. Overall, I feel this is quite a good book. (You may notice that I do not give many 4 stars for books). 
<br />
<br />I waited for quite a while before I start to write this review. It is quite difficult to give an overview to this quite complicate book since it covers many aspects of systems analysis and design, and some of the coverages are excellent and some are done in quite a hurry. Besides, I should tell you that I have not read many other text books in this subject lately so that I do not know how this book compares with others. I decide to review each chapter. I hope this will help the author to improve this book (if they do visit here. I do not know them at all) and help the readers to as a guide. I am teaching this book right now. In this way, I may develop this long review graduately. 
<br />
<br />This book is not written for experienced information technology professionals. Otherwise, they may not have the patient to read this book through. The authors write this book for "information systems and business majors at the sophomore, junior, senior or graduate level". The authors further recommended that the students take a computer- and information systems literacy course first. I do not agree with the recommendation of the authors for the best readership. Students with only computer and information systems literacy course may find this book difficult. This book is much better to teach senior students who have taken courses for various systems building blocks, such as database and programming. In other words, you better have a pretty good idea about various types of houses and the major building blocks before you study how to build them. The authors do cover the basic components for information systems. However, often such coverage is not well-written and it makes me guess that the authors are not as good on the building blocks level of information systems. 
<br />
<br />For business students, I feel this book may be too heavy for them. They most likely participate in the system development game as owners and users, and they should study a text from that perspective.
<br />
<br />The book provides chapter maps based on a framework presentated in this book. I found them very useful for students and for instructors, in particular since the book covers very diversified topics and the book has to study the same element from several different perspectives at several chapters. Different stakeholders look at different building block of different types of house from many different perspectives when different construction techniques are used at different building stages... Try to write a book about it. You get the picture? Several reviewers complain they do not understand this book. It is indeed a complicated game. This is also why the authors use 5 different colors frequently to indicates different perspectives in terms of methods, data/knowledge, process, communication/interface and people. Some reviewers consider the usage of colors in this book confusing. It is partly the fault of the authors. Though the color legend is explained in preface of the book and somewhere else, the authors should know many students do not read preface. 
<br />
<br />A continuous story (Analyst in Action Episodes) is provided for each chapter about a supposedly real world like business and its development team. Many students like this story since it gives them some hints on the outside world. However, again, instructors should remind them to read this story. Otherwise they may not read it at all. At the end, I will return to discuss the quality of this story.
<br />
<br />The book has 4 parts. Part One, The Context of Systems Development Projects, gives an overall picture about systems analysis and design. (to be continued)

                    <span>But the book really was only marginally useful. It was written as a textbook but I don't really think that it gave a good understanding of Systems Analysis and Design, except for small systems design.</span>

                    <span>I have read the earlier reviews of this book.  You see the wide disparity of reviews.  Numerous Best ever, and lots of really bad.  I am on the bad side, and if it could be awarded negative stars I would do so.  This book is a disorganized, piece of junk.  I have now read it twice and feel less informed than when I started.  It takes fairly easy concepts, hides them in buzzwords and wordy explanations in order to make the subject seem infinitely more complicated than it actually is.  If I did not have to complete this class with this book I would throw it out the window right now.<p>It is nearly impossible to sort the garbage from the meat in each chapter.  As a student text it is probably the worst I have seen.  My dissatisfaction with it is nearly limitless.  The first 10 chapters are a nearly incomprehensible and overly complicated, then the last 3 chapters then drop to computer 100 level information such as "much information is printed on paper"  or "a keyboard is a common way to input information".  <p>V/R<p>Bob Morgan</span>

                    <span>I was a senior corporate programmer-analyst for a decade. Only a very small percentage of the text books (or courses) I have ever read were successful as educational facilitators. That goes for grade school and high school teachers, college instructors and professors, and corporate instructors as well. Most of them were absolute dismal failures: F-Minus. If I could dig them all up, I would like to mail each and every one of them their own report card. I must also retract the previous 5-star rating on this Systems Analysis and Design Methods book and give the author Mr. Whitten, the book, and the instructional approach used the very lowest rating possible: F Minus. This book is a complete dismal failure. I didn't like Booch's Object Oriented book either, but this book is too unorganized somehow for the student to grasp the subject matter. I took an online algebra refresher the other day, and I was amazed at how well organized, clearly and simply presented the lessons were, and how much I retained. All my life, I never understood algebra, until I took that online course. I would mail an F-Mius to all of the algebra teachers I had, because I never understood the subject, and I wasn't able to help several people over the years. That may be partly my fault, but that is surely a failed teacher or two. There are a lot of lousy teachers in the schools who should be doing something else. The mark of a successful book (or teacher) is how much the student retains even many months later. A great book or teacher enables the student to further develop some of their own structured ideas. I do not recommend this book even one-percent. Why? It has all of the terminology with the same looking hierarchical chart all the way through, but I didn't understand one thing or retain much of anything from reading this book. It is a complete instructional failure. The organization is disjointed. The colored charts that are used extensively thoughout this book only add to the vague and confusing presentation. Save your money and try to find something else interesting that just has that A+ quality. As Phil McGraw would say, you either get it or you don't. Find another book.</span>

                    <span>(based on 4th edition, 692pp) <br>If you've never studied the fundamental concepts of SDLC, this book will teach you standards when using CASE tools/Project Management software, how to create your first Requirements Statement and how to facilitate between Users, Owners, Vendors, Steering Committees, Programmers, Network Admins, Interface Designers, DB Admins and misc Managers.   <p>Examples of Gane & Sarson (the book's standard), DeMarco/Yourdon and SSADM/IDEF0 shapes and diagramming methods are used for diagramming Data, Processes, Networks and Objects.  The redudancy of the text prevented me from madly flipping back and forth to try and keep everything in memory - THANK YOU!  It's like having a pre-hyperlink referal manual.  <p>While SAaDM 4th ed. also thoroughly delves into the core theory & logic of Database/Process/Network modeling, Object Modeling, Input/Output/Interface Prototyping and Project Management, it is not a replacement for experience.  Consider it a comprenhensive, illustrated encyclopedia or HOWTO that builds off of the project's Objectives/Constraints by cross referencing the technology behind Data, Process, Interface and Geography with human Owners, Users, Designers and Builders.  Each cell of that cross reference has requirements, methods, an outcome & a deliverable which compiles to a standardized, template-based Requirements Statement that you would be proud to submit to the boss.<p>The downfalls:  <br>A) It can't cover the remaining SDLC phases (part 3: Implementation & Support is covered in about 35 pages), but the title already tells us that.<br>B) Many of the methods use very similar terms and templates,  (e.g. the difference between a Data Flow Diagram & a Data Model, or the reason we have a Decomposition Diagram AND a Context Diagram).  With experience, every part of this book reveals neccessity, but a first-time reader would benefit from sidebars like "Why Decomp Diags differ from Context Diags" or "Common mistakes of translating an Entity Relationship Diagram into a Data Flow Diagram".<p>Finally, 140 pages of the book reveal essential Organizational Behavior habits that every System Architect should learn: Project & Process Management Techniques, Fact-finding, Feasibility & Cost Analysis, Joint Application Development and Interpersonal Skills.</span>
