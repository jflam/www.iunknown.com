                    <span>Just not enough content pretty much sums it up for me. Half the book was pictures, which were supposed to emphasize the techniques, but I found many to be unappealing. The overall material explaining the author's ideas of design criteria could have been presented in about ten pages.</span>

                    <span>The cover of this book could have employed design basics to get creative results, but the interior makes up for it. Its generous amount of fundmental information is nicely laid out in an uncomplicated and easy to use format. Mostly, I am disappointed with graphic design how-to books. They tend to be ambiguously narrated "portfolios" of high-profile designers with magnificant clients; as if just staring at their work is going to make you a better designer with a bigger budget. Though the majority of these samples are grand, Perterson actually analyses why the designs chosen are successful based on design fundamentals. The first half of the book is honest and humble -- like kindergarten; but in a really nice classroom. The topics discussed in depth are the basics of design like line, type, shape, texture, balance, contrast, unity, color, and value. The second half graduates to the working world and how those philosophies are applied to working models. A must for every designer. I have been doing this for twelve years and I still refer to the first half of this book all the time.</span>

                    <span>I was really impressed with the fact the author wrote the book with "design novices" in mind. The book was an easy read, but yet pushed the reader to think beyond the examples laid out in the book</span>
