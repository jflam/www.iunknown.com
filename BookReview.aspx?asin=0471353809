                <span id="Label1">Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are critical to all sorts of electronic security mechanisms. Though their machinations are often semiconcealed as part of operating systems, messaging environments, or database management systems, a working familiarity with the interior operations of PKIs can prove useful to all sorts of information technology experts. <I>PKI: A Wiley Tech Brief</I> explains PKIs at a level that's appropriate for experienced network administrators and security specialists who haven't looked into PKI technologies in a systematic way before. Tom Austin--an accomplished security consultant to begin with--has done his research, and he provides an accurate and readable assessment of the state of the art. <p>  For a treatment of computer security and public-key encryption, this book has surprisingly little mathematical content. Instead, it focuses on the business case for PKI, and explains how various applications use trusted certificates. Key (pun intended) details get ample attention, including trusted and accurate time-stamping mechanisms, alternate certificate authorities, and PKI auditing. The procedure for acquiring certificates and establishing a PKI is also covered. It's the five case studies, though, that will most impress readers who prefer example to tutorial. The case studies show how organizations (including Perot Systems and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) implemented their PKIs. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Public key infrastructures--why you might want one, and how to go about setting one up. Detailed explanations of what certificates and certificate authorities can do precede explanations of the efficiencies that PKI can create. Real-life PKI case studies conclude this specialized primer. </span>

                    <span>It is difficult to write a book for a technical as well as a business audience. Tom Austin has accomplished this task in his book PKI. Rather than simply present an in-depth technical discussion, Austin brings the technical arguements to a business audience and, for the technical audience, an overview of PKI technology and the business case for such an approach. <P>The book has five major sections. Security Basics places PKI within a larger information system security framework, introducing central concepts of cryptography and related functions. PKI Technologies examines the fundamentals of the PKI approach, including certificate authorities and hardware mechanisms. The PKI and Business Issues section cover a range of issues, such as acquiring PKI and enabling legacy applications. Then he presents Case Studies, where he shows how several large organizations (Bank of Bermuda, Perot Systems, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Reusch) made their business decisions in support of PKI and the implementation of PKI solutions. In his final chapter, PKI Efforts: Present and Future, the author discusses laws and standards as well as biometrics and PKI. <P>I plan to recommend this book to my consulting clients and those who wish to better understand the importance of PKI. If Tom Austin's book is an example of the Wiley Tech Brief series, I look forward to reading their other offerings. <P>Sanford Sherizen, Ph.D., CISSP</span>

                    <span>Part of my job at an Internet security company is educating prospective customers on the mysteries of Public Key Infrastructure. I know from speaking to hundreds of customers that this is a technology that is foreign to many. In this book, Tom Austin does an excellent job describing, with good examples, each of the fundamental areas of PKI. Along with the well-written text, the book is richly illustrated and will clearly help the reader acquire a firm grasp of PKI. I'd like to leave a copy of this book with each of my prospective customers.</span>

                    <span>I am a software developer looking for a quick introduction before I get deep into the guts of PKI systems. This book does provide such an introduction, but you have to be very patient to get it. Mr. Austin hops around from subject to subject, introducing new ideas in the middle of a completely unrelated section. He will begin a paragraph with "in summary" and then move promptly on to throwing out concepts that he neither defines nor uses.<P>Mr. Austin seems to be working very hard to keep the book relatively non-technical, so that anybody can understand it. Unfortunately, he seems to like tossing in technical concepts, explaning part of what they mean, and then moving on without using them. His examples are generally so non-technical that they are mostly worthless, while so poorly contrived that they still don't make any sense.<P>This book might be a valuable resource if someone spent time reorganizing it, editing the grammar, and cleaning up the examples. Until then, however, I recommend you find something else. I'm certainly going to.</span>

                    <span>Many times our rookies and our sales peoples have asked me to give them a brief intro to PKI. This book is exactly what they have asked for. Thorough enough to give a complete overview. Simple enough for non-techies to fathom. <P>This is not a book for those IT professionals who intend to dig deep into the very core of PKI principles and technology - But I don't think that was the target for the book either ;-)</span>

                    <span>I'm researching on PKI for my PhD in Information Systems. This means I have read the whole range of books on this subject. Without mentioning names, many of these books are either too generalist or too brief on key issues to make sense. That's why I'm sure Tom's book is simply the best out there on the subject. It is extremely hard to balance the needs of some techies who just want to copy and paste lines of code and business people who want to know nothing about the technical side. Tom has done this job magnificiently. My view is that if PKI is to be elevated from the pilot schemes that number about 70% of all adopters of the technology, we need books like Tom's that cover the subject without the usual fascination with keys. Therefore, if you want to get the big picture about PKI - with a tinge of technology and business - get this book quick!!</span>
