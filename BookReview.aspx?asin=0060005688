                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a semi-scholarly look at the effect of our increasing array of choices on our well-being.  Barry Schwartz carefully lays out the argument that the number of choices we have today (from flexibility in where to live to how many types of jeans there are to the dizzying array of crackers in the supermarket) detracts from our enjoyment of the decision we actually make, for many reasons.
<br />
<br />Many assertions made in the book are supported by well-regarded studies.  And we learn interesting concepts about types of decision-makers (maximizers versus satisficers -- those who must have the best versus those who know their criteria and stop their search when something meets those criteria), effects of making decisions (for example, the novelty of what we decide to do or get wears off, so the longer we took to make the choice, the more we're likely to regret it), and the effects of the number of choices presented to us on how, or even whether, we make a choice.  Everything is presented in a more or less easy-to-read style.
<br />
<br />After a while, however, it seemed that I was reading the same thesis presented over and over, but in a slightly different context.  I was glad that he cut the manuscript down from the original (as he stated in the acknowledgements), because to me it still seemed unnecessarily long.
<br />
<br />And then he makes kind of a blanket statement that our overabundance of choices is the root cause of our growing dissatisfaction with our lives.  While he admits that this is merely what he thinks, based on his review of studies on the subject, and while the thesis does make some sense, I think it's a little simplistic to lay the blame for all the malaise in our society at the feet of overchoice.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, it's an interesting concept that reinforces the old notion that you should want what you have rather than have what you want.</span>

                    <span>One of the most eye opening books I've read in years!
<br />
<br />I bought this while I was visiting my better 3/4 in Northern CA with the idea that I'd have something to read on the flight back. Before I knew it I was hooked and ended up reading the whole thing before I even left.
<br />
<br />It certainly made for some interesting discussions between us over our the different ways we Maximize and Satisfice and our reasons why.
<br />
<br />My view of the world will never look the same!</span>

                    <span>I don't necessarily agree with the author that less choice is better. We are always faced with choices and will make bad ones on regular basis. Actively limiting choices so that our life becomes easier and therefore more fulfilling - I disagree. I think to have more choices is great and presents a lot of opportunities. 
<br />
<br />What important, however, is to understand how we make our choices. And in that regard this book is great. It is full of examples of how we actually do that, be it jam in the supermarket or career. Most importantly, it's great fun to read about it. I found many instances when I acted in the same way as subjects in experemints described. We really get very confused trying to justify our choices.  
<br />
<br />No matter how educated or developed, we are humans, with all our emotions attached to us. Despite what many people think, emotions penetrate almost everything in our lives. Our careers, choices of food, investments we make, the way we talk and act and miriads of other things - are all dependent of our emotions. This book presents it very well. And it helps to understand our limitations. 
<br />
<br />So next time I am confronted with a serious choice, I will try and formally analyse pros and cons of each option, and make my decision based on that analysis... And then agonize over it anyway.
<br />
<br />Have fun, read this book.

                    <span>Jimmy Carter was lampooned for talking about the American "malaise," yet everyone acknowledges its existence. As the American gross domestic product has doubled over the last thirty years, the number of Americans who describe themselves as "very happy" has declined. The incidence of depression has grown to the point where 7.5% of Americans experience an episode of clinical depression before the age of fourteen, double the rate of a decade ago. The suicide rate among college students has tripled. We've had children shooting children in primary schools and in high schools like Columbine, divorce rates that make failed marriages more likely than successful ones, and sales of 50 million diet books per year accompanied by widespread anorexia and bulimia. In the midst of unparalleled plenty, Americans are remarkably unhappy.
<br />
<br />In THE PARADOX OF CHOICE, Barry Schwartz proposes overabundant choice as a partial explanation for these disturbing trends. In prose that varies from casual and familiar to moderately academic (but never to the point of being difficult), Schwartz dissects the richness of America's consumption-driven society from a psychologist's viewpoint. He contends that too much choice is as bad, or worse, than too few choices and sometimes the same as no choice at all. We face more choices than ever before: more brands of toothpaste or cereal, more options on our cars and computers, more telephone calling plans, more types of vacations, more TV channels, more of everything. 
<br />
<br />Having so many choices in every aspect of life paralyzes those whom Schjwartz calls maximizers, those who invariably seek the "best" option for every decision. They face untold hours comparing alternatives and can never be happy even after they make their decisions because of other or newer alternatives, their own choice failing to meet their expectations, comparison with others, and adaptation effects which naturally lessen their happiness over time. More fortunate are the "satisficers," those who are content with a good enough solution, yet even they can suffer the same psychic disappointments. 
<br />
<br />Each chapter of THE PARADOX OF CHOICE examines a different aspect of the "choice overload" problem. Schwartz introduces us to obscure terms like hedonic adaptation, hedonic zero point, and prospect theory, but his explanations are clear, backed up by helpful examples and references to underlying research and studies. For those of us without undergraduate degrees in Psychology, the author provides a gentle introduction to, and fascinating tour of, the psychologies of decision-making and (un)happiness in a consumer society. 
<br />
<br />While I found much of this book thought provoking, I have two significant criticisms. First, the writing at times feels repetitive and even over-explained, as if this was really an Atlantic Monthly or Psychology Today article forcibly stretched to book length. Second, even granting that the book is pop psychology, many of the author's closing recommendations are laughably simplistic, suggesting that people can simply turn off the same behaviors he has spent the previous 200 pages explaining as basic human nature. It's as if a book about alcoholism ended with cures to "just stop drinking" or "don't go near places where you can get a drink." Telling people to write down every night five things that happened that day for which they were grateful sounds like Dr. Phil coaching Mary Poppins out of her blues. 
<br />
<br />For readers who want to understand why having more and more seems to bring less and less satisfaction, this book will provide food for thought. As a sociocultural exploration of middle class malaise in the midst of abundance, THE PARADOX OF CHOICE is itself a good choice. As a guide for how to cope with the problem, better to look elsewhere for answers. After all, followers of Buddhism have known for over 2,500 years that material possessions are a major source of human suffering, and for many of the same reasons Schwartz presents in this book.
