                    <span>First, let me say that Ching's Chinese Religions should be viewed as a scholarly text.  It is not, nor intended to be, summer "beach reading."  That said, I must say that Ching did a very good job writing a book that would be a wonderful accompaniment to a college course on either Chinese religion, or Chinese philosophy.  She begins chronologically with the "Indigenous Traditions" of China and progresses through Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and finally the integration of Christian and Islamic influence in Chinese religion. <p>Ching discusses the uniqueness of the Chinese religion, in that it is a conglomeration of many different religious and philosophical influences, and she illustrates how these many influences have come to form a synchronistic relationship between many schools of thought. <p>If I could make two suggestions to Julia Ching, they would be to add a chapter on the rise of Falun Gong in China, and the subsequent oppression by the Communist Party. Secondly, add some excerpts from the religious texts she cites in her work.  I'm sure this would add clarity.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the worst books I have ever read, thankfully it is very short.  The author keeps making referrences to chapters and ideas that have not yet even been discussed, so basically you have to read the book twice before anything even begins to make sense.  The british spellings of several words (centre instead of center) gets rather annoying, unless you happen to be British.</span>

                    <span>Ching's book is one of the better books on Chinese religion.  Her writing is clear and she gives the reader all of the necessary information without burdening one in trivial details.  She covers the origins of Chinese  religion up to the present, even covering how Judaism, Islam, and  Christianity have fared in China. Ching's account of Taoist religion is  very insightful.  Amazingly, she covers China's entire religious history in  230 pages without simply skimming the surface of Chinese religion nor going  into detail in some areas while neglecting others.  Her book was an  insightful and enjoyable read.</span>
