                    <span>If you don't have any interest in higher thinking, and just want to read something else that deals with the Lord of the Rings or thought that the picture on the cover looked cool. I suggest going over to the Fiction section in Amazon, this book is not for you. 
<br />
<br />For intellecutally minded people. This book will help getting you to see many different levels in what you read. The first essay takes Nietzsche and introduces UberHobbits...I really appricated seeing more serious types of philosophy being interegrated into the thought provoking literature that has come about in this day and age. 
<br />
<br />I also suggest the other Popular Culture and Philosophy series, for serious minded people. Having a basic understanding of Philosophy is helpful before picking these up. They do not spell out what the philosophical theories they are applying they are expecting you to know it already. </span>

                    <span>This was an absolutly wonderful book.  As a fan of Tolkien and his universe, I was joyfully bemused to find that there was a "Lord of the Rings for smart people", and this book has lived up to its montif.</span>

                    <span>the most disappointing so far in the 'popular culture and philosophy' series, these essays have little to do with either LotR or Philosophy in the traditional sense, instead attempting to cover everything from environmentalism to narrative structure. As a general format, the authors state their intentions to mold Tolkien's world to their own pet ideas and quote profusely while saying little that convinces. One of the essays even admits that the Buddist parallels it's spent the last few pages proposing are clearly "superficial" - why waste the print, then? Another oddity here is a collection of quotes by various noted philosophers that have nothing to do with either the themes in LotR, or, in many cases, the topics the essays address. Extremely discouraging.</span>

                    <span>This book is definately a great book for people who have read the books and want a bit more.  I recommend this book ONLY to people who have read the books.  I got a friend of mine to start reading a bit of a certain chapter and she was completely bewildered.  If you know enough to understand what they're talking about then this book is wonderfully enlightening.  After reading the chapter about the elves, I felt a kinship with Galadriel that I had not felt before.  This book is a great read that gives The Lord of the Rings much more meaning.</span>

                    <span>Horrible book. This series only superficially mentions philosophy. It is a waste of money. For a better study of the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's Sanctifying Myth by Bradley Birzir is much better, though still not teriffic, as there is no great study on Tolkien in print yet.</span>
