                    <span>Wolfgang Petersen ("Das Boot") has delivered a first-rate thriller with "The Perfect Storm". George Clooney stars as Billy, a down-on-his-luck fisherman in search of one last big catch before the season ends. Mark Wahlberg stars as Bobby, the hard-working shipmate who dreams of making a better life for himself and his girlfriend. Billy (Clooney) decides to sail his ship, the Andrea Gail to the Flemish Cap, which is many miles from their home port of Glouster, Mass. Upon reaching the cap, Billy and his crew find the fishing plentiful, but they are forced to cut their trip short when the ice making machine which is used to keep the fish cold breaks. Reports of a developing storm are received and the Andrea Gail decides to head for home. The storm, which was spawned by a convergance of multiple weather fronts, shows its fury to the Andrea Gail. The ship is tossed about like a rag doll from the force of the waves. Ultimately, the Andrea Gail capsizes and sinks, leaving Bobby (Wahlberg) floating in the sea at the end. This movie is loaded with awesome special effects. The storm sequences are fantastic, and the rescue effort by the Coast Guard crew is excellent. If you enjoy suspense and action-packed movies, then "The Perfect Storm" is one you shouldn't miss.</span>

                    <span>I know that movies rarely live up to the status of the accompanying book, but this one wasn't even close. This film was pretty far from "perfect."<P>The Perfect Storm tells the tragic story of the crew of the fishing boat, the Andrea Gail. George Clooney plays the captain of this ragged crew that has not carried its load as of late. They set off and bring in the largest haul of their careers only to meet up with a fierce storm.<P>If you see this film to see the special effects, you will be sadly disappointed. If you see this movie for a good storyline, you will be even more disappointed. This film didn't have anything mesh together well. The plot didn't allow for any character development, except for the very beginning of the movie where we are briefly introduced to the families. This made it really hard to feel for the characters, which is where this film really goes wrong. It did not do justice to the real men who died in this tragedy. Even more troublesome, the intense action scenes, which probably was the main selling point for the film, were severely damaged due to the most inappropriate music that could have ever been chosen.<P>The one true bright spot was Mark Wahlberg. Not only did he truly look the part of his character, but he continued to impress me with his seemingly good acting ability. His timing was perfect, and his on-screen candor was excellent. Unfortunately, the script's dialogue was loaded with so many cliches, it took away from his stellar performance, as well as the other actor's. <P>This movie was quite a disappointment. Simply put, if you have ever read the book, please don't tarnish it with this film.</span>

                    <span>I really wanted to like this movie but it came off as a bland viewing experience. A lot of it had to do with poor casting...Clooney (IMO) is not a good actor so without a strong lead, the rest of the ensemble faltered. I don't remember much of a soundtrack-a good musical score would of greatly improved this film.<BR>As a New Englander, I find it quite tiresome to listen to ridiculous interpretations of the local dialects. Obviously most of the actors could not speak it, so the few who tried, looked even more stupid. I would of been happy if they had spoken in their natural accents (even if by fluke, someone was from the South, per se)-at least a viewer can justify it by interpreting the character as a transplant; a horrible rendition of a dialect is just that...horrible, and it is very distracting. The hollywood adaptation of New England locals always strikes me as an insult. It seems fair to state that these filmmakers from the west coast don't know enough about the people and culture of New England either.</span>

                    <span>It's hard to get psyched for a movie when you basically know the ending. How can you sustain any kind of tension or suspense? That's a key problem with most movies which are deemed "historical". What most great historical films have done is examine the aspects of the history and demonstrate how the forces came together to create that ending. Think of GLORY or THE LONGEST DAY. They don't even have to be war stories. Think of A NIGHT TO REMEMBER or SEABISCUIT, for that matter.<P>The problem with THE PERFECT STORM is that there is no suspense, essentially. We know the crew ignored or were deprived the information that things were going to get a little rough in the North Atlantic, and its boat got walloped. I don't know how Wolfgang Petersen or the script writers could have created the suspense, and it's not a reviewer's job to make recommendations. But as it is, I found myself increasing impatient during the first half of the film. Let's just get to the F/X and get it over with, I thought. <P>The performances, I have to say in all fairness, are good, considering what the actors had to work with. The F/X were great, of course. But I still left this film with an empty feeling. Pass on this one.</span>

                    <span>This film truely has some great special effects, good acting, heart, but the one thing that it lacks is that positive ending that even the saddest films have. The film was very depressing in every sense. George Clooney, Mark Whallberg, and the rest of the cast all did a great job. The cinematography was brilliant. All in all the film is something you need to follow up with a happier movie. If you are in the mood to be crushed stay away. I reccomend this film to people who love special effects films. Two sad thumbs up.</span>
