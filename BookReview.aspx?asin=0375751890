                    <span>Yeah, this book mught be useful if you have the vocabulary of a paper cup. I genuinely couldn't believe the words in this thing. Who is this for? Eleven-year olds? Seriously-AVOID.</span>

                    <span>The book has only about 250 - 300 words (250 are offered as key words which are illustrated and other related words are mentioned in a box underneath the illustration).  Words are arranged in 17 sections and each section is followed by several drills where you can test your understanding of the words.  At the end of the book are puzzles for more word fun.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best vocabulary builder I have come across; it is great for the SAT. The Illustrated Word Smart has the added bonus of containg some GRE vocabulary as well. Visual space and creativity made it easy for me to learn 250 words in two weeks. My only problem is that there are not more difficult illustrated vocabulary books after this one.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I recommend this book wholeheartedly.  Simply put, it's just the best way to memorize vocabulary words.  For example, I used this book the summer before eighth grade to prepare for a high school entrance examination, and I still remember the pictures and the words I memorized that summer (I'm a rising sophmore now).  It's incredible!!  This book is especially great for visual learners.  The humorous pictures with the captions provide great mnemonic devices that become engraved in your mind.  This book is an invaluable tool for anyone.  I would choose this book over the regular WordSmart or any other vocab books out there that are in dictionary format.  You won't regret buying this book.  I definitely didn't!!!</span>

                    <span>For me, trying to remember words without pictures is a waste of time.  When I was studying for SATs I memorized about 600 words. How many of those words do I still remember for the SAT I have to take this october?  About 20.  About the same time I got a similar book, Vocabular Cartoons which contained 300 words with illustrated cartoons.  How many of those words do I still remember? 300.  <p>This book is practically the same, except I also like how it has a little history of the words on the bottom of every page.  I like it the pictures are really big so they stand out in your mind.  But, and this is a pretty big but:  the pictures themselves are pretty bad. Almost every picture is of a person with a huge smile.  So it is hard to discern the words in your mind.</span>
