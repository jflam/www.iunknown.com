                    <span>Harking back to my long-lost youth, in my senior year in college this brainstorm hit me:  an idea for the Great American Novel.  I wrote furiously for months at the school library, filling up several legal pads.  My story concerned a heavyweight prize fighter who had defied the criminal Syndicate's order to "throw" a fight, then fled to a small rural town to take refuge in fear for his life. One morning I awoke, blinked twice, and it hit me:  With impressions pulled from my subconsious I was merely, inadvertently, re-writing Hemingway's The Killers. I had ruptured Commandment III of The Plot Development Ten Commandments:  Thou Shalt Not Plaigiarize.  Consequence? All legal pads into the fireplace, used for fuel, and resolve to start all over again, ALWAYS in a devout quest for clearly-established ORIGINALITY.  #####  A long non-fiction writing career ensued--55 business books, over 7,000,000 words in print--topped off by my first novel, just released late last year.  (This time I think I got the handle: TOTAL originality.)  #####  While this aspect of Damn Good Novel is not partiacularly emphasized, Frey rings the bell with just about everything else. The Pitfalls:  nothing could be of greater importance than to know these well.  Structure: a good novel must be founded, pursued, and executed along the lines of a resoundingly purposeful sturcture.  Thrust: single premise.  Check out the greatest novels of the past. They all propounded one basic theme, advocated a single message.  Characters: "If you can't create characters that are vivid in the reader's imagination, you can't write a damn good novel," says Frey.  Amen.  #####  In essence, simply, Frey's Damn Good Novel is a Damn Good read.            </span>

                    <span>For would-be writers who don't have much experience or knowledge of what makes good narrative fiction, this book covers the basics very well -- the importance of well-drawn characters, conflict, consistent point of view, and a unified premise -- as well as some of the necessary work habits for a novelist.
<br />
<br />What Frey doesn't give is much real craft advice: how to build character through dialogue and description, how to use language powerfully and originally, how to use metaphor and figurative language, how to show not tell, etc. Maybe this stuff is covered in the follow up book...?
<br />
<br />The book was also very male-oriented; all of the hypothetical protagonists Frey uses to illustrate techniques are male, and all of the books he cites as examples of "Damn good novels" are by male authors. Not a serious flaw, but a little off-putting for a female writer.
<br />
<br />This book definitely seems more geared toward people interested in mainstream and mystery fiction. For people who are interested in doing more literary writing -- along the lines of the damn good novels he cites as examples -- I'd recommend John Gardner's The Art of Fiction and On Becoming a Novelist instead.

                    <span>How To Write A Damn Good Novel by James Frey is a great book a true must have for any aspiring writer as well as more polished ones. Unlike most books that deal with formulas and templates that may have you writing like everyone else. Frey's approach in How To is simple but effective. He starts everything off with what should be the main focal point of every story. Great characters termed "Homo Fictus" in How To; Frey touches on everything from creating bios for your characters to ways of avoiding creating "stereotypical characters." From there Frey explains how important conflict is to the story one is writing. Frey also does a great job of explaining premise, climax and viewpoint. 
<br />
<br />However, what separates this book from the rest of how to writing books are the final two chapters Rewriting and The Zen of Novel Writing. Let's face it rewriting is what separates the pros from the amateurs. Frey lays down a good blueprint for rewriting and then finishes everything off with the most important thing that it takes to become a great writer. The true Philosopher's Stone of writing ...... Want to know the secret writing, writing and more writing there is your golden egg.  How To Write A Damn Good Novel by James Frey is one to add to your collection of writing or better yet starting one. </span>

                    <span>I've always been driven to write.  Despite the desire, I've written only bad high-school poetry, and worse mid-life prose. At 41, an awesome idea for a novel had hit me.  I decided I needed to try again.  Being now older and wiser, I decided to look for instructions and advice before starting, so I visited my local library.
<br />
<br />I checked out all 8 books about "writing novels".  My intent was to scan each one and see which one made the most sense to me. About 30 pages into the first one, the author began using terms which she had not yet defined.  Bad Form!  So, I put that one down.  I picked up "How to write a Damn Good Novel".  I was captivated.  My mind was completely blown.  I read through it completely, then got online and ordered my own copy.  I won't  bother reading those other books; this is the book for me!
<br />
<br />I'm into a lot of hobbies, and have read many "how to" books.  You will find no fluff in this book, nor anything missing -- only well thought out, practical, and followable advice.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.</span>

                    <span>James Frey clearly intends that the potential author-reader has a lot of fun by hugely encouraging the reader to write! He gives sound fundamentals for the creative writing process. An engagingly readable 'fundamentals-of-successfull-dramatic-writing' book, this Guide gives valuable practical analysis of the reasons why books succeed and why they fail. Frey supports his viewpoint with quotes and references to other masters of the subject of the art and craft of writing. At the same time he does hesitate to disagree with the experts, making his case convincingly.
<br />
<br />Some very valuable sections--the neccessity for creating characters with a biography, a history; how fictional characters are different from real life people, while being identifiable with real people; the basic single premise-based message that is the reason for the story; the driving premises of the individual characters; what elements drive a story forward making in an interesting/readable way; identification of the dreaded 'writer's block' in its various forms and solutions for these; the self-editing and re-writing that Frey includes as an essential part of the writing process itself. And of course, the committed hard work that goes into the writing process.
<br />
<br />In this book, in order to grasp the information in a usable way will require many re-readings, making connections and note-jotting. This will be true for published authors as well as for those starting out. (In that sense "How to Write.." is not quite a formula book and reads more like an interesting novel.) 
<br />
<br />A quick way to do this is, having got a point the author makes, to re-read the related section skipping the examples and going directly to the formulation-conclusion represented by those examples. These then become the reference points for understanding the framework of How to Write Damn Good Novel. This makes the reader work at really understanding the methods in a practical way. All said and done--Damn well done, James!</span>
