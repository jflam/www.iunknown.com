                <span id="Label1">There are more than 50 million small businesses located in small towns across the country and around the world. Many small towns don't have marketing or advertising agencies available to help a "Mom and Pop" business. And, in many cases, small business owners couldn't afford them even if they were available.   <P>"How To Market, Advertise And Promote Your Business Or Service In A Small Town," was written to fill that void. At long last, there is a road map available to help the small town business owner travel the road to success and avoid passing through failure.  <P>As Dr. Mike Reilly, Prof. Of Marketing, Montana State University says, "I can bluntly say, as a marketing professor for over 20 years, that this is the most practical and usable help for people to market small businesses in small towns that I've ever seen."  <P>It's the first marketing and advertising book written specifically for small town business owners everywhere. It contains a 10 point, step-by-step marketing plan designed to capitalize on the advantages and disadvantages of small towns.  <P>Also included are sections on: small town success principles, home based marketing and advertising success principles, small town advertising secrets and small town promotion tips.   <P>Confused about where and how to advertise? You won't be after studying the detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of; Radio, TV, Direct Mail, Newspapers, Yellow Pages, Magazines and the Internet.  <P>Want to know how to get some free publicity? You'll learn the four things you should do immediately to start generating news about your business.   <P>Open the book to any page, begin reading, and you'll get a mini-marketing and advertising seminar to help your small town business succeed.</span>

                    <span>Tom Egelhoff has written a practical guide to marketing for businesses in small towns where ever they may be. One does not need a university degree or buckets of money to implement his ideas which are bound to assist any small business person to grow his business. Tom is genuine and sincere about what he has written, much of which is cleary based on his own experiences. <P>As an Advertising Manager of a small town newspaper based in North Eastern Victoria, Australia, I find Tom's book to be very useful and relevant to small business marketing in my area and I plan to use it frequently to assist my clients with practical marketing advice which value adds to the Advertising advice that I give.<P>I recomend the book to all small business people, especially those working in smaller communities.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Egelhoff gets to the heart of how to market your business in a "small town" format. However, the information he gives is practical and useful for all scales of business. His book helps to develop the user's business model from defining who you are, identifying who you sell to and how to critique what you've done. Mr. Egelhoff gives practical and specific areas to consider and useful suggestion and areas to avoid. This book is well worth the reading for anyone seriously considering starting their own business.</span>

                    <span>When I needed to learn how to promote the Religion Dept. at the college I work at, this book came through with ideas and wisdom I could understand and implement! <P>This book is excellent for someone with absolutely NO marketing/promoting experience or educational background. The ideas are sound and, often, not expensive. The best thing is that it is adaptable to any type of group/organization/business.<P>The format is "friendy." Tom gets his points across in a way that YOU know YOU can do. He gives plenty of useful tips, and when this book is used in conjunction with the Internet, the information at your findertips will astound the reader!<P>This book is guaranteed to turn even the most unknowledgable person into a whiz at promoting "whatever" it is you need to promote, even Religion Departments!</span>
