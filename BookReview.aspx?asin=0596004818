                    <span>This is a solid desk reference for SQL syntax which provides invaluable material on the portability of each type of statement. The heart of the book is the four hundred pages of statement reference. Each statement is described with it's syntax and options. Then the support for each database (DB2, MySQL, Oracle, PostgresSQL, and SQL Server) is described in detail. There is a similar 120 page reference on SQL functions.
<br />
<br />This is classic O'Reilly. The text is well written, and the book is very dense and well organized. There is a little introductory material but the heart of the book is the statement and function reference. You will get the most out of this book if you already have a reasonable understanding of SQL. This is not a book for beginners.
<br />
<br />This would make an ideal desktop reference, particularly for someone working in a cross-platform environment that goes directly to the SQL.</span>

                    <span>[A review of the 2nd edition, 2004.]
<br />
<br />Perhaps the best virtue of this book is that it spans all the major variants of SQL - db2, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft's SQL Server. The authors are not beholden to any particular vendor. Thus the book describes the common ground. That is, the commands and usage that are most likely to be the same or similar across these implementations. Because a major use of this book might be in migrating. To this end, the more code you can have in this common area, the less painful the migration.
<br />
<br />Another possible usage is if you are a DBA in charge of running 2 [or more] of these implementations. Perhaps due to some legacy issues, you have to support them. If you cannot merge SQL code into one common version, you can get problems. Being able to use this book to find quickly common commands and options to those commands might greatly help you maximise a common body of code. </span>

                    <span>I have the 2nd Edition, which is 600+ pages.
<br />
<br />The amount of information included is incredible.  Each description of the individual statements has a "Programming Tips and Gotchas" which can be really helpful.  I appreciated the "Rules at a Glance" in each section which give just a quick overview of each statement - the details are described in the section for each database (DB2, Oracle, MySQL, etc).
<br />
<br />However, for me personally, the massive amount of quantity also leads to my frustration trying to look up a specific statement.  The font is small (or at least appears small) and the text looks crammed together - it's tough to see where one thing starts and another ends.  There is a margin indicator marking 400+ pages as the "Statement" section, which is just a big black streak down the edge of the book.  I think would have been more helpful had it been alphabetic margin indicator tabs (A, B, C and so on) - this would have made finding statements easier.
<br />
<br />So, there's my problem - a great book on content (I wouldn't want to see less), but tough (at least for me) to quickly find what I'm looking for - which is what you want in a desktop reference.
<br />
<br />Content = 5 stars
<br />Readability = 3 stars</span>

<br />
<br />fyi ... Amazon is including here reviews from both 1st and current 2nd edition.  1st Edition was a "slim" 224 pages (released December 1, 2000 per Amazon).  2nd Edition is 800 pages (released September 27, 2004 per Amazon).  From 224 to 800 pages ... hmmm, quite a change!
<br />
<br />Per OReilly.com, current 2nd edition covers commercial RDBMS (Oracle, DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server), and open source implementations (PostgreSQL, and MySQL).  fyi, 1st edition did not cover DB2.
<br />
<br />2nd Edition is updated to use the most current ANSI standard, SQL2003, as the baseline in comparing each of the RDBMS.
<br />
<br />Sample chapter available at OReilly.com.  Chapter 4, SQL Functions.  As PDF, 28 pages.</span>

                    <span>This is an awesome book. DBA's need it for reference purposes. Novices need it to learn what the heck they are doing. But it is especially useful for those of us who work in companies that can't make up their minds which database we are going with, and so we have to move back and forth between several. I have worked with Oracle, Informix, Sybase, MySQL, and Microsoft's SQL Server all in the past 4 years. This is an excellent book. Everyone should have at least 1 copy.</span>
