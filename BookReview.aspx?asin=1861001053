                <span id="Label1">If you have no Visual Basic experience but have a desire to learn about the language, you'll find Peter Wright's <I>Beginning Visual Basic 6</I> useful. Furthermore, you'll find it useful for more than a week--the author covers advanced problems as well as language fundamentals. He begins with some introductory information about the development environment's interface and moves on to key aspects of the language, such as graphical controls, variables, arrays, loops, and other control structures. The book then explores different kinds of resources, one at a time, before ending with a series of case studies.<p> Throughout, Wright's style is clear and informed. He often inserts a program's source code into his commentary and then proceeds to examine it in depth. This Talmudic approach proves quite enlightening. His examples aren't overly academic, either. For example, you'll find a database-aware program to manage a library's collection in the text. Indeed, database programming--the bread and butter of professional Visual Basic programmers--is covered very well.<p> Coverage of ActiveX control creation, one of Visual Basic 6's most important features, isn't as lavish as that of other topics, but real-life Visual Basic development still focuses on stand-alone applications, after all. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>This is an extremely well written book. Peter Wright has this way of writing that keeps you hooked on to the book. There is a sense of humor which helps. The book explains the topics in quite good detail with screen shots so that one won't get lost! The examples are bug-free and work fine. The chapter on objects and classes, though short gives quite a clear idea of object oriented programming and how VB handles it.<P>The only hitch I found was that Chapter 12 onwards, the book gets a little too fast and some things are explained very tersely. Moreover, there are quite a lot of grammatical errors in Chapter 13 that ruin the train of thought and are irritating! It's as though the editors didn't go through the last few chapters very well.<P>Overall, a very good book for anyone who wants to learn the basics of VB 6.</span>

                    <span>I rarely give 5 stars for anything, because anything can ALWAYS be improved on, but this book is close enough to perfect for me to warrant an exception. This book is perfectly suited for people new to programming, or to programmers who are new to VB. If you are already able to create projects in VB using objects, database support and ActiveX then you obviously need a more advanced book. It starts by familiarizing the reader with the VB environment and how programs are structured. Then he goes straight in to working with data and controls. He gives a Great intro into Obejct Oriented programming and what VB offers in the form of OO development. From there he smoothly guides the user through Database, Windows API, and ActiveX programming with a brief introduction to the principles behind COM. He even helps to guide the reader to additional resources after the book is completed. The examples are clearly explained and he even makes them fun. I would recommend this book to anyone who is beginning down the VB path as the FIRST book they should buy.</span>

                    <span>I read this book about 2 years ago to teach myself VB6. A friend of mine recently asked me to recommend a book for him to learn basic object-oriented programming on windows and this book is the only one I can think of. The book is very clearly written as is any programming book published by Wrox. Nowadays, VB.net is much more popular. I guess if you want to learn VB, buy a book on VB.net instead.</span>

                    <span>If you already have some experience in programming, I'd suggest you get a book that covers VB topics in a little more detail, rather than one that just tells you how to open a window,drop a control on the form and set properties in a space of five to ten pages - you get the idea, coz thats exactly what the book does all through. <BR>Agreed that this is supposed to be a book for beginners but hey, anyone who has even a little bit of programming experience and possesses the intelligence of even a high school kid, does not need to be told things that are so obvious.<BR>However for complete novices, who have no programming experience at all, this book may be of good use. All in all this is good buy for those who don't have any experience in programming at all.</span>

                    <span>This book states "Even if You have never programmed before you will be amazed at how easy it is and how much you can do." I disagree. I am a c++ programmer but never used VB before. I read the first 200 pages then the book start going too fast for me to handle. The book starts slow which is good but not enough examples and practices over the easy areas. Then it goes to other topics with pace dramatically increased... it loses me in no time. I bought this book hoping it can teach me VB, so far I haven't learn enough to create any working program yet... I need to know enough VB to hand in a class room assignment in 4 days.. I guess I have to learn VB online by myself... book isn't that great for beginners.</span>
