                    <span>This book has been very helpful in my struggle to break out of beginning sewing.  It helps the reader construct garments on a much more professional level.  And it helps you to alter existing patterns to create your own design ideas as well as make your own patterns from scratch.  I don't know if this would be really useful for someone who is very advanced in his or her sewing skills, but for someone like me it's a huge eye opener and a great introduction to pattern drafting.</span>

                    <span>being a fasion student in America I look for any resource that I can find pertaining to real Haute Couture, but this book was a real disappointment. It basically has everything that I've already learned expect for the roses thats a pretty good idea. But for home sewers its absolutely PERFECT! Home sewers will really get alot of experence from this book.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book about 6 months ago and read it from cover to cover.  I was fascinated, but I didn't want to write a review until I had actually tried some of the techniques.<p>Well, I've done the piped pockets, the bias cvered seams, and I'm working on the flounce collar (which happens to be fashionable again), and they look pretty good!!<p>But worth all the money, are the pages on manipulating patterns.  With commercial patterns costing well over $10 today, this book enables you to play with what is already in your collection.  Before this, I was a slave to the pattern companies, but now, I know how to make what I want.  I eliminated a waist seam on a jumper for my daughter, and created an unusual skirt by combining two patterns.<p>My confidence in my ability to construct a garment, and have it look professional, has increased mani-fold.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The gimmick of the first two-thirds of this book is that the author shows various designer ready-to-wear garments with an interesting construction method or detail, and then she shows you, step-by-step and in detail, how to reproduce it. Where there is a trick or shortcut that reduces the time to do something without lowering the quality she uses it, but on the other hand she includes many labor-intensive methods where the quality would be improved by such methods. She covers facings, hem, pockets, trims, fasteners, and more. The book is not so comprehensive in the number of things it covers that it could replace a reference-style book, but where it covers something, it does so in detail (an you need to read closely sometimes). The illustrations are excellent--way above average for a sewing book. The really interesting thing about this book is the last third on patternmaking basics. She covers the three basic ways to copy a garment (measuring, tracing, and rub-off), and tells you how to check your copied pattern pieces against each other, how to true them, etc. She then goes into pattern modification techniques. I managed to copy a Land's End buttondown shirt with a certain amount of success following her instructions.</span>
