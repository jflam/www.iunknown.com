                <span id="Label1">Richard Peck is a master of stories about people in transition, but perhaps never before has he told a tale of such dramatic change as this one, set during the first year of the Civil War. The whole country is changing in 1861-even the folks from a muddy little Illinois settlement on the banks of the Mississippi. Here, fifteen-year-old Tilly Pruitt frets over the fact that her brother is dreaming of being a soldier and that her sister is prone to supernatural visions. A boy named Curry could possibly become a distraction. <br><br>  Then a steamboat whistle splits the air. The Rob Roy from New Orleans docks at the landing, and off the boat step two remarkable figures: a vibrant, commanding young lady in a rustling hoop skirt and a darker, silent woman in a plain cloak, with a bandanna wrapped around her head. Who are these two fascinating strangers? And is the darker woman a slave, standing now on the free soil of Illinois? When Tilly's mother invites the women to board at her house, the whole world shifts for the Pruitts and for their visitors as well. <br><br> Within a page-turning tale of mystery, adventure, and the civilian Civil War experience, Richard Peck has spun a breathtaking portrait of the lifelong impact that one person can have on another. This is a novel of countless riches.</span>

                    <span>The book opens with a fifteen year old boy, his father and his two five year old brothers traveling to Grand Tower, Illinois. It's 1916 and the description of traveling by car is impressive; four flat tires in one day, cranking the Ford to get it started.<P>In Grand Tower, the boy meets his relatives, old Tilly, her husband Dr. Hutchings, Tilly's twin brother Noah, and his wife Delphine. The story then jumps back in time to 1861. Tilly and Noah live with their mother and young sister Cass in this small town off of the Mississippi River. One evening, a boat stops and drops off a girl with violet eyes and grand skirts and a quiet, dark-skinned girl. The two girls from New Orleans, named Delphine and Calinda, move in with the Pruitt family and immediately change their lives. Tilly learns of the torture of wearing corsets, how Calinda makes pralines, and just how bad tensions between the Yankees and the Secessioners have become in the South. Still, little is known about the two girls. Is Calinda a slave? A servant? Has she been freed? Are they escaping from something?<P>All questions are put on hold as Noah volunteers to fight for the Union Army. Then Tilly and Delphine become even closer as they travel to Cairo to find Noah and hopefully bring him home in one piece. They learn much about themselves and about each other, and that the bonds of friendship transcend the ideals of war.<P>Richard Peck has written an extraordinary portrait of life for a Northern and Southern girl during the American Civil War. I never guessed exactly what Delphine's story was and was surprised by the many twists in the story. I would highly recommend this book to teens interested in historical fiction, especially those interested in learning about war and racial tension in America. This is a tremendous little book.</span>

                    <span>Peck has followed Mildred Taylor's "The Land" with another expose' of the exploitation of women of color by gentrified white men of the South up to the Civil War. It was a norm and secret that deserves unmasking for American children.<P>But the book is so much more. Peck takes the reader on an road trip with a father and his sons by touring car in 1916 for a family reunion with elders. It is the elders' story told as teens experiencing Succession and the beginning of the Civil War in a region around the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. With this, Peck also brings in the cultural history of New Orleans. The artifacts and other markers for the time period are totally engrossing. Mystery and surprising revelations abound.<P>It's a fascinating read by a master writer.</span>

                    <span>The last steamboats from the South were making their final trip to the north and with them they brought many surprises. In the midst of the Civil War one family had to try to stay strong and attempt to overcome life's obstacles.<BR>In The River Between us the Pruitt's were a fatherless family struggling to grow up in 1861. Tilly was 15 years old and just trying to be a good sister and helpful daughter. Her mom was cold hearted and selfish. Her little sister, Cass, had visions of people dying. Noah, her brother, had his heart set on leaving and going to fight in the war. Then came Delphine Duval, a spoiled southern girl from New Orleans. Calinda also came with her and together they introduced Southern style to a small town of Northerners. Add all of these people together and you had one crazy family.<BR>The book started out in 1916 with a father and his two sons who traveled to visit their family. Then it went back to 1861 to tell the story of that family. Flash forward again to 1916 and the story is summed up. Basically, in the story Delphine and Calinda arrived on a steamboat to Illinois. They then lived with the Pruitt's and turned life upside down. Neighbors started to get suspicious, fights broke out, and war took its toll. What shocked me the most is what Tilly's mother said to her. Tilly's mom told her that she loved Noah more and that Tilly had to go get him back. Tilly and Delphine then traveled to Cairo and find Noah. They nursed him and a bunch of other people back to health. Then, Noah went out to fight, lost an arm, and then they all went home. <BR>This book really disappointed me. It was written in a really simple manner and left me confused. The writer does not explain a lot of things towards the end and it seems as if he was in a hurry to finish it. It was also unrealistic that two girls would go down to a war camp to rescue a boy. It was also depressing and everyone dies in the end. The mother kills herself, Calinda leaves and is never heard from again, Cass dies from depression, and Tilly, Delphine, and Noah all die of old age. Not to mention that Noah loses an arm and their father comes back dead in a coffin. However, this book did pull me in and I enjoyed reading it up to the end. All in all, I give this book 3/5 stars because it was an easy read, predictable, confusing, sad, but also captivating book.<BR>If you're looking for an easy summer read this book is for you. I think people who enjoy history would not like this book because some of the stuff in it would never happen in real life. I think that this book is more for a 10-12 year old because it was way too easy for me.</span>

                    <span>I thought this idea was really interesting. the mytery of the two young women who comne to stay during the war. It was really good. sometimes richard peck writes sort of a group of stories like in year down yonder. but in this book its more like a novel and I like that better personlally. And for those who like interesting Historical fiction read also Prairie Whispers . It's super.</span>

                    <span>The book is about a fifteen-year-old girl named Tilly Pruitt and her family: Mom, Cass, her younger sister who sees visions and can tell the future, and Noah, Tilly's twin. Their dad/husband has died a long time ago; life was complicated and stressful to the Pruitt family. Mom still misses her husband, Cass is having the worst visions ever from the past and future, Noah wants to join his part in the Civil War. Tilly is in the thick of it and doesn't know what to do, till one day a New Orleans lady and another lady (her slave?) comes off a steamboat: their names are Delphine Duval and Calinda. Tilly's Mom lets them inside, and this is how just one little thing changed the Pruitt family's life. <P>I like this book because of the following reasons. The book showed how just one little thing changed the entire family's life; every single one of them. This relates to the life right now: how kindness can be received back to something even greater, like happiness to the Pruitt family. Another is how mysterious this book was, although I do hate waiting most of the time, this time it was worth it. Like how in the book it says that Delphine was really a free woman..of color. As it says in the book, (Delphine) "French blood flow through me and Spanish blood and African blood. It is the African blood they despise. Is it not curious?" <P>Despise all things, however, there are some things that I wished the author of the book never added in, like pain, death, saddness. Noah lost an arm in the story, Tilly was betrayed of her mother after she commited suicide and told Tilly that she'd rather have Noah then her in the book as it says here, "Don't come back without him. I can spare you. I can't spare him." Cass saw death in her visions and in the future, it seemed so stressful for her that in a way it seemed scary. In the end, surprisingly, everything turned out fine, even if several things were lost.<P>My least favorite part of the book was when Tilly heard that she was betrayed. How would you like it if your own mother told you the same thing? It's like saying that she wished that you were never born at all and would rather have another sibling instead. Tilly must've felt sad to know this, depressed, yet in the end she went with Delphine to fetch Noah back from the camp. At least she was loyal; although at the same time she didn't have much choice.</span>
