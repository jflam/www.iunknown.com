                <span id="Label1"><P><BR> When Bill James published his original <I>Historical Baseball Abstract</I> in 1985, he produced an immediate classic, hailed by the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> as the "holy book of baseball." Now, baseball's beloved "Sultan of Stats" <I>(The Boston Globe)</I> is back with a fully revised and updated edition for the new millennium.  <P> Like the original, <I>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</I> is really several books in one. <B>The Game</B> provides a century's worth of American baseball history, told one decade at a time, with energetic facts and figures about How, Where, and by Whom the game was played. In <B>The Players,</B> you'll find listings of the top 100 players at each position in the major leagues, along with James's signature stats-based ratings method called "Win Shares," a way of quantifying individual performance and calculating the offensive and defensive contributions of catchers, pitchers, infielders, and outfielders. And there's more: the <B>Reference</B> section covers Win Shares for each season and each player, and even offers a Win Share team comparison. A must-have for baseball fans and historians alike, <I>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</I> is as essential, entertaining, and enlightening as the sport itself.</span>

                    <span>I almost fell out of my chair when I saw "The New Bill James Historical Abstract" in the bookstore. James is every baseball fan wrapped into one and has always been able to see the cold statistical side of baseball along the human side. He even talks about uniform styles and baseball players' looks, which my wife enjoys. This is the kind of book that it takes months to completly consume, the reader starts at the beginning, but then a short tale leads us to another area to compare, then off we go to another similar player who we remember,then to something else. For baseball lovers this book is a must, but for the casual fan this is also a teriffic book. I became obsessed with his 1985 "Historical Abstract" and his yearly publication when I was in my early twenties, I hope young people today find this book and share some of my experiences.</span>

                    <span>How can you not like this book?<P>Bill James is a stat-head. You already know that. And if this were simply a compilation of obscure stats -- many made up by James himself -- I'd probably skip it. I can get my stats elsewhere, thank you. I already own the Baseball Encylopedia and Total Baseball.<P>But Bill James is also a terrific, engaging writer. His studies, in every book he writes, are filled with humorous and insightful observations on individual players and the history of the game. It's true in this book, too. Just when you think you've read enough about, say, the Top 100 Shortstops in history, James sneaks in an essay about why catchers and shortstops have historically been such genial, well-liked people, and why the outfield is filled with such curs. The book is filled with essays like this, in unexpected places, so that turning the page you're never sure what new and funny stories or trends you'll find.<P>It ain't perfect. The Win Shares system is subjective. It is imperfect. And Bill James bears grudges. He despises Rogers Hornsby and has some pretty not-nice things to say about Joe Morgan, the broadcaster. So what? The ratings are merely a jumping-off point for character studies and anecdotes. And any book without prejudices -- at least any BASEBALL book -- is bound to be dull. Chill out and enjoy. It's a fun read.</span>

                    <span>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract introduces a novel new way to evaluate players: The Win Shares System. What is revolutionary about the system is that it does not use statistics that are subject to variation as the game changes. It is based on how many games a player helps his team win, based on his performance. Since the ratio of win shares to wins is always 3-1, the system treats good players on bad teams as equally as bad players on good teams. James has also created the first effective system to measure fielding prowess. But most of all, it allows us to fairly look at players across eras, in one single integer. The system is brilliant. James application of it, however, is not. First, it does not evenly rate pitchers vs hitters. Pitchers are arbitrarily assigned one fourth of all win shares, hitters one half, and fielders one fourth. The numbers are not necessarily an accurate reflection of relative importance. But the system does allow for fair assessment of hitters vs. hitters. In evaluating hitters, James creates a six-step system to include all relevant data. Simply adding up raw win shares and rating the players against each other does not work, according to James. As proof of this, he cites the fact that Rusty Staub has almost as many Win Shares as Joe Dimaggio. So to even it out, he weighs a players three best seasons, five best consecutive seasons, and win shares per 162 games. It is these three values that skew his system, but more on this later. His fifth element is a time line adjustment, and the sixth a subjective element. The time line adjustment is a good factor, since players get better over time, but it is weighed a bit too heavily. And the there is a better way to deal with the sixth factor. The problem with the 2,3, and 4 factors is that they overate a players prime, while vastly underrating his career stats. This leads to some skewed ratings of players. James himself admits to one: His system rates Mickey Mantle higher than Ty Cobb, mostly since Mantle's prime numbers were so good. Similarly, the system underrates Hank Aaron, while overrating Honus Wagner, and overrates Mark McGwire while undervaluing Eddie Murray. The reason these three variables were introduced was to compensate for a situation that rarely occurs: Players like Dimaggio missing significant time due to wartime service. A better system would look at total win shares while extrapolating what a player would have done in the years he missed, based on performance before and after the time missed. This would give us a rough total win shares, while not overcompensating for peak values. There is no inherent reason why peak values are more important than total values. Longevity is a key factor in rating a players total worth. The only exceptions are players who hang around late in their careers to pad their stats, like Pete Rose and Rickey Henderson. One may argue that guessing what a player would have done is unscientific. Surely it is. But it is far better than skewing an entire system to accommodate for a couple of players who missed time.</span>

                    <span>Bill James has been cooking statistics to support his own prejudices for twenty years. Think about it. A midwest nerd is tired of being on the losing end of the Mays v Mantle debate (James is a shameless Mantle man) and decides to prove Mantle was better. It's hard to prove a lie so he had to get imaginative. There was only one way Mantle was superior. Base on balls. Thus began the tyranny of the on base percentage myth. Real statistics like rbis had to be diminished since Mays was so superior in every category so he needed to invent new categories like "win shares", none of which any honest person can say they understand since they are simply ruses to distract people from reality. In his first version of this book he said Mantle was much greater than Mays. A concern for his place in history as a credible source has caused him to back off that nonsense a bit but his four main prejudices are still present in this new compendium of misinformation. 1. He's a devout midwesterner and seems dedicated to the notion that he must defend the greatness of fellow midwesterners like Walter Johnson and Mickey Mantle to the point of shredding the truth. 2. He's an insane American League chauvinist. In his latest irrational rantings on the subject he isn't satisfied to say the American League is a better league, it's also a morally superior league. Once again, a nerd grows up in the midwest watching his beloved American League be pummeled year after year in the all star game, it must have drove him mad. It doesn't justify dishonesty and shameless manipulation of statistics. 3. He's a racist. That he still can't bear to consider Negro League players in his position by position ratings shows that. His pannicy attack on Barry Bonds in the 2003 postscript to the book shows his great fear that the dead white hopes like Ruth and Williams might be obscured by a great black player. Not a convenietly dead one like Josh Gibson but a very alive one. He segregates his analysis of the Negro League players into a top 100 discussion but does not mention them in the position by position chapters. 4. He doesn't like the present day game. He'd rather live in the ivory tower of statistics than the acutal game that is played every day in parks around the country. He actually suggested that the only explanation for an uppity black man like Bonds threatening the place of the great white myths is that baseball is a dying game and easily dominated now. Ultimately he'd rather believe statitstics than what he sees on the playing field (except of course when statistics threaten his illusions). Which is what's wrong with all the stat mongers like James and Pete Palmer. They don't illuminate the game. They take us farther away from it into an arifical world of numbers and lies. I honestly believe that Bill James is the worst thing that happened to baseball in my life time.</span>

                    <span>I bought the original when it came out years ago, and read it, and read it, and read it until it's spine cracked and pages started falling out. This time I bought the hardcover edition (buy whatever edition you can get your hands on, and can afford) and have read it, and read it, and read it; but thanks to hardcover binding it is not falling apart. One of the most fun aspects of this version is seeing how James has used his Win Shares method of evaluating performance to rank players by position. (By the way, the book Win Shares is an absolute classic, and should be purchased with this book, if at all possible.) For example, if you were to look strictly at the numbers you may say that Ty Cobb or Tris Speaker (or even the Mick) was the greatest center fielder of them all; but armed with his Win Shares method he makes you seriously consider that it has to be Willie Mays. I certainly have no argument against James's evaluation, but with Win Shares there seems to be a more logical, statistical basis for that judgment than by comparing raw numbers (not that Willie Mays needs to apologize for anything; he did after all have some huge seasons while playing at Candlestick park. How would he have done, I wonder, playing the last half of his career in Atlanta?) If you are a baseball fan, young or old, buy this book and get a wonderful overview of baseball history.</span>
