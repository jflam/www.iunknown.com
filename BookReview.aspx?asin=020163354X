                    <span>I cannot fathom a guess as to how many times the books in this series have saved my in project work over the years.  The only drawback with this series is that some publisher should endeavor to keep them up to date.  Serious Unix system programmers must have copies of the complete series.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book shortly after finishing Volume 1.  With volume 1, I found myself staying up late to read more, but volume 2 gets tiring after a while... it's literally a detailed analysis of every single line of networking code in the BSD 4.3 kernel.  Although it's well worth the effort, I found myself reading no more than about 10 pages at a time (constantly flipping back, sometimes almost all the way to the beginning, to re-read something I hadn't quite absorbed the first time).<p>Difficulty aside, this book alone will honestly make you a TCP/IP guru - now that I've read volumes 1 and 2, the networking administrators where I work come to me with questions about issues they can't resolve.  I'm literally comfortable saying that there's nothing I don't know about TCP/IP, and that's not a statement I'd make lightly (feel free to test me).  But more than that, I learned a *lot* about writing good, solid code... in learning the networking stack as a whole, I was able to understand some higher-level software engineering concepts that had previously eluded me.<p>All in all, volume 1 is The Hobbit, and volume 2 is the Lord of the Rings - an oddysey not to be undertaken lightly, but from which you will emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.</span>

                    <span>An elaborate description of network implementation and working of transport layer protocols. Like all of Richard Steven's books, this one too has a large number of code examples to explain the usage of <br>the data structures and the API used for writing networking applications. The book offers a great index for backreferencing.<br>Covers all important layer 3 and 4 protocols and the various services offered by them. The code examples provide an excellent first step for starting network programmers and a useful reference for the experienced.</span>

                    <span>....<p>Please, I beg of you: learn how software actually should be expressed.  This book will help you do so; 15k lines-of-code is all it takes for a TCP/IP implementation.<p>This books is part of the programming cannon.  Buy it, read it, learn from it, shelve it, and refer to it.<p>Or waste your time on Windows.  Up to you.</span>
