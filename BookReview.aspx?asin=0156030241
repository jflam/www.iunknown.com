                <span id="Label1"><I>Like the Red Panda</I> is debut author Andrea Seigel's brutal answer to the throngs of Chick Lit novels that have inundated book clubs and influenced the big screen over the past decade. Stella Parrish, Seigel's tragic heroine, is 17, extremely wise beyond her years, completely alienated from her peers and her foster family, and determined to kill herself before she arrives at Princeton's gates in the fall. Seigel's task here is difficult--she's created a character of extraordinary depth, given her an unpleasant (at best) mission, and attempted to make her amusing and interesting, all at the same time.  In many ways, the author's success should be widely applauded, even if she falls short on occasion. <p>  <I>Like the Red Panda</I> enjoys its greatest success when Stella is commenting on the people around her. Her wry observations about her cranky old grandfather, her pot-smoking classmates in AP English, and her brilliant, unmotivated drug-dealing ex-boyfriend paint an equally amusing and insightful portrait of suburban life in America. When describing the temple-going practices of her jumpy and awkward foster parents, Stella explains that services are held on Sunday morning instead of Saturday, "mostly so everyone could be on the same worship schedule as their Christian friends. This benefited cross-religion plan-making on the weekends." When Seigel strays from witty observations like these, the novel has a tendency to lose its quirky appeal and simply becomes a tale of disenchanted youth. Thankfully, <I>Like the Red Panda</I> delivers more laughs than tears, and rewards readers with a unique blend of one-part teenage angst mixed with two-parts comedic wit. <I>--Gisele Toueg</I></span>

                    <span>Pay no attention to all the people whining about how "depressing" this book is. Here's what I liked best about LIKE THE RED PANDA: it never flinched. <P>The narrator Stella stares you in the face, doesn't get the joke when some boy calls her Diane Court, feels everything as intensely as every teenager, even detachment, and yet her emotions are particularly hers... The secondary characters are as heartbreakingly spot-on as Stella. <P>The voice, Stella's voice and the writer's, never feel forced for a moment and are compelling right up to the show-stopping finish. Anyway, I could keep rambling, but it's impossible for me to say too much without giving away key plot elements. Suffice to say this book is worth your time and you will not be disappointed or "depressed." (Well, not in a bad way.)</span>

                    <span>This book is supposed to evoke "Catcher in the Rye," but there are some noteworthy differences between the two protagonists. Holden Caulfield tries valiantly to connect with people, but usually only succeeds in alienating them. Also, there are cracks in his facade, cluing the reader in to his deteriorating mental state. <P>Stella, the main character, of "Panda" is his opposite number. The reader gets very limited access to her mental state, and as she seems to effortlessly move from task to task before ending her life, we are left in the dark as to why she is going to do this. Apart from her foster mom, she improves her relationships if anything as she manages to charm her teachers and principal into overlooking minor misbehavior, and makes - dare I say it - a friend. She is not locked into any one path, and has a chance to delay college. Though she quits an acting class, she must indeed be a first class actress if she can carry off "normalcy" so well. Many people who end their life are depressed, and it is impossible for a depressed person to feign interest in their surroundings so perfectly. (At least I think so.) <P>I also agree with reviewers that said that the drug dealer boyfriend and the outburst from the foster mom came completely out of left field. Stella never explains why she and the guy broke up - which might be an important clue right there. And the foster mom thing seemed added because the author was trying to shoehorn in some "drama."<P>The character of Ainsley was the most fascinating to me. I wanted to know more about her, as she was the least stereotypical of the cast. Stella, in comparision, did fit into that "angsty teen" mold, despite some uniqueness.</span>

                    <span>The book tries way too hard to be catcher in the rye from a girl's point of view. It's nothing more than a lame ripoff. I did not care for Stella at all. Sure she suffered a tragedy, but she had a couple who was willing to adopt her. Some kids aren't even that lucky. I don't buy the way her adoptive parents treated her. Especially the stupid explanation that from day one Stella had been glaring at them, judging them. Anyone who adoptd a child, especially one that had been through a tradgedy know that child is going to have some emtional problems. You'd think the adoptive parents would be sympathetic and try to get her pyschiatric help and show her love. The book was unrealistic, depressing, and b-o-r-i-n-g!</span>

I've never really been able to relate to a novel written by a female before but this was easy. I was laughing out loud and finding myself very anxious to read on til the very end. Fans of Palahniuk and Bret Easton Ellis would throughly enjot this novel.</span>
