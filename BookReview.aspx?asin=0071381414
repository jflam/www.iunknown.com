                    <span>As a curriculum director of summer sports camps for Basketball I highly recommend this book to all coaches. It challenges players to learn proper techniques, but more importantly it challenges players to think about their decision making, and to understand concepts of vision and space. (Difficult for many, so lets help make it easier). The book is ideal for working with youth players, the philosophy behind the book and the drills are fantastic.</span>

                    <span>Just out of curiosity, I would like to know the back ground on the person who reviewed this book named H.A.  It is obvious that he or she did not have a background in education or youth developement. Having worked with over thousands of students I can safely say that H.A. doesn't have a clue on what kids can really understand.  If it is over your head then you have no business trying to teach it to the kids.  Feel free to reply or email..</span>

                    <span>As a director of youth basketball camps I found Dr. Garland's book priceless.  There are few books written on space and movement like this one.  You can never have enough drills to reinforce movement on and off the ball.  The illustrations could help even the begginner level coach have a taste at success.<br>There are a great deal of inexperienced coaches and parents that could bennifit from this book.  I use it and it works.</span>

                    <span>Basketball books I have read by the dozen. None like this one though. Jim Garland's approach to teaching the game is totally unique. How many times have you seen kids at basketball practices standing in lines waiting for their turn? How many times have you seen teams with one or two players who move around on offense while the others stand watching? These drills involve kids constantly in the skills and concepts of the game without ever waiting in lines.  Garland's drills teach coaches how to get those players to move intelligently on the court, help teammates get the ball in good places, see open players, and how to play defense within a team concept. What's amazing is that the drills are so well thought out, they do the teaching for you. Most drills are a game within themselves but as players strive to "win" the drill, they are improving in their understanding of the very concept you were trying to get across. The descriptions are remarkably simple. The progressions are masterful. And the diagrams are extraordinarily user friendly.  Garland's Baffled Parent's Guide to Great Basketball Drills is a must for any youth coach! 5 stars!</span>

                    <span>I bought The Baffleds Parent's Guide To Coaching Youth Basketball and thought that the drill book might be interesting as well. Boy was I dissapointed. The drill book is nothing more than an attempt to extract more money from consumers like me. Readers beware--the coaching book is excellent ---the drill book is terrible.</span>
