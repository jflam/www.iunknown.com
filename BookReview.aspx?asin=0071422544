                <span id="Label1"><p><b>A proven tool for sharpening one's competitive edge</b></p>  <p>Today's leading organizations have seized on the concept of transparency as the key to gaining the confidence of investors, employees, and customers--and gaining profits. In <i>The Transparency Edge</i>, leadership expert Barbara Pagano demonstrates that transparency is more than an excellent policy--it is a powerful management skill that managers can learn and use to make themselves and their organizations more competitive.</p>  <p>Presenting the nine behaviors that every successful leader uses to gain a transparency edge, Pagano shows readers how to use these techniques to build loyalty, gain trust, and establish an impeccable reputation for integrity. She also shows how this nothingto- hide approach enables organizations and their leaders to:</p> <ul> <li>Make decisions more efficiently and execute them more effectively  <li>Speed up operations  <li>Identify problems sooner and solve them faster  <li>Build trust and collaboration within the organization  <li>Establish a higher level of credibility  </ul>  </span>

                    <span>Within the first few pages of The Transparency Edge, I had a much clearer understanding of how transparency applies to leadership. This book gave me specific behaviors to incorporate and practical concepts to consider in my day-to-day decision making. It's the only book I've found that applies transparency to leadership on an individual level. With rich data and compelling stories of real business leaders, this book is sure to make a difference for other business owners like me. Thanks!</span>

                    <span>In the wake of major corporate scandals over the past few years, "The Transparency Edge" is cutting-edge reading for every business executive.<P>If all companies took this book to heart, we could have avoided the financial fiascos at Enron, WorldCom, etal. The Paganos offer a nine-step system for creating credible leaders in the workplace. But like any system, it's only as good as the aplication.<P>The authors provide not only solid theory, but also a practical way to live out the core principles of an organization. Well-researched, with lots of specific examples, this book features a unique 360-degree leadership assessment tied to the nine behaviors all business executives should strive to emulate for their co-workers.<P>As one who licenses a comprehensive mentor program to Fortune 500 companies and other organizations that features 12 monthly seminars, I'm reminded that the first lesson is on values. I'm adding this book to the recommended reading list for Lesson I. If an organization isn't reputable and their people can't be trusted, nothing else matters. Thank you, Barbara and Elizabeth, for driving home this critical message in such a meaningful and memorable manner.</span>

                    <span>As someone who has inhabited a pretty competitive corner of corporate America for over 20 years, I can honestly say this book was like a lifeline. <P>With the huge generation of baby boomers all entering the business scene at the same time, I think a lot of us have felt tremendous pressure to conform to what seemed some pretty harsh norms. Being professional and getting ahead was all about being efficient - not taking the time to explain what was going on; being strong, which means never appearing vulnerable; being tough - which means focusing solely on the more easily quantified sales and profit implications of a decision, and shutting out the human factors. <P>I work in the communications/consulting business and, at every company I've worked for, senior management would get up every year at the annual meeting and say something like - "What sets us apart and gives us our competitive advantage is how we care about our people," and "The most valuable asset in this company goes home every evening." And everyone would just look at each other and roll their eyes, because nobody believed them! <P>If they cared so much, why didn't they tell us candidly the reasons behind some of their apparently uninformed and careless decisions? Even bad news would be better than all the confusion and speculation in the ranks when no-one knew what was going on. Why did they do all this management training, yet still knowingly tolerate bosses who brutalized their subordinates? Why did they ask for our suggestions - and even ask us to put extra time in volunteering for various corporate task forces - only to break their implied promise of change by ignoring everything we came up, and proceeding with business as usual? <P>As I moved up into management myself, I understood better what some of the pressures are that push the people in charge into some of these behaviors, and there were times when I found it hard to reconcile my own choices. I saw it as having to make a trade-off between what I thought was the right thing to do (i.e., my responsibility to my personal values), and doing the right thing for the company (i.e, my responsibility as a professional). <P>What The Transparency Edge does is show beyond a doubt that standing true to your values makes good business sense. Yes, it's harder to do sometimes, and yes, sometimes the benefits are long-term rather than immediate. But leaders have a responsibility to the long-term welfare of the company, which includes maintaining their own and their company's reputation, as well as creating the motivation for people to follow their leadership. Both of those goals are impossible to achieve without personal credibility. And personal credibility is built through conscientiously respecting the nine principles in this book. <BR> <BR>Pagano demonstrates that, without question, the reason to behave transparently is not only because it's right, but because it's smart. What a breath of fresh air - it's about time!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoy the stories in The Transparency Edge. It is a great reminder that we can choose to be better leaders in everything we do, everyday. Leadership concepts are hard to grasp generally. And illustrating these with personal experiences make these issues come alive for readers. The Paganos' conversational style also makes reading easy. I recommend this to those who are starting/doing 360 feedback. Such a feedback process can be rather disconcerting, as my first-time coachees have confirmed, and it is helpful to have a resource like Transparency Edge to act as a guide for reflection and new actions.</span>
