                    <span>This book requires the reader/entrepreneur to invest more than just time to extract true value from the book. It requires the reader to analyze, understand and then apply Mr. William's seemingly random stream of thoughts and ideas to his or her own venture. Perhaps the best description of the book is that it is an anecodotal collection of marketing concepts and essays that loosely portray the author's own creative philosophies and illuminate his thoughts about success, business and competition. Though it lacks the revelatory tenor of a Vonnegut novel it's use of extremely short "Chapters" is reminiscent of that sort of work but in a wholly non-fictional way (if that is possible).<P>On the upside, the short narratives allow the reader to take in small concepts at a time and then use those concepts to let the thought process wash over him. Used in that fashion, the book can be a fountainhead of inspiration. <P>On the downside, not everyone who reads the book can muster that type of creative energy and ability and then the book is nothing more than a collection of short stories and essays.</span>

                    <span>"Magical Worlds of the Wizard of Ads" is truely a fantastic book. The Wizard describes in plain English how the brain responds to input. And how to bypass the security guard at the entrance to the brain.<P>The book is a nice compilation of interesting and mind-baffling texts. Ir really got me thinking about my own persuading skills. And more importantly how I live my life.<P>As a little bonus the book is wonderfully crafted. With coffee stains and hand written notes and everything. Definately a must.</span>

                    <span>What is branding? How do people really remember you? How do you build your brand? This book gets back to the basics. There really is a magical formula. For you. For your company.<P>I bought this book because it was different. It disagreed with everything I had previously learned. This book can change the way you think. Forever. My mind turns in a completely new direction. Seeing things from a complete new angle. How can anybody pass up such an opportunity?</span>

                    <span>As a graduate of the "Wizard Academy", I can vouch for Roy Williams: he is a masterful, charismatic speaker. The dark side, though, is that Roy respects scholarship only slightly more than he respects his followers. Roy talks about brain chemistry, but has no training in medicine or psychology. He talks about quantum physics, but never graduated college. His method of self-teaching is the purchasing of many volumes that he skims in search of support (however tenuous) for conclusions he's already arrived at.<P>Roy is charismatic, yes, but then so are most con artists. What he preaches is pure bunk, overlaid with a good deal of pseudo-sophistication and "mysticism"! Oooh! On the other hand, if this is your cup of tea, Roy pours it better than most.</span>
