Rather than rattling off a list of features, diagrams and acronyms, this book provides step-by-step examples of the most important techniques developers typically go through to create database applications.  Learn how to design a database, build the user interface, write queries,  and construct a three-tiered client server system based on ADO 2.0, RDO, COM, SQL Server or  Oracle. Find out "what's new?" in Visual Basic 6 as it applies to data access strategies.  Receive more information on different types of SQL queries and differences between the Access and SQL Server dialects.</HTML></span>

                    <span>Jeff McMannus, Database Access with VB 6. As its name says,this new book from Jeff McManus is completely focused on databaseaccess with good solid, concise, examples from getting started with MS Access to SQL Server stored procedures. You can immediately find samples of the new features like the Data Environment and Jeff even gives you the basic concepts to get started with MS SQL Server. What you get a wide range of subjects that is comprehensive. This technique doesn't present the depth you get in build a whole application style books, But I'm usually looking for that one clear example. While technical books are typically 'dry', Jeff succeeds in spicing his up with easy going humor.. As in a Q and A chapter summary use your new found powers for good.. not evil.. This is a good book for clear examples of a wide variety of database related tools. Pat Tormey PE, Editor,<I> World Wide Developer's Network<I></span>

                    <span>I absolutely love this book! The book is so clear and easily readable, I found myself breezing through the examples. I loved the coverage of SQL Server and SQL itself. McManus doesn't assume that the reader has any other tool but VB6, and explained the many database features of the language that I had never used before. I did not even know that VB6 provided a SQL query designer.<P>McManus also delved into Active Server Pages and other topics that were very interesting, but reserved such subjects for the end of the book.<P>I loved the writing style and the tutorials. I found not a single error in the step-by-step instructions for setting up SQL Server or the connections in VB. This book is full of useful information, and is my sole reference on database programming in VB.<P>Summary: Novice Visual Basic database developers will love this book!</span>

                    <span>I worry that there may be multiple editions of this book; mine was published in 1999. ADO, the key database technology of VB6, isn't treated until Chapter 10, followed by a quick jump to IIS in Chapter 11. Had problems getting some of the examples to run; the website offered hasn't been up for quite a while. This isn't a bad VB6 database book, and in fact I'd recommend it for students developing their background in the historical development of Microsoft's Universal Database Access technology -- its presentation of the older technologies is great. This text won't, however, solve any problems you'll encounter trying to develop VB6 database applications.</span>

                    <span>Jeffrey writes extremely well and the previous edition of this book was the definitive book on the subject. This wasn't quite as good and lacks a degree of detail that a professional developer could need if messing about with data access but don't let me sound as if I'm putting you off...its a must have on your book shelf compared to some of the junk written on this subject.<P>He's also unique amongst authors in that he actually replies to E-mails you send him...</span>

                    <span>Even though this book is a little old, and still shows some already unused techniques and resources, as DAO, it brings a good starting for basical VB-60, and good ideas over database accessing, either local or remote. If you are thinking about starting, this book is fine. But, be sure, you will need other titles, when you intend to go deeper in the subject, or you need newer techniques, as ADO.</span>
