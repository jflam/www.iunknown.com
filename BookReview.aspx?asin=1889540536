                    <span>This book, based on the author's column for Motorcycle Consumer News, makes for good interesting reading. Though not a motorcyclist, reading this title has made me a safer and smarter driver. I'm more aware of motorcyclists and know how to share the road with them. More importantly, I know how to prepare for and avoid dangerous driving situations. The chapters repeat critical information, so you can read them in any order and not miss a key point. At the same time, the author keeps it fresh by telling the same story differently, according to the focus of the chapter. A very good read for anyone who uses the road. </span>

                    <span>Great glossy cover for a useless 60's-era manual.  If aren't sure that rain jackets will keep you drier or that gravel may cause a wreck, then this is the book for you.  Nothing about motorcycles, just the road conditions that one may encounter.  Totally useless.</span>

                    <span>Until recently, I've never had the desire to ride a motorcycle, mainly because I was afraid of becoming an organ donor. However, that suddenly changed a couple of months back, probably due to turning 37 and sitting through a marathon viewing session of "American Chopper" episodes.  So, I began to shop around for a bike that would fit me, and at the same time I tapped into all the informational sources I could find about motorcycling (friends, the Web, etc.).  "Proficient Motorcycling" was one of the first books I read, and I bought it based on the good reviews I saw on Amazon.com. <p>It was my desire to arm myself with as much knowledge and hands-on riding skills as possible before swinging a leg over the motorcycle I finally settled upon (a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy).  I signed up at a local Harley-Davidson dealer for a "Rider's Edge" class, and "Proficient Motorcycling" was an excellent supplement to the MSF course materials.  Indeed, Mr. Hough recommends taking an MSF course, and frankly I can't imagine a novice trying to ride without formal instruction.  <p>The techniques that Mr. Hough advocates in "Proficient Motorcycling" have made me a better AND safer rider.  I feel more confident riding my new H-D, and therefore I'm able to enjoy my road-time that much more.  I've already started reading the book's sequel "More Proficient Motorcycling: Mastering the Ride" to build upon what I've learned so far.  If you want to be a good motorcyclist (and not a "donor-cyclist"), then by all means dive into "Proficient Motorcycling."</span>
