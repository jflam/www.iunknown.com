                <span id="Label1"><P> Cliff Stoll was an astronomer turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley Lab when a 75-cent accounting error alerted him to the presence of an unauthorized user on his system. The hacker's code name was "Hunter" -- a mystery invader hiding inside a twisting electronic labyrinth, breaking into U.S. computer systems and stealing sensitive military and security information. Stoll began a one-man hunt of his own, spying on the spy -- and plunged into an incredible international probe that finally gained the attention of top U.S. counterintelligence agents. <I>The Cuckoo's Egg</I> is his wild and suspenseful true story -- a year of deception, broken codes, satellites, missile bases, and the ultimate sting operation -- and how one ingenious American trapped a spy ring paid in cash and cocaine, and reporting to the KGB.</span>

                    <span>This was the second computer security book I read and it was like adding flame to a fire because it increased my curiosity and prompted me to want to know more about it, so I ended up reading Cyberpunk by Katie Hafner and John Markoff to get a more inside look. If you start reading it then you'll probably finish it the same day. It talks a scientist that stumbles on a mistake in the accounting part of his job as a scientist at Lawrence Berkely Lab and he makes the mistake into a chase through cyberspace. In the book the author takes on the role as a modern day Sherlock Holmes and in the end he realizes that it was only elementary.<P>Dealing with the CCC (Chaos Computer Club), Hunter (the main hacker), and the different networks will really make you think and keep you on your toes. Read it and see for yourself just how intense the experience will be. I advise you to get some sleep before you start because you probably won't be getting any anytime soon.</span>

                    <span>"The Cuckoo's Egg" is one of my tests for evaluating someone's security awareness. If they think this is a trivial book, I know that they have a narrow concept of information security.<P>There are two good reasons to read this book. First, it is entertaining and engaging, recounted autobiographically by a gifted storyteller. Second, it is a classic case history of detection, intrusion response, traceback, and prosecution. This book is one of the first documented reports-and a highly-detailed one-of hackers who use the Internet to jump from computer to computer. Although the events took place in the mid-1980s, almost 10 years before consumer use of the Internet, the Internet's predecessor, ARPANet, existed, and was already a hacker's playground (at the time, I was managing a user support office that provided support to the users of one of the Pentagon DEC machines that was compromised). Surprisingly little has changed since then, and hackers still use telnet to guess weak passwords, hack into systems, exploit weaknesses to gain root, and then rummage through e-mail looking for clues that can help them crack other systems.<P>One of the most important lessons of this book is that discrepancies usually have a cause. It was through the investigation of a trivial system accounting error that Stoll first became aware that a member of his digital flock was harboring a wolf. Although not a computer expert by training, PHd astronomers (people who make their living by counting stars) are undoubtedly highly patient, stubborn and methodical-personality traits that were crucial to the author's success in the long weary months it took to finally track down the attack to its source. On the way, Stoll created what is possibly the first publicly documented use of a 'honey pot' to lure his attacker back to his site so that he could both record his activities and allow the network authorities to trace him back to his European origin.<P>Although a variety of James Bond-like high tech attacks have been developed over the years since this volume was first published, the fact is that passwords are still the most commonly used form of information system authentication, and they are no stronger today than they were 15 years ago. This book provides a great understanding of how attackers take advantage of weak passwords and unused accounts. All system administrators and security professionals need a total grasp of these concepts in order to understand how the systems they are responsible for are at risk of very simple attack. <P>Today, interest in Intrusion Detection Systems continues to grow. Many of the attacks are much more sophisticated than those that are documented by Stoll. But the basic paradigm of cops and robbers, an endless cycle of spy vs. spy, continues today, just as it did in the mid-80s, before 'THE Internet' was recognized as such. I certainly do not want to discourage general readers-my relatively non-technical wife recently picked up my copy and finished it inside of a couple of days-but I do urge all burgeoning security experts to get a copy of this book early in their career, read it, and understand the many lessons that it contains. <P>In spite of being written by an academic, this is a fun book, with a breezy casual style. It is in no way a dry and dull scholarly tome. And that is a positive to me, because most people are more motivated to complete a text when they don't actually dread picking it up. No matter how accurate the information in a text book, if the reader falls asleep or tunes out, they won't acquire the knowledge within it. Because "Egg" is such an easy book to read, it is an ideal introduction to security ideas including: attack process and hacking, intrusion detection, computer forensics, infowar, hacker motivation, electronic surveillance and traceback, auditing, social engineering, password usage, cross-border issues, prosecution of cybercrime, and the relationship with law enforcement. It is such a gentle introduction to these concepts that you don't even realize that you are gaining a significant education.<P>In spite of this being over 10 years old (my copy has already started turning yellow), it is still a highly-relevant book today. If you are interested in a career in Information Security, but do not appreciate what this book has to teach on the subject, I strongly recommend that you reevaluate your choice of profession. You might not like Stoll's flip style, but if you cannot see that this non-specialist wrote 'the book' on intrusion response, then you need to seriously consider that you might also be missing some important Infosec concepts and understandings.</span>

                    <span>This tells of Cliff Stoll's involvement in reconciling a 75 cent bookkeeping discrepancy that led to an intruder who broke into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in order to break into classified military systems. Cliff writes with a 'stream of consciousness' style that used over 350 pages where maybe 86 pages would be used in a more concise style. [Is using many pages a mark of bureaucratic style?] Cliff describes his lifestyle as a university serf: eating a lot of pizza, bicycling around, living with friends, sewing quilts. His big event of the year is dressing up for a Halloween parade in San Francisco. This book lacks a Table of Contents and an Index (not intended for reference?). I don't expect a sequel.<P>This is worth reading as a slow-paced detective or mystery story. But it is unlike a Hammett or Chandler or other detective authors. One lesson is the care needed when talking over a phone line (the "F" entity). Cliff's comments on an uncaring Federal bureaucracy were echoed in the aftermath of 9/11/2001. The personal activities of Cliff and his friends show them to be dedicated followers of fashion who imagine themselves to be radically original. American telephones are computer controlled so they are easy to trace.<P>Cliff is asked about the "adiabatic lapse rate on Jupiter". This wasn't "by chance", but a test of his bona fides (Chapter 45). Chapter 47 explains how to decrypt Unix passwords from words. Plodding through this book is like running on a dry sandy beach. He could have been more specific. Cliff claims the problem with viruses is they destroy trust (naive?). My advice is: trust no one.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book at the suggestion of a friend. I did not really expect it to be entertaining since most books on the subject are tough to get through. Instead it is as compelling as any good thriller. It is one of those books that are tough to put down once started, and I found myself staying up late to make it through just "a few more pages".<BR>Try it and you're in for a treat.</span>

                    <span>Here's a great nerd's-eye view of Cliff Stoll's practically one-man stand to capture a 'Cracker' (aka a Malicious Hacker for the non-geeks). There's enough technical detail to get the point across without losing an audience. Mr Stoll has a great ability to write that doesn't alienate the non-computer savvy folk, yet keep us fellow geeks enthralled.</span>
