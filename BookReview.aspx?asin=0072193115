                    <span>what i really like about this book is the fact that it covers the gamut from wiring, to configuration, to parental controls, with tips from a lot of third parties. <P>i'll confess: i know david strom and i have his phone number. so, whenever i go to install a new piece of equipment, i call strom and ask why it's not working. "can't get the windows ce thing to work with the wireless lan?" i say. "turn off encryption and try again" he says. "my isp is acting flakey, who should i switch to?" i say. "go to this url" he says. imagine my surprise when i found this book and found all of my questions and his answers in them. using this book is really going to cut down on my long distance bill!<P>besides you have to love a book with a section called "Threats from Microsoft Office Users".</span>

                    <span>David Strom's Home Networking book is a must have. If you read it you'll get a good tutorial on how things work. If you have things that don't work you can use it as a troubleshooting guide. It is very comprehensive -- includes both PC and the Mac and numerious networking vendors. I recommend the book for anyone who wants or needs to know more about how to share computers and printers and files in their home.</span>

                    <span>I can't imagine why anyone would not like this book. In the back of the book is an appendix to fixing networking problems. I wrote this appendix and was so confident it would resolve every peer-to-peer networking issue, I include my e-mail address for readers to contact me directly if, after following the appendix trouble-shooting guide, they still can not resolve their problem.<P>I know of no other book that offers such a 'free' and helpful service. If the book didn't answer a question you were seeking, the opportunity is made available to the reader to email me directly with that question.<P>What's not to like?</span>

                    <span>Thought this book would be perfect A-Z reference for my home-networking needs, but alas, coverage of key topics was disappointing. Details and comparisons of networking protocols was scant. A common file sharing error, which i frequently experience was not covered at all (Windows File Error: 1026). Also this book recommends Norton AntiVirus, one of the most disappointing and buggy AV applications i have tried.<P>I found "Sams Teach Yourself Windows Networking in 24 Hours" to be much more informative for my needs (at a lower price).</span>
