                <span id="Label1">A meticulously reported expose uncovers exactly how the drug industry boosts sales and bilks consumers in the most lucrative prescription drug market in the world. <P>As the pharmaceutical industry invests more and more in the development of new drugs, true breakthroughs are few and far between. Into the breach comes a panoply of product-line extensions and me-too drugs aimed at grabbing market share. The industry plows its high profits back into research, but invests an equal or greater sum in flogging its products in every imaginable venue. Research studies are designed to support marketing claims. Many doctors all over the country get their first information about new drugs from a salesperson. And, increasingly, prescription drugs are pitched to consumers on TV and the internet with images of hope, terror, or chic. Evidence-based practice guidelines, which endeavor to get the right medicines to those who will benefit most, can't be heard over the din. <P>Having created an unprecedented number of "megabrands"--blockbuster drugs with huge sales--and undergone an extraordinary wave of consolidation, some drug companies now find themselves in a precarious position. Patents are expiring on flagship products. In order to sustain the growth Wall Street has come to expect, these companies must produce billions of dollars worth of new revenue--fast. But can Americans continue to bankroll Operation Grow Big Pharma? Must we swallow the bad with the good?</span>

                    <span>This is my personal response to anyone else throwing darts at this book by Katherine Greider.  Let it be from now on that you eiether agree with Mrs. Greider on this issue, or you side with the Big Pharma terrorists.
<br />As her father, the great muckraker William Greider demystified the U.S. Federal Reserve, K. Greider demystifies the big drug companies with their claims that they must have their way with public policy.
<br />It would seem that a President who purports to be "pro-life" would waste no time pushing some PRICE CONTROLS so people could afford the prescription drugs they need.</span>

                    <span>Katharine Greider has given you a rare unbiased look inside the pharmaceutical industry.  I know several doctors.  They all get 4-6 visits a day from drug "detailers."  That's where they get virtually all their prescribing information.  Forget about older generics that are just as effective.  Forget about the thousands of studies published everyday on natural substances which are as effective, much less expensive with no side effects.  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in April, 1998 showed that:
<br />
<br />In 1994, an estimated 2,216,000 (1,721,000 to 2,711,000) hospitalized patients had serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 106,000 (76,000 to 137,000) had fatal ADRs, making these reactions between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death. 
<br />Do you really think this has improved in the last 10 years?
<br />
<br />In December, 2003, at a conference in London, Dr. Allen Roses, a senior vice president of GlaxoSmithKline candidly admitted that fully 90% of prescription drugs only work 30% to 50% of the time.
<br />
<br />Other countries control drug prices...the same drugs from the same companies for which Americans pay exorbitant prices.  Despite two laws passed by Congress since 2000, the FDA, under pressure from drug company lobbyists, still prohibits "reimportation"  of drugs from Canada and other countries.  States and cities are deliberately challenging the FDA to help their seniors get drugs at reasonable prices from Canada.  Busloads of seniors travel from New Hampshire, New York, Michigan and Montana to get their prescriptions filled in Canada.  Is this a sensible solution?
<br />
<br />To fully understand the dynamics of this ridiculous situation, read this book.  For example, there are no studies to compare the effectiveness of "new" drugs to those already available (and about to go off patent) or to generics.  Does this make sense?
<br />
<br />Most people are unaware that Costco sells the same drug as the local pharmacy at a 30-80% discount.  Anyone can use the Costco pharmacy.  By law, you do not have to be a Costco member.  Call them for a price quote on your next prescription drug.  Fight back, America!</span>

                    <span>Whats the price of your life? No coverage of the new compounds and molecules that have sustained millions of lives worldwide?
<br /> Do we complain about the high cost of education, a new car, a new home? Do we complain about the price of those frozen custards, donuts, fast food? NO Why, cause all of those things give us pleasure. Why don't we regulate commericials for cars, food, cell phones, would that not also make our cost of products lower?? You don't think every single industry has lobbyist? Boy, how naive can one be. What does a drug do at best, but make you feel normal. Drug cost are 8% of the total healthcare cost, and have risen less the hospital and physician cost, but we don't bitch about those because we don't pay out of pocket for those items. This country is the most obese, out of shape nation in the world, yet when it time to pay for your years and years of indulgence, "the company is ripping me off"?
<br /> This is the United States last great industry, employing millions of americans, its not perfect, and there is greed as in any other industry, now lets lower the cost and rate of inflation of education?? </span>

                    <span>Not nearly the insightful analysis that is claims to be, it presents a lot of the practices of the pharmaceutical industry that deserve scrutiny, including its promotional practices and focus on drugs that treat chronic vs. acute conditions, because that is where the profits are. But it doesn't address the issues of high healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical profits represent such a small fraction of healthcare costs that even if they were eliminated, total costs would go down perhaps a few percentage points. We would still have out-of-control healthcare costs. And the book doesn't adequately address the profit motivation that is needed to support innovation and has always been the strength of this great country, nor does it adequately address the economics that support how often drugs save many more dollars in healthcare costs vs. their costs, or the fact that many drugs especially generics are available at much lower costs in the US than elsewhere. Drug firms have their issues, reforming their cost structures including drug R&D and other practices is necessary, but many of the roots of healthcare costs go well beyond drug firms, and unless the whole system is addressed, to pick on one seemingly dysfunctional part will do little.<p>Patients themselves contribute to the high-cost of healthcare by expecting free healthcare and not doing anything to take care of themselves preventively. How telling is it that many people take better care of their cars than than themselves (is this because no one else will fix our cars for free if we abuse them)?  What I look at my personal experience, and how much better pharmaceuticals have made my life when I needed them, and how inexpensive they were, lifesaver is what I think, not rip-off.<p>Bottomline, if you want some insight into some practices that could be improved without enough context to the overall structural issues in healthcare, read on. But for a more balanced debate around what really has to be done to fix healthcare costs, dig deeper.</span>
