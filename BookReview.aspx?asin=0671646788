                    <span>I have to admit, I have read this book about 8 times. I make it a goal to read this book every six months because of the powerful influences that come from Dr. Schwartz. I read this book initially in 1999 and was taken aback by how powerful the thinking process is. As a result of applying the book, I was able to get a better job, attain certifications in my field (Computers), buy a house and feel much better about myself. If you find yourself in need of a change, look no further than this book. <P>I recommend this book for family and friends. While the book was written some 30+ years ago, the concepts are still relevant, and the stories hold true today.<P>Put this book at the top of your must read list!!!</span>

                    <span>I could repeat everyone else's comments, or I could just give a quick overview of why I think you should read this book.<P>This book is a must-read for any person serious about improving themselves as a manager, a husband or wife, a friend, or a person in general. There are a lot of mediocre self-help books out there, and its refreshing to go back and re-read The Magic of Thinking Big, which is one of the few that sets the standard. I would classify this at the same level as Think and Grow Rich and How to win Friends and Influence People. This is one of those rare books thats actually flawless, and thats why it gets 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>This book started it all. Without a doubt one of the best book ever written. I just love it. This book is about realizing your potential as an individual, and it makes a wonderful companion to other books on the market. One such book is, "How to find your dream job and make it a reality: solutions for a rewarding and meaningful career" by Jason McClure. Of course, this book about realizing your career potential, which is very important. <P>In his book Jason takes the complexity out of the job/career search, and makes it easy and doable, which is why I highly recommend Jason's book. If you buy any book as a complement to the "Magic of thinking big" I would recommend Jason's book. Both books are classics, and both books offer proven solutions.</span>

The recommendations in this book are easy to follow and are beneficial to even the most experienced management personnell. I purchased this book in 1996 and have read it at least once a year since then. It can really make a difference with an individuals academic, work and personal goals.</span>
