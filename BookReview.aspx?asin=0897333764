                    <span>what an an amazing book! one of the best anybody could read on the holocaust subject. it is about the wife of a doctor who is imprisoned in the death camp BIRKENAU. unlike auschwitz, this camp is a death camp not a work camp where the author lives under unbearable conditions and manages to survive while watching her fellow internees give up on life. a very moving TRUE story. do not leave this book sitting on the shelf. it's a real page turner and make sure to grab a tissue!</span>

                    <span>Olga Lengyel's 'Five Chimneys' is probably the most descriptive and compehensive book written on Auschwitz-Birkenau from a survivor's point of view. Many authors have written outstanding books on this subject but Lengyel's is the most moving and detailed of those books. The story is outlined by other reviewers here so I won;t get into that but simply say read it, it deserves it's 5 star rating.</span>

                    <span>I'm very sorry for the reviewer that uses "gruesome" to describe such an example of someone who survived to bear witness. I have probably one of largest private collections of books on the Holocaust that runs into the hundreds. I am 70 and have known many of the survivors (especially since many were children who were 10 or more years younger than soldiers). Some would share their story with me, some could not, but I believe that one thing that kept many alive was the need TO BEAR WITNESS. One book on this subject is like one book on a bloody battle of WWII, it is ugly--as war usually is--but it doesn't begin to help understand the war (or the Holocaust). There is the individual, the killers and collaborators, the governments, the people on both sides, all of which, if studied for the deep meaning, tells us much about the "human" race.</span>

                    <span>this is an unbelievably touching and shocking book. it kept me reading constantly. i highly recommend this book for anyone who is just starting reading about the holocaust or is a seasoned veteran on the subject. it will leave you speechless. this book is about one of the most couragous women i have ever heard about. these people were heroes ...every one of them.</span>

                    <span>The cold truth comes out in this book. How she survived (among others) is still a mystery of human spirit. Excellent account of the holocaust. The author brings up the important point that not only Jews were victims, people from many lands and religions suffered, even the Germans.</span>
