                    <span>Guy has always done an excellent job of collecting information and dispersing it in an entertaining and educational way. His latest book is no exception. What makes Guy's books useful is that they are not filled with extra stuff. In other words, he presents just the facts, in as few words as possible. You don't have to read two pages to figure out the point he's trying to get across. Reader's of his other works will recognize some familiar themes such as how to treat the customer. As an added bonus, Guy presents "required" reading at the end of each chapter -- a wonderful collection of other works that are relevant to the topics discussed. And while the book uses the software industry as frequent examples, it is really for every business, high tech, low tech, no tech. Highly recommended reading.</span>

                    <span>I always say that I love books that make me think and laugh. This one doesn't disappoint in either respect. I picked it up in the bookstore, flipped it over (I always read the back and index first!), and laughed out loud at what was written under "Work Like a Slave,": "Get ready for hard work, and lots of it. To go from revolutionary to visionary, you'll need to eat like a bird-- relentlessly absorbing knowledge about your industry, customers, and competition-- and poop like an elephant-- spreading the large amounts of information knowledge that you've gained." Ah, finally. Someone else who understands, but says it much more humorously and eloquently! I'd love to chat with him in "real life!" I read this book in one afternoon, then read parts of it again. I also liked the bits of Latin thrown in, who'd of thunk of that! I'm glad he did, it made the book more enjoyable to read. Humor, wit, Latin, and quotes from Brancusi. Works for me!</span>

                    <span>Excellent book! Very simply written and easy to read, yet brilliantly points out the seemingly simple, but important business rules of marketing a product or a service. Looking forward to read more from this "revolutionary" enterpreneur.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very concise guidebook on product evangelism. The author was Apple Computer's chief evangelist, and I myself an Apple evangelist, really enjoyed the author's description of the product evangelism process, of which I was part as a customer. <P>The authro uses some analogies, like "eat like a bird, poop like an elephant", which oozes unconventional thinking, however the topics he addresses are pretty standard. Rather than innovative thinking, I think this is a good way of repackaging thoughts into a coherent framework.<P>It seems to try to speak to the actors of the internet revolution in their language, which in many ways alienates some of the other audiences. However, if we ignore this segmentation, it is a pretty nice, short guide.</span>
