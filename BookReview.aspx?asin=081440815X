                    <span>Women are the most powerful consumer force in the U.S., but they do not approach buying decisions the way men do. That's intriguing, but it doesn't mean that exhaustive demographic and sales statistics make interesting reading. Authors and marketing consultants Lisa Johnson and Andrea Learned explain how to direct your marketing efforts to women. Each chapter deals with a different subset of women - old, young, black, white, Hispanic, married, single - but the groups are compared along similar lines and the information is sliced the same way in most chapters. The authors liven up their exposition with short illustrative case studies, but the cases often feature products for which marketers have made no concerted, specific effort to attract female buyers. For instance, the decision to sell single servings of food occurred because of other demographics (more people living alone) and was not intended just to attract women buyers. Still, the thesis here is important enough to carry the authors' occasional tendency to twist product features to fit the theme, as well as their branding jargon. Acknowledging the significance of marketing to women, we recommend this information-packed book.</span>

                    <span>After nearly 30 years in the marketing business, I am delighted to find two dynamic thinkers who have written compelling, concise and creative content on the needs of this country's most powerful and influencial market. Too long overlooked, women have different priorities, values, communication styles and preferences than men consumers.  Learned and Johnson aptly address key differences, important nuances and critical factors that drive decision making, the customer experience and brand loyalty by giving actionable strategies for gaining women's trust and turning them into true brand advocates. Don't Think Pink is an easy read business book, dotted with personality and fun.  If you want to train your brain to think differently about the women's market (not to mention grow your bottomline), but hate to be weighted down by the business-speak in a typicial business book, Don't Think Pink is for you.</span>

                    <span>The last time I was this enthused after reading a marketing book was in '99 when Paco Underhill's book Why We Buy was published.  I've already begun a second (slower) reading of Don't Think Pink -- and I just bought it on Thursday!<p>Thanks to the authors Lisa and Andrea for sharing their experience and findings in such a readable book.  After knocking around the marketing arena for a couple of decades, I am thrilled to have a ready, authoritative reference such as Don't Think Pink to cite when presenting recommendations and concepts, both internally as well as to clients.</span>

                    <span>I've read a lot of business-related books and rarely do I find one that I can't put down.  As a woman consumer, I read Don't Think Pink and I found myself feeling understood.  As a businesswoman I believe that organizations that truly embrace the marketing philosophy, strategy and tangible suggestions that the authors provide will find themselves able to break ahead of the pack to reach their women customers innovatively.<br>The personality and expertise of the authors come through in their writing, which makes this book not only incredibly relevant in today's marketplace, but also just a fun, conversational, easy read!</span>
