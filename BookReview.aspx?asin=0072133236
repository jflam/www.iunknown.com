                    <span>If you had no cartooning instruction, nor opened a 'How to Cartoon' book, and had a limited understanding of Flash this would be a good place to start. If you are well advanced in your study of both cartooning and Flash and want to put together quality animation I'm sorry to say this book will be poor help.<br>I bought the book shortly after it was published, went to the authors website and never went back to either. To make cheap, shoddy animation you don't need an overly priced book like this...<br>The "Illusion of Life" book for Flash Animation, with fine examples of how Flash can move the net, has still to be written.<br>You've been warned.</span>

                    <span>I bought a lot of books about Flash animation to better improve my skills in the subject. I got this one along with a few others. This book taught me nothing that I didn't already know. This stuff I already knew wasn't from other books, it was from common sense. Sure, I guess if you are completely new the program this book may be useful somewhat, but not much at all.<p>This book had some pretty awful ideas. Something about drawing each frame onto paper then scanning it in. It kept referring to capture cards to capture video. Wait, I thought we were making the video?<p>The fact that this book was in black and white didn't help at all. What few good pictures it had, they really needed to be in color to understand what was going on.<p>For $40, you'd expect a good book and a CD-ROM with all the examples in FLA source format. Nope. You get a pretty bad book with no cd at all. Be smart, don't buy this book. I'd recomend THE FLASH ANIMATOR since it was written by a true professional who has made a landmark on the internet (Sandro Corsaro).</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be pretty good. Not knowing a single thing about flash and some about animation it was able to meet all my needs in learning more about the two together. The greatest thing about this book was the author, i was confused on how to do something in Flash so i emailed the author and he emailed me back the same day with clear info on how to fix my problem.  I really apprecited him taking his time out for me, i was trully suprised when i got his very helpful emaiil. Thanks again, and to all of you out there that are thinking about getting this book please do you woun't be disapointed.</span>

                    <span>I think this is a great flash tutorial book on how to make cartoons. Its wonderful! So simple to catch on to. This is not any ordinary tutorial book its one of the funest ones I've ever purchased. Instead of the book be dull and boring like other tutorials this book takes a fun twist. I highly rate this book for everything. I hope that Ibis Fernadez comes out with another tutorial book just as great as this one!</span>

                    <span>This is a good-enough and likeable book about extending the capabilities of Flash into professional animation and cartooning. But a CD on the back of it would really have made my day.</span>
