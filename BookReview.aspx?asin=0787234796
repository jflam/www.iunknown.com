                    <span>Carl Jung and Anthony Robbins are unlikely bed-fellows. What brings them together is an understanding of your reaction to my assertion. Jung's major work was in the development of his theory of psychological type -- using four scales to divide humanity into sixteen groups, seen most frequently now in the increasingly ubiquitous Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. More recently Rodger Bailey used his experience in Linguistics and in personnel work to construct a 14 scale model of scales useful in the world of organisations which he called the Language and Behaviour (LAB) profile. <P>Shelle Rose Charvet trained in the LAB Profile with Rodger and has gone on to us it to build her own business as a trainer and consultant. Her book is written out of her experience in running her two-day LAB Profile work-shop, the style is light and friendly, rich in examples and clear in teaching. I enjoyed the material immensely, both from its clear presentation and its practical utility. If you want to know how to use language to influence people, or to avoid other people manipulating you then you really have to choose to buy and then read her book. I especially like Shelle's speech patterns -- "talking with both sides of the mouth" which are designed to address the breadth of a scale in a single sentence, for instance to communicate to both "towards" and "away from" people with equal effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>This book presents meta-programs (the content-free filters we use to make up our model of the world) in a simple, understandable and highly readable way. It's based on the Language and Behaviour (LAB) Profile developed by Rodger Bailey - a simplification of the original 60 (!) meta-programs down to 14, along with the questions you can use to elicit them. This is a kind of psychometric test, although as people may have different meta-programs in different contexts, and they may change over time, it's not about pigeonholing people. Shelle also tells you the kind of language to use to reach particular kinds of people - useful in sales, negotiation, motivation and deciding who to hire for a particular job. The book is chatty with a good sense of humour. As an NLP trainer I recommend it!</span>

                    <span>As a teacher of business writing, I do not recommend this book to all my students; I only recommend it to the ones who are serious and want to take that extra step. I tell them that this is a book that shows you how to pay close attention to the words you use, whether speaking or writing, so that you maximize the impact you have on the specific person you are communicating with.<P>I applied some of the concepts in the book to a case study in a writing workshop I teach. Students are fascinated by it. They often say things like, "I can't believe something so subtle could be that powerful," and, "I wish I had known about this when I had so much trouble getting my previous boss to even listen to me."<P>The theories in the book result from research in neuro-linguistic programming. They use fancy concepts such as profiles, filters, and meta programs. But the author translates it all in a way that makes it easy to understand. And she gives hundreds of examples of how you can apply it to situations at work where you need people to listen to you, understand you, and even agree with you.<P>If you work in human resources, this book is especially valuable because the author provides many examples of assessing how people think. This can be used to match people to the right jobs and to help them improve their interpersonal communications.<P>I rated this book 5 stars because I think it is superior in all categories for a specialized communications textbook: powerful ideas, insightful author, meticulous exposition, and reasonable price.</span>

                    <span>I too thought I was a good communicator. Without direction, which this book provides, I probably would have continued to underperform in this critical area.<P>An example: my boss is an "away-from", risk-averse individual. Until I learned to couch my words in a similar vein, he often misinterpreted and became angry with me. Now, I am happy to say we are talking more freely, with greater understanding, than ever.<P>The categories of influence outlined here are insightful and pratical. Some are obvious, but many hours of thoughtful observation on who is saying what, and how, could pass before one might catalog these nuggets in their entirety.<P>Thank goodness I discovered this fine resource. It already has repaid me in dividends of good will and understanding greater than the modest cover price.<P>Thankyou Rose!</span>
