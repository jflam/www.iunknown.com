                <span id="Label1">Naturally, you should clear your schedule if you really want to learn VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) 2.0 in three weeks. You need to study carefully to become proficient in this language, which is the standard lingo for creating 3-D graphics and animations for the Web. Luckily, the authors of this book are careful to take you from basic VRML concepts to tricky scripting tasks quite smoothly, enabling you to build on each lesson as you go. And, of course, you can extend the 21 days to 210 if you want. At any rate, you learn how to build scenes and complex objects, define object behavior and interaction, create animations and special effects, and use collision detection. You can also learn how to create new node types and write VRML scripts. The book is intended for beginners, not programmers. In the appendices you get reference guides to VRML nodes, fields, and event types, as well as a glossary. A hybrid CD-ROM includes sample VRML worlds, HTML editors, and graphics utilities.</span>

                    <span>This was my first book for VRML2. Although I do lots of graphics programming in C/C++ and Open GL, I am sure that this book will be equally easy for those who want to start web 3D programming. If you know java script then this can be a good guide for VRML scripting. I would like to thank the author for his work. I did my entire project on VRML with the help of this book only ...</span>

                    <span>Although I have some previous programming experience (2 C++ classes in college), I'm usually able to grasp the basic concepts pretty easily. This book is no exception, but it certainly isn't related to C++ or anything like that, so it really is like starting from the beginning to me. But it was still easy to grasp the concepts (so far anyway, I'm only about 1/3 through the book) and apply them following the author's exercises. CosmoPlayer (the VRML plugin for your browser) is in version 2.1 now (the book's CD includes version 1.0) so a visit to cosmo software would be good. Also, they make WYSIWYG editors for VRML, so don't think that you won't be able to write VRML just because you can't remember all the code - I assume it's like a 3D Studio Max interface.<P>The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the author seems to assume you completely understand everything the very first time he explains it to you. I've had to go back and re-read several sections so that I could understand something later in the book, but I suppose if he kept explaining concepts over and over again then the book would be twice as long. Great book if you're interested in the VRML world.</span>

                    <span>I have read alot of the web3d/vrml books over the years, and this book is the best one I have read so far. The book starts with easy to understand concept and example to show you what VRML can do, and what VRML is possible. It is suitable for both beginner and advance users. The complimentary CD-ROM is very helpful and is a great time saver for anyone who wants to use the example and script in the book. This is the best VRML book I have read so far.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great introduction to VRML2. Clear concise and will take you through the basic building blocks for programming VRML worlds. However it dosen't cover Java integration, which I believe is needed if you want to make an advanced world. If only all computing guides were this logical and clear! great introduction</span>
