                <span id="Label1">Acclaimed historian Niall Ferguson offers a radical new history of the links between politics and economics, drawing unsettling conclusions about the future of capitalism and democracy.  <P>Conventional wisdom has long claimed that economic change is the prime mover of political change, whether in the age of industry or Internet. But is it? Ferguson thinks it is high time we re-examined the link--the nexus, in Thomas Carlyle's phrase--between economics and politics. His central argument is that the conflicting impulses of sex, violence, and power are together more powerful than money.   <P>Among Ferguson's startling claims are:  <P>&#183; Nothing has done more to transform the world economy than war, yet wars themselves do not have primarily economic causes.  <P>&#183; The present age of economic globalization is coinciding--paradoxically--with political and military fragmentation.  <P>&#183; Financial crises are frequently caused by unforeseen political events rather than economic fluctuations.  <P>&#183; The relationship between prosperity and government popularity is largely illusory.  <P>&#183; Since political and economic liberalization are not self-perpetuating, the so-called triumph of democracy worldwide may be short-lived.  <P>&#183; A bold synthesis of political history and modern economic theory, <I>The Cash Nexus</I> will transform the landscape of modern history and draw challenging conclusions about the prospects of both capitalism and democracy.</span>

                    <span>Professor Ferguson tries to examine the link between money and history. However Mr. Fergusson changes the argument around and persuades the reader that money does not influence history so much as warfare does. According to Mr. ferguson it is fighting between countries that has given rise to the modern state. One cannot predict when a nation will journey to war and so an apparatus(tax gathering and bond issuing) is left in place to cover any sudden conflict. Mr. Ferguson points out correctly that the state has moved away from a warfare viewpoint of government function to a welfare viewpoint. The best part of the book is the last chapter which criticizes the US for not getting involved in other countries' affairs due to a post Vietnam ambivalence. I would highly recommend this book simply because there is nothing out there right now which examines history in a different light. I would have given this a 5 star rating but Professor Fergusson tends TO REPEAT HIMSELF at times.</span>

                    <span>In this monumental work, Professor Niall Ferguson traces the evolution of and relationship between money, the state and war. Beginning with a section on taxes (the earliest form of large-scale finance), the book continues with a history of bonds, currency and finance. Then, there is a great deal of information on how these financial institutions have influenced society. And, most importantly, the final chapters of the book look at money and finance on a global scale, analyzing everything including stock "bubbles", gold and military success and failure. This book was written in September 2000, which means that much of the author's data is right up-to-date!<P>The above description of this book does not begin to do justice to it. The author's knowledge is obviously encyclopedic, and this book covers a vast multitude of subjects relating to money and power. Indeed, my one complaint against this book is that, at times, does seem to meander from subject to subject, seeming to lose track of the point. However, that said, this is a fascinating book, one well worth taking the time to read.<P>As an aside, I must say that the author does seem to severely undermine Paul Kennedy's (author of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers) concept of "imperial overstretch." Instead he raises up the possibility that countries have experienced "understretch" leading them into costly later wars (such as the British Empire before World War I), and that America may be understretching right now.</span>

                    <span>This is an interesting book as it is part of "the new history". Ferguson is a person who heads a team of researchers who collect a range of data. This data is then written up into a book.<P>It is an interesting approach and breaks free of the simple narrative history of years gone by. This book is basically a history of the financial mechanisms of government and their effects. <P>It is unusual to read a book which is written from what is largely an ideology free perspective. (The author has a mild bias towards free market mechanisms but he would not doubt suggest that instead of these representing a defined ideological position they reflect current what is now commonly accepted across the board as economic fact.) In some ways it is quite refreshing. The book also writes history free of the sorts of biases brought about by seeing history as a process. The development of democracy or the development of a national identity for instance. <P>One thing which astounded me was the fact that no one ever in reality tried to manage overall levels of demand as advocated by Keynes. Even when Governments accepted Keynsian orthodoxy, they never used deficient financing to offset unemployment because of balance of payment considerations. <P>The book basically sees the development of British financial institutions as the key to a large amount of modern history. Britain pioneered the use of salaried officials to collect tax, when they borrowed arrangements were put in place to ensure that such a debt would be repaid. The British system was successful in financing wars, the major expense of states until the 20th century and was adopted by all other states. <P>The book however is more than a history of the financial arrangements of states. It is a discussion about the role of governments, what they have done historically and the sorts of things they do now and what challenges they face. Well worth a read.</span>

                    <span>It's pretty obvious from the outset where Ferguson's arguments are going in this book and what his political philosophy and world-view is. He states in quite plainly in the end. In contrast to Paul Kennedy who argued in THE RISE AND FALL OF GREAT POWERS that "imperial overstretch" is the economic causal factor that was directly linked with "Great Power" decline, Ferguson sees political will (or the lack thereof) and "understretch" as the problem. He says in the world today "we've got economic globalization very much on a 19th century model" however "there isn't a global policeman with the kind of interests Britain had then". The real difficulty in his view is that "the leaders of the one state with the economic resources to make the world a better place [the US] lack the guts to do it." OK, so Ferguson sees the US adopting an "imperial" approach to world affairs, and he supports Friedman and Fukuyama who argued that the spread of capitalism and democracy are neccessary for freedom to bloom. Before we look at whether he convincingly makes his point there is a basic question that puts this whole discussion in context. How persuasive can a British writer be in directing his argument to Americans for a more economically activist role by their country, and how are we supposed to read this in our new world of narrower priorities? <P>If our American economic and political system is to be supported and encouraged, and we are his intended audience, then who is the target of Fergusons criticism? It's axiomatic that it's Marxist historians and supporters of historicism as Ferguson sees nothing "deterministic" or directional about economic history. Ferguson instead convincingly argues that a CASH NEXUS exists and it is there, in the linkage between money and power, where the real story lies. Indeed he says quite clearly that "money does not make the world go round...it has been political events - above all,wars - that have shaped the institutions of modern economic life: tax-collecting, bureaucracies, central banks, bond markets, stock exchanges."<P>The whole book is a development on this point. Financial statistics and bond yields are presented in chapters such as "The Money Printers: Default and Debasement", "Of Interest", "Dead Weights and Tax-eaters: The social History of Finance" and "Bubbles and Busts: Stock Markets in the Long Run". These chapters are obviously analytical and there is sometimes a flood of data that tends to dampen enjoyment of the book. The latter half of the book where Ferguson spends more time making the connections between money, power, politics, culture, and warfare and less time analyzing, is both more enjoyable to read and more instructive.<P>It's an interesting book well written and certainly very opinionated. It's broad ranging covering the last 300 years of western economic development and interdisciplinary in scope touching on philosophy, political science, geography as well as it's main subjects of history, finance, and economics. Opinionated history like this is always contentious but it's equally always enjoyable to read.</span>

                    <span>The Cash Nexus is an overly ambitious attempt to re-examine the link between economics and politics in the post-Cold War period.<P>	The most interesting part of the book is the first 6 chapters, which focus on how state institutions have emerged over time to serve the needs of war finance--the principal impetus behind the rise of the modern state. These institutions produce what Ferguson calls an optimal combination for producing power and include 4 institutions: a professional tax gathering bureaucracy; a parliament that accords a measure of representation to tax payers; the management of a system of national debt, which allows the state to borrow; and a central bank to manage a currency and the national debt. Ferguson maintains that this combination first emerged in Britain after the Glorious Revolution and was later exported to other countries and, together, produced many unintended benefits, such as an educated civil service and expanded capital markets which served the needs of the economy. <P>	An important part of Ferguson's argument is that economic philosophies have produced two deterministic views of history--one Marxist and the other liberal capitalist. While one opposes capitalism and the other celebrates it, both see history as being essentially economic history. The modern variety of economic determinism (neoclassical economics) has produced three ideas that Ferguson criticizes: economic growth promotes democratization; economic success leads to re-election; and economic growth is the key to international power. While Ferguson's criticisms are interesting, there are a few shortcomings.<P>	One is that he makes the mistake of equating wealth with money when discussing liberal economics. In fact, the term money seems to be a synonym for economics wherever Ferguson discusses modern economic ideas on history, but he does not take note of the fact that liberal economics--whether classical or modern--does not view money as being the core of the economy. <P>	The dichotomy between Marxism and neoclassical economics appears too simple as well. He fails to note that much of the West--i.e., on the Continent of Europe--practices a rather different variety of capitalism than that suggested by the Anglo-American model, one that is corporatist and whose adherents are often in strong antipathy to open and competitive markets. The absence of this distinction becomes annoying when he discusses fixed exchange rates and monetary unions (Chapter 11). He argues that floating exchange rates and market instability cannot go on forever, that some sort of supranational controls are required. If we take the Anglo-American model to mean the way the United States and Britain operate, then fixed exchange rates and monetary unions are not part of that. In fact, proponents of this model generally argue against what Ferguson argues for.<BR>	<BR>	Sections 3 and 4 (Chapters 7-14) cover so many different topics that the material does not integrate well into the core themes of the first two sections. A related matter is one of depth. While the research of other disciplines is frequently discussed (e.g., political science and economics), he often considers too thin a slice of that research to provide enough depth in any one place. While arguing against the idea that political manipulation of the business cycle always leads to re-election, for example, he does not engage most of the literature on this question.<P> 	Another issue is the way in which data is used. Some of his charts present data across so many years and countries that it is hard to see the detail in the movement of the figures. This is especially true when the figures contain extreme values during the world wars.<P>	Ferguson returns to the warfare state at the end of the book to argue that the West is quite under-militarized and potentially vulnerable to more aggressive states. The United States should heed this warning and assert its role as a hegemonic power again. Ferguson concludes that money does not, after all, make the world go round. People are driven by motivations other than economic gain and power has many facets to it--some tangible and some not. While this may be true, it is not much of a revelation.</span>
