                    <span>This is an incredible bargain. I always said that if Air Time came out on DVD, I would get it, but boy did they outdo themselves!! All these pieces show why Jordan is not just the greatest baller on earth, but also why he is an incredible individual in every aspect of life. There is truth to the statement "I wanna be like Mike!". The highlights are incredible, the sound (5.1 decoding) is breath-taking, and the features are superb....This DVD set should be worth $50 easily, yet look at the deal. As an avid player also, I must say that even if you are not a Jordan fan (at least not until you see these pieces) you will greatly appreciate this set as you get to see the mental points that made Jordan the best ever. GET IT!! YOU WONT REGRET IT!!</span>

                    <span>In the last weeks since the 2003-04 NBA season ended, the Pistons have been crowned champs, Phil has moved back to the mountains, Shaq is dipping into the Atlantic Ocean, and Kobe is still being heralded as the current Michael Jordan. All of this makes me feel only one thing. I miss watching Michael Jordan play basketball. I miss him on and off the court as an NBA fan. I wish they would stop crowning future Michael Jordans. There is only one. And this is his DVD collection. If you want to be reminded of what greatness in basketball is, get this DVD. Watch it, remember the good times, and once again love basketball.</span>

                    <span>Prior to buyng this dvd, I had only read books about Jordan and heard about him. After I was through watching the excellent collection of programs and the slew of special features, I had been captivated by the perfect blend of in-depth Jordan information and amazing highlights. This dvd is worth at least $30, but is selling for less than half. If you have only heard about his greatness, or even if you lived to see it,THIS DVD IS A MUST BUY. Much of the footage will have your mind blown from his unbeleivable exploits. Not only that, but the film quality and different perspectives from legendary players and coaches are great. Most of the narration is flawless and the music goes right along with the flow of the programs. It even comes with an exclusive booklet filled with Jordan pictures and quotes. The case which it comes in has an eye-catching and intresting interior and exterior. This dvd is one of my most valueble,and after watching it, I guarentee you will be jumping off your seat to the nearest court to shoot some hoops.</span>
