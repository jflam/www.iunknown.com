                    <span>A complete guide to venture capital covering all aspects from understanding what venture capital is, to writing the business plan to negotiations, written in an easy to understand, practical manner. <P>Hill and Power have done extensive research through their surveys of 250 venture capital firms, interviews with partners in VC firms and experts in their field. And it shows, "Inside Secrets To Venture Capital" provides comprehensive coverage of the world of venture capital. <P>And it's entertaining as well, I loved the "Deal Tales". <P>If you're interested in venture capital, this book is a MUST read.</span>

                    <span>Inside Secrets to Venture Capital is similar in caliber to many college course books. It's written in a concise, contemporary manner that offers wit along with wisdom. The authors cheerfully nuke business-related myths while providing entrepreneurs with a wide range of splendid information.<P>Hill and Powers spent three years surveying investors and entrepreneurs. Well worth the time and effort. This highly organized book, loaded with fascinating statistics, offers special mini-sections in three categories: advice from angels, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs.<P>Inside Secrets to Venture Capital doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but provides enough data, resources, and insight to ensure that all entrepreneurs find the right resolutions. While it may well become the consummate reference for entrepreneurs in search of funding, it should also be required reading for potential angels, venture capital investors, and anyone seriously seeking a business degree.</span>

                    <span>Jerry Chautin <BR>Volunteer SCORE Business Counselor, www.SCORE.org<P>I've recommended INSIDE SECRETS TO VENTURE CAPITAL to my clients as a way to gain immediate insight to what's really going on in the VC world. Novices have unrealistic expectations and rarely understand what the venture capitalist wants. INSIDE SECRETS tells it like it is. <BR> <BR>*I found INSIDE SECRETS to be fast reading and an excellent resource for those beginning their search for VC. In my opinion it can substantially reduce the entrepreneur's learning curve and allow them to assess their chances of getting equity funding for their venture.*</span>

                    <span>Having spent a couple years now as a venture investor, I was looking for a book I could point entrepreneurs to, so they could get a better perspective on the venture investment process: what do they need to have in place, what's most important, how does the process work, etc. "Inside Secrets to Venture Capital" would take someone maybe 75% of the way there. Unfortunately, that's not good enough, as the lack of that last 25% would likely mean that the reader would head off in some unproductive directions. So I can't recommend this book to entrepreneurs I counsel, or to anyone else.</span>
