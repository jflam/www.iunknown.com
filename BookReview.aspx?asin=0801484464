                    <span>This is another labor community insider book directed toward labor union leaders and their strategists and written by the same. The motivation is the reversal of the sagging fortunes of labor unions.     Many of the  articles focus on the need for grassroots activity by existing union  members and community supporters. Several union campaigns utilizing members  are examined in detail. Union support organizations such as the Garment  Women Justice Center are described. Serveral articles examine subtleties of  the motivations of non-unionists to vote for a union. An interesting  observation is that white collar and technical workers are turned off by  the potential for conflict when joining a union, which is interesting in  light of the fact that unions have always relied on confrontation as their  tool of last resort.     The main point of the editors is that union  tactics and actions make a large difference in organizing success. The  second point is that unions must remake themselves into organizing bodies  and avail themselves of the wisdom contained in these articles.     But for  non-union insiders reading this book, many chinks appear when looking at  the articles in totality. For example, one article shows that belonging to  two community organiztions lowers the desire to join a union, yet many  articles tout labor-community coalitions. In one case where community  connections were leveraged to the fullest to win a union contract, it is  admitted that may have been a one-time occurrence.     A large and  confusing point that leaps out from these articles is, just what is a  union. Is it a centralized business that collects fees from subsidiaries,  demands adherence to policies from the CEO, and provides services? Or is a  union a legally recognized association of workers at a locale that  affiliates with a national body but retains sovereignty? Statements that  workers "are" the union hide more than they reveal. If workers  are the union, can they insist that national unions remain committed to a  servicing model? If workers are the union, how can some national unions  literally require local unions to focus on recruitment? Claiming that  workers are the union can be a demotivator for joining a union. After all,  it is workers who have unsuccessfully dealt with employers on their own  that want to join unions; now they want support, not abandonment.     The  editors and authors may complain that this book is not about "what is  a union," but is only about subtle strategy. If so, they need to put a  "Nonunionists need not read" label on the cover. Actually the  book is worth reading by all interested in the situation of labor not only  on its educational merits but also for the questions that it can engender  for non-insiders. Who knows, maybe their next book can be "What is a  Union."</span>
