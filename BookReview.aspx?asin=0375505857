                    <span>It takes a good tour guide to show us a way through the dense jungle of the modern economy. What did the Southeast Asian currency crisis have to do with the USA? Why did Russian economic policy hurt Argentinean citizens? How exactly does one go about becoming a cabinet officer for the President? Robert Rubin is a knowledgable, humble tour guide par excellence. We here at History House wonder where America's economy might be in 2004 with someone of conscience and real intelligence at the helm rather than the band of thieves we got instead. Rubin's autobiography is notable for these reasons, and also because it is one of those good works which conveys important life lessons on how to get ahead, secrets of leadership, and just what's going on in our government.</span>

                    <span>After reading this book you will appreciate the yawning chasm that exists between the rational way economic policy was made in the Clinton years and the ideological way it is made today.  You will yearn for a Treasury Secretary who understands capital and international currency markets.  
<br />Rubin first gives a Treasury Secretary's eye view of the Mexican debt crisis, then pulls back to describe how he developed professionally to become one of two co-managing partners of arguably the best managed Wall Street firm (Goldman Sachs) before joining Clinton's economic team.  Mr. Rubin gives a sober assessment of the role of capital markets in national and international economic policy.  Only someone with his background and knowledge could pick up the phone and query a Wall Street trader on the possible repercussions of letting Mexico or Southeast Asia or Long Term Capital fail, assess the intricate interrelationships between the US and other economies, the International Monetary Fund, etc. then make the right judgment call (albeit a calculated risk) on how to respond.
<br />This book is written with modesty, intelligence and just enough personal history to let you know who Robert Rubin really is.  It is perhaps Rubin's complete lack of hubris that enables him to appreciate and understand his colleagues' points of view, sort fact from fiction (or ideology) and reach a decision that fits the situation.  It gives a sobering insight into what it takes to make good economic policy.  
<br />Try to imagine Paul O'Neill or John Snow making the same sober, informed judgment in the current ideologically driven administration - I can't. A must read for anyone who has (or wants to have) an opinion about economic policy since the millennium.

                    <span>A fascinating book.  Bob Rubin is a fiscal veteran who has been nice enough to compile his experience and perspectives into one of the best political/financial handbooks.  Anyone who frowns upon the concept of free trade will have second thoughts after reading Bob Rubin's common sense reasoing as to why it is important.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to comprehend the perils of the Mexio Crisis when our former Secretary of Treasury explains it.  He glibly reasons the essential American measures that were vital to the resolution of it.  After all, under his tenure, Mexico was able to absolve itself of its debt, which in turned saved the professional lives of scores of American workers.  Remember how well the economy faired under this man's guidance, and remember how it floundered when the administration he was part of retired from the Oval Office.  You need not have access to an adavanced calculator to do the math.  If you want to appreciate how to nurture a volatile market to a healthy one, this book belongs in your library.</span>

                    <span>Robert Rubin was a power player (maybe *the* power player) in the Clinton Administration for six and a half years, first as head of the NEC, then as Secretary of the Treasury.  Rubin's style is dry, understated, and self-deprecating, and that comes across in the book.  In fact, I bought "In an Uncertain World" at the same time as Monica Langley's profile of Sandy Weill ("Tearing Down the Walls") and they are about as unlike as two books can be (given that that Langely's book reflects the rollicking life and outsized ego of Weill...and I mean that in a complimentary way).
<br />
<br />Frankly, Rubin's work is a tough cover-to-cover read for someone not juiced up about learning all the workout details of, for example, stanching the Asian financial contagion, circa 1998.  But, I will say that two chapters - "Political Education" and "A White House Life" ought to be required reading for anyone about to accept an Administration post.  It's a primer on inquisitive learning and subtle use of power.  It also reflects highly on Bill Clinton's stewardship of the economy.  Rubin has great insight on the traits that made Clinton so effective...and, at other times, so maddening.
<br />
<br />I say Rubin is self-deprecating.  Here's why: he spends a lot of time downplaying his influence on the President.  In essence, he's reporting "Hey, Clinton is a smart guy and realized that good (economic) policy is good politics."  But, if you've read Bob Reich's contemporaneous account (the far more inviting "Locked in the Cabinet"), you know that from other perspectives around the Administration's main table, Rubin's impact was enormous.  Reich all but accuses him of subverting Clinton's 'true' (from Reich's viewpoint) agenda: a panolopy of progressive program visions Reich says he and Clinton had developed and shared since their days at Oxford.  The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle (after all, Reich wrote from the perspective of a quasi-jilted lover).  Juxtaposing these two accounts is an interesting exercise. </span>

                    <span>I can sit here and easily say this is the best book I've ever read. A truly masterful insight on how world changing decisions are made at the top and how politics fits in to the debate.  What's more Rubin's writing style is nothing short of spectacular, and that's saying a lot in the world of politics where LawyerSpeak is sometimes the language of choice.  Go Hillary!</span>
