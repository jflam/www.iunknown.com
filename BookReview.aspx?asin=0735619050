                    <span>No one could learn rocket science in a Dummies book. And no one will learn all there is to know about VB.net in this one book. But it is a very confrontable, easy to understand (even the math!) step by step approach to getting your feet wet in VB.net. I've never coded in any language, though I do design software for other coders to code. This book is wonderful and amazing. I now know I've been missing all the fun by not coding myself. I enthusiastically work on the exercises and lessons each day, I make sure I understand each thing before going on to the next...I feel like a kid with a new toy. Once I have these basic understandings and I am armed with the wonder of seeing a program work and make my computer do what it says... I will continue to learn and grow with other resources here at Amazon. And by the way... I didn't buy the book here, I didn't think I could wait the 2 days or so, but I paid about $10 more at my local franchise bookstore. Amazon rocks, there's no doubt about it.
<br />
<br />Don't let hard nose coders (no offense) dissuade you from getting this book. Halvorson is a very good, clear writer, a born teacher, with an easy to take "author" voice that sometimes feels like he is right there. You'll feel in good hands....

                    <span>This was the first book on VB.NET I purchased for self-study. As a starting point, this gets you started with building a few simple programs to demonstrate what you can do with .NET. It is sort of like a 100 mile wide and 1 inch deep introduction for you to explore all of what you might want to do with VB.NET, including building simple Windows Forms, ASP Web Pages, and data-driven Forms. The Visual Studio (VS.NET) is given a good look over as well, so you should by the end of the book be able to get around in the studio fairly well, build some simple programs, and even create your own install programs.
<br />
<br />Don't expect that by the end of the book you will be able to start building complex, object-oriented solutions or even really gain an understanding of Object-oriented programming methods: for that you will need to invest in some other books.
<br />
<br />VB.NET is a much larger and much more complex subject that will extend your study beyond the simplistic examples given in this book, but you will find it an enjoyable introduction.

                    <span>Although for the average novice this book seems like a good one. It is not. It is just encouraging the programming perception of the novice programmer.
<br />It doesn't go into detail of real .NET programming and is really focused on showing off simple things that any novice could have worked out in a few hours.
<br />Visual Basic 6 programmers shouldn't read this book it will make you think VB.NET is the same thing. But in fact it is nothing like VB 6. The author decides to not discuss the what the importance of object oriented programming is.
<br />He also decides to hide some of the most important information of the .NET framework and the Visual Basic.NET language from the novice who wouldn't know anything about .NET or Visual Basic.NET. Nearly everything in this book could be accomplished in Visual Basic 4-6. And everything within it is very easy to learn and the novice programmer would feel like he is repeating himself.
<br />And for all the people who are saying that this is a good book. You are wrong. This book has got nothing to do with .NET! If you expect to be a proffessional after learning this book you are gonna have one bad career if you don't pickup now and get the basics of Object Oriented Programming and the .NET framework into your head. If you look up on any proper coding site you will know that the code in this book is nothing like real life code for real life situations and I can't believe Microsoft published this.
<br />That review comes from 13 year old as well! And believe me I know a some real life developers who have to employ people and have to be irratated by this kind of stuff each and every day.
<br />It's code that teaches people how to not get a job. Or how to make your open source programs not be downloaded.</span>

                    <span>This book is listed first when you search for it, but it is an old issue and out of print. Amazon wants 2 weeks to find this old edition for you. Look for a later edition of the same book further down the list. It usually ships in 1 day. Amazon should eliminate this problem by notifying customers that a later edition of a particular book exists.</span>
