                <span id="Label1">Jesse Liberty, author of the best-selling books <i>Programming C#</i> and <i>Programming ASP.NET</i>, has written an entry-level guide to C#.  Written in a warm and friendly manner, this book assumes no prior programming experience, and provides an easy introduction to Microsoft's premier .NET language.  <i>Learning C#</i> is a complete introduction to C# and object-oriented programming. <i>Learning C#</i> will help you build a solid foundation in .NET, and show how to apply your skills by using dozens of tested examples. After introducing Visual Studio .NET, you'll learn about the syntax and structure of the C# language, including operators, classes and interfaces, structs, arrays, and strings.  Liberty then demonstrates how to develop various kinds of applications--including those that work with databases--and web services.  Whether you have a little object-oriented programming experience or you are new to programming altogether, Learning C# will set you firmly on your way to mastering the essentials of the C# language.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book and I think it is a good starting point for learning the language. Some of the other reviews say "it didn't cover this" and "it didn't cover that", but I think the book accomplishes the task. It teaches a beginner the basics of the language. It's not going to teach everything about programming in C#, it just starts you on the path. I thought it was very readable and the author explains concepts very well. This book was so interesting that I want to learn more about the language. The next book I read will definitely be "Programming C#" by the same author. If you are a seasoned programmer and want to learn advanced topics, this is not the book for you. If you are new to programming and want a good start, I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Jesse Liberty has written an excellent introduction to C# entitled, "Programming C#". That book required some background in an object oriented language such as Java or C++ to get the most out of it. This book is geared for the less experienced developer. "Learning C#" covers basically the first half of "Programming C#" in about 50% more pages. A person without a background in OO will find this book much easier to follow. The book covers the language a little slower, gives more hand holding, and even gives an introduction to Visual Studio. Of course, none of the advanced topics in "Programming C#" (ASP.NET, ADO.NET, Web Services, etc.) are found in this book. The author has a nice style of writing that makes the topics easy to follow. His examples are clear and there are plenty of them. All the basic C# topics are covered including control structures, enums, structs, delegates, operator overloading, polymorphism, interfaces, and collections. The topics covered demonstrate the main features of OO languages without being overwhelming. However, the book is not a complete introduction to C#. Some topics are left out (I/O for example). But overall, the book is a good introduction for the novice object-oriented programmer. If you already have some OO experience then you will probably want to get "Programming C#". If object oriented programming (or just programming in general) is new to you then this would be a good place to start.</span>

                    <span>This is a good introduction to C# but you can't depend only on 1 book. You can read Programming C# it's a good book too. I read some articles for an author called Michael Youssef in www.c-sharpcorner.com he's a great author and write in a very simple way that you can 100% grasp I hope that he publish his book soon.</span>

                    <span>Focuses on basic language syntax in a very slow, very wordy way. Those fairly new to programming will appreciate this, such as the guy in accounting who has written some Office macros, the web designer who writes simple javascript blocks, or the QA tester who aims to become a QA engineer or developer. The back cover description is misleading because it mentions being for "experienced programmers who are new to object-oriented programming," whatever that means. Any truly experienced programmer, coming from VB6 or C or Fortran etc, will be skimming and skipping A LOT to get over the many paragraphs of hand-holding.<P>I can only see this book being really valuable for novices, and those "experienced programmers" who have only been doing scripting in the past. Note that there are *much* better books for going from VB6 to C#.<P>And despite the subtitle, there is very little coverage of object-oriented programming in this book. The basics are scratched for about 4 pages of chapter 3 -- but this is of little value, especially since classes are not introduced until chapter 8.</span>

                    <span>This book is definetely for programmers new to c# or even for beginners. Jesse Liberty explains with real world examples the concepts. Best part is he has kept the book concise such that you can easily read everything and practically apply all the examples and finish everything in a months time. I only found Destroying Constructors and Delegates, Events chapter to be a bit more difficult but on the whole the book is a treat. I have already bought his book Programming C# third edition also for adavanced programming. Best part I forgot to say is that Jesse personally answers to all your queries which is really handful. I sincerely reccommend this book.<P>Regards<BR>Nitin</span>
