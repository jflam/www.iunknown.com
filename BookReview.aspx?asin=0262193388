                <span id="Label1">This new edition of The Art of Prolog contains a number of important changes. Most background sections at the end of each chapter have been updated to take account of important recent research results, the references have been greatly expanded, and more advanced exercises have been added which have been used successfully in teaching the course. Part II, The Prolog Language, has been modified to be compatible with the new Prolog standard, and the chapter on program development has been significantly altered: the predicates defined have been moved to more appropriate chapters, the section on efficiency has been moved to the considerably expanded chapter on cuts and negation, and a new section has been added on stepwise enhancement -- a systematic way of constructing Prolog programs developed by Leon Sterling. All but one of the chapters in Part III, Advanced Prolog Programming Techniques, have been substantially changed, with some major rearrangements. A new chapter on interpreters describes a rule language and interpreter for expert systems, which better illustrates how Prolog should be used to construct expert systems. The chapter on program transformation is completely new and the chapter on logic grammars adds new material for recognizing simple languages, showing how grammars apply to more computer science examples.</span>

                    <span>This, to me, is one of the 4 best books on computer programming. Unfortunately, it is hard. Not because the book is poorly written - it is like a wonderful story, but because understanding how to think declaratively after being taught something like C or Java is like someone giving you a pair of wings when you're a mudfish.
<br />
<br />Thinking declaratively changes how you think about problems and how you write code. It's a career changing experience. This book leads the way.
<br />
<br />Top 4:
<br />* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Sussman, Abelson)
<br />* The Art of Prolog by Sterling/Shapiro
<br />* Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, etc.
<br />* Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming by Van Roy and Haridi</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for anyone starting to program in Prolog or interested in logic programming.<p>A downsize of the book (if any) can be that it could have detailed more in the respect of Prolog's applications. The pleasant style of the authors would have made a wonderful introduction into these fields.<p>A real pleasure to read.</span>

                    <span>If you have previous programming experience, Prolog will be quite a challenge. Logic programming is very different  from functional or imperative, and will definitely be a major culture shock.<p>The first part of the book introduces the concepts of logic programming at the right pace, giving you time to assimilate everything.  The second part contains several applications of Prolog.<p>This is a great first book on Prolog and will certainly help you `getting it'.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for the cover (it's good enough to keep on a coffee table), and stayed for the code.  My favorite part of the book is Part II, where the Prolog language is described.  I learned Prolog from the Clocksin  and Mellish book, but never really "got it" until I went through  The Art of Prolog.</span>
