                <span id="Label1">With nearly 20 albums, two Grammys, two Cable ACE awards, and more HBO specials sunder his belt than anyone else, George Carlin is more popular than ever.  Now, for the first time, Carlin has prduced a book of original humor pieces, <B>Brain Droppings</B>.  Filled with thoughts, musings, questions, lists, beliefs, curiousities, monologues, assertions, assumptions, and other verbal ordeals, <B>Brian Droppings</B> is infectiously funny.  Also included are two timeless bonus items from the past, "A Place for Your Stuff" and "Baseball-Football." <P> Readers will get an inside look into Carlin's mind, and they won't be disappointed by what they find: <P> <I>* I buy stamps by mail.  It works OK until I run out of stamps.<BR> * What year did Jesus Christ think it was?<BR> * A tree: first you chop it down, then you chop it up.<BR> * Have you ever noticed the lawyer is always smiling more than the client?<BR> * I put a dollar in one of those change machines.  Nothing changed.<BR> * If you ever have chicken at lunch and chicken at dinner, do you ever wonder if the two chickens knew each other?<BR></I></span>

                    <span>Well, I love GC and all his works. He was dubbed the thinking man's comedian by the national press club. For those who say he is to vulgar and obscene, this aint 1700 anymore. Adapt to the century you are living in. And after being through hell with various diseases and illnesses, i still find him up lifting. The best way to view this book is from the aiethiestic point of view. IF you have a really conservative and religous background then don't read you will just be offended. And what he says in short takes are idel thoughts and have no meaning.NEVER TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY! I noticed all the bad reviews came from people wwho took it waay to seriously. Im middle class and i really don't care.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading Brain Droppings after a friend recommended it to me. I must admit I started crying because I was laughing so hard. I absolutely love the way the book is layed out. It is fun and easy to read. I don't personally get what all the uproar is about. He really does challenge us while at the same time making us laugh. A rare combination.

                    <span>This is a great book. George may have what some people consider a 'warped' view of the world, but in my opinion he is right on the money. He really makes me think about how F-ed up most of the people in this world really are. I really like his statement (I can't remember if it is in this book or from his stand-up) "If you believe in God you are good, but if you believe in UFOs you are a Kook. Even though there is more evidence of UFOs than there is of a God." Well it goes something like that. I can't remember the exact quote!!!..... Sorry :(</span>

                    <span>This book is real fun to read, at worst it's clever at best it's genius. I read 120 pages the day it came, to give you an idea of the entertainment value of the book. Carlin is a great comedian, to me the best of all time next to Richard Pryor, and he does a good job on this book. I'll probably start his second book "Napalm and Silly Putty" soon, and his third book "When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops" when it comes out. Have fun with this book, that's what it's for, but it also has many insights and interesting ideas we can all appreciate.</span>
