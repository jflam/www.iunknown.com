                <span id="Label1">Elizabeth Bishop was vehement about her art--a perfectionist who didn't want to be seen as a "woman poet." In 1977, two years before her death she wrote, "art is art and to separate writings, paintings, musical compositions, etc., into two sexes is to emphasize values in them that are <i>not</i> art." She also deeply distrusted the dominant mode of modern poetry, one practiced with such detached passion by her friend Robert Lowell, the confessional.  <p> Bishop was unforgiving of fashion and limited ways of seeing and feeling, but cast an even more trenchant eye on her own work. One wishes this volume were thicker, though the perfections within mark the rightness of her approach. The poems are sublimely controlled, fraught with word play, fierce moral vision (see her caustic ballad on Ezra Pound, "Visits to St. Elizabeths"), and reticence. From the surreal sorrow of the early "Man-Moth" (leaping off from a typo she had come across for "mammoth"), about a lonely monster who rarely emerges from "the pale subways of cement he calls his home," to the beauty of her villanelle "One Art" (with its repeated "the art of losing isn't hard to master"), the poet wittily explores distance and desolation, separation and sorrow.</span>

                    <span>..............Elizabeth Bishop was a poet who sometimes waited years before completing a poem and submitting it for publication. Her perfectionism, when it came to her craft and to choosing just the right word, is evident as you read through each of her poems. They are all here, from her best known "The Fish" to other favorites like " The Man-Moth", "The Armadillo", "Sandpiper", "Sestina" (my favorite for its surreal imagery), "Crusoe In England", "The Moose" and "In the Waiting Room". Bishop's poetry is incredible because of her original metaphors and her amazing ability to describe a scene with remarkable vividness. Her poetry simply takes me to "another place".<P>This collection also includes a number of previously uncollected poems, poems written in Bishop's youth and translations of the work of several poets including Octavio Paz. This collection is truly a treasure of poetry from the greatest American female poet of the last century. I urge anyone with an interest in poetry to pick it up!</span>

                    <span>No matter what sort of poetry you are drawn to--and here I include the Beowulf poet, the Metaphysical poets, the Modernists, etc.--Elizabeth Bishop can't be ignored. Her poems, from set forms like the villanelle "One Art" ("The art of losing isn't hard to master.") to the patchwork of imagery that is "The Fish" are all at the peak of expression. Bishop demonstrates virtuousity in a number of forms of poetry in this (relatively) slim volume. I especially appreciate her poems on travel and Brazil. This is a dead writer whose ideas of culture are still ahead of our time.<P>This book is a treasure trove. It rewards multiple readings. Bishop's craftsmanship has ensured that this book will continue to endure even as bigger names of her era fall by the wayside.</span>

                    <span>Elizabeth Bishop is one of the greatest American poets we've ever had--only Frost and perhaps maybe Whitman are more important. She is certainly Emily Dickinson's equal, and in my opinion, a finer poet. When discussing American poetry, Bishop can't be ignored. Her imagery, her use of form, her command over the language is rarely matched, and this collection contains all her work. There's her first book, _North & South_, which is one of the finest volumes of poetry produced. You'll find poems like "The Map," "The Man-Moth," "The Weed," "The Imaginary Iceberg," "Seascape," and the masterful poem, "The Fish." _A Cold Spring_ follows, containing "At the Fishhouse" and "Letter to N.Y." "The Armadillo" (Bishop's poem to Robert Lowell), "Filling Station," "Visits to St. Elizabeths" and "Sestina" (one of the few poems in this form that actually works) follows in _Questions of Travel_. Then there is a selection of uncollected work (1969) before we hit _Geography III_ which contains two of her best poems, "Cruso in England" and "One Art"--which is in my opinion her best poem. The collection rounds out with some more uncollected poems, juvenalia, and some fine translations. Overall, you have an important book by one of our most important poets.</span>

                    <span>Elizabeth Bishop's use of structure (especially the villanelle) blows me away. This is a satisfying collection of poems because they're all there, and it's fairly easy to randomly thumb your finger through and stop on a poem that you don't know, but will enjoy. Though I know that it wasn't the goal of this book, I personally wish I could have found out more about her biography. A nice present to give to people who are a fan of "One Art" but who haven't read anything else by her.</span>

                    <span>Gosh, it is hard to sum up one's feelings about the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop. She is one of those artists, like Shakespeare and Mozart and Cervantes, whose work contains such perfection it seems almost sacrilegious to comment upon it.<P>And she was ALWAYS a good poet. This volume proves it by publishing much of her juvenilia alongside more mature, better known poems as the wonderful "Florida", "Sestina", and the majestic "The Fish", a poem I enjoy teaching to my students every semester as a supreme example of imagery (I defy them to find instances of abstract language in the poem; there aren't many). Also included is an astonishing series of translations Bishop rendered over the years, mostly of South American poets, including Octavio Paz.<P>All in all, this is a treasure trove, a book for the ages, and a reminder of what we lost with Bishop's early death at age 68.</span>
