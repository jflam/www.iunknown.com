                <span id="Label1"><i>Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters: What I Leaned in Ten Years As a Microsoft Programmer</i> is a reflection on a decade spent working at the country&#194;&#146;s largest software company. The book views Microsoft from a unique angle: that of an insider who feels that Microsoft has done many good things, but is also unsure about some of its methods. The book offers a new viewpoint on Microsoft, challenging existing assumptions about why the company has succeeded, what it does well and what it does badly, and what it needs to do in the future.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a great "trip down memory lane" in regards to the birth of the PC and Microsoft.  Adam does a great job of providing history and context of the era.
<br />
<br />Although the text was long and often would stray from the intended topic, the extra info was pertinent and interesting.
<br />
<br />This was a great read for someone who grew up with the PC and Microsoft.</span>

                    <span>Adam Barr writes well. I found myself agreeing with several of his analyses: esp. his dissection of MSFT's evangelistic activities and his keen understanding of the api-itis that afflicts MSFT products today. <p>The book is in four parts. The first is a look at MSFT hiring and interview processes, which is followed by a description of his time at Softimage (which includes a brilliant dissection of type-1 through type-4 demos), then a long and meandering recounting of his early involvement with computers and then an equally meandering final part which is a compilation of his observations about MSFT and the industry in general. I found the first two interesting enough to read, but found the final two not as compelling. He completely mis-understands the point about middleware and Java (see Lou Gerstner's book "Who said elephants can't dance?" for a different definition of middleware and business strategy). Perhaps his narrow, unappealing and unfocussed second half meanders so much because he didn't take his chances to widen his own career within MSFT as a manager or PM.<p>Like Adam with his interviewees, I agonized over whether or not I should give this book a "four" or a "three" star rating :). Ultimately, I had to go with the lower rating because as a developer, I was hoping to read about what "he" had actually "learnt as a developer" when I picked up the book. Unfortunately, while he talks about a whole lot of things (such as the importance of testing for product quality, and the importance of programmers getting a 'life' as they mature, the contributions of MSFT to the open source movement, etc. etc.) he doesn't at all talk about what he worked on, what was exciting and new about NT code he may have contributed to, or how methodologies and practices changed while he was there. Maybe MSFT prevents people from talking about such stuff, but by cutting out such professionally interesting bits, the book becomes a "missed opportunity" (esp. since Adam is a self described "systems guy").    Perhaps he really was writing only for the non-programmer crowd (but I doubt it).</span>

                    <span>don't bother buying this book.<p>For me, it was a bummer, too much ado about hiring practices, and the author does not escape his bias after having worked for Microsoft 10 years.<p>There are too many inaccuracies, like Microsoft has won the database wars, Microsoft has won the networking wars, Windows NT is  "clearly superior to Linux", etc, etc.....</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed the early pages of the book, highlighting the  workings of Microsoft, but felt the author could have provided more insight into what it was like working with his team and working for B.Gates.  I thought the book ended strangely.  I read it cover to cover in less than 24 hrs.</span>

                    <span>This book really answers some great questions for those interested in learning more about Microsoft.  <p>First hand accounts of intereviewing and recruiting.  <br>Working for MS in hell like projects.<br>History of computers and how it relates to MS.<br>Open Source Development vs. MS.<br>Answering why people hate MS so much.<p>Take the chapters you want, unless you could enjoy them all.  I found the book intensly amusing at the beginning during the interviewing and recruiting.  It sorely frustrating during the work in Canada (All the hangups and ... that happened).  Brief, but well described history of computing (other book).  But by far the debate between Open Source Development and Microsoft Development was great.<p>If you are interested at all in the computer industry this is a must read.  Regardless if you fancy yourself as a OSDN vs Closed Source Developer, Start-Up vs. Large Biz.  It is important to know your enemies or allies. This has fueled me with lots of information in understanding more about the whole view of the Computer Arena.</span>
