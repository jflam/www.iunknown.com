                    <span>I first came across these books traveling to Europe and I own almost 20 of these guides. I will be going to Singapore this year so I bought the DK guide, naturally! <P>The photos are in bright stunning color and leap from the pages. There are history time lines, references to historical and political development, architecture, museums, maps, culture, restaurants, places to stay. Very complete. Just a great book. <P>Let me elaborate a little bit. There are a number of other travel books - and some guides are mainly just text. I like some photographs and color. A picture is worth 1000 words. The visuals are just stunning in the DK books. This book about Singapore is no exception. Like all other DK books it has maps, and drawings, and numerous stunning photos of art, architecture, city scenes, etc. This book also has a section unique to Singapore - it has a special section on foods with many dishes all (again) in wonderful color photographs. Just an excellent job.<P>Highly recommend and makes for a good souvenir.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>Seduced as I am by the highly glossy, supremely compact and wonderfuly illustrated DK Eyewitness Travel Guides, I suppose I am somewhat biased as a reviewer. The combination of succinct text, numerous useful details, spectacular photographs, eyecatching 3-D graphical images, and user-friendly maps make the Eyewitness Travel Guides uniquely useful, distinctive and even collectable. The new Singapore book is no exception to these considerations, so much so, I wish I had it my disposal when I visited there last year, if only for the invaluable details it provides. Now shortly before leaving for Singapore once again, I have recently acquired this book, and it has whetted my appetite, by reminding me of the places, the colors, the smells, the greenery, the heat, and the vibrancy I had already experienced. It has also made it quite clear, exactly how much I missed last time, particularly in terms of wildlife reserves, museums, and galleries. The book contains a brief, but informative overview of the history and multi-cultural nature of this exciting island country. As with other titles in the series, the guide enables the user-traveler to gain maximum benefit from his or her visit, by highlighting THE places to visit, and what to expect from these experiences. If I have any criticisms of this, and indeed with many other Eyewitness Travel Guides, it is a shade small, with tiny text font, and it is a tad too short for my liking. But I guess they have to fit comfortably into your pocket, and, in any case, you cannot have too much of a good thing, otherwise you may just stay at home and gloat over the marvellous pictures.</span>
