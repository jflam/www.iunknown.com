                    <span>Ambrose's strength lies in his ability to make history approachable for almost everyone.  While this is certainly not the most exhaustive book written about Crazy Horse, Custer, or Little Bighorn I would wager that it the most enjoyable.  It's a great read, but those searching for the most minute details regarding the actors involved would be well advised to look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>How much do you know about "Custer's last stand"? Crazy Horse?
<br />Until I read this book recently, I had little in depth  knowledge of either man. Stephen Ambrose is one of my favorite authors, and I want to read all his works. I finally settled down to read this American history book which is well researched, easy to read;, and thoroughly riveting throughout.
<br />
<br />George Armstrong Custer - his life and service in the Civil War, and later in Indian wars as the west opened up to make way for trains, telegraph, and settlers - what a character he was. Crazy Horse, a courageous Indian who rebelled and took revenge on the white man, and the sad sad history of our government and the breaking of treaties with the native peoples. Also - names and habits of various Indian tribes and how they differed, what they ate, their habits and their attitudes toward the white man.
<br />
<br />The author gives us a glimpse of what the American west looked liked when the Indians and buffalo were free.  Every page is carefully written in a "fair and balanced" manner. I greatly enjoyed reading it from cover to cover and have a much better understanding of America and the westward expeditions in the 1800's.
<br />
<br />Reading James Michener's great book "Centennial" a few years ago, may have prepared me and helped me to process the information in this interesting and factual book.  I recommend it. There are many surprises and plenty of action.</span>

                    <span>In Crazy Horse and Custer the Parallel Lives Of Two American Warriors, Ambrose does a very good job of telling the life stories of the two warriors.  He also makes this book very readable. He does not just state the information he really tells the story of the two men.<br>	It starts on the plains of Nebraska.  Ambrose writes about the Native American lifestyle and you can begin to see why our culture and theirs clashed so much.  Then he talks of the culture in the United States during the 1800's.  After that Ambrose begins to tell of the two warriors during their childhood, and then each of their separate journeys to manhood.  <br>	Ambrose keeps the readers interested throughout the whole book by going into great and gruesome details about the battles that each Crazy Horse and Custer had been involved in.  The climax of the book was the Battle for Little Big Horn.  I just could not put down the book he started out describing the battle by stating the mistakes that Custer had made, such as underestimating the power of the Native American forces.  Then Amborse explains where Custer was and where Crazy Horse was and how Custer was caught on his flank by Crazy Horse.  This book really made the history of Crazy Horse and Custer come alive.</span>

                    <span>Very interersting book about the blind luck that Custer had in life that failed him in the end. Interesting points about the life style of Native Americans. Well written like all of Ambrose's books.</span>

                    <span>The story of Crazy Horse and Custer is the story of two men, two societies and two ways of life. The story of the Sioux and those who tried to destroy them. <br>And when Ambrose tells the story you really get the feeling that this is all about us today. How we became who we are.<p>  When Custer looked on a virgin forest, he envisioned sawmills, houses being build etc. Custer believed in progress, in the doctrine that things are going to be better. <br>  Crazy Horse on the other hand saw the trees as they were at that moment. He lived in that moment. For Custer events marched forward, onward and upward. For Crazy Horse things were done because thats the way they had always been done. <br>  Indeed, the European thought that a man should and could improve his station in life would have made little sense to Crazy Horse.<p>  Ambrose lets us know that Custer might have been a buffoon, but he died for the thing called progress, the thing we, whites, also believes in.<br>   Along the way we also get to know Crazy Horse, his love for Black Buffalo Women and his people, the Sioux. And it does seem just that Crazy Horse could outnumber and outmaneuver Custer on what is now Custers hill.<br>   One final indian victory before the end. <p>   An epic story where every little detail Stephen Ambrose tells us just makes us want more. A brilliant book!<p>-Simon</span>
