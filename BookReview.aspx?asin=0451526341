                    <span>This was kind of a reverse 'negative utopia,' for animals. That is to say, here the characters begin their story by creating a real utopia, but in true Orwell fashion, that utopia is slowly destroyed and a darker, crueler world arises. Not nearly as good as 1984, this is never-the-less classic stuff. I can't help but root for the characters in Orwells writing knowing full well that it won't turn out good for them. This, still manages to crush my spirits by books end.

                    <span>Orwell draws an incredible picture of what happens to a society when governors embark on an uthopy, such as a totalitarian project. He does so using animals instead of real people as characters. "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others". I think this sentece is a good summary and everybody should remember it.</span>

                    <span> Orwell's allegory regarding the Soviet Regime certainly is perfect; and such perfectionism was hard to publish at the time, as this book was initially declined by four publishers-a fact Orwell persistently emphasized: the ignorant justification and biased publications for the Soviet Regime; simply put, the British Press moguls were generally hesitant to carry out anything against the USSR lest it might offend their ally, or, the expediency of the political situation (then). One letter revealing this fact was from T.S Eliot, who as a spokesman for Faber & Faber wrote: `we have no conviction that this is the right point of view from which to criticize the political situation at the present time.' 
<br /> But apart from all that he did manage to get it published, and when it did, it was a huge success. The simple tale wraps around a group of animals who rebel and success in driving away their proprietor, Mr. Jones. Hardship and Tyranny ensue, making the animals wonder whether they are any different now than the earlier days when they were under the influence of Mr. Jones. The pigs become power obsessed; one is an eloquent speaker named Squealer, another named Snowball and the main character of the story Napoleon (Stalin). Later Napoleon devices falsified accusations which lead to many executions, apart from driving away his counterpart Snowball (Trotsky) out of pure greed for a centralized, totalitarian system. By way of Squealer (whose rhetoric is known to `turn black into white') Napoleon manages to con the animals into various false convictions, some of which never did at any time exist.
<br /> So and so, Orwell has allegorized the many treacheries behind the USSR via a simple story...simplicity of a complex political topic is the point of success here.

                    <span>Animal farm follows suit with the rest of George Orwell's books, as a book with a good storyline but a gigantic amount of hidden meanings and symbolism. The plot of the story develops quickly which is a must if the book is to grab your attention and pull you in. The book is a quick read which makes it even better because you can finish it in a day or two at most. However the best part of the story has got to be by far actual plot and how the story takes place.
<br />
<br />	The story begins on a farm called Manor farm where animals are put to work as usual, just like on any other farm. Something however is different on this farm, the animals on this farm catch the wind of rebellion and decide to rise up against their masters. Together they run out the owners and workers of the farm and continually repel attacks by their human owners. They rename the farm Animal Farm hints the name of the book and everything is going smoothly. All the animals are fed and are happy except for a select few. The hunger with these few is not of food but of power and they crave it with a passion. Slowly the pigs begin pulling themselves up the power ladder one step at a time being careful not to offend anyone. However these acts go unnoticed so long that eventually the power hungry pigs are the ones with complete control and begin to rule over the animals just like the humans had, and that's how the book closes with the pigs toasting wine to mankind itself.
<br />
<br />	The vast symbolism and intriguing plot are two reasons why Animal Farm is a superb book that is greatly worth your time. You will root for the animals and hate the pigs and love every minute of it. That is why I am rating this book the highest rating five out of five stars for Animal Farm.

<br />Animal Farm definitely deserves a 5/5 rating. It is a wonderfully exciting read that exemplifies totalitarianism in an adult fairy tale. As you get deeper into the book, you discover what can happen when a government (power) corrupts. Not only is this book educational, George Orwell has turned a serious topic into a black comedy, making it an enjoyable (if not sometimes disturbing) read. For the first time in years, I found myself hooked on a fairy tale about talking farm animals. This book also has a lot to teach us. Don't miss the chance to read this!
