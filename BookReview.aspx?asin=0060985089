                    <span>Brenda Maddox' ROSALIND FRANKLIN: THE DARK LADY OF DNA and ROSALIND FRANKLIN AND DNA by Anne Sayre both imply that Rosalind Franklin was the true discoverer of DNA and that James Watson & Francis Crick, with the help of Maurice Wilkins, stole her discovery.
<br />
<br />Rosalind Franklin was no doubt an excellent scientist, a molecular biologist, who, along with Linus Paulding in the US, sought to solve the puzzle of DNA. She was a painstaking researcher, who compiled much of the fundamental data on the subject (in the form of x-ray photos of DNA). Her work provided the crucial information that enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA.
<br />
<br />But the fact remains that, while she had the information, she did not make the discovery. Watson & Crick did. Could she have arrived at their conclusion give more time and more research? Perhaps. But the question is irrelevant. She didn't. They did. Watson & Crick did not "steal" her discovery. They made it on their own - no doubt with the invaluable help of her data. 
<br />
<br />But that is the way scientific discoveries are made. The great breakthroughs are always based on previous inconclusive research and data compiled by other scientists. Such information is the common property of the scientific community, not the private property of individual researchers. Progress is made through the sharing of data, studies and findings. Science progresses not in secret, but through an open system of shared information. 
<br />
<br />The credit for any scientific discovery goes to those who reach the solution first, not to those who work toward the solution or provide the data on which the solution is ultimately based. 
<br />
<br />The fact is that such discoveries are often the result of a combination of painstaking research and illuminating insight. Rosalind Franklin was a painstaking researcher. But it was Watson & Crick who had the brilliant insight.
<br />
<br />I believe that this episode is an example of Thomas Kuhn's theory of the function of paradigms - the framework of existing concepts that dominate any field of human endeavor. The effect of paradigms is to "blind" those who work within the existing conceptual framework to possibilities that become visible to those who work "outside the box," - i.e. outside the paradigm. To work within an existing paradigm is to expect a certain solution and, inevitably, to look for that solution. 
<br />
<br />I believe that this is probably what happened with the discovery of DNA. While Rosalind Franklin was working within the framework of the existing molecular biological paradigm, Watson & Crick stepped outside the box and were able to view the data in a new and different way. This was because neither Watson (a zoologist & bacteriologist) nor Crick (a physicist turned chemist) were molecular biologists and were therefore not trapped in the existing paradigm of molecular biology. This enabled them to see what Franklin and Paulding didn't see. Therefore, it was Watson & Crick who became the discoverers of the structure of DNA and received the credit, and the Nobel Prize they fully deserved.
<br />
<br />To give Rosalind Franklin credit for the research she did and the data she so painstakingly assembled (data which enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery) is a generous thing. But for these authors to imply that they "stole" her discovery is inaccurate. It has far less to do with the pursuit of scientific or historic truth than it does with the pursuit of a feminist agenda.

                    <span>For years Rosalind Franklin has been mistaken as the Joan of Arc of the science world. While Watson and Crick were hailed for discovering the complex double helix of the DNA's shape, Rosalind was left in the background. While the truth of the matter is that Roalind Franklin took the picture and formed the theory of the double helix before Watson and Crick had even begun to formulate thier theories on DNA. Most people look at Rosalind as yet just another example of men steeling the credit form women. For a long time this was what I had been taught to believe.
<br />    The book Rosalind Frinklin: The Dark Lady of DNA by Brenda Maddox is a no-nonsence, straight facts, kind of book about Rosalind's life. When brought into focus this "alarmingly clever" woman was one of the most interesting women I have ever read about in my life. Growing up in a well-to-do family Rosalind basicly had no adversity to overcome except that of her gender, and yet that was a heavy yolk to bear. Most scientists during the time were male and they disliked the idea of a woman comming into a man's matters. Women were not thought of as especially intellegent back then and were meant to stay in thier place. Rosalind struggled though it all to make a starteling discovery that would later be credited to two male scientists. But the theme of the book does not neccesarily focus on how Rosalind was shunned from the high-school chemisry books and nearly fogotten in the scheme of things. It more focuses on Roaslind as a person. An introverted, shy woman, calm and cool but with a temper that would come out in flashes, Maddox paints the picture of Rosalind Franklin with such detail that one cannot help but marvel at Rosalind's strength and passion for all that she did.
<br />   This book is a wonderful interpretation of one of the most shadowy, misinterpretted and almost forgoten people in history. A clear veiw of the dark lady.  </span>

                    <span>As the previous review said, this book does justify Franklin's position in the discovery of DNA. And it does present the story from more than one side. It was well organized, quite engaging and interesting. I could not help admiring Franklin for her high ability and high standard in experiments.
<br />
<br />For those considering choosing science as their career, they can get a glimpse of how it feels doing scientific research. However, they should not use this book as a reference. Although this book depicted the hard side of hard science much more than "The Double Helix", it does not give you the whole picture. The book misses two important ingredients: First, experiments are planned very carefully and meticulously, meticulously and carefully. One can never overestimate the importance of this part.  For me this is hard, but still interesting. Second, the most time consuming, boring, tedious and mistake-prone part is preparation (including setting up instruments, preparing sample, setting up essays, etc), which was attempted to describe in this book, but far from adequate. (For that, I give Franklin my full admiration). If one is to do science, he/she has to have so much passion for science to overcome, or more accurately say, completely ignore or even enjoy this pitfall.
<br />
<br />There are two things that I don't like about this book:
<br />1.	Although this book tries to present the complete story, it is narrated in a defensive tone for Franklin. It could have defended Franklin better if it is in a more objective tone. Just give one example: on why Franklin was denied the credit she should have got, the book admits that Franklin was in bad temper at least at Kings college. The book explains it in a way Watson tries to excuse himself in "The Double Helix". It is understandable that why she could have this bad temper. However, everyone who wants to succeed anywhere should know how important it is to maintain good relationship with colleagues. One can never imagine ordering his/her boss to do or not to do something for any given reason just like what Franklin did. When conflict happens, rarely is only one side to blame.
<br />
<br />2.	When the book describes the Franklin's pre-doctoral years, the narrate of her intellectual development is alternated with that of world war two background, which I think hinder the flow of that part of the book. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a well-researched book of respectable volume divided into three parts. The first one gives a lengthy history of Rosalind, her family, and other generalities (including her love for everything French and a penchant for hiking). The second delves into Franklin's connection to DNA, and the third part focuses on her work after she left the Kings lab to pursue other projects (in viruses especially). 
<br />
<br />Like many other people, I first learnt about Rosalind in Watson's book, "The Double Helix", in which she was horribly caricatured. I chose to read the book because I wanted to know more about this "dark lady" -  and I am happy to say that my thirst was quenched. The author uses a wealth of first-hand material, including Rosalind's many letters to various people. Although Franklin is said to have had a sharp and impatient tongue, the book demonstrates that she was also a good friend and a diligent scientist. She was a hard worker in spite of all the hardships of being a woman (and Jewish) in an arena that was mostly male.
<br />
<br />I really think that the book does justice to Rosalind in highlighting how her work was undervalued and unappreciated. The book summarizes it all when it states that "she had provided all the essential data for those who took the two brilliant leaps of intuition". I would definitely recommend this book if you want to know more about Rosalind Franklin and her connection to DNA.

                    <span>I don't have the scientific background to adequately appreciate everything in this mesmerizing book. I recently had the privilege of meeting a scientist who once worked with Dr. Franklin, and this meeting sparked my interest in learning more about her. It isn't often that one has the opportunity to realize the complexity of personality, and interpersonal relationships, behind scientific discovery. I believe that if more students were encouraged to "get acqainted" with working scientists in a similar fashion, who knows what the next, great discovery might be?</span>
