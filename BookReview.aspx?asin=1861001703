                <span id="Label1">This book examines how and why you should use COM, ActiveX controls and DNA Business Objects, and how these components are linked together to form robust, flexible and scalable applications. A key part of the book is the extended case study in which we produce a distributed events calendar that fits Microsoft's Distributed interNet Applications (DNA) model. This three-tier application uses flexible browser-based controls for the client user interface, business objects on both client and server to process the required information efficiently and Universal Data Access to perform the queries and updates. It depends on the support for component-based development now available for Windows NT server.</span>

                    <span>Good content but poorley explained at times.<br>Usefull for ATL controls as it has usefull information, if only it was better explained with more complete examples then it may have rated a 5. Still I believe it is a usefull book but I would welcome a later edition which gave controls a fuller explanation.</span>

                    <span>I read this book & recalled the Charles Petzold days.  Let me tell you I am not reminiscent of those days.  However, their introduction reminded me of Petzold's Programming Windows 3.0 book.  That's how antiquated I  believe the introduction to be.  The same holds true for the remainder of  the book & its coverage.  The only good thing I can say about this book  is the fact that it mentions classes such as CComBSTR.  When transitioning  from MFC to ATL, MFC die-hards try to make a strong argument in favor of  MFC with CString.  Besides the fact that MFC can be contained in ATL @ the  expense of code dependence & a larger memory footprint, CComBSTR allows  for a counter offensive.  @ any rate, @ one point, the author himself  considers getting back on track so as to avoid having the reader throw the  book away.  I must confess, a short while after, I did just that!  I  believe, your time is better spent elsewhere...</span>

                    <span>The main thing that I have against this book is that its is neither "Professional" nor "Beginning" book. Authors spend a lot of time talking about things that should be familiar if not obvious for  professional COM programmer, but fail to spend enough time on subjects that  really matter like ATL. Although they stated that no prior knowledge of ATL  or COM is required, if this is a case you probably won't understand the  book at all. Good example is OLE DB chapter: talking a lot about relational  database theory, ODBC, OLE DB but not enough about ATL database access  templates. It's a typical bloated book teaching you how to repeat the  project that authors did and nothing else. If you have some COM experience  this book is a waste of time (you won't learn ATL from it - at least not as  much as you would like). If you are new to COM you won't use it either, as  it will not explain COM or ATL enough for you to understand.</span>
