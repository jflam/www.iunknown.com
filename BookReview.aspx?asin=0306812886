                    <span>The collaborative work of Burton B. Turkus (who was the Assistant District Attorney of Kings County, Brooklyn during the original Murder, Inc. investigations) and veteran journalist Sid Feder, Murder, Inc.: The Story Of The Syndicate is the factual chronicle and history of an infamous and feared American criminal organization that prospered in the 1930's and 40's, making their mark in American criminal history for their efficient and utterly ruthless means of eliminating rivals and enemies; controlling and corrupting local, state, and federal officials; and for resisting prosecution by the law until one of their members (Abe "Kid Twist" Reles, known for his habit of strangulation) turned state's evidence and exposed to public view a secret and lethal criminal organization with national implications. A chilling, thoroughly researched presentation, Murder, Inc. is a strongly recommended contribution to American Organized Crime supplemental reading lists.</span>

                    <span>I found it extremely draggy. The author would use 3 or 4 adjectives when only one would suffice. I found it hard to keep my attention on the book while reading it. Also, it read more like a fiction novel than a true crime book. However, because of the subject matter, it was still a good enough read. very informative to say the least.</span>

                    <span>"Murder Inc." was written by a former Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, New York-Burton Turkus.  In the years just preceding WW2, Mr. Turkus successfully prosecuted several members of the national crime organization he terms the Syndicate. Seven went to the electric chair at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, New York. The author believed that the Mafia, as we now know the term, did not then exist. There are both weak and strong points to MI. Weak points include the author's breezy style, with which this reviewer was initially uncomfortable. At the outset, Turkus wrote as if his readers were as knowledgeable of the subject as he. I found it difficult to keep up with the both the story and the cast of characters. These are not the Gottis, Colombos, Gallos or Gambinos of a more current era.  These guys are of the 1930s and early 40s and comparatively unknown-especially to non native New Yorkers. They are not even all Italian. We are introduced to Harry Strauss ("Pittsburgh Phil"), Louis Buchalter ("Lepke"), and Abe Reles ("Kid Twist"). I will save the infamous-and embarrassing! - tale of the Kid's demise for those who buy the book. We are introduced to Italian criminals as well: Albert Anastasia (the boss of the waterfront), the notoriously powerful Frank Costello ("The Ambassador") and the cover boy Joey Adonis, who even the author respectfully calls "Mister A". Midway through the text, this reviewer felt a shift! MI got stronger! Perhaps I warmed up to Turkus' style. Perhaps an anonymous editor took charge of the text. Perhaps I became used to the characters-and "characters" they are! I loved the painstaking recounting of various rubouts. These guys planned! I appreciated the savvy courtroom tactics needed to convict the accused mobsters, all defended by top-notch counsel.  Turkus explains the delicacy of using information provided by informants, the ever- present danger of a mistrial or reversal of a conviction on appeal. Like a good professor, he drums into his readers the import of CORROBORATION at trial.  Sadly, he recounts that not all in government, including his one time boss (the future Mayor O' Dwyer!) shared his zeal to bring these criminals to justice.  Significantly, the author goes to lengths to demonstrate that the crimes relived here are decidedly not "victimless". As a suggestion, I might hope that future editions of the reprinted MI carry an epilog explaining what happened to those still standing at the tale's end. I know Mr. Anastasia met his violent demise in 1956-in his favorite barbershop at the old Park Sheraton Hotel on 55th Street and 7th Avenue. Minor point. The end result is a very satisfying story for those who bear down and read it through. Those who claim to like "True Crime" can't go wrong with MI. This is criminality at it truest and rawest!</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for a good near contemporary work on the origin of the modern Mob, this book is probably as close as you'll ever find. There's a lot of uncorroborated gossip here (i.e., the long rumored "Mafia Purge" of 1931, which never happened) but there's also a ton of info here from Abe "Kid Twist" Reles, "the canary who could sing but couldn't fly," as translated by Burton Turkus, the crusading prosecutor who broke the "Murder Inc." case. ...in those pre-Valachi days little was really known of the Mob's organizational structure or that Mafia "families" as we know them today even existed. The average Mafia books of the '50's are bad jokes and largely fictional. On the other hand, the testimony of Abe Reles and other informers in this case not only solved hundreds of murders but also sent Louis "Lepke" Buchalter and other mobsters to the electric chair, while no one ever even went to prison as the direct result of Joe Valachi's highly publicized testimony of two decades later. A lot of the stuff reported here is erroneous but much more is true and it's the best available for its time. Before The Valachi Papers or anything else, read "Murder, Inc."</span>
