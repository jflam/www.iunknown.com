                    <span>I bought this book hoping to learn more about using healing herbs. Rosemary Gladstar did an excellent job with this book and I have learned so many things from it. The recipes that are included throughout this book are awesome. If you are interested in herbal remedies and natural beauty, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>Ok, I am no writer so will just give my little ol opinion. Book is very nice, tons of great information and wonderful pictures. <P>However, it is not a book if you want to learn how to plant a garden, keep a garden or plant herbs etc..This books is mainly full of information of what herbs do, not what I wanted, but still a lovely book..<P>Now I need to find a book that can help me to grow a nice vegie and herb garden without killing everything;o)</span>

                    <span>Rosemary Gladstar's Family Herbal: A Guide to Living Life with Energy, Health, and Vitality, is basically all her small manuals (Home Medicine Chest, Herbs for Beauty, Herbs for Children.. etc..) condensed into one handy volume with added information she doesn't include in her other books. She has been an herbalist for quite some time, and really knows her stuff. She also presents it in an easy to read and understand format while including some information about scientific properties of certain plants. Of course, you can't only have one book on herbalism, you have to cross reference, but this is a good book to add to your collection. It has a lot of good recipes, too.</span>

                    <span>I own many herbal books, but this one stands head and shoulders above all the others. Reading this book is like walking into a house with treasures hidden at every turn. Unlike other herb books I've read, Rosemary explains how using herbs is not just a way of treatment, it is a way of LIFE. She explains how herbs can become a part of your nutrition, medication, beauty routine, garden and home. All her recipes work fabulously well. They have obviously been refined over the years and stood the test of time. Her little life anecdotes which appear scattered throughout the book are delightful, instructive and serve to draw you further into her world. Her resource list at the end of the book is extremely helpful. Thank you, Rosemary, for sharing your world and love of plants with us. I truly hope that this book will be passed down to my kids and their kids and beyond (if it doesn't get too beat up from being in the kitchen all the time!).</span>
