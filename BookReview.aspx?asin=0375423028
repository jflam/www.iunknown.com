                <span id="Label1"><I>Disarming Iraq</I> is an insider's account of the diplomatic and inspection efforts leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Though a bit dry, the book is logically presented and gives an excellent background on the inspections process and the politics surrounding it. Hans Blix, who came out of retirement in 2000 to lead the inspections effort, was often bashed by American politicians and journalists, but he does not use this forum to strike back. Instead, he allows the evidence to do the talking, only occasionally offering his own opinion. Blix stresses that he never trusted Hussein and that inspectors were often misled and stonewalled, but he also points out that they never found any evidence of weapons of mass destruction either. Though Blix welcomes the end of Hussein's brutal dictatorship, his removal was "neither the avowed aim nor the justification given"  for the war&#151;-WMDs were the issue. Therefore, he believes the invasion was unnecessary and possibly counterproductive in the long run and is disappointed that they were not given enough time to complete their task. "Containment had worked," he writes. "It has also become clear that national intelligence organizations and government hawks, but not the inspectors, had been wrong in their assessments."  </p> Blix blames "monumental" intelligence failures on the part of the U.S. and Great Britain for most of these errors. In particular, he questions America's reliance on Iraqi defectors over their own intelligence agencies. He further wonders why the U.S. dismissed nearly all of the inspection agencies' findings over the past decade, in essence depriving themselves of a valuable source of information. He concludes that inspections are a worthwhile and effective method of containing potentially dangerous regimes and he believes that too high a price was paid for the war: "in the compromised legitimacy of the action, in the damaged credibility of the governments pursuing it, and in the diminished authority of the United Nations."  --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>Disarming Iraq by Hans Blix provides some interesting insights into the Iraqi WMD debate from the man in the vortex of that pre-war debate. <P>As one would suspect from a book written by a scientist cum international bureaucrat, the text is somewhat turgid and at times it takes a bit of slogging to get through the text.<P>That being said, the book is pretty interesting. The major thing that strikes one, especially given the post-war realization that WMD's weren't in Iraq, is Blix's pre-war conviction, based more on a gut feeling rather than any special insight, data or analysis, that WMD's probably did exist in some significant concentrations.<P>The other interesting conclusion of the book is Mr. Blix's assertion that the fault for the conflict rests, basically, with Saddam Hussein. Granted, Mr. Blix does have some very pointed, and not very complimentary remarks to make about the positions and actions of Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair. He definitely feels that the inspection process should have been accorded more time to do its work and is pretty critical of some of the timelines the Americans and British placed upon the process. On the other hand, he explicitly points to the fact that the Iraqi regime never, at any time, lived up to either the letter or the spirit of UN resolution 1441. He also agrees that, once the military buildup had reached a critical mass having it simple sit in lace indefinitely was not a viable option for anyone. The 1441 resolution was unanimous, the force was present, the decision to comply or defy rested with Saddam. It was, in effect, says Mr. Blix, Saddam' own obduracy that, in the end, did him in.<P>In the end what Mr. Blix communicates is an overwhelming sense of frustration. He truly believes that, given a reasonable continuation of proximate implied force and sufficient time, the inspection regime would have worked. The fundamental question, which Blix can present but not answer, is whether, in the final analysis, WMD's were the reason or the pretext for the war. If the former, his argument for more time is persuasive. If the latter, it's irrelevant, as any of a slew of other pretexts could have-and would have-- been concocted by the Americans and British to justify invading.<P>I doubt this book will change many minds--those who opposed the war will find fodder for their cause. UN haters will simply see evidence of the anti-US bias they always see at the UN. However, for the objective reader--if there are any out there--this is a uniquely informative read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Every time that Hans Blix, who was in charge of the UN team to disarm Iraq, made a statement to the United Nations Security Council, both hawks and doves found material to support their positions. This book, which tells of his efforts to disarm Iraq from 1991 to 2003, is likely to do the same. <P>The initial impression is twofold: that the intelligence presented to support the war was questionable; and that Mr. Blix was unlikely to lead the aggressive inspections that the American administration claimed were necessary to find Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Soon, however, there is much more of the first and less of the second.<P>To be sure, Mr. Blix is a civil servant and not a politician. As such he tries to avoid getting into political discussions; when he does turn political, he is clearly at his weakest. His various jabs, usually aimed at the American government, and his interjections often distract from the narrative and even invite readers to wonder how much his views have colored his professional work (not much is my take). <P>All the same, Mr. Blix gives a very balanced assessment of the pre-war intelligence. He admits that his gut feeling was that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction. But he argues that there was never any concrete evidence to support that hypothesis; and he goes point-by-point to the various facts claimed by the Americans, British, and his own team to substantiate his position.<P>In all, "Disarming Iraq" is neither an easy read nor burdensome. Much of the information in the book is in the public domain; yet the way that Mr. Blix has brought everything together, alongside with his commentary and perspective, is undoubtedly going to make "Disarming Iraq" an indispensable read on the war in Iraq.</span>

                    <span>For all of the distortion of facts, lying and obfuscation that occurred surrounding the Iraq war Hans Blix, along with Mahomed AlBaradei, were probably the only two central figures to come out of this debate with clean hands. These two men are truly great diplomats and statesmen.<P>This is book contains Blix's account of his experiences leading up to the war. He does so in a style that is unbiased and pluralistic. I suspect in times to come this book will be held as one of the authoritative accounts of the lead up to the war.<P>Without going into the details of this book there is really little else that I can say. Blix's account is a truthful relation of his experiences that he dealt with in a critical and unprejudiced frame of mind. This book is well suited to anyone who is interested in the politics leading up to the war. However informative, it is a bit dry and not the most entertaining read so it would not be appropriate for people who are interested in partisan rhetoric.</span>

                    <span>Issues raised, but not entirely answered are:<P>1. Saddam was given the task of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had no weapons of mass destruction. Was that a fair requirement?<P>2. How proper is it to start a war after giving evidence for its necessity that would not stand up in court?<P>3. Why were certain US government officials so determined to put forward, publicly, weak evidence of weapons of mass destruction, despite warnings from their military and intelligence experts that the interpretation of the evidence was not clear?<P>It is clear to me that these issues will recur in the future. Blix gives a good account of their history in the Iraq situation. I am convinced from it, that the US policy was not the result of intelligence failures but the failure to be intelligent.</span>

                    <span>The war against Iraq divided opinion throughout the world and generated a maelstrom of spin and counterspin. The man at the eye of the storm, and arguably the only key player to emerge from it with his integrity intact, was Hans Blix, head of the UN weapons inspection team. This is Dr. Blix's account of what really happened during the months leading up to the declaration of war in March 2003. In riveting descriptions of his meetings with Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Kofi Annan, he conveys the frustrations, the tensions, the pressure and the drama as the clock ticked toward the fateful hour. In the process, he asks the vital questions about the war: Was it inevitable? Why couldn't the U.S. and UK get the backing of the other member states of the UN Security Council? Did Iraq have weapons of mass destruction? What does the situation in Iraq teach us about the propriety and efficacy of policies of preemptive attack and unilateral action? Free of the agendas of politicians and ideologues, Blix is the plainspoken, measured voice of reason in the cacophony of debate about Iraq. His assessment of what happened is invaluable in trying to understand both what brought us to the present state of affairs and what we can learn as we try to move toward peace and security in the world after Iraq.</span>
