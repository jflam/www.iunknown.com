                    <span>The third in Dr. Stanley's books on people who have made a million dollars. The first book, The Millionaire Next Door was a best seller. This was followed by The Millionaire Mind. During the research for these two books he found that a small but significant percentage of self made millionaires were female. 
<br />
<br />"Female millaires," he reports, "are a different breed. Their similarities and dissimilarities to the male millionaires I've interviewed led me to the conclusion that it is indeed time for millionaire businesswomen of the self made variety to be heard." 
<br />
<br />This book rejects the stereotypes and writes from a series of interviews to provide a solid basis. He talks about their common traits with their male correspondents, but spends more time on the differences. Viva la difference.</span>

                    <span>Wow!  What a great book!  No, I'm not a millionaire woman, not even close.  But I certainly learned WHY, and that there is a millionaire woman in me, in all of us, if we choose it and pursue it.  Women see their personality in this book, or their ex-husband's, or their parents, or their children, possibly all of the above.  It should definitely open a dialogue between mothers and their sons and daughters, if we want to raise future generations of happy, well adjusted, young women and men.  </span>

                    <span>I have read hundreds of books on success and finance, including the original "Millionaire Next Door," and this book ranks in the top 3 "MUST READ" books in my lifetime. Absolutely required reading! It's an easy read with extremely powerful principles and lessons.    </span>

                    <span>Having been a fan of The Millionaire Next Door and The Millionaire Mind I eagerly bought his new volume. When I bought it at my favorite bookstore, I told the clerk that I was buying it for my wife which was partly true. I was also interested to know what advantages these millionaire women have over the men and how we can keep up with them.
<br />
<br />So let me say congratulations to The Millionaire Women Next Door and now thanks to Dr. Stanley the men have the real dope on how these  millionaire women have done it, what they are doing now and what we can do to hopefully catch them or even pass them.
<br />
<br />Good book Dr. Stanley. Oh, I did let my wife read it and now I have a potential millionaire woman pushing me even more! </span>

                    <span>While I loved the millionaire next and was eagerly anticipating this release I had a strong sense while reading this book that perhaps the author was under the gun to meet a deadline.  What could he ever have possibly been thinking to dedicate a whole chapter to a man with dyslexia (perhaps in the author's mind a handicapped man somehow equals a woman...Argggh!)  Even more disappointing were the many charts regarding small business opportunities. In my opinion, they would have had much more pertinence to the reader-(and the supposed subject matter of the book) if they were WOMAN OWNED businesses.  There are some interesting cases but all and all I was not impressed for the above reasons. </span>
