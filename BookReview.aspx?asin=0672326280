                    <span>This is a great book for anyone looking to start Java.
<br />Goes at a pretty fast pace but does not lose you anywhere in the book.
<br />The chapters also dont go on and on and on about the same thing, otherwise I wouldnt have been able to read it (ADHD).

                    <span>THE CASE:
<br />This review is most intended to the readers who have unfortunately bought Deitel: Java How To Program, and Sams: Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days. Because if you already unfortunately bought them, you'll might not want to spend your money more on other Java programming books. I think that it's better to use the resources that we already have, rather than to buy another books about Java, coz' you'll end up just the same. And if I were you, I won't blame the authors, coz' I think that they are just like the rests of us, who have different ways of thinking, and also have unique ways to explain something. 
<br />
<br />
<br />WHAT MY REVIEW BASES ON:
<br />1. I wrote this review based on my experiences after I read "Deitel: Java How To Program 5th Edition" and "Sams: Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days",
<br />2. And based also from other reviews which written by other reviewers about both books. 
<br />
<br />WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PROGRAMMING BOOKS:
<br />1. "Many programming books out there should not be used alone.". And if you are in mentioned case above, let's make it to be an advantage. We'll combine the power of Deitels and the power of Sams together.
<br />2. Nobody can learn something new so fast. First the Concepts, then the Practices to make you a master.
<br />
<br />SOLUTIONS OF THE CASE:
<br />Read for the first "Sams: Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days", and then the "Deitels: Java How to Program". Deitels explains you more about how to write programs in Java, instead of the concepts of OOP and Java 2. In other side, Sams explains more about the concepts of OOP and Java 2. Or you can read them together, but that would be a paint in the neck.
<br />
<br />You can forget about what they said for marketing and not based on researches, like: "You would be able to write or build programs in Java in only 21 Days". And you can ignore about what they said: "This book will boost you with Java in no time", or something like that. Coz' the fact depends on many factors, such as times, ability to understand, motivation, etc.....
<br />
<br />And finally, this both books are for Java beginners and self-lerners recommended, who are self-motivated. But in the mentioned Case above, still the decision is upon you, whether you decided to buy another book of Java, or try the solution mentioned above. But I can tell you for sure, it has worked for me, and I am a self-lerner.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this help, coz' there are so many confusing positives and negatives reviews about these both books. And good luck !
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Chris</span>

                    <span>I do not recommend this book to someone who has _no_ experience in programming any language. Alot of the words they use to explain things can be intimidating, to say the least. Though they help out by giving alot of examples (both coding examples and comparisons to things in real-life) which makes the book a quick read; unless of course you are stuck trying to figure out what a paragraph is talking about. <p>This is a great book to look back on, but don't expect to know all of Java 2 after reading it.</span>

                    <span>I have read pretty much every book that the RI CLAN library system has on java and general computer programming and I have never seen a better book on java developement. It taught me almost everything I know about java, and I have read every almost edition. Although I regret that this version does not have as much coverage of threads, awt interfaces, or applets as the 2nd edition, it has better coverage of OOP and I finally figured out how to get the jdk command line tools to work! This book is perfect for anyone of beginner or intermediate knowlege of Java, or it will teach you java and OOP from scratch! Also good to buy as a desk refrence for all those difficult functions.</span>

                    <span>I read two other books on Java while preparing for the SCJP.  The problem I had with the SCJP books, is that I felt like I still didn't know Java after I read them.  This book filled in that gap for me.  I wish I had started with this one, because it assumes that you will  be writing some progams in Java other than just taking an exam.  <p>This book is broken into 3 primary sections.  The first 7 chapters cover the basics including Java concepts, object oriented programming concepts, basic Java, objects, classes, methods, and applets.  These chapters provide a good introduction to Java and serve as a foundation for the remaining chapters.  <p>The next 7 chapters primarily cover visual java and programming with Swing including components, containers, user interfaces, and graphics.  Threads and sound are also coverd.  <p>The next 7 chapters introduce more advanced (actually intermediate) topics including packages and class features, error handling, streams, object serialization, sockets, JavaBeans, and database connectivity.<p>The appendicies on configuring the Software Development Kit (SDK) is very helpful to a new programer.  There is a good amount of sample code that all runs as designed and compiles without error.  The sample code very helpful for grasping the concepts as they are presented.<p>This book is what it was written to be.  It's a solid introduction to Java.  It does not cover advanced Java, but it does cover enough to get you started.  Those who intend to use Java as a primary programming language would will want to augment this introductory text with other books after these concepts are mastered.</span>
