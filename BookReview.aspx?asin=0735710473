                    <span>This book claims to take the fear out of programming but it jumps right into writing raw code in "Advanced" mode as opposed to coding in "Normal" mode which I would assume to be the logical first step. <p>The author does a good job of introducing the ActionScript language by using metaphors but failed to get me to actually program anything.<p>This book is not for designers, maybe it is for programmers but, I would guess that programmers would require more depth than this book provides.</span>

                    <span>This book is great for learning how some of the great Flash tricks are done.  I'm not a designer or Flash programmer by trade, but after perusing this book I was able to employ my knowledge of similar ECMA languages to ActionScript and create sliding and fading effects as well as a few others.<p>Highly recommended for someone trying to expand their ActionScript toolset.<p>-Steve Parks<br>Macromedia Certified Instructor<br>Macromedia Certified Advanced Cold Fusion MX Developer<br>Cold Fusion Developer's Journal Contributing Author</span>

                    <span>As others have stated, this book has errors, and what's worse those errors are not even pointed out on the book's website.  The least the author/publisher could do is keep the website up-to-date.  <p>The good part is this book does contain some interesting effects with ActionScript, but this is not a book for ActionScript beginners.  It is for people with either some background in ActionScript already, or with JavaScript.  Otherwise, you will be frustrated very quickly.  The quality of the physical publication is quite high with excellent paper stock, full color throughout and long book width.  New Riders, to their credit, rarely produces cheap physical products.  <p>In all, this book has some good meaty content, but poor technical editing to catch the errors mars its overall usefulness; hence the mixed review.</span>

                    <span>Very disappointed in buying this book as it has so many errors.  For a beginner, it will be very frustrating to deal with.  Very disappointed because I know the author is a Flash expert.  Very disappointed that the Author, Editors and Technical Writers rushed this book out onto the market before testing, thoroughly, the examples in this step-by-step book.  The only ones who will truly benefit from this book are the advanced readers versed in ActionScript as they have the knowledge to pick-up on errors.  ActionScript newbies.... you will be very frustrated with this book.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book with much excitement based on the examples I was going to learn through the step and step approach.  Brenden assumes you have some knowledge of ActionScript and therefore assumes that you can pick-up on his errors and correct them for yourself.  For a newbie who is learning ActionScript for the first time should not be learning from a book with so many errors.  Not only is this very, very frustrating for a newbie but it quells the excitement of a newbie from learning ActionScript....at least for awhile.  The book was probably rushed out to the stores without thoroughly testing the examples.</span>
