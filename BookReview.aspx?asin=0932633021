                    <span>I have gotten more out of this book than any other that I have read.  It is ideal for current software developers who think they might be interested in leadership.  It begins with some basic ideas about leadership and how they will relate to the rest of the book.  The real meat of the book is in sections 2, 3, and 4 which are dedicated to Innovation, Motivation, and Organization - the three key components of being a technical leader.  Weinberg does an excellent job of explaining these topics as well as the barriers to them.  Each chapter ends with a list of questions.  You will not get as much out of the book if you do not take the time to think through and write down your answers.  Also, you will be asked to begin keeping a personal journal in one of the chapters on Innovation.  You will not regret taking the five minutes a day to do this.  It is well worth it.  The book ends with some advice to help you implement changes necessary to become a technical leader as well as understand why you want to do it.  The book asks a lot of its readers, but it gives a good return on the investment.</span>

                    <span>Concrete advice about both how to assess where you are today, and what to do to become and be a technical leader. There are also some fun anecdotal pseudo-conversations that work as a nice interlude, and a great description of the tradeoffs between technical and personal strenths.<p>While a light read, I couldn't help coming away from this book feeling that it was longer than it needed to be -- the information density isn't terribly high. A few of the pseudo-graphs that appeared in the book also seemed to have mislabeled axes, though that may have been corrected in subsequent editions.</span>

                    <span>Jerry recently stopped giving the workshop on which this book<br>is based.  I number him among my most valued friends. Our <br>friendship began in that workshop.  If you take the approach to<br>leadership that this book explains you'll be the kind of leader<br>that almost anyone would willingly follow, and with good reason.<br>I'm still trying to assimilate the thousands of tasty bits of<br>wisdom it contains.  Jerry already has.  He's been there and back<br>again, and has buried many of the jewels he discovered on his<br>journey in this book.  BUY IT.</span>

                    <span>I recommend this book to almost everyone I know. In addition to talking about management, Weinberg makes clear that anyone can lead, regardless of their official role. There are lessons in this book for everyone who works in a "knowledge" industry. And there are even lessons in the book that can help you be a better person overall.<p>Everyone should read this book, and you may want to own one, as there are passages that you will want to reference from time to time.</span>

                    <span>This book was somewhat misleading in that its focus wasn't on how to become a technical leader, but rather how to become a better person.  By becoming a more open, well rounded individual you can excel at leadership, also asks the question "Why do you want to become a leader?"  I found the most useful part of the book to be the section on the job-satisfaction graph which encourages an introspective review of where you've been, where you are now, and how to get to a more positive work situation.</span>
