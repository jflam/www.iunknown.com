                    <span>This isn't a coherent book for overcoming your fears of retiring without enough money.  Its a hasty and crude assemblage of Brock's "Seniority" columns from the New York Times.  Indeed, the copyright is in the name of the newspaper instead of the author's.
<br />
<br />Look at the book's cover.  It pushes the image that we're all timid little sparrows nervously watching eggs in our nests.  If I read "nestegg" and "golden years" one more time, I'll need to excuse myself to retch in the hedges.
<br />
<br />I believe healthcare is a mess and "private accounts" won't solve Social Security's future troubles.  But like other readers, I object to material that supports one side of these issues in a general book on retirement planning.
<br />
<br />For all that, the book's premise is absolutely correct: You don't really need 70 to 80 percent of preretirement income investments advisors say you do.  Keep looking; there must be a better book than this out there.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The best thing that can be said about this book is that it is cheap. About half of the book is dedicated to political haranguing about Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which is hardly of any help for those planning to retire. Mr. Brock argues the New York Times party line: there is nothing wrong with Social Security and we should not touch it. The projections of insolvency are subject to a high level of uncertainty. Curiously he seems to think that the uncertainty is only on the upside. That is, there seems to be no chance that the projections may be actually too optimistic. Oblivious to the obvious contradiction, he forecasts only gloom and doom for the stock market, as he argues against private accounts. So he envisions a future in which the economy does quite well, so that there are enough taxes to pay for Social Security for all, but the stock market performs miserably. He also laments that American conservative will not allow a socialized health insurance system like that of Canada or some European countries, without ever mentioning the high tax rates in those countries or the fact that thousands of Canadians cross the border to get medical care in the US every month. You have to wait one year (!) for an MRI in Canada unless it's an emergency. You cannot pay for an MRI in Canada, it is just no available. Hockey players get them because they go through a loophole in which their MRIs are classified as "research" after the clubs contribute millions to hospitals. 
<br />
<br />Another 25% of the space is spent on arguing that you do not need 80% of your pre-retirement income to retire (duh). 
<br />
<br />I gave the book two stars because there is some useful information here and there, but nothing you could not find in the web in a few minutes. The book can be mildly useful for those who are not computer savvy or are very lazy. 
<br />
<br />If you are wealthy enough that you do not have to worry about things like retirement you can waste ten bucks on this book. But then why should you?</span>

                    <span>I was duped by the title of this book into believeing that I was buying a book on retirement planning.  Instead, what I got were the completely and utterly biased political views of an East Coast liberal Democrat which he has presented as fact.  I have never been so disappointed in a book or in a publisher who would allow such a mischaracterization of a book's contents.  As bad as the one-sided opinions are that Mr. Brock wants you to take as stone-cold-fact is what he leaves out...like Alan Greenspan's comments on the Social Security system or Nobel prize winning economist Edward Prescott's concerns over the system.  Mr. Brock also repeatedly (and I have to assume intentionally) misleads readers that the current Social Security privatazation proposals would only allow young workers to allocate funds to the stock market.  There are far better books to read on Social Security, retirement planning and political views that this one.  I would encourage readers to try "The Millionaire Next Door" as a vastly superior alternative to this diatribe.</span>

                    <span>If you followed Brock's advice on cutting unnecessary expenses then you probably shouldn't buy this book ($15). Mostly NY times op-ed filler with a few helpful web links. An example is the chapter on obtaining health insurance which is 90% a call to arms for nationalized health insurance and 10% practical advice. You can indeed consider retiring on less than you think if you believe the current government safety nets will be in place (and relatively unchanged) for the next 30 years and you are willing to live at a level that the government deems appropriate. I give the book one star for the included web links.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The basic premise of the book is that you don't need a retirement nest egg large enough to provide you with 70-80% of your present income to retire comfortably.  This is contrary to the common advice found in the marketplace and the author attacks this as hype.  I found his commentary insightful and thought provoking as I had bought into the believe that you needed at least 70% of your present income otherwise you would be stuck eating Alpo.  I agree with the author's basic point that if you live in an expensive metropolitan area (e.g. Manhattan, Chicago, SF) and are willing to relocate to a less expensive area you can retire comfortably on a modest income.  I agree with some commentators' criticism that the author spends time making his own political commentary on Social Security and healthcare, but this does not detract from the rest of the book.  I wish the book had gone into more detail on some of the subjects covered, but a reader can continue researching various topics by looking at the websites recommended in the book.  Unless you are "set for life," I would recommend that you take a look at this book.  After reading it, I am rethinking my retirement plans and am not nearly as nervous of making my retirement work as I was before.</span>
