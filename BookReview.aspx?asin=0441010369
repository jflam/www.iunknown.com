                    <span>If you long for the days of the Heinlein juveniles or the Time series of Madline L'Engle, then this book is for you.<p>The Earth's sun is dying and has been given just three years to live.  A young girl and her grandfather travel to the most spectacular sun in the galaxy to try and find a cure.  They travel using butterflies and sillyscience (I mean superscience).  Girl and grandfather find themselves on a planet of intelligent polygons in the middle of a battle with a great star eating evil.<p>A very fun book involving strange aliens, amazing stars and moral lessons for all.</span>

                    <span>If you look up a list for the top ten worst science fiction books ever, chances are you will see this book on that list. <p>Somehow, I don't see a great plot here. I almost had to force myself to finish this book. It seems almost directed to little kids in the way that it's about this young girl who's grandfather is this great scientist. When he suddenly disappears, she has to find out where he is and how to save him. Big deal. Compared to other works by T.A. Barron, I'd say that this one is very disappointing. Books by Garth Nix and "A Wrinkle in Time" prove to be much more entertaining than this book.</span>

                    <span>This book was great. It captivates you and you won't want to but it down. <p>I don't think this should be age level 9-12, it seems to me to fit more under young adult.</span>

                    <span>Heartlight is a science fantasy book by T.A. Barron. The book is about a 7th grade girl named Kate who has moved into a new town. She has trouble making friends, so she spends most of her time with her unusually preoccupied astrophyisist grandfather. When he suffers a heart attack and mysteriously disappears, Kate is forced to embark on a quest to save the sun and another star. I disliked the book because it did not seem very scientific. Also, I would have liked a greater variety of conflicts for Kate. The most well written characters in the book were the giant butterflies, Morpheus and Orpheus. A better science fantasy read with a similar theme would be "A Wrinkle in Time" by Madeleine L'Engle.</span>

                    <span>T. A. Barron's Heartlight is a great science-fiction book.  As you read this book, it is easy to sense that you are in the book with the characters.  The book tells of a young girl who travels in outer space through her heartlight.  Kate's mission is to find her grandfather in outer space in another galaxy and bring him home to safety.  Heartlight is full of excitement and adventure as Kate searches for her lost grandfather who is trying to save the sun.  The sun is running out of PCL (pure condensed light) and it is up to her grandfather to save the sun.  <br>	I really enjoyed Heartlight, and I am not a person who likes science-fiction books.  This book is not one of those completely unbelievable books where you know that nothing in the book could ever happen.  T.A. Barron writes outstanding details and descriptions in the book, and one starts to believe that the sun just might really run on PCL.  The characters live within you throughout the tosses and turns of the book.  T.A. Barron makes it possible to ride on the wings of a Morpho nestra, a beautiful butterfly, soar through outer space into other galaxies, get stuck in a black hole, and live to tell the story.</span>
