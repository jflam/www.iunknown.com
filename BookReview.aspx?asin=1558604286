                <span id="Label1">This textbook provides a basic introduction to the fundamentals of current computer designs. As the title suggests, the text skirts the border between hardware and software. After an overview of the subject and a discussion of performance, the book launches into technical matter such as instruction sets, how they are constrained by the underlying processor hardware, the constraints on their design, and more. An excellent critique of computer arithmetic methods leads to a high-level discussion on processor design. Following is a great introduction to pipelining, nice coverage of memory issues, and solid attention to peripherals. The book concludes with a brief discussion of the additional issues inherent in multiprocessing machines. The extremely lucid description is grounded in real-world examples. Interesting exercises help reinforce the material, and each section contains a write-up of the historical background of each idea. <I>Computer Organization and Design</I> is accessible to the beginner, but also offers plenty of valuable knowledge for experienced engineers.</span>

                    <span>If you have to use this book in a college course and you are not directed to do so, download the SPIM simulator (MIPS spelled backwards) the author mentions in the book. This can help you understand some of the more complex topics. 
<br />
<br />The reason I gave the book four stars is because the topic of pipelining as introduced in the book is confusing and may require most readers to go back over the topic several times before it clicks. 
<br />
<br />I also think that having a course in digital fundamentals prior to taking a course that requires this book would help, too. It used to be that colleges would require undergrad computer science students to take a digital fundamentals course (or equivalent) before taking and organization class. It seems now that many schools have dropped the digital requirement and have students take one computer organization class. If you fit in this boat, maybe thing about picking up a Schaum's outline on digital design concepts to go along with this book.</span>

                    <span>This book has a good potential in teaching students about computer organization. Unfortunately, the authors spend too much time explaining simple concepts which makes the book very boring and tedious to read. For example: the authors spend 335 pages just to explain basic MIPS assembly languages and computer performance. Those concepts could have been explained in 50 pages at most. Giving too much unnecessary detail won't help me to get a better understanding of computer organization. In fact, I get lost because the main topic was buried inside all the unimportant unnecessary details. This book could have been written in 300 pages, which is about a third of the length of the book, and still gives a clear, to the point, concise explanation of computer organization.</span>

This is a very good study track.</span>

                    <span>This is yet another classical textbook in a Computer Science undergraduate curriculum. It was recommended heartily by my professor (when in fact he has never used it in the course), but I chose not to buy it. And was glad about it aftewards since after reading half of it in the library I found it<p>1) Boring<br>2) Exceedingly and unnecessarily detailed<br>3) Poorly organized<p>For those of you who don't fall asleep while reading the first 200 pages, this might prove to be a good investment. Otherwise, I'd suggest taking good notes during classes and consulting online references, because this book is just not worth the price (in my opinion, of course).</span>
