                <span id="Label1"><P> <B><I>Something extraordinary is about to happen on this planet.</I></B> <P> Humanity is about to create a new form of spirituality. This New Spirituality will allow humans to express their natural impulse toward the Divine without making one another wrong for the way in which they are doing it, and without killing one another in the name of it. When the New Spirituality is embraced by humanity, it will, of course, change everything.  And that is exactly what is needed now. <P> This book contains an astonishing prediction. And that prediction comes from an astonishing source. Author Neale Donald Walsch says it comes directly from God. Whether you believe that or not, you will find it difficult not to be swept up in the startling and profound vision of our near future contained here.   <P> <I>Tomorrow's God</I> says, point-blank, that humanity will soon re-create its experience of God in such a way that our experience of one another will be healed at last. You may agree or disagree with the contents of this book, but you will never forget having read it.</span>

                    <span>To anyone who has ever read any of the Conversations With God books by Neale Donald Walsch: you don't want to miss out on the most important message of our time! "Tomorrow's God" presents the greatest spiritual challenge for the entire human race. A challenge which calls each and every one of us to make a decision about how we feel about the current conditions on our planet.<P>Neale Donald Walsch presents for all of humanity, an opportunity to create a whole New Spirituality. A kind of spirituality that will allow humans to express their natural impulse to seek and to experience the Divine without making each other wrong for the way they are doing it, and without killing each other in the name of it.<P>Through Neale, God describes how this New Spirituality will play its effect when overlaid upon the experience and constructions of our human society, specifically in the areas of religion, politics, economics, business and commerce, education, relationships, and sexuality.<P>There is much to explore within this unique treasure. So much that you may have to read it twice!</span>

                    <span>For anyone who has not come across any of the Conversations With God books, "Tomorrow's God" is as good a read as any to find out why they are so popular. Having read nearly all the CWG series myself, and some of them several times, I am completely biased in their favour. They are spiritual sanity and hope in an often mad world. <P>Walsch and God's re-defining of God in the opening chapters is contemporary, clear, profound, spiritual wisdom, building on previous themes in the CWG series. Some possible social, economic and political consequences of embracing such a God are explored towards the end of the book. Much of this is brilliantly inspirational, even if you don't agree with all of it. <P>Some religious fundamentalists still seem to feel threatened by the CWG ideas. Yet again Walsch is quite clear here about us EMBRACING all that works in existing religions. "Not a replacement for the old, but an enhancement of it. Not an abandonment of your present religions, but a revitalization of them". "BE THE HOPE OF HUMANITY", say Neale and God at one point, inspiring this reader considerably!</span>

                    <span>The message of this book is about us humans realizing that we are all connected to One God, One Life Force that includes all of Life itself, and therefore requires us to respect all things Created, each other and our ecosystems. I love Jesus Christ because of the WAY He lived; he would agree that we are of One Body. This book is blasphemy only if we hold onto the words rather than see beyond the words to truth. If we recognize and respond to our unity that includes the Love of God there will be more compassion, more responsible action; even the selfish will realize that to hurt another hurts oneself. Anger burns the angry the most. <P>The author is right in saying that we need to change our negative behavior patterns. I ask, Has Money become God? Is the Almighty Dollar worth more than our own well being as seen in the consequences of the loss of the forests, lands turning to desert, lack of attention paid to human impact on the greater whole? Must some of us stuff ourselves to obesity while so many starve? Must we give into the media telling us we have to look a certain way or buy certain things to be happy? Is this the Way? Who is really running our lives? Why are we so freely giving away our freedom? What are we afraid of? There should be no fear in a state of Grace.<P>Religion has helped to do much good such as charitable relief organizations that give over 80% of their collected funds to help the poor & hungry. We've created and we can end this hunger by giving to or working with these kinds of groups. This author rightly also suggests that the man made aspect of religion is loaded with man made self interests and bias and as such can bring about separation. See this happening in this day and age with the extreme acts of violence in the name of God! <P>The Truth should only serve to strengthen your Love of God. Realize that you are the Light of the World; every day is judgment day or otherwise said, Today is the first day of the rest of our lives. Read and Act and still go to church and worship. The only threat herein is one for those who want to sleepwalk their way through life; this book will wake you up!<P> We create the future by our actions today. This is what I think free will means. What do you think?</span>

                    <span>Christians, beware of this book. Its message is untruth, and blasphemy. We are asked to sacrifice what we hold true for the sake of the world. Take heed, we are not designed for this world, but a better one Where God reigns supreme, and we live eternally in his Holy presence. I gave this book "1 star" because there was effort, and I enjoy a good rebuttle every now and then. <BR>Why is my review entitled "Postmodern Garbage". Simply put, we are in an era of Postmodernism, which is really known as the "whatever feels good", or "its all relative" group. Postmodernists believe there is no truth, but to believe there is no truth means that "its true there is no truth", which is contradictory. Their philosophy is highly uneducated, but extremly tempting. If you look what Christianity has survived you will see by the grace of God postmodern thought will fade away too. What this "educated" author wrote is nothing new. Since the New Testament we've battled postmodern thought, the apostle Paul wrote to Greeks who were trying to mix the old pagan religion with Christianity. Paul tells us in the scripture that there is nothing new under the sun, meaning that every "new thought, new movement(postmodernism)" is not actually new. <BR>Of course, the authors intentions were genuine, but never the less they are still dangerous. <P> We survived the "modernist age"(which is dead I might add), evolution is constantly debunked, communism is a failure.....etc. A certain reviewer asked us to seek the truth in our heart, but I ask you to seek the real Truth, Christ. Do not change for this era. If you still want to read this "pleasant, hopeful, and tear jerking" book, proceed. I only ask that after you read this book, read Dr. Gene Edward Veith's "Postmodern Times: A contemporary......."(its a long title). Take care</span>
