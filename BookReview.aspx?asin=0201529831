                    <span>Leslie Lamport's second edition of the Latex manual is helpful, concise, and puts ideas first; it's a great book for the TeX beginner. All essentially topics are covered quickly, in an engaging style. <P>However, it has two drawbacks. First, the reference section is cryptic and confusing; I recommend keeping the Latex Companion handy for detailed explanations and examples. <P>Second, too many useful things are left unsaid. For instance, nowhere in this book is it stated that \to is a built-in abbreviation for the clumsy command \rightarrow (the arrow in A -> B); most users waste time making their own abbreviation, such as \ra. But \to is right there in the Latex source, it's simply not documented in this manual. The MakeIndex appendix explains the \index command in detail, but omits to mention the \glossary command (you'll find it in paragraph C.11.5 of the reference section, if you're desperate). The all-important business of add-on "packages", which allow endless customizations of the standard Latex styles, is dealt with in only one or two pages. And so on...<P>The manual doesn't tell the reader that its style conventions are not obligatory. Thus, curly brackets are pervasive: to type a subscripted list of variables, the book suggests $x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}$. It takes quite a while for the beginner to realize that $x_1,\dots,x_n$ works just as well (and gives the same result). A simple explanation of what is an "input token" would save users a lot of time and trouble.<P>Final answer? You'll need this book: it's a good book, and it's authorative, correct and concise. But if you need to know more than the basics, make sure you also have the Latex Companion.</span>

                    <span>I am a recent immigrant to the world of LaTeX, and find this book a very adequate guide. My needs are modest, and this book is well enough organized to meet those needs without fuss. Four stars for content.<P>The cover (paperback) fell off the signatures within the first month, though - the glue failed completely. One star for shoddiness, only because the scale goes no lower.<P>Three stars averages the two ratings, rounded up.</span>

                    <span>This is the only book you will need on LATEX, however, you are required to make a few "leaps of faith" in understanding. The latex markup language is extremely powerful and sometimes you have to try things and discover the power for yourself. Having said that, the author does an amazing job of fitting so much information into such a thin book! Stick with it, persist with it a little, and you will come to know and love it. I write many papers in LaTeX and this is the only reference I have ever needed.</span>

                    <span>Much like K&R's "C Programming Language", economy (and precision) of words characterize this book. There's little fat or fluff in this slim volume but is packed with usable information. And, as one might expect, it is beautifully typeset. Don't let the aging copyright deter you, if you're serious about document processing, this is one book you need to add to your collection. Thanks to Lamport, I have used LaTeX to prepare professional-quality documenation giving little (if any) thought to how it looks so that I can concentrate on clarity and content.</span>
