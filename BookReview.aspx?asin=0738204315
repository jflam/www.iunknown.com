                <span id="Label1">From four of the liveliest personalities on the Web comes a provocative, outrageous, and wickedly smart account of what it will take to prosper in the fast-forward world on the wire. This nationally acclaimed best seller is a spirited, original, and wonderfully irreverent conversation that will challenge, provoke, and forever change your outlook on the digital economy. A rich tapestry of anecdotes, object lessons, parodies, insights, and predictions, The Cluetrain Manifesto illustrates how the Internet has radically reframed the seemingly immutable laws of business--and what business needs to know to weather the seismic aftershocks.   <P>"An earnest plea for a new kind of language and new expectations for the Web.... While others work on turning the Internet into the perfect medium for reaching traditional business goals, these four Net-philes hope cyberspace will give commerce a 'human voice.'" -Harvard Business Review   <P>"For every retail or consumer-products company wondering why its Internet marketing doesn't seem to be working, The Cluetrain Manifesto...offers fresh and sound advice, expressed in entertaining prose. Its oft-repeated premise--that markets are conversations--should be pounded into the collective brain of corporate executives." -Business Week</span>

                    <span>The Cluetrain Manifesto is a must read; for two reasons 1) It will stimulate your mind about future possibilities, and 2) There's no excuse to not read it ... The book begins with "A powerful global conversation has begun. Through the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. As a direct result, markets are getting smarter-and getting smarter faster than most companies."
<br />
<br />One great thought in this book is that the Web makes it possible for everyone to participate in the "great conversation." As such the web remains full of possibilities. We've only touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unlocking Tim Berners-Lee's dream of bringing people together. The several sections that comprise the Cluetrain Manifesto are:
<br />
<br />The 95 Theses
<br />Elevator Rap
<br />Introduction
<br />Chapter 1: Internet Apocalypso
<br />Chapter 2: The Longing
<br />Chapter 3: Talk Is Cheap
<br />Chapter 4: Markets Are Conversations
<br />Chapter 5: The Hyperlinked Organization
<br />Chapter 6: EZ Answers
<br />Chapter 7: Post-Apocalypso
<br />
<br />A thought provoking book ...

                    <span>Hard to recommend such a small publication when the entire thing is now available for download at the website. <br>Markets are conversations. This is good.<br>Mass marketing is not a conversation. That is bad.<br>The authors leave themselves open to some fair criticism - their ideas aren't fully developed nor are their any clear suggestions as to implementation. It reads more as a protestation against existing norms than a viable alternative. <br>Find a second-hand copy. It's worth a read but not quite worth the price.</span>

                    <span>I think the target audience is somebody who completely missed out on the late nineties, but who would like a very light read to understand the change in openness and freedom in conversations that most folks now take for granted. There's not a lot of content here -- you can skim about 10% of the book and get seemingly 99% of the content. If you're really "clueless", hit the web version instead and save the effort of grabbing this book.</span>

                    <span>I have mixed feelings about this book. At the beginning, it makes a lot of sense, with discussions about markets and the power of the Internet. Here it succeeds. The problem is that it runs out of steam. A lot of concepts are repeated over and over and some of them make less sense the more they are repeated. There are some good ideas about using the technology to reconnect with customers, co-workers and the world at large. The case histories are also quite illuminating. These guys have clearly been there and done it. The problem I have is that they think the Internet is somehow a magic cure for a lot of these problems. Technology by itself never fixes anything and I say this as someone who is an IT professional.<p>I found it an interesting read, but was left wanting more from it in the end. Some of the observations about organisational hierarchy and culture I think are over simplified and at times plain wrong. As a companion to the book, I would recommend readers try "Good to Great" by Jim Collins, which deals with how some organisations make the jump and some don't. It's an interesting counterpoint, as it focusses a lot on effective management of people, any organisation's most valuable asset. Cluetrain is worth a read, but keep some salt handy....</span>
