                <span id="Label1">Today's digital cameras are affordable and provide quality images that rival their traditional film counterparts. Because digital images are easier to share, and because you only have to print the pictures you need, this new medium is both cost effective and environmentally friendly. Best of all, it's fun! With a digital camera, you can set free your creative spirit and take risks you never would with a film camera. The only obstacle is learning how to unlock all or this power and pleasure packed into these pocket-sized picture takers. <i>Digital Photography Pocket Guide</i>, 2nd Edition expands on the basic photography techniques introduced in the bestselling first edition to help you take the kind of pictures you've always wanted to--and now in full color! This book is the photo mentor you've always wanted: it explains each of the camera's components, shows you what they do, and then helps you choose the right settings. When you ask, "How can I get that picture?", simply pull this small guide out of your camera bag, backpack, or back pocket and find the answer quickly. This fully illustrated book covers everything from image resolution,  shooting sports action, close ups and night shots, to memory cards, transferring images, archiving, making QuickTime movies, and much more. Topics in the guide's three main sections on "Digital Camera Components",  "Standard Camera Functions", and "How Do I?" are labeled A to Z for quick reference. Or if you prefer, use the comprehensive index or table of contents to find the information you need. There's even an entire section of easy to read reference tables for quick look up of white balance settings, exposure compensation, camera mode explanations, and much more. </span>

                    <span>Being fairly new to digital photography, I had high hopes for this volume.  Having read through the 100 pages fairly quickly, I am now disappointed.  I was hoping to find either a very concise guidebook to digital photography or a more substantial work on the subject.  I didn't find either one.  Instead, I encountered a book that takes too many pages to cover too little content.  The information is more technical than practical for an individual new to the field.  For someone more experienced, it would be far too basic.
<br />
<br />I gave this title two stars because it does have a few helpful points.  If you are looking for a beginner's primer, look elsewhere.  Better books can be purchased for the money.</span>

                    <span>I think this would make an excellent present for someone getting a new digital camera. It covers, very briefly, topics from the construction of the average camera, through the basic settings, and recommendation on composing pictures.
<br />
<br />It's in the advice on composition and taking good pictures where I think the book really shines. He has advice on taking portraits, sports shots, scenery shots, wedding pictures and other types of pictures.
<br />
<br />I can see two good reasons to buy this book. The first is to give it as a gift. The second is to tuck along on trips to remind you of how to compose good shots if you aren't a professional photographer.</span>

                    <span>Thank goodness for the digital camera. People like me with a lousy eye can take hundreds of photos and experiment until our eyes fall out and get a couple of gems. Despite my left-handedness, I don't have a natural eye for photography, art, or anything of the sort. It all went into writing.<p>With three kids, photos are important to me as I want to take capture many times of their lives so we may reflect on them with a visual aid. A good photo does make a difference. Again, three kids, who has time to read a book or take a class to become one with a camera? This pocket guide fills that need.<p>It has three chapters with quick reference tables in the back of the book. It's small enough to fit into your camera bag, laptop case, briefcase, suitcase, or jacket pocket. The chapters address what is it, what do I do, and how do I questions.<p>What is it covers the basic, intermediate, and advanced features found on digital cameras. It's the shortest chapter as once you get familiar with the features, you won't need the chapter anymore and you still have roughly 85 pages of material to support you when you're out there trying to capture the world you see.<p>Once you've conquered the buttons and figured out what most of the symbols and modes mean, you're ready to dig deeper into the features and gain control of the camera with answers to your what does it do types of questions relating to exposure and flash compensation, white balance, ISO speed, and resolution.<p>The last chapter is more free flowing as you and the camera have become one. Get tips on taking outdoor and group shots including sporting events where players are moving fast. Capture kids, travel spots, and wedding memories with class as kids grow up, you may not return to the same places, and weddings happen only once (we would hope unless it's a renewal of vows).<p>Adding this book to your camera bag is a step toward to better pictures and better understanding of those fancy photography terms, which aren't a big deal after you read author Derrick Story's simple and clear explanations.</span>

                    <span>I love this book and I will try to share why... <p>First I will tell you why this book is good for me and then you decide if it is good for you! First few words about me:<p>I am not a professional photographer -- I am a professional web developer! I do not know much about aperture, exposure, white balance, etc. I am a newly-minted father whose task is to launch a new website with new photos of his beautiful daughter taken with a newly purchased Canon digital camera... All these new things can be daunting. <p>Here comes help from O'Reilly. I know O'Reilly for their wonderful computer books. I did not know O'Reilly could deliver such high quality consumer information for digital media novices and professionals alike.<p>The book tells you:<p>1. The basics of your digital camera.<br>2. How to operate it and take full advantage of its features.<br>3. How to achieve success with specific tasks: taking outdoor portraits, taking interesting children shots (try taking a photo of a three-week old baby!), creative architecture shots, landscapes that would make you feel like a pro, and so on...<p>Last but not least, the book shares computer tips and tricks which would be helpful for any digital camera user, whether professional or amateur: working with RAW files, sending and archiving photos and preparing them for print.<p>The quick reference tables listed in the appendix of this wonderful pocket guide alone would justify its gentle price ($14.95 in the US):<p>- exposure compensation reference guide<br>- flash mode settings<br>- white balance settings<br>- metering modes explained in plain English<br>- camera modes explained in plain English<br>- reference of number of pictures per memory card depending on its capacity<br>- etc, etc.<p>If you spend $300+ on a decent digital camera and all you can use is just its basic auto modes, you are not doing yourself and your camera justice. For less than $15 more with the help of O'Reilly and this pleasantly witty and informative guide written by Derrick Story, you would multiple the value of your digital photography investment -- by taking, storing and sharing better photos quicker and with higher quality and artistry!</span>
