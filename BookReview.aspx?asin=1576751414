What struck me immediately was the observation that people cannot see inside of me, they judge me by my actions. In the end I found the ideas in this book to be intriguing and compelling"</span>

                    <span>"BE YOUR OWN BRAND" is a great book with a powerful premise. Instead of regurgitating all the old marketing themes about branding, David McNally and Karl Speak, uncover the fundamental truths. Creating a unique stand-alone identity requires a commitment to build special relationships - with yourself, your co-workers, your customers and the public. The authors make it easy to read and understand. In addition, there are lots of practical strategies that will inspire you to take action. This is a must read for everyone in business!</span>

                    <span>In my own career I have learned that to succeed I need to know how to market myself.  I found  this book to be extremely helpful in that regard.  I especially liked the authors' philosophy that strong relationships result from people providing value to each other.  The book was concise and to the point, however, I would have enjoyed more "real life" examples.  Overall, I found it to be both insightful and practical.</span>
