                    <span>Catherine thhe Great, the little teenage Princess who came from germanic heritage, developed into a scheming, pitiless, yet loving ruler. The author takes us through her development with wonderful descriptions of those times. One can compare her reign in Russia with the development of the American Revolution and be astonished at the paths of the two nations. It is well worth reading and helps us understand the Russia of that time and of later times.</span>

                    <span>The daughter of a minor German prince, it almost easy to imagine Catherine the Great came to the throne by accident. But Catherine had a mission. Almost from the day she was chosen to be the wife of Grand Duke Peter, Catherine set her sights on greater power. She suceeded, some say by murdering her own husband, Tsar Peter III. <P>Catherine lead the Russians in the battle for the Crimea, eventually winning the region for the empire. The book also goes extensively into the many loves of Catherine. But short of using them to define who the Tsarina was, Troyat treats them as the diversion that Catherine saw them as. <P>Catherine saw herself as a liberal monarch. In fact, she regularly corresponded with Volraire and Diderot. But in the end, Catherine's main accomplishment was the maintain the power of the monarchy.</span>

                    <span>This is a skillfully written story of a great Russian Czarina. This biography reads like a novel and keeps the reader's attention to the very end. This is one of the few historic books on Russia written by a non-Russian author that paints an honest and accurate picture of the Russian life and politics of that period. I recommend this book to everyone interested in history, intrigue and romance.</span>

                    <span>I read this book for a school project, expecting it to be boring. But the way the book was written made it really easy to understand. I like the author, and I think this is his best work. This is a great way to get information, or to just read for fun. I reccomend this book to everyone! (but watch out for the Russian names! )</span>
