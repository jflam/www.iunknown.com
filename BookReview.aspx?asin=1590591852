                <span id="Label1">Also featuring: Keith Peters, David Hirmes, Lifaros, Paul Prudence, Pavel Kaluzhny, Ken Jokol  Forget school math class, Flash math is about fun. it's what you do in your spare time - messing around with little ideas until the design takes over and you end up with something beautiful, bizarre, or just downright brilliant. It's a book of iterative experiments, generative design; a book of inspiration, beautiful enough to leave on the coffee table, but addictive enough to keep by your computer and sneak out while no-one's looking so you can go back to that Flash movie that you were tinkering with 'til 3 o'clock this morning. In New Masters of Flash the designers told us about themselves and deconstructed their finest effects. Well this time we've gathered the best in one book and simply asked them to go away and do what they do best: play. We give you the code and explain the essence, then you take your inspiration and run with it.</span>

                    <span>This is honestly one of the best books that I've picked up in a long time. There are so many books lately, that appear to be nothing more than a ploy at being the first book on the latest release of such and such software application. Flash Math Creativity avoids using interface clips from the Flash authoring environment, in order to concentrate on the content and not on something that has a much more limited shelf life. This book has so much to offer beyond getting acquainted with Flash 5 or MX or whatever. Becuase of the choice of displaying only raw code, it's probably not the best choice for a beginning Flash user. The examples, although excellent, aren't always well annotated, and often leaves you scratching your head -- but that's part of the fun.<P>I really appreciate the fluid examples, and the challenge of using the provided content for further investigation. These experiments should keep me busy for some time.<P>The graphics are quite beautiful and it would be hard to look at them and ignore the value of these creations on the basis that it doesn't have a practical application in the area of web design, as one reviewer stated. Plus, when did I start reading books and enjoying Flash only to do corporate stuff.</span>

                    <span>This book will not teach you anything about how math is used in Flash technically in a "how to manor." You can use the movies provided to teach yourself. This book is basically just a bunch of Flash guys paid to show off thier work. Each chapter has a different author and they walk you through the creative process and code of the movies featured. Each author has thier own unique style. Some chapters have amazing Flash movies and some are simply unimpressive. All of the .flas are available online for you to dissect and play with. If you like this kind of stuff, then you may like this book. If you have a ton of money and want a book to "play" with, I would recommend this book. Otherwise, spend your money on something that can actuallly teach you something.</span>

                    <span>very good designs to stimulate creativity using maths. Too bad the downloads don't contain all the codes. For example, each author writes several sections, and in each sections there are some samples, some are variations one design, but the variations can be quite substantial at times. The download only gives the basic design. You would have to figure out how the other ones will look like on the screen, without the movie clip design. This is not satisfactory.</span>

                    <span>I was lame at math in school....but not anymore. If you want to apply trignometry, and coding to make cool animations (without messing around in photoshop) check this book out. It is also a candidate for the coolest layout of any Flash title.
