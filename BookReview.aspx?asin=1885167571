                    <span>Having just finished Free the Beagle, I am at a loss as to where to start this review. The funny thing about it is that I think Roy Williams would approve of such hesitancy. First of all, Free the Beagle tells a fantasy story of a lawyer and a beagle traveling together on the rough road to destiny. Is there an allegory buried within this simple adventure story? Most certainly, but the success of the book is that there is more than one interpretation to be had, perhaps one for every type of reader out there. As a business book, Free the Beagle will most certainly find itself in the company of Who Moved My Cheese, Peacock in the Land of Penguins, and Roy Williams' Wizard books. However, I recommend that you pick it up with no preconceptions. Knowing little to nothing about the book until I received my copy (meaning, I didn't read a bunch of hype about it first), I went into it with an open mind. What have I decided? That Roy Williams is a master. He understands his audience so clearly... How can I explain?<P>I read Free the Beagle expecting a simple business allegory. I was charmed by the little dog, amused by the rigidity of the logical lawyer, and the journey Roy Williams concocted for them. They traverse through such places as the Forest of Confusion and the Sea of False Hope, overcoming loss. The tale harkened back to The Little Prince or Flatland or even those new popular book/movies "Harry Potter" or "The Lord of the Rings." When I concluded the first section as the lawyer's journey concluded, I thought, "Huh. Nice story." Very applicable to any sort of interpretation depending on what the reader is needful of. Then I moved on to the startling second section. It surprised me that Williams included a transcript of a roundtable meeting held to discuss this book. In attendance are a number of educated, successful folks who have all read the story. The discussion is led by Ray Bard, the publisher. For 20 pages, the book is discussed by this diverse group of people and each person brings his or her own interpretation to the book--such interpretations that I never really even considered. Each interpretation (I won't list them here because, hey, why ruin it for you?) was so fully realized, it became clear that Roy intended each from the very beginning. Instead of allowing the reader to only see one reading, he included the roundtable discussion to open each reader up to the myriad of interpretations. It reminds me of the Agatha Christie's 10 Little Indians--a mysterious stranger gathers just the right group of folks to get just the right results. A book for everyone, Free the Beagle is a lot of fun to read and full of self-discoveries. I will be re-reading the story, maybe even a few times! <P>Jack Covert</span>

                    <span>You know it's buried somewhere in your brain - the creativity that you once had as a child, back before you obediently slipped your arms into the straitjacket of conformity that bound you tighter and tighter while the years sped by. If you could only find a way to liberate the creativity again! <P>Free the Beagle by Roy H. Williams points the way. It's an amazing allegory about you, your life, your responsibilities, and your relationships, and it has the power to teach you to see everything through new eyes. It's a can't-put-it-down book, a short novella that's both shallow enough for a child to wade in and deep enough for whale to swim in. It's about balancing your left brain (an order-seeking lawyer) and your right brain (a freedom-loving beagle) so that you can learn to access your creativity and be a more open, more productive and more positive human being. When you discover the principles in Free the Beagle, you've found the closest thing there is to operating instructions for your brain.<P>You'll read it quickly, and want to read it again. The style is spartan (though you might spot an extra adverb here and there), yet it is written in a way that the thinking reader will see layers of meaning begin to unfold. Few books with such an economy of words say so much. <P>Don't expect this to be another trite Who Moved My Cheese? But if you liked that book, you'll love Free the Beagle. If you hated Who Moved My Cheese? you'll especially love it. The time is right for Free the Beagle by Roy H. Williams, and the proof will be seen when it quickly becomes a best seller - one that people actually read! To top it off, an audio CD dramatization of the book is included in the miniscule price - so no one will have an excuse for not reading it. <P>Free the Beagle might be the best investment you'll make in a book this decade. Buy it now, and you'll be in-the-know when everyone is talking about it.</span>

                    <span>This book is a short read, but one where the message is powerful! This book has creative, yet simple, descriptive names for places or people that are passed by through the journey that forces you to pause and reflect on your own path. I could not stop thinking about this parable for months after I read it, and would highly recommend it to others who want a positive tool to help reflect. I used this book as a professional development topic, where after reading this book, my staff explored their own professional paths to "destinae", while defining what that term meant for each of them. It was very well received!</span>
