                    <span>I launched a successful graphic design business using dozens of the marketing approaches that fill Rick Crandall's book. Six years later I re-located, re-read the book, and started all over. Hundreds of tried and true strategies for getting your offering "out there" are well-organized in the various chapters of the book. There are lots of good real-life examples and something for everyone. Rick points out that when buying services, people don't reallly know what they're getting until the service has been provided. Potential customers must decide to hire you based on trust. Therefore, relationship building is critical to marketing intangible services, and the consultative marketing approach Rick advocates shows the customer you have their best interests at heart. I still refer to the book often and share relevant strategies with clients developing their own businesses.</span>

                    <span>I read this book after being promoted to Product Manager. I was hoping to get more insight and do my job better, but it was too poor in some aspects.<br>The book is good, but not so good, unless you haven't heard of marketing before. <br>Anyone with a little imagination could come up with the ideas showed in the book.<br>I guess it is aimed at people with personnal business and offering only services like lawyers. It is very usefull for independent consultants. I am a consultant, but work for a company, so it didn't help too much. If you work for a company, then don't waste your time and money.</span>

                    <span>I've just started a consulting business and I have no marketing  experience.  I've also realized this business is more than consulting, I  need to learn how to sell myself!  <p>Most marketing books focus on  "product" marketing - a lot of their methods do not apply to  service marketing.  This book is fun to read and applies marketing methods  specifically to service businesses and provides real-world actions you can  take today to promote your business with little or no money!  I've already  implemented some of the methods.  I love this book!</span>
