                    <span>I bought the book yesterday and already read half of it. The content is great, very helpful and easy to read BUT the book binding is awful. This disappointed me a lot. I am wondering if all 'Alpha' books have same 'quality' of (un)binding... <P>Except this problem, the information provided is really helpful and written in a friendly & clear manner. <P>I enjoy a lot the author's style and personally I would like to see another Steven Greenberg's book, more detailed on Part 3 of the book ('Let's Take Pictures').</span>

                    <span>I read this book two years ago after buying my first digital camera. I gave it away after reading it, so maybe it's not a keeper as a reference, but even so, I have to praise this book very highly for the insight into digital photography that it's given me. I've bought two other digitals since, and find that the lessons that I learned from this book are with me even to this day. If you're a beginner, and wish to understand this technology, buy it!</span>

                    <span>I have had a digital camera' a Kodak DC280 for many months now. I have ben a 35MM amature for over 30 years and this book has helped me make the transition to digital photography better than anything else I could have done.Before I got this book, I had many problems with doing this as the manuals on the software were very poorly written and had many things just skipped over or missing entirely. Before I got halfway through the Book there were many things that helped me greatly That were just not in the manuals that came with the software. It has made everything much easier and faster. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting in digital photography.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book after reading many reviews on digital cameras. What I was looking for was a book on digital cameras and how to help me choose the correct one. What I got was a good all round book on cameras, composition, exposure, lighting, compression etc.<P>Certainly a great book if you have or are thinking of purchasing a digital camera. I did purchase a book purely on digital cameras but it was a tad heavy going.<P>This is an easy reading book which you can read cover to cover during the adds when watching TV.</span>

                    <span>this is a good book for those who know nothing about photography (thus, the "idiot's guide"). and i gave it four stars for that reason. but, for the amateur or student photographer, this book is worthless. the author covers the basics, and will give the reader a good idea of what photography is and how to take pictures. he gives a great intro to the digital world (this was the first book i bought, but quickly moved on to better, more specific books). i gave the book four stars because it is what it is supposed to be, an introduction to digital photography (you can't fault the author because the reader has some basic knowledge). i would have given him five stars, but, he didn't use photoshop as his program. adobe photoshop is the most widely used digital photography program. most people have it or will get it. so after you learn his tips, you have to relearn or adjust them to photoshop. still, i recommend this to those who don't know anything about digital photography.</span>
