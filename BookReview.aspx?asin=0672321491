                    <span>hello! you can purchase this book for 2 bucks from amazon used. This book is a little bit obsolete and the first time i started programming vb.net I threw it away thinking that was really bad. Yes, you get really confused on the first chapters as a beginner in vb.net when typing stuff that doesnt work.(the truth is that it was written for a vb.net beta version and some things changed.) Now, after I;ve become familiar with vb.net, i find this book pretty good in clarifying some parts that other books dont explain properly. <p>If you disregard some examples for databases and just look around the book you will have something to gain. I dont recommend this book to beginners but, I do recommend it to more advanced or intermediate vb.net developpers. Its level is not that hard, it contains easy examples and I think this book would be a waste of time for vb.net experts since they will already be familiar with the contents of this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is not well written, it looks like the book was based on a Beta Version of Visual Studio .NET, and was never validated against the final release version of VB.NET.<p>I like creating the programming examples from the book, I find that helps me to learn the product better and faster, however, I could not get the programs to work correctly when entered from the book.<p>I stopped reading the book after the first chapter, because the information is incorrect.</span>

                    <span>this book attempts to teach the reader how to develop VB.net applications using object-oriented methodologies.  <br>While it tries in meeting this objective, it falls short in a few areas. <br>First, the codes in the book seem to be different from what you get, even  when you follow the authors' guidelines religiously. Some lines of code just appear almost from nowhere; some of those that are accounted for are mysteriously rearranged in the book.<br>The authors' coding styles are neither here nor there. They do not seem to be within easy grasp of the VB.net newby or at the league of the blackbelt category.<br>Secondly, there are several omissions and inadequate explanations in the text. The authors obviously know their jobs. But they have difficulty imparting that knowledge to their readers. 21 chapters in a book of 360 pages mean each chapter, including the code snippets and screenshots, occupy less than 18 pages. Not that I am a fan of fluff, but I believe that adequate explanations would require many more pages. <br>Thirdly, a few explanations are simply wrong. E.g. you don't save files with .visual basic extension, but with .vb; neither do you write:<p>Me.TextBox.AcceptReturn = True<br>Me.TextBox.MultiLine = True<br>.......<p>But you write:<p>With Me.TextBox<br>  .AcceptReturn = True<br>  .MultiLine = True<br>.......<br>End With<p>I gave it three stars because it gives the reader a bird's eye-view of what OOP looks like in VB.net. But that's how far this book can go. If you really want to learn OOP in better details, you will need to use additional resources--either one that is geared to the newbies, or one that is aimed at the gurus out there. This hermaphrodite of a book defies easy placement.</span>

                    <span>After spending heaps of time sudyinh the UML - finally a book that brings OOP - UML and VB.NET together. I was wrong. After 1 chapter where the code doesn't match the examples in the book and where saving visual basic id actually .vb I am thouroughly lost and confused.</span>

                    <span>This book claims to be for newbees to VB.  All I can say is there isn't much ground work to build on.  On page 10 it says "save the file as "SimpleMsg.visual basic" which is wrong but it took me a while to find out why the IDE wasn't formatting my text. In the first code for a form, two different variables are given the same name.  Now maybe thats really a good idea but I found it pretty confusing.  This book feels like it was written by someone who had forgotten what its like to be starting fresh with VB.</span>
