                    <span>Vitale holds court on all things college basketball and in doing so offers some nice tidbits about life in general. Living a Dream is much better than Holding Court, which he wrote with Weiss about ten years ago. Living a Dream is well-written and much more polished and organized. Chapter 7 on "Absent Friends" such as NC State's Jim Valvano is terrific. There's a foreword by Coach K for Duke fans. Dickie V is a colorful guy with something to say, and that shines through again in this book.</span>

                    <span>I found this to be a fascinating review of the college basketball scene from a viewpoint rarely taken, from inside the "Coach K Waste Disposal Tunnel at Cameron Indoor Stadium," where many Duke fans in the media hang out, and discuss matters of interest to Duke athletic supporters. Dick Vitale really dares to go where no other living soul would. <P>Beyond that, Dick's use of hackneyed cliches sets the standards for a whole generation of 1-trick pony sports broadcasters yet to come. Kudos to Dick for having the courage to be an exemplar of stupidity, BABY!</span>

                    <span>This book contains a foreword written by a CLASS ACT, Mike Krzyzewski. Much unlike the classless Gary Williams, who refused to attend my barbeque ----- Perhaps this explains why can't pull recruits from his own backyard? This is described in detail in chapter 5. Mr Vitale is a pleasure to read. He describes his trips to Cameron Indoor and his friendly conversations with Coach K, Mike Dunleavy, and Wayne Gooch.</span>
