                    <span> I was excited to see a new book from everyone's favorite biker, so I had to have it. The fun stopped there. This book is pointless, except to fill the pockets of Barger.
<br />
<br />  It's a poorly camoflauged retelling of his autobiography for the first half of the book. The last half is just dumb. It involves every half-baked idea presented in the biker movies from the 1960s and 1970s and ties them into this dumb book. I almost expected to have a bit a biker werewolves by the end. 
<br />
<br /> Advice: save the cost of this book and apply it towards the purchase of a motorcycle of your own. But, avoid this one.</span>

                    <span>"Dead In 5 Heartbeats" is a fascinating look into the world of outlaw bikers.  Written by Ralph "Sonny" Barger, former leader of the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels, and the writing team of Keith and Kent Zimmerman, this novel tells the story of "Patch" Kinkade, former president of the Infidelz biker club.  Having grown tired of the burdens of leadership, Patch moves to Arizona in an effort to start a new life for himself, but he is called back into action when a war erupts between the Infidelz and their rivals, the 2Wheelers.  Although he is no longer their leader Patch feels that he must help them, either by attempting to broker peace between the Infidelz and the 2Wheelers, or by leading his comrades into battle.<p>I have always found novels written by authors who have such an intimate knowledge of their subject matter to be fun to read, and Sonny's first effort as a fiction author is no exception.  In "Dead In 5 Heartbeats" the acton fairly explodes from the page, painting a vivid portrait of life in a biker club that only an insider like Sonny himself would know about.  This book is rich in detail from the very first sentence, and by the end I felt as if I were caught up in the action.  This is definitely worth a read, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a lot of action when they read a book.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. It gave a real good insite into the life of a biker. What typical bikers have to go through on a day to day basis and how they live their lives. I thought it was very entertaining and not too gruesome as I read in previous reviews. It spoke about stabbing and fighting but that is something you deal with when you live a life like that. I couldn't put this book down. Great job Sonny!</span>

                    <span>I didn't like this book. I liked Sonny's other books but this one was senslessly violent. I don't like to read stories about people who stab other people. I can't imagine anyone liking this book. It's about the motorcycle club called the "Infidels".<br>They seem to really have a problem with other motorcycle clubs.<br>The Infidels take thier revenge on a rival motorcycle club with lead pipes, knives, and guns. It is horrible. Lots of people are killed and some are seriously wounded. One of the Infidels<br>called "Patch" carries a knife and he stabs many people. He seems to like to stab people. I was glad to finally finish the book. I put the book away in my bedroom closet. I don't think I'll want to read it again. Perhaps Sonny's next book will be less violent. I like to read stories about having fun on motorcycles. Killing people doesn't sound like fun.</span>
