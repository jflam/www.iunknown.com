                    <span>This book is all of these things and more.  This is the story of an essentially decent person fighting his own demons.  A beautifully crafted book written in the subjects own idiom. A must have for anybody wanting to get inside jazz during the be bop era.</span>

                    <span>This was the first jazz biography I have read.  Hawes does a great job of portraying the terrible effects of heroin addiction.  I knew some jazz musicians were busted for heroin use in his time.  But I didn't understand how rampant heroin use was in the industry.  This book gives great insight into the life of a wonderfully talented jazz pianist.  But more importantly, it gives insight into the tumultuous life of a drug addict.  Initially, the piano seems to be Hawes' only love.  But then there is the realization that heroin is his real love.  It is his only motivation to even play the piano.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. Remember, back then when you played this music,  it wasn't exactly a sweet world for the musicians (Black ones). I'm glad he let everyone know how hard it was out there. Drugs took this Bad Boy out the game and the world passed him by. Musicians like Brother Hawes, will never be acknowledged for their great playing in the U.S.A.<p> If there was a dumb remark in this book, I didn't see it. Again, think back to the times he was living in. He talked about Jimmy Rushing and the way he thought about things. Jimmy Rushing came out of a different era, yet Some of his thoughts were not far behind. When he described Black people, some were light skninned, some were black... The book is not dated, it's just good.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading this book very much. <p>It is first of all Hampton Hawes biography of his life as a jazz musician. It tellls us of his way from being a little boy attending his father's church on Sundays to a highly acclaimed jazz pianist, his downfall because of his heroin addiction, his 10-year jail sentence (which was reduced to six after Hawes had written to John Kennedy!), his way back up on the European market, his love relationship with Jackie, and his new found love after separating from Jackie after almost two decades. The very last sentence of the book speaks about his ex-wife Jackie - and it is very touching and shows that Hawes indeed must have been a nice man.<p>There is only one really dumb remark in the book that I felt was disgusting. (Find it for yourself... ;-))<p>Hawes repeatedly talks about Black issues. I personally feel that those statements are very intelligent, and can therefore recommend this book not only to those of you interested in jazz, but also to anyone into Black issues.</span>
