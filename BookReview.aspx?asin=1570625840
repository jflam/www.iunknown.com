                    <span>I started reading this book after reading Principles of Feng Shui by Larry Sang because I am seriously interested in the history of feng shui as a methodology for living harmoniously with the environment. Any serious reader will want to read this book and do the exercises to get a better understanding of geomancy and the way alignment can be a metaphor for spiritual and emotional "alignment" as well as moral and social. 
<br />
<br />Dilettantes and wannabes who are interested only in interior decorating or furniture placement need not apply. They should check out interior decorating books instead.
<br />
<br />I would recommend this book highly to anyone who is interested in truly learning about feng shui, the historical and authentic practice and not the watered-down, dumbed-down New Agey version of crystals and charms.</span>

                    <span>Unlike many other fengshui books, A master course in fengshui is more of a workbook instead of a quick-reference solution. Beginners will find this book useful and I would think the learning curve is manageable. Eva Wong has also highlighted some of the techniques she personally uses and coupled with the many pictures and diagrams, this is a great book that anyone interested in fengshui should get.<p>As for the 4/5 star rating, well Eva Wong's perception of the flying star interpretation is very different from other masters. Unlike most masters who analyse the sitting and facing stars, Eva looks at the base star and facing star. Some of her interpretations seemed unsafe to me like the 3/8. Nevertheless what you will learn off this book far outweighs the controversial aspects. <p>A good book to ground yourself proper in fengshui</span>

                    <span>In "A Master Course in Feng Shui", Eva Wong provides the FS novice through practitioner with substantial FS theory, application, and exercises on a wide range of subjects such as site evaluation, matching the person(s) to the building/site, space usage, & commercial layouts.  Her explanations of counter measures and enhancers are throrough and in-depth.  Ms. Wong even gracefully and successfully maneuvers the concepts of the Landform and Flying Star schools - not an easy feat.<p>From a non-FS standpoint, the concepts in this book are wonderfully organized and chunked to allow for maximum absorption.  Although this is a fairly technical book, Eva Wong manages to provide an enjoyable reading experience by infusing the book with her formal, yet coherent and logical writing style.  I absolutely love the exercises at the end of each chapter.  Unlike many adult-learning texts, she does not patronize her readers by providing easily answered questions.  On the contrary, the reader will have an accurate gauge of his/her comprehension of the pertinent material after completing the end-of-chapter exercises.<p>With the plethora of FS books on the shelves today, it is disappointing the majority of them are heavy on hype and short on substance.  Whether the authors are guilty of recycling their old, worn material continuously or penning "books" which are little more than beefed-up brochures for their workshops or schools, they all fail to deliver on the basic promise to provide their readers with genuine FS knowledge and tools. Eva Wong's "Master Course in Feng Shui" more than delivers on this promise.  In addition, her respect for her readers is evident by her dispensing of FS techniques most FS authors deem "too advanced" for their readers.  Ms. Wong actually gets that most of us are adults *gasp* and can quite nimbly grasp concepts beyond tying our own shoelaces.  So, on this alone, Ms. Wong would have gotten my kudos.<p>If you, like me, are tired of getting gypped and looking for a FS book with real meat and written by a true expert, this is the book for you.  It will be a book you will reference over and over again.  If credentials are important, Ms. Wong is a true lineage holder of the Hsüan-k'ung and practices San-yüan and San-ho.  More importantly, if you are looking for some respect as an adult and committed FS learner, then this is the book for you.  Ms. Wong is a class act and a "Master Course in Feng Shui" reflects this in every aspect.</span>

                    <span>After working through Larry Sang's "Principles of Feng Shui", I decided to check out Eva Wong's book.  It is an excellent and in depth approach to classical feng shui.  The exercises are very helpful - after doing them, you can see if you truly understood the information presented.  Her recommendations are sound and she is truly a thorough and inspired teacher.</span>

                    <span>This book is the answer when you're looking for a genuine way to improve your life with feng shui.  If you're looking for a book that provide quick fix solutions simply by moving your furnitures, clearing your clutters and placing symbols, this book is not for you.  Feng shui is much more deep than just an art of placement (which is normally last on the list).  You will have to read this book from chapter one and do the excercises to fully understand the whole concept.  It's time consumming but it's well worth the time.  Have you seen a lot of Feng Shui books that the author has spent the time to set up exercises so that the readers can have a solid understanding of what's being said? There's no second book on the market that shares with you so much knowledge (including enhancements and countermeasures) for such little price.  Of course this is not a book for a lazy person.  There is a lot of information (no fancy colored photos nor fancy printing paper) and you will find yourself reading the book over and over again and still find new information each time.  I have read so many books on Feng Shui that are in English and this book by far is only one that I recommend.  The method of working the flying stars that Eva shows in the book is the most widely used by practioners in Asia and is the most sophisticated tool of Feng shui.  Buy this book if you're serious about Feng shui.  The title "A Master Course in Feng Shui" really gives this book justice.  The book is not just for entertainment, it really is a home-study course that will give you enough confidence to work on your own Feng shui.  I am ever grateful to Dr. Eva Wong for her graciousness for sharing her invaluable knowledge on Feng Shui. Thank you so much and hopefully you will consider publishing another feng shui book in a near future.  <p>Trinh Nguyen</span>
