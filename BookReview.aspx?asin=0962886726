                    <span>I've read seemingly every 14er guide available. Much of the information overlaps as one can imagine. However, what really sets this (and the companion volume as well) one apart is the truly four season information that it provides. Louis gives you ratings for summer and snow climbs as well as ski descents. None of the other 14er guides I've read give you that. These volumes are often compared to Gerry Roach's books which are excellent in their own right. However, in my mind the information in Louis Dawson's guides is better as many of us climb in seasons other than summer!</span>

                    <span>I own many trail guide books and this one is far and above all of them. The book is logically structured, maps and photos are very helpful and directions are clear. Dawson has obvioulsy dedicated a great part of his life hiking Colorado and has documented his travels well in this book. All routes are rated and shown in pictures of the mountain. If you buy one Colorado 14er guide book, buy this one.</span>

                    <span>Finally, a book that is worth its weight in your backpack. Lou Dawson has done it right. Great photos, incredible maps and route descriptions that make sense and are easy to follow. All you have to do is compare Lou's book to any other title to the shelf to see that his book is the one to have.</span>
