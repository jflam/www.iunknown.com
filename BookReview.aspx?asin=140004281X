                <span id="Label1">Alice Munro has been accused of telling the same story over and over, and to a certain extent the characterization is true. Her subject matter is inevitably the vagaries of love between middle-aged people in some rural Canadian setting, trapped there by the combination of their desires and weaknesses. Or, if not love, then at least the mysteries of relationships as characters struggle to understand each other and themselves. But this thematic single-mindedness can hardly be considered a criticism considering Munro tells stories better than anybody else and with a level of precision matched by few. It would be like criticizing Shakespeare for writing about politics.<p>  <I>Runaway</I> is no exception. The stories take place throughout Canada--northern Ontario, the Prairies, the West Coast, Stratford--and feature women and men drifting in and out of each other's orbits, pulled by forces they don't understand. In "Runaway," a woman considers leaving her husband with the help of a neighbor, but the husband has other plans. In "Chance," a woman leaves her life behind in a quest for a man she met on a train crossing the country. Their intertwined lives play out through two more stories, "Soon" and "Silence," but the path they follow is as unpredictable to the reader as it is to them. In "Trespasses," a small town's women dream of escaping their lives only to find themselves in lives they never imagined.<p>  What really marks the stories is Munro's sense of mood. There's a sense of hidden menace or even violence everywhere in <I>Runaway</I>. It occasionally erupts, but always in surprising and unexpected ways, and with unintended consequences. Munro may be an old-fashioned storyteller, but she understands chaos theory well enough. The same story? Sure. But it's a damn good one. <I>--Peter Darbyshire, Amazon.ca</I></span>

                    <span>These stories are gorgeous, beautiful pieces with a lot of charm and bittersweet flavors. However, not one of the characters seemed someone I would identify with or care too much about. They all seemed to be controlled and as cold as their northern settings. I understand why readers would admire Munro's writing style and even enjoy these stories, which are all very carefully written with a certain wry fatalistic viewpoint. Munro's truly skilled and talented, but I like to feel a bit more for the characters I read about. I can't tell if the stories didn't live up to the hype, or if they just weren't for me. Because certainly there isn't a lot to criticize with Munro's prose. She's an astute observer and wonderful writer; these particular stories just didn't grab me as I hoped they would.</span>

                    <span>Alice Munro is a gifted writer whose multi-layered style can be enjoyed by anyone. And the short story format suits her well.
<br />
<br />In the title story, the author describes a young woman's attempt to leave her husband. Things have turned bad for the couple, compounded by the disappearance of their pet goat, Flora. The centerpiece of the collection of runaway stories is  about a woman named Juliet, the stories are titled, "Chance", "Soon" and "Silence". These stories represent Juliet's relationship with her mother and later with her daughter.
<br />
<br />The remaining stories highlight aspects of youth from a young girl's mindset and from the hindsight of an older woman. The best story is perhaps the last titled, "Powers", which is divided into titled sections. The first section begins in 1927. The last section, dating in the 1970s, describes a dream of the protagonist. In the dream, Munro writes that the past "begins to crumble behind her, to crumble and darken tenderly into something like soot and soft ash." It is this kind of observation that makes the author truly exceptional, that makes for unforgettable moments. She has written tales that illuminate human motive and behavior with piercing insight. Munro is a master of the small moment , moments that should be remembered and perhaps some events that sould be forgotton.</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I've ever read by Munro, and it far exceeded my expectations. That said, this wonderful collection is also more than capable of breaking your heart.The title story was my least favorite of the collection,instead loving the surprising and superior "Tricks", which left me with a lingering ache. All of the stories run on a somewhat familiar terrain of love, longing, regret,and betrayal, three of the eight centering on the same woman at different stages of her life. The stories are painful in their honest representations of the heart. Yet that's what also makes it such terrific writing </span>

                    <span>	Munro is an extremely gifted writer who has the unique talent of keeping a woman's life in focus from adolescence to senescence. She plumbs the depths of her characters' emotional lives and finds beautiful expressive language at the same time. In the first story in this collection, "Runaway," a surprise ending shows how a husband can wreak revenge on his abused wife when she returns after leaving him unexpectedly. 
<br />
<br />	In the first of my favorite set of stories, "Chance," Juliet, a young Classics teacher leading a stunted life in Ontario, takes a fateful train ride and encounters a man from B.C. whose wife is dying; she later starts an unorthodox relationship with him but learns he already has a woman, Christa. (Many of Munro's characters are teachers or scholars.) "In the town where she grew up her sort of intelligence was often put in the same category as a limp or an extra thumb, and people had been quick to point out the expected accompanying drawbacks--her inability to run a sewing machine or tie up a neat parcel, or notice that her slip was showing. What would become of her, was the question." In a store, a woman says, "So that's the girl who talks Latin."
<br />
<br />	The story is continued in "Soon," which concerns Juliet's trip home with her baby daughter, Penelope. It is 1969. She takes leave of Christa, who has become her friend. When they get there, Juliet finds her mother dying of heart trouble and her father tied down by manual labor after being fired as a teacher for being too outspoken. The story ends in "Silence," with time speeded up. Penelope, first adolescent and then grown, disappears from her mother's life without explanation, and Juliet's live-in companion, Eric, drowns; Christa becomes her best friend but then falls ill. Munro explores both the heartaches and the walling-in of emotions these events cause, and how Juliet continues through the years remaining to her. 
<br />
<br />	The remaining stories in the collection tell of an encounter between a woman and a sexy alcoholic, a trip up a country road to scatter someone's ashes, two Shakespearean parodies about mix-up of twins, and the life-stream of a woman who marries the wrong man and whose friend has powers of second sight about the right one. Several stories contain women characters who seem hard and rigid and disapproving, but always for an inner reason, a burden of pain.
<br />
<br />	Munro almost literally has her finger on the pulse of people's hearts. For that reason alone, I can't do justice to her work. It's just something in which you immerse yourself.

                    <span>"Runaway" is a compilation of short stories that can be very sad, I'll say that up front.  There wasn't a happy ending in the bunch.  Still, Alice Munrow captures the souls of the women in her stories, truly revealing their vulnerability, their hearts laid bare.  As she does this, she seems to get inside your thoughts and makes you look closer at your own life. 
<br />"Tricks", the most notable story, still occupies space in my mind..  It's a story of a chance meeting, hope, anticipations, despair, and then possibly, understanding.  All this takes place between just a few short pages which I find amazing.
<br />
<br /> I think this book is about discovering yourself.  Alice Munrow has a knack for making you look deep inside yourself and ask some hard questions AND she does it while entertaining you. I highly recommend "Runaway" if you're the type to stay put and take at look at your own life.</span>
