                    <span>Quite possibly one of the best guidebooks ever written about a National Park. Steve Medley, president of the Yosemite Association, shares his 30 years of park experience with Yosemite newcomers and old-timers alike. The book is affordable, light-weight, and includes nearly everything a visitor may need to know about the park. The author pays close attention to detail, is quite humorous, and looks great in a speedo. I would recommend this book to anyone visiting Yosemite National Park</span>

                    <span>Hi All, I read this book from cover to cover and highlighted the entire time. I went with my friends Amy and Dave to Yosemite in May 2001. We had my son (3 at the time) and their two kids (2 and 8 months at the time) in tow. I wanted to be ready with information which I never really did get to give out a tour guide as I had planned(funny thing about kids, they have other ideas of what to do in the car other than hear all about Yosemite and John Muir).The book came with a sheet of updated info which I did copy into my copy of the guide. I was directed to write for a better map than is provided in the book. Well, I never received it...ever! That was my only disappointment. I would like to see the Yosemite with kids section expanded for future travelers with small kids. I recommend you get this guide!</span>

                    <span>This is the best guidebook to Yosemite I've seen. The guide is well written, easy to read and full of useful and interesting facts about visiting the park. Mr. Medley obviously knows his subject, and his insightful and humorous observations make this an enjoyable read. Not only does it include how-to information for visiting the park, but also sections on Yosemite history, geology and wildlife. If you are planning to visit Yosemite, make this your first purchase.</span>

                    <span>I love Yosemite and I'm glad I got this book because not only will this book give you details on all the available campgrounds in the park, it also info on hikes, tips on how to avoid unwanted visits by local residents (bears, deer, wolves, etc.) and places to go to avoid the summer crowds in the Valley.<P>Another plus? Fits nicely in your daypack!</span>
