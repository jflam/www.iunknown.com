                    <span>The DeLorme Nevada Atlas & Gazetteer is useful if you're planning to travel off of Nevada's main highways. But there's a notable flaw that I hope DeLorme will correct in future printings. The atlas shows many spots, represented by a black diamond as a "City or Town" according to the key on the inside front cover, that are no such thing. Some of those places are deserted. Others may have a house or two but no services. You may run out of gas if you rely solely on this atlas.<P>Take, for example, page 62 in the current edition. The hamlet of Hiko is listed in large type; you'd think it has every convenience. But the 2000-2001 edition of the Nevada Official Highway Map, published by the state's department of transportation, shows that Hiko has no services at all. On the same page of the atlas you'll find Logan and Crescent. Neither "City or Town" appears on the official highway map, and the atlas itself shows that Crescent connects to the outside world by the tiniest road -- probably a rough dirt track. On the facing page (page 63) you'll find Uvada, in large type, just across the Utah state line. The last time I drove by Uvada, in 2001, the place consisted of a railroad siding; I didn't see a single dwelling, much less any services.<P>Similarly, roads that appear to be modern thoroughfares according to the key are sometimes not paved. If you're familiar with Nevada, you'll know instinctively which ones are likely to be and which are not. But if you're visiting from New York or California, again beware.<P>Outside of Reno, the Carson City-Lake Tahoe area, and Las Vegas, Nevada is spectacularly empty, with lonely, starlit, sometimes snowy valleys that may contain a few hundred people in an area the size of Connecticut. Public services in those places are few and far between. Most roads are unpaved. Do not rely on the DeLorme atlas for the location of urban amenities, or even a gas station. Rather, obtain the official state road map. The 2000-2001 version that I have shows which places have services and which do not. And it shows which roads are paved and which likely are not.<P>These comments pertain to the third edition (2000) of the atlas. I hope that it will be updated and that my observations will become obsolete.</span>

                    <span>I use the Delorme Gazetteers, including this one, for planning my fishing trips every year. They include comprehensive coverage of the state in question with sufficient detail to identify all the major topological features one will find, including streams and lakes. Also, they show all the roads. One criticism is that they don't contain road mileages between locations, unlike a highway atlas. But, a highway atlas will not show topographic coutour lines, or indicate locations where one may launch kayaks or rafts, or show locations reputed to have good fishing. I keep a Delorme Gazetteer for each state in which I expect to travel on any extended drive. They enable me to find campgrounds (in the indexes and shown on the maps), roads, topography, and all the essentials to plan a trip.</span>

                    <span>Delorme's Nevada Atlas and Gazeteer does not approach the quality of its other western states atlases. Users will be disappointed to discover that contour lines are rarely labelled. There is no distance scale, either on the pages or in the key - an oversight which would produce an automatic 'F' in introductory cartography. Furthermore, land ownership status is not indicated on the maps by color coding as with other atlases - instead there is only a single statewide page which is essentially useless. Finally, the maps on each page run to the edge with approximately a half-inch overlap between pages. Although convenient for inexperienced map users - it is a source of frustration for those with greater map experience. If you really need a Nevada atlas, then get this one. Otherwise, wait until Delorme reissues a new edition correcting its most serious flaws.</span>

                    <span>As other reviewers have noted, some roads were poorly marked "other state route or major connector"; when we got to some of these roads they were dirt, and labelled "unmaintained" and "use at own risk". In addition, I am fairly sure that some of the roads marked on the maps do not exist. We looked for a couple of turnoffs off SR 160, twice going back and forth where they were supposed to be, without seeing them.<P>This inadequate accuracy made the atlas worse than useless, since it cost money and time.</span>

                    <span>Travelers from outside Nevada may assume that a town name on the map means a place to buy gas. This is not always true for small towns in rural Nevada. Often a small town shown on the map will only be an abandonded cafe. Small towns that are still inhabited often have no gas. Use this map to find wonderful and seldom visited sites in Nevada, and be sure to fill up when you come to a big town, like Ely or Tonapah.</span>
