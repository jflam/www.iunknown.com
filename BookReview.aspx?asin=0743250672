                <span id="Label1">Back in 1993, editor-turned-designer Kate Spade made a splash in the fashion world by turning out a small collection of boxy, utilitarian handbags, each elegantly accented with her name stitched in discreet, lowercase letters. As a result, the simplicity and unabashed refinement of the Spade moniker on those Lilliputian labels has come to define the very foundation on which the designer has since built a fashion empire, one that now, in addition to handbags, includes shoes, clothing, and smart home things, all of which embody the Spade formula of timeless style--a seamless merging of cheerful colors, clean shapes, and well-chosen embellishments. Not bad for a Kansas City-born girl who used to comb vintage stores for fun. Having perfected and expertly marketed her own brand of personal style (one that has famously been counterfeited throughout the world), the designer has emerged with an equally elegant trio of books whose topics Spade has become a virtual authority:  <I>Style</I>, <I>Occasions</I>, and <I>Manners</I>. <p>  The packaging, as well as the neatly clipped advice found in <I>Style</I>, is as polished and sunny as the pert designer herself. Spade draws pearls of wisdom from fashion greats like Diana Vreeland and Coco Chanel, and also employs the inspiration of iconic films, books, artists, and design movements. The layout and typography, while vibrant, can be overwhelming at times and her suggestions a bit old-fashioned ("&#133;if you have to wiggle into something, assume it won't flatter you."). But <I>Style</I> still stands out as a treasure in itself. From "forever" clothes like full skirts and jewel-neck sweaters to playing around with color combinations and cocktail rings, Spade has captured a place for herself in the modern fashion vernacular. And <I>Style</I> is a suitably chic way to celebrate her arrival. <I>--Christene Barberich</I></span>

                    <span>I bought this book expecting more fashion tips. There are several useless facts about how Kate finds style in everyday objects. The book was interesting even though it wasn't what I expected. If you really want a book about fashion and only fashion I would heed the words of other reviews. If you decide to get the book I recommend waiting for the paperback or buying a used version.</span>

                    <span>I'm a fashion design student and bought this book hoping to glean some information from it, however, I found nothing worth my while in the entire book. This is basically an inventory of what Kate Spade thinks is great about her own wardrobe and doesn't tap into any longstanding style concepts. <P>It strikes me as being very self-indulgent on her part. As if we all care what her favorite colors and shoes are. Beyond tittering on about her own wardrobe, she makes mention of a few style standards, but ones we already heard of a million times, like how great Audrey Hepburn's look is in Breakfast at Tiffany's.<P>Don't waste your money on this one!!</span>

                    <span>I must be missing something but I cannot for the life of me figure out what makes Kate Spade a "style icon". This little book is just that, a little, nothing book. Kate Spade will never have the style or class of Jacqueline Kennedy or Audrey Hepburn. She is nothing more then a little WASP princess who happened to design a handbag that people now go into debt to buy! Having read the book and watched her segment on the "Oprah" show I can honestly say that I fail to see her style. Her home is a total color disaster and looks as if it was decorated out of a rubbish heap. Save your money on this book and if you must read it, borrow it from the library!</span>

                    <span>Kate and Andy blew this opportunity by producing a painfully anemic brag book which is less of a style manual and more of an inventory of Kate's wardrobe. If you already love fashion and know something about it, there's nothing new in this insipid read. Vapid quotes from Andy such as "When a shoe is pretty or elegant it communicates to me that the woman is pretty sexy" help rob this brief read of any real thought given to the concept of style, making it more like a free-association of passing thoughts on the subject.</span>
