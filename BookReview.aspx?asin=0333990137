                <span id="Label1"><div>This book is about building and delivering great customer experiences. Many companies neglect this, but the physical execution and emotional impact of customer experiences, companies and brands may ultimately determine customer satisfaction and loyalty and commercial success. With the use of compelling examples and cases the authors show that this is key for all companies and organizations.<br><br>"There are not many people who understand the new paradigm of the Customer Experience. The emerging gurus on the subject are Colin Shaw and John Ivens with their holistic approach. We will all have to embrace the paradigm they are unlocking and focus on our Customer Experience if we are to be successful in the future. At Microsoft we understand the importance of this and are committing ourselves to this new world." <br><br>Steve Harvey, Director of People, Profits & Loyalty, Microsoft <br><br>"Many business books look at new companies and how they have become successful. This book bases itself in the reality in which most business people find themselves daily &#8211; working in companies which have been established for some time and who are faced with legacy systems, legacy processes, legacy people, legacy channels and an existing culture. It focuses on how you can change an existing organisation in order to build and deliver Great Customer Experiences. Shaw and Ivens are the gurus of the Customer Experience. Whilst we have all recognised the importance of service in the past, their book moves business thinking on apace. It is about more than just customer service, it is about the whole Customer Experience. Their 7 Philosophies for Building Great Customer Experiences explicitly outline the building blocks that are the foundation of good business." <br><br>Liam Lambert, Director & General Manager, Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London <br><br>"John and Colin&#8217;s innovative approach deserves applause - their thought leading book is at the cutting edge. Their 7 Philosophies for Building Great Customer Experiences underpin Hilton&#8217;s own philosophy on how to delight our customers. My endorsement reflects the importance I personally place on the Customer Experience". <br><br>Mike Ashton, Senior Vice President, Hilton International Hotels <br><br>"This book hits the strikezone of how marketers, and organizations overall, need to be thinking to win today. It's a clear roadmap for building a high performance organization crystallized around the customer. Importantly, Shaw and Ivens recognize that emotions are at the core of all relationships -- it's no different with customers than our family & friends -- and truly engaging and successful brands." <br><br>Barry Herstein, Chief Marketing Officer, Financial Times Group, New York <br><br>"The Customer Experience will be a critical differentiator in today's commoditising economy. Colin and John's thought provoking book is essential reading for anyone wishing to create engaging and memorable Customer Experiences. This simple and readable book is littered with the views and thoughts of senior business leaders on the Customer Experience. It not only explains the theory of the Customer Experience but also provides practical advice and insights on how you can begin building and delivering Great Customer Experiences". <br><br>Peter Scott, Customer Service Director, T-Mobile <br><br></div></span>

                    <span>It takes a great deal of effort to write any book, even a bad one, so I hate to be excessively critical, but I found very little value in this book. Despite its intriguing title, I don't think anyone will gain from reading this book, unless they are a prospective client of the authors' consulting firm, Beyond Philosophy, and would like a peek at the vendor's approach. (There's no escaping the shadow of the authors' consultancy within these pages. I know consultants write books to get noticed, but this one is more like something you would create just so you could hand it out to clients.) <P>At its best, this book repeats marketing dogma. More often, though, it simply misses. You can usually count on a book like this for some valuable anecdotes, if nothing else, but even the authors' anecdotes don't always make the intended point (as near as I could tell). It really needs a substantial reorganization, starting with a framework that would help the authors decide what is important and what is trivial, and then a solid edit.<P>In my opinion, this book is probably not what you're looking for. For example, you'd think that a book about "Building Great Customer Experience" would at least define "customer experience." But no--the authors say that people are usually better off figuring this out for themselves. You'll be much happier, for example, with Lasalle and Britton's (2003) Priceless: Turning Ordinary products into Extraordinary Experiences.</span>

                    <span>This book helps tie together all the parts of developing a business plan. Before I read this book, I was struggling with writing a business plan for a new business. The hardest thing for me was putting all the pieces together in a coherant structure. This book provides the missing piece that every business needs to have in order to produce results that are lasting and memoriable. GREAT FOCUSING TOOL!</span>

                    <span>I've started to see lots of commentators, conference speakers and consultants talking about the Customer Experience. But none of them come anywhere near these guys for a holistic and in-depth treatment of the subject. Their book provides the intellectual rigour, as well as advice which is clearly based on practical experience, that is missing from so many Customer Service and Customer Experience books.</span>
