                    <span>In the first chapter, de Roos poses four questions designed to convince the reader that real estate investing is superior to other kinds of investing. The first question is: "How many dollars' worth of stock can you buy with $100,000 cash?" The answer, according to de Roos, is that $100,000 cash will generally buy you only $100,000 worth of stock. He says investment houses will only let you buy "a very limited number of stocks" on margin and "then only for about 30 percent of the value of the stocks." I have never encountered a stock that I have not been able to buy on margin through my Schwab account. Furthermore, I can margin up to 50 percent. Besides, the reason why Schwab won't let me use more leverage is because IT'S RISKY. de Roos then goes on to suggest that you can easily get a loan to buy a $1 million property by putting down just $100,000. How is this less risky than buying stocks on margin? de Roos says: "[You] have an asset worth $1 million that would generate rental income for you. If you had bought wisely, then the rent would more than cover your expenses." Well, what happens if you "had not bought wisely?" What happens if you can't find tenants? What happens if the economy goes south right after you bought? All one needs to do is drive up and down Highway 101 in Silicon Valley and look at all the "For Lease" signs to realize that vacancies are a fact of life.
<br />
<br />Consider, for example, the case of Mission West Properties (AMEX-MSW), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that, according to its most recent 10-K, "acquires, markets, leases, and manages Research and Development ("R&D") properties, primarily located in the Silicon Valley portion of the San Francisco Bay Area." In a recent conference call, MSW's management reported that the bursting of the Internet bubble will cause vacancy rates in their R&D properties to approach 40% over the next year. The only reason why MSW may survive is because they are only moderately leveraged. For example, their ratio of mortgage debt to shareholder equity is a modest 2.35 to 1. If, on the other hand, MSW had a debt/equity ratio of 9 to 1, as they would if they had followed de Roos' advice and purchased properties by borrowing $9 for every $1 of their own funds, quite obviously it would be very difficult for them to remain a going concern in an environment of 40% vacancy rates; they would soon be overwhelmed by interest payments.
<br />
<br />It seems, then, as if de Roos' first chapter is based on two very dubious assumptions: 1.) it is difficult to persuade your stock broker to loan you any money so you can buy stocks on margin, but it is easy as pie to persuade your local bank to loan you 90% of the purchase price of an investment property; 2.) using leverage is risky if you are buying stocks, but not if you are buying real estate. If the first chapter of the book is filled with such nonsense, the rest of the book can't be much better. I didn't even bother to read any further.

                    <span>This book can give you incredible insight on what the real estate industry is all about, through the eyes of Dolf De Roos.  A very indepth book about real estate that may come off confusing at first, but will all fall in place at the end...or conclusion of the book.

<br />A must buy and a must read! </span>

                    <span>Roos is part real estate investor, part cheerleader.  If real estate investing were as simple as getting excited about real estate investing then we'd read this book, leave our 9-5s, and, ahhh, riches.  Real Estate Riches inspires me to invest in real estate the way Bruce Lee inspired me as a kid to become a kung fu master.  It's great to dream about, but the hard work between the dream and the reality is usually enough dissuade.
<br />
<br />His basic plan-of-action is 1) use as little of your money as possible and as much of the bank's money, to, 2) --he skips this part about how hard it is it find and identify a positive cash flow property, then, 3) buy a place that continues to increase in value, while it simultaneously delivers cash in your pocket each month, and finally, 4) when you need more money to invest, drain the equity from your property and repeat.
<br />
<br />I think the best advice he gives, and the one insight you might find to be part of the real work of real estate investing, is the 100:10:3:1 rule.  Look at _100_ properties, make offers on 10, negotiate financing on 3, and you MAY buy 1.  Real estate investing is hard work.  Roos show you all of the glamour, but little of the daily grind that's involved to make it happen for yourself.  
<br />
<br />For a more balanced approach see Real Estate Investing, 4th edition by McLean and Eldred.

                    <span>This is a good book to really inspire a new reader.  
<br />However, its tough to overlook the gross distortions that the author makes.  
<br />
<br />For example, he makes a huge argument to start the book off saying how you can't use leverage in the stock market.  Well, most of the companies you invest in will use debt for you let alone trading on margin.  Furthermore, he fails to realize that not all stocks have giant swings.  
<br />
<br />Thats just what he fails to mention.  On top of that, some of the numbers he does use are needlessly exagerated.  A 400 dollar paint job?  Wake up Dolf, unless your hiring illegal immigrants I dont think thats going to raise property value much.  
<br />
<br />I think the author does make some good points... but his distortions make me extremely wary, if im investing in property i dont want the glitz and glamour I want to know the risks in order to make an informed decision.  </span>
