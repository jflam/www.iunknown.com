                    <span>Tripp offers an intriguing thesis -- Lincoln's fundamental
<br />homosexuality -- that can be useful in understanding and
<br />explaining many of the most difficult aspects of his character.
<br />Lincoln's famed melancholy, his evident sorrows, and his stormy
<br />marriage and difficult family life can be readily explained and
<br />perhaps rightly understood in the light of this premise.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, though Tripp's conclusions make a great deal of
<br />sense from a psychological perspective, I do not find them
<br />wholly convincing.  This is possibly an inherent scepticism I
<br />have with pyshological explanations of historical figures:  I
<br />am unsure and unconvinced that what we know now about
<br />pyschology must always hold true for the past (it was a
<br />different context, and thus quite similar manifestations may
<br />have quite dissimilar causes while similar causes may have very
<br />dissimilar manifestations.)
<br />
<br />My scepticism is also due to my training as a historian.  While
<br />a pyschologist may well be allowed (perhaps MUST be allowed) to
<br />make great conclusions from scant evidence, a historian
<br />generally should not be.  Tripp offers a goodly body of
<br />evidence about the relationship between Lincoln and Speed (one
<br />that I find persuasive, even.)  But he draws a great deal of
<br />inference from a small body of evidence for other examples.
<br />And Tripp relys upon a style of argumentation which I cannot
<br />abide: "Since we know my premise to be true, all this that
<br />follows must be true."  This is a common tact in psychological
<br />writing starting with Freud, at least, but it fails to convince
<br />me.
<br />
<br />Were Tripp to have offered the text as a history paper in a
<br />class of mine, I'd've told him to get more data or moderate his
<br />conclusions.  My feeling is that Tripp's case deserves Scotland's
<br />so-called "(...) verdict:" neither "guilty" nor "not guilty,"
<br />Tripp's case remains "not proven."
<br />
<br />Still, this work adds a useful dimension to Lincoln scholarship
<br />and provides a worthwhile starting point for future exploration.
<br />
<br />I much appreciate the book's presentation with its introduction
<br />by Mary Todd Lincoln's biographer Jean Baker and its two
<br />afterwards, both pro and con.  These enhance the book's value to
<br />both the scholar and the casual reader.</span>

                    <span>OK, the author has found a few instances of behaviour, that do suggest, by modern standards at least, Lincoln may be gay ......... Although I can't help thinking his enemies (North& South) would of made much more of it at the time.  During the 19C this was criminal behaviour.
<br />
<br />Other biographers suggest he was racist.  By modern standards he was. But he was revolutionary for his time.....
<br />
<br />So what? Lincoln was alive in the 19th Century, not the 21st.  His behaviour was not unusual by the standards of his day.  The author has found some evidence he might be gay,or bisexual, but does it really make any difference to his accomplishments (or faults)?
<br />
<br />NO!!
<br />
<br />This is a well written, (apparently) well researched book.  It isn't a page turner though.  When I finished reading this book, I couldn't help thinking what does it really add???
<br />
<br />Post Script: Just a few thoughts after reading the next review; without reference to DSM IV it is easy to understand why Lincoln suffered bouts of melancholy (depression); he lost a son, had problems with subordinates at work, in particular, performance issues (e.g. General George B. McClellan), and was regarded as a social inferior by many (frequently referred to as the Illinois Ape); including the in-laws.  And running for a second term, while significant Union casualties are being suffered can't of been easy!  Repressed (even if the author is right) homosexuality pails in comparison........
<br />
<br />On reading this account of Lincoln's life you do not have to be a JD to conclude that if written in his lifetime, Lincoln could have won any libel action outright (by contemporary or 19C standards).  
<br />
<br />As for being convicted in a criminal court, the case presented certainly does not make the standard for Scotland's "not proven"; this verdict isn't a substitution for not guilty.  It is used when there is considerable doubt as to the innocence of the accused.  Based on this book, there is significant doubt of guilt (the case is week).  It would probably be hard to get even a Texan jury to convict .......

                    <span>C.A. Tripp's valedictory study of Abraham Lincoln has raised predictable ire from self-styled patriots and right-wingers who recoil in horror at the idea that one of America's most beloved icons might have had lustful thoughts about other men and acted on them, specifically with Captain Derickson, a handsome military man and Lincoln's bodyguard; and Joshua Speed, with whom Lincoln shared a bed for no less than four years. In truth, the evidence Tripp presents, though often strong, is not irrefutable. In addition, the published text suffers from structural and editing problems due to the death of its author soon after the manuscript's completion. Tripp would undoubtedly have cleaned up some sentence fragments and other bits of untidy writing; he might also have reconsidered the somewhat haphazard construction of the book, which begins as more or less a chronological account of Lincoln's early life and abruptly switches to a series of almost self-contained essays concerning his relationships with various people, including his wife (a truly harrowing portrait) and other women, concluding with broader views at Lincoln's  attitudes toward sex and religion.
<br />
<br />However unsatisfying their arrangement, these chapters are full of interest that is not the least bit prurient--they paint a portrait of the man that is no less compelling for being not a bit like the marbelized figure most Americans carry in their mind from elementary school mythologizing. Indeed, considering the portrait that Tripp paints of a conflicted, frequently deeply depressed man, caught in a singularly loveless marriage to a harridan, with a fundamentally bleak view of life quite at odds with conventional Christian piety, Lincoln's indelible accomplishments as a statesman are all the more remarkable and moving. Whether or not he was gay in the modern sense ultimately becomes irrelevant--Lincoln in these pages emerges as a human being. All of the homophobic rantings of the book's detractors (including many of the reviewers below) cannot erase this singular achievement. 
<br />
<br />I believe "The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln" will eventually take its place beside "The Homosexual Matrix" as one of the cornerstones of serious writing and research about alternative sexuality.</span>

                    <span>First Lerone Bennett, who in a book full of falsehoods, lies, and opinions tried to label Abraham Lincoln a "Racist".
<br />
<br />Now, C.A. Tripp, who is no longer with us to share his "wonderful beliefs" says that the evidence proves Lincoln to be Gay, or at least Bisexual because he shared a bunk with men.
<br />
<br />HELLO!
<br />
<br />I don't know if C.A. Tripp was Gay himself - and wanted to make Lincoln a "Gay" icon. Just like countless Hollyweird biographers are still trying to label Randolph Scott Gay because he shared a house with Cary Grant and were friendly towards each other. 
<br />HELLO AGAIN - they ended their lives as happily married men with children...
<br />
<br />The fact of the matter is this: During the 19th Century and into the 20th Century men in rooming houses and cabins often did share bunks and beds, and cowboys out in the plains huddled together in sleeping bags in the extreme cold. There was NOTHING sexual or "dirty" about that.
<br />
<br />Also, yes, Lincoln was awkward around women. Many men who grew up on the frontier, and remember, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky were the frontier at the beginning of the 19th century, were awkward around women. And he did enjoy the company of men. So What!
<br />
<br />Tripp could have made a very compelling case - as many others have over the weak and effeminate James Buchanan. But this is nothing more than innuendo and a nasty swipe at our most beloved President. Don't bother with this - do yourself a big favor and buy a copy of "The Eloquent President" instead.</span>

                    <span>Anyone lightly dismissing C. A. Tripp's The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln (2005) should keep in mind that Tripp, a former Kinsey researcher, was also the author of the astute, ground-breaking The Homosexual Matrix (1975), a comprehensive study which had almost as much to say that was new about heterosexuality as it did about its title subject.  
<br />
<br />Tripp died in 2003, before completing the final manuscript of The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln, and, as his publisher notes, it is likely--probably very likely--that Tripp would have continued to work on the project.
<br />
<br />In its present form, despite a sound introduction by Mary Todd Lincoln scholar Jean Baker and brief "reactions and comments" by two historians and a psychologist, The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln, while interesting, is scattered, fragmentary, and unpersuasive. 
<br />
<br />Tripp makes a number of obvious mistakes while building his thesis that Lincoln was predominantly homosexual (stressing, for example, that Lincoln's habit of closing his letters to Joshua Fry Speed with the words "yours forever" was significant, when, in fact, Lincoln closed his letters to many people with those words) and, unsurprisingly, offers no unequivocal proof. 
<br />
<br />Tripp partially bases his conclusions on the fact that Lincoln willingly shared beds with two different men--close friend Joshua Fry Speed and bodyguard C. M. Derickson--for extended periods over the course of his life. But only an objective, lengthy, and exhaustive study of the sleeping habits of the period--during which entire pioneer families often shared beds and lived together in tiny, cramped, and cold one-room cabins--could genuinely shed light on whether or not Lincoln's behavior was in any way telling or unusual. Since adolescent brothers and sisters often slept together, and mothers and fathers with their children, a study of the records of frontier incest, if any, would also be instructive. 
<br />
<br />Tripp's conclusion that Lincoln experienced puberty at the remarkably young age of nine--thus making him ripe for early, perhaps homosexual, physical encounters--is another matter which can be widely interpreted, depending on how an individual chooses to read the evidence. Tripp's statement that Lincoln, via self-manipulation, had "already arrived at his own powerful pleasures of orgasm...and loved it" is clearly nothing but speculation. 
<br />
<br />Like the body of the text, the conflicting contributions by Jean Baker, Michael Burlingame, Michael B. Chesson, and Alice Fennessey fluctuate between bedrock fact, common sense, personal if educated opinion, speculation, and assumption. 
<br />
<br />Since even the matter of whether Lincoln's well-documented marriage was a happy or a miserable one cannot be agreed upon by Lincoln scholars, there seems little hope that there will ever be accord regarding the more obscure--and exceedingly controversial--matter of his sexual nature. By the book's end, it is impossible to arrive at an assured, rational conclusion about any of its specific topics, and thus the reasonable assumption that Lincoln was heterosexual, or predominantly so, will most likely continue to hold sway. 
<br />
<br />The overall impression the book enforces is that human sex and gender studies are, sadly, still in their formative stages. As Camille Paglia wrote in Vamps & Tramps (1994), "At the end of the Christian millennium and the century of Freud, sex is still shrouded in mystery. A question mark hangs over every important sexual issue. Despite bitter public controversy and heated private debate, we have no answers. Indeed, we have barely begun to formulate the questions accurately."
