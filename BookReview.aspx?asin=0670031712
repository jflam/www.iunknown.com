                    <span>Nice pictures of great quality and angles. They, however, after the first few pictures, get repetitive. If you have seen the first half a dozen, then you have seen most of them. The same smoking buildings, hazy skyline and gloomy skies - in several dozen different angles! 
<br />  
<br />A decent book to buy secondhand for less than 2 or 3 dollars. Not worth buying brand new. </span>

                    <span>The photos are the best on the area.  The one that scared me was the one where Dave takes a picture of himself in the glass and then a few seconds later a beam falls where he was just standing.  The photos of the jet pieces all over the ground and the thick dust that was everywhere makes it all real and all the more haunting and terrible.  But we must have these in front of us, because what happens, we forget.  Let's not forget.  Those people don't deserve that.  </span>

                    <span>If you live or used to live somewhere in the New York area, you might have a grim desire for a book that shows exactly how the WTC attacks affected specific shops, buildings, blocks, etc. that you knew and loved, not just how terrible the effects were in general.<p>The NYPD book shows how the attacks affected the little sailboats in the marinas near the WTC, what the attacks did to the daycare center, what the "bad side" of the Winter Garden looked like, etc.</span>

                    <span>In the immediate aftermath of the 911 attacks of 2001, a group of photographs, taken by members of the press, were run and rerun over the media. This book contains a collection of photographs that were not immediately available to the press, these were the pictures taken by the men and women of the New York Police Department. This book contains 192 pages of color pictures that show the horror, the hope and the determination seen at Ground Zero that day. If you are interested in what happened that day, and want to see photos that you have never seen before, then I highly recommend this book to you!</span>
