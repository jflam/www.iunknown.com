                    <span>I use it constantly. I use the indexes all the time too. Over 26,000 reviews and sometimes long, comprehensive ones. Most of the reviews are right on the money or very close.I can honestly say that i have rarely strongly disagreed with it's opinion. I love the fact that the book will give a perfect 4 bones to a small ,largely unknown newer movie like "Spider" or how when he loves a movie he doen't have to wait to say it is great, like "Road to Perdition." However i do have one HUGE complaint, and i can't get over it. How in the hell is Matin Scorsese 1976 Masterpiece "Taxi Driver" not worthy of 4 bones, atleast 3 and a half bones. Even a good but in hindsight certainly not great movie like "Driving Miss Daisy" gets 3 and a half bones. Now that's crazy. Oh well ,besides that i have to say i absolutely can't imagine my film watching life without this book.</span>

                    <span>I am a movie fan. That's an understatement. But the fact is, I can answer almost any question about any movie made after 1975. And when I can't, I go to the Golden Movie Retreiver, because it always knows the answer. Don't go crazy wondering who that one guy was in that one movie with Patrick Swayze. It's Emilio Estevez. But if I wasn't here to tell you, the Golden Movie Retriever would have been able to help you out.</span>

                    <span>This movie guide seems to have info on a whole lot of movies. The reviews are not especially long or in-depth (they're about two paragraphs for most movies, longer for major or important films), but they give you enough info to know what the movie is like and I find that MOST of the time I agree with what they have to say. There may be some movies it doesn't cover, but I spent some time trying to think of ones that wouldn't be in it, and it wasn't easy.<P>But, to me the best part of this book is that it's fun to read. The bad movies get slammed in a creative fashion (in one movie, they "ride the one joke premise like a rented Ferrari"), and there are jokes, etc. And in addition to indexes of actors, directors, etc., they have a list of categories, some of which are pretty specific and some of which are entertaining, like "Korean War", "Farming", "Phobias", "Stolen from Europe" (American remakes of European films), "Tennis", "Venice", "Scared 'Chuteless" (Skydiving without one piece of important equipment), etc.<P>I also have the electronic version (for the Palm handheld) made by pocketsensei.com, which is nice because the actual paper book is the size of phone book and not too portable. The Palm version, of course, fits in your pocket, and I take my Palm with me most of the time, so I can refer to it while I am in Blockbuster or at Best Buy to buy a video or whatever. (You can read the back of the DVD box, but since 100% of them say the movie is awesome, that's pretty worthless.)</span>

                    <span>This is the best movie guide available today, not so much because of its reviews (they're as generally reliable but opinionated as any other guide) but because of the massive amount of indexes, which go way beyond other guides. Definitely worth purchasing as a physical companion of sorts to the online Internet Movie Database (imdb.com).</span>
