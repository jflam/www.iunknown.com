                    <span>This book contains very clear introductions on how SQL server 2000 works, what are the important design considerations for creating a database, and has tutorials on the various tuning tools.  As an introduction on SQL Server workings, it is very good.  However, it is also very light on how to actually monitor and tune a real system.  The tuning checklist is generic and many of the items are only applicable to designers, not someone who administers databases that may have been in existance for years.  If you read the entire book, you can pick out handy items, but it does not give tuning examples, does not tell when to get concerned over particular parameters, nor go into which parameters (from the many supplied by the performance monitor) are really the important ones.  As such, I did not find it much help in my daily activities as a DBA.  I found "SQL Server 2000 for Experienced DBAs" by Brian Knight to be much more helpful.</span>

                    <span>I read this book online at ACM (by books 24x7) and was impressed with the clarity of Ken England's writing style. Finding a good reference on how SQL Server treats clustered and nonclustered indexes is no easy task, since most of the time a clustered index is described recursively (e.g. a clustered index is an an index that clusters data) and a nonclustered index is also defined based on not being clustered. That's useless. Ken makes it very clear what these differences are in terms of the data structures used, and more importanly helps you understand the ramifications. Reading this book has given me a black belt understanding of the Query Optimizer and Indexes. In fact, my first project after reading this book resulted taking a long running 8 hour query written by someone else and turning it into a 5 minute query. Needless to say I am purchasing a physical copy. Thanks Ken!</span>

                    <span>I would say this this is one of my favorite SQL Server books and I have alot. If you want plain english internals, query optimization, information on locking and the things to think about when you are designing a new system or improving an old one, then Ken England has the book for you. I agree with another reader that this book reads like Ken is in the room talking to you. What is my favorite part...the part on the default data cache which if you are a Sybase DBA or a guy from way back this is something that they teach you right away and you would configure yourself along with the stored procedure cache. In SQL 2000 they are integrated and have been for a while but Ken does a real nice job of explaining them so that you can understand the need for memory how things come in and out of memory etc. I also like how he gets you to ask yourself the same questions that he asks himself, " Is this going to cause a locking problem in the future." I would say that If you want a book that is down and dirty to the point for every DBA to learn about and understand sql server and how to optimize it, look no further all of the essentials that you wished that you had known years ago are here. While there are other good authors out there like, Kalen Delaney, Rob Vieira, Mike Otey, Ken Henderson, etc.. This book is in the catagory of.. You need to have it and know everything in it. Any DBA worth their weight would own this book.</span>

                    <span>...This covers what some of the other tuning books covers - but every book shows you something the others don't. This book showed me quite a few undocumented commands and tips I didn't get from other books.<p>I think what I liked best about it was the writing style. It doesn't read like a technical manual or textbook... it reads more like Ken England is talking to you personally. He explains concepts and techniques in a way that even I could understand. I highly recommend this book.</span>
