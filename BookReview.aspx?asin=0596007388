                <span id="Label1">Java 5.0, code-named "Tiger", promises to be the most significant new version of Java since the introduction of the language. With over a hundred substantial changes to the core language, as well as numerous library and API additions, developers have a variety of new features, facilities, and techniques available.  But with so many changes, where do you start? You could read through the lengthy, often boring language specification; you could wait for the latest 500 page tome on concepts and theory; you could even play around with the new JDK, hoping you figure things out--or you can get straight to work with <i>Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook</i>.  This no-nonsense, down-and-dirty guide by bestselling Java authors Brett McLaughlin and David Flanagan skips all the boring prose and lecture, and jumps right into Tiger. You'll have a handle on the important new features of the language by the end of the first chapter, and be neck-deep in code before you hit the halfway point. Using the task-oriented format of this new series, you'll get complete practical coverage of generics, learn how boxing and unboxing affects your type conversions, understand the power of varargs, learn how to write enumerated types and annotations, master Java's new formatting methods and the for/in loop, and even get a grip on concurrency in the JVM.  Light on theory and long on practical application, <i>Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook</i> allows you to cut to the chase, getting straight to work with Tiger's new features. The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Tiger, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution. </span>

                    <span>This book will get far down the road of understanding the new features in Java 5.0. Unfortunately, there are typos and, worse yet, an entire section of text that randonly appears in another chapter's section later in the book. Very strange. All in all, though, you will learn a great deal from this book.</span>

                    <span>This book has a unique layout and presentation. It's not a comic book type new wave layout you see in text books today but a notebook that's straight to the point. The book is only for the experienced Java programmer that puts together all the new language changes. Instead of reading all those articles on new Java 1.5 features, just read this single source collection. It's a fast read detailing the language changes, how to use it, and why in a very orderly manner. Only the last chapter was out of place that covers changes in Thread programming which is not exactly Java language change but it was interesting to know for follow-up. Many speak of the new Java features of printf, autoboxing, etc., but there is a lot more and some subtle changes that you need to know. This book covers everything. </span>

                    <span>The foreword to this new O'Reilly series explains that a "Developer's Notebook" is the raw scribbling of an "Alpha Geek" as he or she examines some exciting new technology. That pretty much describes "Java 1.5 Tiger."  It's raw, it's scribbling, and it's exciting nonetheless.
<br />
<br />At a slim 177 pages, this is one of the shorter general Java books you're ever likely to see. There isn't a lot of fat between these covers. Over the faint blue graph-paper lines and the cute faux coffee stains, the concise text covers just the biggest new features in JDK 1.5: generics, varargs, autoboxing, annotations, printf, enumerations. Many of the plentiful code examples are sensible and give you a realistic idea of how to use a feature. Some of them, unfortunately, are rather contrived and don't make much sense.
<br />
<br />My main brickbat for "Java 1.5 Tiger" is the very high incidence of typos, more in the text than in the code. Raw scribbling is one thing, but accuracy is important, too; a programming book demands it. My main bouquet is that I learned a lot from reading it, and honestly, you can't do much better than that.</span>

                    <span>Who: You. You already know Java. In fact, you silently snicker at most people who say they "really know Java," because they don't - not like you do.
<br />
<br />Why: Java 1.5 is really different. Not just enums and boxing/unboxing, it has type-safe varargs (who'd've thunk it!), last-chance handlers for threads, the most comprehensive generic mechanism I'm seen, and more. You need to know what's new, and how to use it, and fast. 
<br />
<br />What: This book. It won't help the Java newbie. It's just the new features, spelled out in detail. Better yet, they're spelled out in code samples. This doesn't so much tell you what's new, it shows you.
<br />
<br />Where: Here. Until the next generation of Java books hits the shelves, your alternatives are this and the language spec. Believe me, you don't want the language spec.
<br />
<br />When: Now. This book will probably look old fast, once the more polished, friendly, and tutorial texts come out. It's a great quick-start on the new technology, though, and (see "who" above) you can't wait.
<br />
<br />I hope O'Reilly keeps coming out with new titles in this series. I give it five stars now, but probably two a year from now. As I said, though, this book is for !right!now! and does a great job of what it does.

                    <span>This notebook series is a very good aid for the experienced developer who wants to play with some new feauture in the company of an even more experienced fellow who has done most of the research for him. Stay far from this one if you need to learn Java from scratch. (Go for one of the many excellent intro books by Ivor Horton or Cay Horstmann). Not surprisingly this book is one of the best in the series, being mostly the effort of Brett McLaughlin who, besides being a talented coder and writer is also the man behind the O'Reilly "developer notebook idea". In about 150 pages you will get plenty of working examples and clear, concise explanations on the new features of "Tiger": generics (templates), varargs, annotations, autoboxing etc .. If you are a serious Java developer you cannot miss on these new features, and have no excuse for doing it since now you can bridge this gap with just a few hours of reading on a train. And if you are an old school C coder who grudgingly had to pass to Java for "marketing reasons".. I have great news for you.. believe it or not, we got printf back! ;)</span>
