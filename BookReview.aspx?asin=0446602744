                    <span>This book cuts to the chase. It is blunt and does not sugar-coat anything. I think what upsets most men about this book is that it teaches a woman to rely on her OWN judgement with the Rules as a guide. Each and every man will tell you what a DECENT guy he is. Ladies when you go shopping, you know we take all the time in the world to compare prices, size, reputation, etc of the product/service BEFORE we buy it. In other words, we don't trust soley on the product's seductive advertisers. We should be even more cynical, inquisitve, etc. with our hearts, bodies, and emotions where any man is concerned. Ellen and Sherrie's rules are a GOD-send in this respect.<P>Using The Rules has helped me avoid men who are rage-aholics, sex creeps, hate addicts, commitment phobics, etc. I wished I'd read this book many years ago. I am now is a very emotionally balanced relationship with a rare find -- a real man, one who is a gentleman, fun, and all the things any woman would DREAM of in a man. His advice supports the Rules, "Most women do too much for ALL the men in their lives, believe anything the man tells them, reward his obviously negative behavior constantly. Then the same women wonder why most men are the selfish, sexually-entitled, minority hating, pseudo-intellectuals that they are today."<P>The only problem I have is with the sub-title. It should read, "How to treasure your mind, body, and soul and enjoy the rest has to offer without wasting your precious time on glorified juvenile deliquents." The subtitle puts to much focus on the man, as if he is some sort of treasure to capture. That's my only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.<P>The only men who should be offended by this book are the ones women are better off without anyway. The only women who are offended by this book are the eternally nurturing wives, mothers and mistresses of the very same men this book helps weed out in the early stages of a relationship.<P>As the old saying goes, "Once the fool (non-Rules females) learns the rules (created by men and for men at a woman's expense), the game is over! "<P>Keep up the good work, Ellen & Sherrie. (For entertainment read the overly critical, nasty reveiws on this book, especially those from "decent" men -- hilarious and telling.)</span>

                    <span>I haven't read this book yet, but I've finished all the reviews.<BR>It seems like the guy was applying rules on me and I am completely turned off by it. He always end the calls and kept conversation to less than 10min. And we don't spend much time together. When we were first going out, I didn't like him that much. He kept calling me and I tried to avoid his calls. But then I gave him a chance. I continue to go out with him and see what he's like. I eventually end up falling for him. And all of a sudden, he was cold to me. He doesn't initiate the call anymore. Maybe he's doing the rules thing on me. In any case, this rules thing does not work on me. Because I am definetly a good catch and I don't like being ignored. He's history!</span>

                    <span>This is a book that should be part of a reading list for middle school girls. Women are far too accomodating in relationships. This book is easy to hate, especially for women who are self-righteous "Oh, I'm so much better than this and my way of dating men is so much better." Whatever. Girls, if you want to end up with the man of your dreams, follow these rules. They changed my dating experience for the better.</span>

                    <span>Try them. They work, and the results will speak for themselves.<P>I remember my Mother, Grandmothers and Aunts explaining the same "Rules" to us when we were children. For example: Most of the girls I knew were told never to accept a date unless the guy asked you out at least 3 days in advance. Why? Because, being too readily or easily available made you look like you had no self-respect and were desperate. It was an embarassment. And...the boy who asked you out on such short notice was also suspect. Why? Because it often was interpreted to mean he couldn't find anyone else, and you were the last resort! Or he felt you were not that much a "hot commodity" and he could afford to wait to the last minute. Not exactly flatteringh, huh?<P>It's interesting that conventional wisdom like this, is now published in book form and turned into a bestseller. Why? Because, a lot of women have not been taught any of this conventional wisdom. As a result, they have been wearing their hearts on their sleeve. They have made themselves too available, too forthcoming, too desperate. As a result they are getting very, very hurt.<P>"The Rules" are NOT about manipulating men, either. They are about having self-respect, self-esteem and having an independent life of your own. <P>"The Rules" should be required reading for every female over the age of 13.</span>

                    <span>Men say that they hate this book, but they actually agree with the advice in it. I recently had a man suggest that we meet halfway for our second date. (Rule 4: Don't Meet Him Halfway Or Go Dutch On A Date) But how silly to live your life by some rules in a self-help book, right? So, I decided to ask 10 MALE friends what their opinion was. EVERY guy told me that the man who suggested meeting halfway was a "creep," a "cheapskate," or a "dirtbag," and they said things like "Dump him!" and "Kick his ass to the curb." The men all cited examples of how they drove for hours to see women they liked. The married ones told me that they never would have considered asking their wives to meet halfway. So men really agree with THE RULES; they just don't seem to like the idea that it's all written down in a book.<BR>For those of you GUYS out there who don't believe me, look at it this way:<BR>Suppose you had a friend named Joe Schmoe who typically engaged in locker-room talk about the "easy" girls he went out with. Now suppose your little sister meets Joe and falls madly in love with him. Your sister is very sweet; she's no "game-player." So, she calls Joe up, asks him out, meets him at his favorite place (convienent for him/out of the way for her), and even pays her own way (she's fair and modern). One day, you overhear your sister talking to a girlfriend on the phone. She tells her friend that she's madly in love with Joe; he's the ONLY one for her; she wants to marry him and have little Schmoe babies; she would do ANYTHING for Joe! Then you go to the gym, and as you enter the locker room, you overhear Joe telling his friends (in graphic detail) what he's done with your sister. No, Joe doesn't like her all that much, but hey, she wants him. What's he gonna do? Say no? <BR>Now, do you want to tell your sister that you are proud of her for "taking initiative" and for "being open and honest in a relationship?" Or do you want to punch Joe's lights out?</span>
