                <span id="Label1">Though it is no longer a secret that the Danish capital, Copenhagen, is the perfect destination, with its beguiling blend of super-cool shops, fabulous restaurants, and world-class museums all conveniently compressed within a pretty, pedestrian-friendly heart, the third edition of the Time Out guide illuminates the corners of the city that other guides rarely reach. In recent years, visitors have begun to discover an alternative Copenhagen, away from the royal and historic riches of its 1,000-year-old center. Previously down-at-heel parts of the city like Vesterbro and Norrebro have emerged as newly groovy hot spots where cutting edge fashion, food, and design flourish. So, while many are lured to Copenhagen by its rich 20th-century design legacy, they are as likely to leave having sampled the best that modern Scandinavia has to offer. This comprehensive guide to Copenhagen covers every attraction, museum, and source of amusement, including cutting-edge hot spots and up-and-coming neighborhoods.</span>

                    <span>I recently went to Copenhagen in mid-July 2004, and this was my first time there. I didn't know anything about the place and I needed to find good information about accommodation, restaurants, and transportation. This Time Out Copenhagen Guide book was truly informative and accurate. I stayed in a hotel mentioned in the book and it was great (lovely romantic rooms). I tried one of the restaurants recommended and that was wonderful too (great food, lovely atmosphere). Other witty and funny information about the history, famous/not-so famous Danish people, etc., in the Guide helps me to understand the city and locals more. I am really pleased with this guide book. I have ordered many guide book in the past (e.g. EyeWitness Guides) and I find Time Out Guides to be better in comparison. The information about the hotel accommodations, restaurants, etc., are spot-on, uptodate, and very useful. I will definitely buy more Time Out Guides for other cities in the future. I really recommend Time Out Guide book to anyone who are deciding on which Guides to buy.</span>

                    <span>An excellent guide. I was familiar with Copenhagen as a student 10 years ago and this book helped me right back into step. The general feel is spot-on and it's written for a more adventurous traveler than one just off the cruise ship. The book is irrepressibly positive, and perhaps overstates the charm and style of some sites - just like a guide book usually does. I thought the maps to be good, and they thoroughly cross-reference the entries. The addresses and hours seem to be correct. Copenhagen is an underrated European city; virtually untouched by the past ravages of war and living very much in the present day. If you're destination shopping, the city rates an 8+, and so does the guide. Bring, rent or buy a bicycle if you really want to go local.</span>

                    <span>Before going to Copenhagen, I purchased several guides...this is the one I used. Covers the usual castle, museum stuff but excels in the less usual stuff like club-life, small restaurants (try Ban-Gaw for Thai food and watch the human traffic on in the tacky old sex district of Istedgade),....prices are up-to-date, good info on train travel, good section on nearby Malmo.Lots of opinions...mostly right on. Could use a better map.</span>
