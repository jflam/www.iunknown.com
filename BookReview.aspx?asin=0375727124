                <span id="Label1">Thirty-eight outrageous, deliciously provocative pieces from Vogue's indomitable food critic-the man who eats everything, dreams perpetually of the ultimate food experience, and compulsively searches out the truth about how, why, and what we eat.<br><br>Each section of his new book is a savory course of a splendid feast: For starters, in "Who Is Having All the Fun?," join Steingarten as he dons costly fishing gear and sets out on an epic hunt for bluefin tuna (whose raw belly meat is one of the most delicious things on earth), or read about how he was assaulted by toxic airline food (and be glad you didn't taste that little green leaf).<br><br>Then, in "A Deep and Blinding Insight," partake of his investigative pursuits as he takes on salt chic (salt is salt, after all-isn't it?), assaults the FDA for banning succulent whole-milk cheeses in the name of hygienic sterility, and starts cooking dinners of braised short ribs for his dog when he can no longer withstand the baleful looks from his golden retriever confronted with desiccated dog-food pellets while his master sizzles sausages for himself. "There Is a God in Heaven," you'll find, be it in "Chocolate Dreams," "Caviar Emptor," or in the luscious taste of a superb boysenberry from the Chinos' farm.<br><br>But for every reward, there is first "An Intense Hunt for the Facts": knowing the lobster includes understanding its sex life, the secret to supergoose is brining, and you have to aim a Raynger ST-8 at your baking stone in order to determine the heat for the perfect pizza.<br><br>This is only a sampling of the gloriously entertaining menus that <b>The Man Who Ate Everything</b> dishes up this time around. You'll even find tucked under the plate some special recipes that he has climbed every mountain to obtain.<br><br>Lucky for his audience that Jeffrey Steingarten is insatiable.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book, as was the first. Encompassing, more or less at random: travel and food, history and food, science and food, technology and food and a healthy helping of the sociology of eating, it was a fast and funny read. There are books devoted to each of these topics which does a more rigorous job at it, but no one else rolls them all into so fun and informative a package. And, as opposed to a book which deals strictly with, say, the science of food and cooking, you can use this one to learn the names of the best French cooks and the names of their and countless other worthy restaurants. <BR>I haven't previously found anyone willing to discuss the merits of caviar AND cricket tacos within the same volume. <BR>I'd recommend the purchase of this at the same time as "The Man who ate Everything" - you won't be able to read only one.</span>

                    <span>I loved Jeffrey Steingarten's first book of essays and was thrilled he'd released a second. I find his writing to be warm, witty and lovely. His affection for food is infectious, and I appreciated the inclusion of several recipes and where-to-buy suggestions (I will be making Pierre Herme's version of hot chocolate, NOT Laura Bush's!). It is rare to find a writer who combines erudition with humor and manages to remain accessible along the way....</span>

                    <span>In an age where everyone who has ever had a meal anywhere seems to think they can write about food (just as anyone who travels to the south of Europe thinks that the public wants to read a book about it) Steingarten's writing stands out. He may be obsessive beyond what is considered normal - the measures he takes to fulfill notions about what he wants can take him to different continents or result in him cooking way too many batches of dog food - but you can't help but cheer him on as he writes about it in such a wry, acerbic style. His chapter on people who claim they have food allergies should be required reading for everyone for a start. Yes, he can be snobbish, demeaning, and plain rude, but the fact is he knows what he is writing about, and in the comfort of our own home, over a well prepared snack or a good drink, we can laugh along, partly due to the humour, and partly glad we are not the intended target.<P>In neat little self-contained chapters, each story in this book is witty and entertaining, and educational. This is a book that no food lover should deny themselves.</span>

                    <span>Steingarten's writing comes off as very arrogant and condescending. He does minimal research which he often interprets incorrectly. I could barely get through the introduction.</span>

                    <span>These two books should be considered as a pair - they are both of the same structure (small articles), same style (witty yet informative), same approach to knowledge (always trying to instill some) and goal (entertaining to the extreme). The only problem is that they tend to overlap in my mind....<P>For example, which one had the hilarious French Eatathon, which one had the article on ripening fruit, where was the essay about cheese? Regarless, both of these are just excellent works for quick reads. Unlike MFK Fisher, whose ouevre reads like novels, Steingarten seems to have found his gait as the food reviewer in Vogue. The articles seem somehow "Magazinish" and this is not necessarily a bad thing. He takes a fresh approach to food and eating in general - not reverent but certainly serious.</span>
