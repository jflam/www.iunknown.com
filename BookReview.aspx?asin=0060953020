                <span id="Label1">An exhilarating meditation on nature and its seasons-a personal narrative highlighting one year's exploration on foot in the author's own neighborhood in Tinker Creek, Virginia. In the summer, Dillard stalks muskrats in the creek and contemplates wave mechanics; in the fall she watches a monarch butterfly migration and dreams of Arctic caribou. She tries to con a coot; she collects pond water and examines it under a microscope. She unties a snake skin, witnesses a flood, and plays -King of the Meadow' with a field of grasshoppers.</span>

                    <span>Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker creek is a delightfully enjoyable book that transforms the way one views not only nature, but himself. She brings forth the many lessons nature has to teach us regarding philosophy, society, and theology. Boldness is a quality that shone brightly throughout the book. Dillard is not afraid to ask questions that challenge the beliefs of herself and others, and comes to terms with what cannot be explained. She is a seeker of the truth.<BR> Dillard's often humorously detailed descriptions of her encounters with nature are both entertaining and enlightening. She frequently uses telegraphic sentences, which give the book a playful tone, and she approaches nature with that attitude. Laced with scientific detail, her prose often reveals more than the reader wants to know about her subject. Dillard obviously finds every aspect of nature fascinating and draws the reader in with her boundless knowledge. <BR> I read Pilgrim At Tinker Creek as a required reading for Advanced Placement Language and Composition for a high school course. Earlier this year, I was assigned Walden by Henry David Thoreau, which is similar to Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. After struggling through nineteen pages of Walden, I put down the book and settled for Cliff's Notes. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek managed to capture my attention for the entire book. I have found it to be, by far, the most enjoyable book I have read as a requirement for any class. I highly recommend spending some time with this book.</span>

                    <span>With Spring Break approaching, my high school Advanced Placement Language & Composition class had one thing impending after the break from school: our class study of Annie Dillard's, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. We had just read Henry David Thoreau's, Walden. Personally, I found Walden unbearable because of Thoreau's detailed, scitific language. Many critics have drawn similarities between the style and intention of Walden and Pilgrim at Tinker Creek; therefore, I feared that PaTC would be another Walden. However, I was pleasantly surprised with Dillard's style that mimics the writings of Thoreau, but in a more personal, poetic manner. <BR>Dillard is noted for her easily recognizable crisp, precise diction and unique sentence structure. She continually employs similes, metaphors, and imagery to bring life (and the reader) directly to Tinker Creek: the sound of birds flying is "a million shook rugs". One of my favorite aspects of her writing is her characteristic, one-word, telegraphic sentences: "Fine," adds spunk and certainty to Dillard's point; "Knock; seek; ask," completely epitomizes Dillard's many philosophies in a nutshell: it's your responsibility to take charge of your life. It is this and many other aspects of her writing that make her so poetic; she develops a personal relationship with the reader and "invites" them to join her at Tinker Creek.<BR>Dillard and Thoreau have some similarities, but they are also very different. Sure, they are both two adults trying to learn about their surroundings and themselves near a body of water, but Thoreau communicates through science and logic and Dillard communicates with personality and her heart. I recommend you read Walden if you are looking for a more difficult, trying read about studying nature, but I would recommend Pilgrim at Tinker Creek if you are looking to discover something about yourself and your view the world.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed it immensely, even if its sentences are overwrought often to an annoying degree. I appreciate how she looks at the world in poetry: the world is a painting, and we are the poets charged with understanding it. The thing about Dillard is that in spite of the fact that her uber-emotive imagination stands in that place in her brain where my philosopher/mathematician stands in mine, she can still ask brilliant--even terrible--questions without all of the normal dillusions about what the alternative answers really are.<P>There are downsides: the overdone sentences, the fact that not every chapter drove forward toward the point--or even manifested her goal. But one reads her and agrees, at the end of it, that yes, she earned that Pulitzer after all.<P>And to all of the "bright AP English" students out there, for goodness sake put the book down and leave the book reviews alone. It just isn't for you. Pick it up again once you've lived some more of life.</span>

                    <span>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard is an exceptional book. It is like a modern day version of Walden by Henry David Thoreau. The deep thoughts and intricate details bring to life images that have not been experienced before. For example, when Dillard tells about the water bug sucking the frog, it brings to mind a very gruesome image that the reader just cannot get rid of. Yet, this image also sucks the reader in for more. Also, the exotocally intense descriptions make grotesque actions more beautiful, such as when the praying mantis lays its eggs. While writing about the praying mantis laying its eggs, Dillard seems almost frantic to get it all down. It is almost childlike, like a child who is to agitated by the sunlight and all of the beautiful things outside to stay inside and do their work. This technique makes the book more playful,fun, and attractive to young readers. <BR> <BR> Dillard's paragraphs are woven together into tightly knit chapters by the nice transitions. The full circle effect ties up all of the loose ends at the end of each chapter and then again at the end of the book. The similes that are throughout the book make the book very poetic and intriguing. Dillard's obsessiveness with nature is intriguing because the reader does not know what she is goint say or do next. <P>Dillard's Actions bring the book to life. When she is describing running from tree to tree so that she would not be seen, the reader gets a sense of how full of life she is and how happy she is just doing simple things out in nature. Also, when she is less then four feet from the snake, she just sits there amazed by it like a child.<BR> <BR>I never thought that I would read Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, but as a part of a class I had to. Now that I have read it, I am glad that I did read it because I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it to everybody.</span>

                    <span>Overall, a very interesting read. The adjective "interesting" can be taken in more than one sense, however. For example, <BR>A. The subject matter found within is unique and intriguing, revealing tidbits about nature one would not discover in a normal lifetime.<BR>B. Writing styles and techniques change throughout the book. At times Dillard is darkly pessimistic, while turning around a few sentences later to include some light wit. There is a lot of imaginative figurative language found that augments the writing a good deal.<BR>C. The author herself is an ... amusing person. I never would have thought one person could be so thoroughly interested in nature, at least if I had not read Walden, by Henry David Thoreau, before.<BR> And since the topic of Walden comes up, a comparison of the two would be appropriate. Dillard is much more appropriate for a modern audience. Both contain many insightful thoughts about nature and its relation to life, but you have to sift through a good deal of gunk to get to those points in Walden.<BR> So, I would recommend this book, along with Walden, to anyone willing to take it seriously and probably get grossed out a few times. The time and mental strain will be worth it in the end.</span>
