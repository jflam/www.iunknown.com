                    <span>With that book, George H. Stein has done a great historical work. His conclusions about the Waffen SS are still valuable to this day, even if there are some small errors, generally concerning the military history of some foreign units (ie the 13 SS "handschar", the 14 SS Galizien or the 33 rd SS "Charlemagne").<BR> I must admit that, this well documented book with a large amount of german official documents, gave me a good comprehension about this branch of the german armed forces. <BR> Stein is right when he writes that the vast majority of Waffen SS soldiers weren't compromised in the genocide toward the european jews and, he is also right when he considers that many european 'volunteers' didn't fought for hitler's regime but rather for their homeland.</span>

                    <span>Probably the most valuable contribution of this book is the list of non-German nationalities represented in the SS, along with the approximate numbers of each nationality thus represented. Irrespective of whether or not all these units were directly involved in anti-Jewish "aktions", they all contributed to the Holocaust by furthering the German war effort and prolonging German rule over Europe. With all of the bad rap Poles get for being almost as anti-Semitic as the Nazi Germans, you would expect that there would be more Poles in the SS than any other non-German nationality. Surprise! There was not a single Polish SS unit in existence! (Though there may have been a few Polish individuals in other SS units, and then mostly Poles of German extraction (Volksdeutsche) as well as those of mixed Polish-German ancestry). Nor is it true that the Germans did not seek Polish collaborators: Early in the war Germans tried to get Polish volunteers as auxilliary staff for the concentration camps, and got not a single applicant. So the Germans could forget about recruiting ethnic Poles for the SS. Although there certainly were "little league" anti-Semites among the Poles, the "big league" anti-Semites were the other European nationalities who supplied volunteers for the SS. It is high time that Holocaust films and popular-level Holocaust educational materials get off the Poles' case and tell it like it ACTUALLY was.</span>

                    <span>This literary work provides a comprehensive yet concise historical narrative of the Waffen SS - the elite Nazi militarized wing of the vast Armed Forces of Germany. When on the offensive, the Waffen SS spearheaded Nazi Germany's military victories. Subsequently, in Germany's years of defeat, the idealogical fanatics of the Waffen SS fought to the bloody and bitter end to defend their Fuhrer and Fatherland. One dominant fact emerges overall from George Stein's book; and that is the fact of the existence of the thorough military professionalism of the Waffen SS and its soldiers and officers.</span>

                    <span>I strongly recommend "Hitler's Elite Guard at War" as a measured, unbiased account in a field which is typically dominated by neo-Nazi literature and apologist "history" books. Anyone interested in the bizarre mechanics of the Waffen-SS but wary of the fact that most books on the subject are written by Nazi sympathizers will be pleased to find a serious, professional study of all aspects of the Waffen-SS, including creation, organization, volunteer composition, and war crimes. A good book on a particularly dark chapter of history indeed.</span>

                    <span>E' la ristampa del primo serio studio sulle Waffen SS, edito nel 1966. L'analisi è sufficientemente approfondita, basata sui documenti e sugli studi apparsi fino ad allora. L'autore riesce a dare una precisa idea di come nacque e come si sviluppò questo "stato nello stato", direttamente sottoposto ai voleri del Fuhrer e di Himmler. Una storia carica di atti di disperato eroismo militare e incredibili orrori. Stein oppone inoltre, in uno dei capitoli conclusivi, alcune pacate ma ferme conclusioni a chi nel mondo vorrebbe tramandare la falsa idea delle Waffen SS come corpo d'elite intriso di romantico idealismo.
