                    <span>In our love for what is current, we often assume that our generation is the first--the first to do whatever the new "fad" is. Reading the spiritual auto-biography of a pre-modern Saint like Augustine reminds us that history is the democarcy of the dead, giving vote and voice to our ancestors (to paraphrase Chesteron in "Orthodoxy"). 
<br />
<br />We are not the first to be reflective. We are not the first to explore our inner world. We are not the first to struggle with guilt. We are not the first to integrate inner spirituality and the philosophy current in our day. Augustine did all of these, and so much more, 1600 years ago.
<br />
<br />Reading Augustine's "Confessions also reminds us of the "three ways" that Christian theologians and philosophers have historically taught that we can know God. We can know God through His special revelation in Scripture. We can know God through His general revelation in nature (creation). Aquinas emphasized integrating this "way to God" with special revelation. And we can know God through His natural revelation in human nature (in the image of God in humanity). Augustine emphasized integrating this "way to God" with special revelation.
<br />
<br />This is where Augustine's "Confessions" diverges from post-modern auto-biography. Today's auto-biographies tend to be "all about me." Not Augustine's. Augustine searched his soul to know himself not as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. 
<br />
<br />For Augustine, self-reflection enhances our God-reflection. Since God is eternal and since we are created in His image, the deepest longings in our souls point toward the only One who can fulfill our longings. The deepest thoughts in our minds point toward the only One wise enough to provide answers for the mysteries of life.

                    <span>Augustine's 'Confessions' is among the most important books ever written. One of the first autobiographical works in the modern sense, it also represents the first time a psychological and theological enterprise were combined. It also helps to bridge the gap between the Classical world and the Medieval world, exhibiting strong elements identifying with each of those major historical periods.
<br />
<br />Most undergraduates in the liberal arts encounter the book at some point; all seminarians do (or should!). Many adults find (or rediscover) the book later, after school. For many in these categories, there are concepts, narrative strands and historical data new and unusual for them. However, Augustine's 'Confessions' is still generally more accessible in many ways that truly classical pieces; it has interior description as well as external reporting that we are familiar with in modern writing.
<br />
<br />The 'Confessions' shows Augustine's personality well - he was a passionate person, but his focus wavered for much of his life until finally settling upon Christianity and the Neoplatonic synthesis with this faith. Even while remaining a passionate Christian and rejecting the sort of dualism present in the Manichee teachings, he varied between various positions within these systems.  Augustine's varied thought reaches through many denominational and scholarly paradigms.
<br />
<br />The 'Confessions' are divided into thirteen chapters, termed 'Books' - the first ten of the books are autobiographical, with Augustine describing both events in his life as well as his philosophical and religious wanderings during the course of his life.  The text is somewhat difficult to take at times, as this is writing with a purpose, as indeed most autobiographies are.  The purpose here at times seems to be to paint Augustine in the worst possible light (the worse his condition, the better his conversion/salvation ends up being); at other times, one gets a sense (as one might get when reading the Pauline epistles) that there is some significant degree of ego at work here (Paul boasts of being among the better students, and so does Augustine, etc.).
<br />
<br />Augustine also uses his Confessions as a tract against the Manichean system - once a faithful adherent, Augustine later rejects the Manichean beliefs as heretical; however, one cannot get past the idea that Augustine retained certain of their intellectual aspects in his own constructions even while denouncing them in his official life story.
<br />
<br />The whole of the conversion turns on two primary books - Book Seven, his conversion to the Neoplatonic view of the world, including the metaphysics and the ethics that come along with this system; and Book 8, which describes his conversion to Christianity proper.  This is where perhaps the most famous directive, 'Tolle!  Lege!' ('Take and read!') comes from - Augustine heard a voice, and he picked up the nearest book, which happened to be a portion of the Pauline epistles, arguing against the undisciplined lifestyle Augustine lived.  Scholars continue to debate whether Augustine's conversion to Christianity was more profound or more important than his conversion to Neoplatonism; in any event, Christianity interpreted through a Platonic framework became the norm for centuries, and remains a strong current within the Christian world view; Protestant reformers as they went back to the 'original bible' in distinction from the Catholic interpretations of the day also went back to the 'original Augustine' for much of their theology.
<br />
<br />The final three books are Augustine's dealing with the creation of the world via narrative stories in Genesis 1 exegetically and hermeneutically.  This is very different from what is done in modern biblical scholarship, but is significant in many respects, not the least of which as it gives a model of the way Augustine dealt with biblical texts; given Augustine's towering presence over the development of Western Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant strands, understanding his methods and interpretative framework can lead to significant insights into the ideas of medieval and later church figures.
<br />
<br />This translation by Henry Chadwick is one of the standard editions of the book available.  Chadwick, a noted scholar of early Christianity, provides a good introduction that gives synopses of the books as well as background and contextual information. This is a book that will be of interest to novice readers of Augustine as well as scholars, to students, clergy and laypersons, and anyone else who might have an historical, literary, philosophical, theological or other interest in Augustine - something for everyone, perhaps?

                    <span>This is a beautiful book even if you aren't familiar with the Saints.  It opens like a flower as you read.  It is completely about this wonderful man's own thoughtful analysis of his own emotional experiences.  He reflects on his early life when he was actually a pagan worshipper, and then focuses on his conversion to the Christian faith.  Once he converted Saint Augustine returned to Africa and set up a monastic community.  What makes this book so special is that is told with the utmost candor and he holds nothing back.  It is also a beautiful book in praise of God and how he changed Saint Augustine's life.  Although religious in tenure, this is not a totally religious work.  So many observations and thoughts that this man had in his lifetime (354 AD is when he was born).  It is a book about friendships (both true and false), faith, celibacy and love.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>To talk directly to God , my guess is Augustine learned from the Psalms. To tell his life story to God including the story of his own inner life and struggles in such a prolonged and detailed way he apparently learned only from himself. In any case in inner intensity, in moving description of human relationships, to his mother and friends, in reflection on Time and its meaning, and in his relation to God Augustine writes the work that will set the standard for all spiritual autobiography before and after.</span>
