                    <span>This just may be one of the best all-round books on retirement available. From whether to retire, to where to do so, to how to afford it, to selling your home, to health insurance, to Social Security, this volume just about covers it all. When I first saw the wide-ranging Table of Contents, I wondered about depth of coverage. But it's solid and deep enough in most areas to keep at one's fingertips as a reference. And what a compendium of internet URL addresses! First-rate! I set myself the goal of reading through it in a weekend, and skipping only a few pages that didn't relate to my situation, I made it -- which is not to my credit but an attestation to the readability of this text. An excellent first book for the future retiree, The New Retirement belongs on the well-stocked bookshelf, where it may be the only work to pull all the pieces together. A bargain for the price!</span>

                    <span>These women write very interestingly about their choices for retirement in the U.S.,with a bonus of Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.  I've read many retirement books, and this is the best approach I've seen, albeit not mentioning that Temecula, CA has an earthquake rating of "8" - ouch!  Also, I prefer a book I can hold on my side in bed and read, but the spacing (not large print) spread the book out too much, making it heavy and bulky.  However, the contents are profound and I will be reading my book for a long time.  Oh yes, the legal info is much better than in other books I have read.  Good for them!</span>

                    <span>If you have already started contemplating retirement and doing some preliminary reading and research, you have probably already come across most of the information in this book.  Based on the blurbs and reviews I had high hopes for The New Retirement, but unfortunately found the book to be superficial and a rehashing of information that is widely available - from a 42 page chapter on travel opportunities to a 136 page chapter on best retirement cities.   Also included are many "true life" accounts such as an email from a retired couple living in Mexico describing their encounter with a hurricane.  Perhaps these make interesting reading for some and may be thought provoking for you - but I had difficulty relating their message to my reasons for reading the book and I generally found them distracting.  The book may be helpful as a one-stop resource for someone just beginning to consider retirement but I would have benefited more by investing the cost of the book in my 401K. </span>

                    <span>This book is chock full of sound advice for the multitude of choices facing us all upon retirement. As a baby boomer I am soon to face these choices. The greatest concern to me though is the failure of this book (and similar books) to address the massive unavoidable 13 year depression, the onset of which is now just a few years away, that is going to upset all our retirement plans. I am the eternal skeptic but, after reading Arnold's The Great Bust Ahead (which according to his book's website www.thegreatbustahead.com has been in the top 1% of Amazon's book sales every day for two years, and therefore not to be brushed aside lightly), I am definitely not a skeptic on this coming event. Use the contents of The New Retirement wisely, but also factor in that the greatest depression in US history is now just a few years away. </span>

                    <span>I have two financial concerns:  The first is paying for the college education of my two sons.  Fortunately they are 10 years apart in age so I won't have them attending college at the same time.  The second is saving for retirement.  I'm still 25 years or so away from retirement but I see how my own parents have struggled as they got into their mid-70's.  My dad did not have a retirement account and my mom only got into one maybe 10 years before retiring.  A sobering prospect.  
<br />
<br />This book is a real eye-opener.  We don't plan on re-locating and we are only looking to maintain our current lifestyle while trying to account for medical expenses.  While much of the book does focus on the best places to retire with appropriate ratings, I found most helpful the various surveys and worksheets designed to come up with the retirement plan that best fits your desires.  You'll uses these work sheets to figure out just how much money you'll need to have when you retire based upon your lifestyle.  
<br />
<br />Most interesting was information on a "working" retirement, where you enjoy the benefits of retirment while perhaps owning a small business.  There are lots of opportunities that you may not have considered for a working retirement.  There are also the very important sections dealing with healthcare, living wills, and dealing with aging parents.  This is great information for us as we are now dealing with two aging and ill parents ourselves.
<br />
<br />Whether your planning that retirement to Arizona or Florida, or planning on staying where ever you are at, the information in this book is invaluable.  Best of all it's great no matter what age you are whether a younger person in their late 20's or in their 40's like me.  It's never too late to get planning.</span>
