                <span id="Label1">Indian style is eclectic, according to Monisha Bharadwaj, blending the influences of many cultures into its decorative schemes. Through vivid descriptions and 250 color photos of Indian homes, this book explores both the practical and inspirational qualities of Indian decor. It explains the diverse origins of the ornamentation that epitomizes Indian style; elaborates on the differences between regional decorative traditions; and presents the treatments of doors, windows, floors, and walls that can be emulated in the Western home. India Style discusses living spaces and their purposes, including relaxation, eating, and sleeping.</span>

                    <span>When asked to describe Indian style in one word, most people would say "colorful". That is indeed true. Indian style is rich in color, which is liberally used by everywhere- from palaces of erstwhile maharajas to homes in rural and urban parts of contemporary India. What fascinates most westerners is the ability of Indian interior decorations to assimilate mind-boggling number of styles from different cultures and even different eras. The whole design flows with ease- different elements blending together to enhance the look rather than impart incongruity.<P>This book presents exactly these aspects and is meant to inspire the reader. As each part of the home is visited, different styles are explored, explained and in some cases, re-interpreted for contemporary living. Some of these are high-end and would not be practically possible to duplicate. But most can easily be adapted in the Western settings to infuse them with an ethnic flair or just make them outright Indian. The beautiful color pictures are sure to fire your imagination. The types of accessories shown are commonplace in India and at most Indian art stores in other countries. You may not find the exact duplicates but you are bound to find something close. Recipedelights.com recommends this book and feels that it will start off the reader in the right direction. Everything else is limited only by the reader's imagination.</span>

                    <span>Monisha did a great job in writing this book. It reflects her good taste in decorating homes in Indian style. Eventhough it is nice to see some of the maharaja styles decor she definitely includes examples of decor of regular households and contemporary looks that could definitely be applied. <P>Most of the decorating items included in this book could be found in Indian arts and craft stores. The colors are so vibrant and enticing in each and every photograph. I read this book so many times, actually it is a very nice relaxing reading companion. I usually leave it on our coffee table when we have get togethers with our friends. It is a good conversational piece and everyone wants to borrow this book. Nicely done!</span>

                    <span>India Style is a timely and refreshing look at one of the oldest civilizations in the world. India 'style' relfects the complexity and depth found in Indian cooking. Similar to how spices are blended and prepared, the country's style is a vibrant blending of color, texture, culture, religion and history. India style has been developing for thousands of years. There is something within our soul that responds and reaches out to this richness.</span>
