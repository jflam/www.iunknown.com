                <span id="Label1">Mike Schiffman has hit upon a great formula for <I>Hacker's Challenge</I>. Rather than try to research, fully understand, and adequately explain attacks that have taken place on other people's networks--the approach taken by too many writers of books about computer security--Schiffman lets network administrators and security experts tell their stories first-hand. This is good. What's better is that Schiffman has edited each of their war stories into two sections: one that presents the observations the sysadmin or security consultant made at the time of the attack, and another (in a separate part of the book) that ties the clues together and explains exactly what was going on. The challenge in the title is for you to figure out what the bad guys were doing--and how best to stop them--before looking at the printed solution. Let's call this book what it is: an <I>Encyclopedia Brown</I> book for people with an interest in network security.<p>  It doesn't really matter, from a value-for-money standpoint, whether your skills are up to the challenge or not. The accounts of intrusions--these are no-kidding, real-life attacks that you can probably learn from, by the way--are written like chapters from a novel (though log file listings, network diagrams, and performance graphs appear alongside the narrative text). Recall every time you've seen a movie or read a book with computer scenes so technically inaccurate they made you wish for a writer with a clue. Schiffman and <I>Hacker's Challenge</I> is what you wished for. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: The sorts of attacks that black-hat hackers (everyone from script kiddies to accomplished baddies) launch against Internet-linked computers and networks. Everything is presented from the perspective of the defenders--i.e., the network administrators--who have to look at log files and process activity to figure out what's going on.</span>

                    <span>I've had many a kick in the nuts, and they range from bothersome to excruciating, like many computer security texts. This book superceeded all those kicks in the nuts, and even beat out most punches in the face.<P>After I read chapter 5 on wireless security, I threw my pager out the window and cursed the name of its inventor for the security issues it had introduced into my network.<P>From here on out, it's only semaphores for communication, and nothing else!</span>

                    <span>this book sucks. plain and simple. i have some respect for the author, i've used his libnet and he's a funny guy.. but this book is garbage. the last good thing mike schiffman wrote was libnet, and after that he figured why not just take it easy and write dumb books like this for the rest of his life, be a manager @stake and get paid way more than the researchers who are doing the actual work. he goes into stupid crap like backdoors in inetd.conf, how outdated can you get.. what is this? incident response to that crappy phrack article he wrote years and years ago about simple unix backdoors? hah. the real challenge here is for a real hacker to read the whole book and maintain his sanity.</span>
