                    <span>This book effectively captures the spirit of "brazilianess" and presents it to the reader in an easy to understand format. Page openly admits that the analysis presented in the book is through his eyes, which is an honest admission that this is not necessarily a scholarly study of Brazilian culture. That said, the book does not lack for adequate research and Page obviously knows his Brazilian history and culture and spent years putting this book together. The fact that it is not a "scholarly study" is probably what makes it an interesting read. <P>This is a great book to get a basic understanding of Brazil, its culture and its wonderful people. If you are traveling to Brazil I highly recommend reading this before you go or while you are there. It will help you understand a lot of what you encounter.</span>

                    <span>I wish I could have read this before living in Brazil for three years. This book covers all of Brazilian history from a cultural point of view. If you're interested in modern Brazilian culture (Carnival, TV, etc.), there are some very interesting insights. I'm not sure how this book would read if you haven't experienced Brazil first-hand. I'm not sure Brazilians will appreciate it since it's not always a flattering portrait. I think there are many insights that pertain the history of American slavery and being African-American in this country</span>

                    <span>Page provides an overview of Braziilian history and culture, but is far too free with his often economically na√Øve and leftish comments that add nothing whatever to the story. He seems to operate from the notion that profits equal ill, while labor is equated with virtue. One wonders how the Soviet Union, where profits were outlawed and labor (skilled and educated) was plentiful managed to force its way into the ranks of the third world over 70 years of Marxist experimentation and misery. Page's views might have been a little less out of touch had they been published 10 years before Gorbachev, when there were still some serious economists who were still ignorant of what von Mises had shown six decades before --- that in the final analysis socialism could not work because of how it distorted human incentives.<P>Page goes so far as to suggest that the United States may follow Brazil into economic ruin because of the market based policies that are increasing the size of the "economic pie," which necessarily increases the gap between rich and poor. Since the logical leap necessary to make such a conclusion requires the equivalent of rocket power, one can only wonder whether it instead represents an expression of the author's hope (perhaps unconscious).<P>Like so many of his apparent ilk, it would be better for low income households to be even poorer so long as, in exchange, the affluent are less affluent. This "hope my neighbor's barn burns down" philosophy may warm the hearts of comfortable elites who would never have to feel the pain of such policies, but would make the real poverty daily experienced by others even more desperate. <P>A good example of Page's gratuitous comments is on page 491. After having praised the comparative economic success of Curitiba, capital of Parana, he goes on to attribute part of it to not having "allowed itself to be overwhelmed by ... extensive, oppressive poverty." This is akin to crediting good health to not having allowed one's self to be overwhelmed by disease. Perhaps Page is not completely aware of the special conditions that have made Curitiba and its less impressive than Chamber of Commerce hyped success possible. Or perhaps, he believes that Curitiba policies would have made Sao Paulo an urban planning paradise that would have successfully repelled the inconvenient impoverished millions who have moved there from the Northeast (where hopelessness sprawls even more than in Sao Paulo).<P>All in all, what could have been a literary triumph deteriorates into an extensive ideological pamphlet. I am in the market for a good history of Argentina under Peron. Page's is not on my list.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book if you are interest in the history and culture of Brazil. It's obvious that the author did extensive research on the subject and he does a very good job explaining how some of the cultural traits developed. However, the country has gone under a great deal of changes recently and so I though it was a little outdated. Also, the reading can get boring, as the chapters are long and too detailed sometimes. I gave it four starts because it definitely a good book, if this is the kind of reading you are looking for.</span>

                    <span>I wish my college textbooks had been written this well! Page's book is chock full of information about Brazil's history, politics, economy, culture, environmental issues, geography, and and and! I learned so much. And yet I found I could not put the book down. It is so readable, never dry. I'm becoming a frequent traveler to Brazil and this book really enriches my travels. I only wish I had an update! This book takes you up to about 1995 ... I'm busily researching now to see what happened in areas concerning the environment, the government, the economy, etc. that Page so successfully introduced. It's as if Page wrote the beginning of a great story...now I want to continue reading about Brazil, to see what's happened since then. <BR>I can't finish this review without saying how sad much of Brazil's history is, and how much I admire the people's spirit.</span>
