                <span id="Label1">In 1969, 22-year-old Tim O'Brien was drafted and eventually sent to Vietnam.  In a memoir, <I>If I Die in a  Combat Zone</I> and two works of fiction--<I>Going After  Cacciato</I> and <I>The Things They  Carried</I>--he revisited the war, crafting gut-wrenching tales of terror, death, and futility among the rice paddies and jungles of Southeast Asia. In <I>The Nuclear Age</I> the author explores the road not taken: his hero, William Cowling, avoided the draft and spent the 1960s, instead, in a welter of antiwar radicalism. But soon one begins to wonder how different life in the underground, with its strange mix of idealistic visionaries and glory-seeking psychotics, really is from the battlefields of Vietnam. Enlisted in the ranks of an antiwar paramilitary organization in Florida, William remarks to his radical girlfriend Sarah that the group is  "like a death squad. Can't tell the good guys from the bad guys, they're all gunslingers. Completely scrambled. But it's lethal. I know that much, it'll kill somebody." Nevertheless, he sticks it out in a noncombatant capacity and resurfaces several years later at the end of the war as a profitable trader in uranium. <p> Success hasn't dulled William Cowling's survival instinct, however; at the novel's start in 1995, the now-middle-aged businessman is busy digging a bomb shelter in his back yard. Nuclear war has been a particular obsession of his since those childhood drills back in the mid-1950s during which he was expected to crawl under his desk at school and cover his head against fallout. Forty years later, he still isn't taking any chances. His daughter thinks he's crazy, his wife is on the verge of leaving him, but still he digs--and as he digs he reviews the events in his life that have led up to this moment. <I>The Nuclear Age</I> is especially strong when it focuses on William's childhood and the complex web of relationships that exist within families. Less successful is O'Brien's portrayal of his character's obsession with nuclear war; though we are meant to see William as the only truly sane man in an insane world, all too often he comes across as genuinely cracked. Despite the book's weaknesses, it has many strengths, not  least among them being Tim O'Brien's fierce intelligence, black wit, and eloquent prose. <I>--Alix Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>I was intrigued in reading the plot of this book as it is posted on the back cover.  I have read some of O'Brien's other work and was very impressed.  This book is among his best work.  The best comparison I could give is that it is a combination of Dr. Strangelove and Catch-22. It is both witty and intelligent commentary on the culture of war.
<br />
<br />William's Cowling's greatest fear is nuclear war.  Since childhood, he has attempted to allude death in a nuclear fallout. It was during childhood that he built a shelter under the ping-pong table in his parents' basement.  The consequences of his childhood behavior are among the more amusing scenes in the book.  His fear subsides until the Vietnam protests of the 60's reawaken his phobia.  He creates a gang of protestors, who eventually go into hiding to avoid the draft with him.  Among these characters is Sarah, who is the most vivid character in the book.  She is the woman who thinks she knows what she wants, but really has no clue.
<br />
<br />After the series of flashbacks, we return to the present in which William is again struck with fear.  The fear causes him dig a massive hole for a fallout shelter.  His family thinks he has gone insane.  His wife, a somewhat distant amateur poet, never speaks to him.  The main dialogue in the present is between William and his daughter.  His daughter swears like a sailor, but serves as her father's voice of rationality.
<br />
<br />William's further breakdown and eventual recovery pose a number of interesting scenarios.  "The Nuclear Age" is wildly entertaining and certainly a book I will recommend to many.</span>

                    <span>It is no secret that I believe that Tim O'Brien is one of the finest writers of fiction alive today. Literate and full of fantastic prose, O'Brien usually is able to create complex and original stories. There is plenty original about The Nuclear Age. However, the novel fails to accomplish what it sets out to do. It sublimates nuclear war behind Vietnam-era radicalism, the William Cowling character is more pathetic than anything else, and ultimately one walks away without any real gain.<p>I was drawn in by the concept: William Cowling just decides to start digging a bomb shelter one day. This creates an alienation between himself and his wife and daughter. The book then segues into William's childhood, where he tries to construct a bomb shelter out of pencils and cardboard boxes. Had the book been about that, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it. But the vast majority of the book deals with his past as a radical activist. He has no real conviction for his cause, but he stays partially out of being intimidated by his passive-aggressive militant girlfriend, for whom he has no stated affection. I really found the Sarah character annoying. Her repetitive catchphrases, especially, annoyed me. She was clinging one second and gung-ho the next. What kind of dope would stay with her under any circumstances? Which brings me to my next point. William is supposed to come off as a sympathetic sane man, but he comes off as a demented milquetoast. O'Brien never creates strong and dynamic protagonists, one is reminded of Paul Berlin in Going After Cacciato. However, Berlin had values that dictated his actions, to some extent. And how sane can a man be that inserts nuclear terms into nursery rhymes and recites them like mantras, not to mention locking up his family. His aversion to nuclear war notwithstanding, he bumbles around with no goal or passion. Then he spends thousands of dollars to pursue a flight attendant he met for an hour to ask to be married by following the trail of jilted lovers she has left in his wake and then is shocked when she cheats on him and wants to leave him, which shows the analytical reasoning of a very bright second grader.<p>What does one walk away with from the book? Nothing for me. The Things They Carried left me with a greater understanding of Vietnam and a greater perspective on humanity. Well, I guess O'Brien deserves a pass. Babe Ruth struck out a few times, too.</span>

                    <span>The human mind can be a fragile object, prone to fits of insanity and hallucinations under periods of extreme stress.  Yet even under an intense psychotic episode, the mind still functions, providing the personal motivation for acts the majority of the public would consider at best odd, and at worst dangerous.  The manner in which a mind provides rationale for the irrational is a fertile ground for literary discovery, and Tim O'Brien is not afraid to reveal the catalysts for psychosis.  THE NUCLEAR AGE is a testament to madness, a diary of the slow loss of one's mind.<p>THE NUCLEAR AGE begins with a profoundly eccentric act:  William Cowling, at age forty- nine, undertakes to dig a nuclear shelter in his backyard.  As his wife and daughter watch his progress (first as observers, then as captives), Cowling ruminates on his life thus far; as a child, he built a bomb shelter under his family's ping-pong table, lining it with pencils so that the `lead' will arrest any incoming radiation.  As his life progresses into the 1960's, he falls in with Sarah, a past object of obsession, who takes his fear of death, and uses it to transform him into a draft-dodging terrorist.<p>To tell more would be to tell too much; one of THE NUCLEAR AGE's considerable charms is that it continually takes left turns when the reader expects a right.  William's life is nothing if not unpredictable, but it follows a precise logical line when looked at in hindsight.  His misadventures as a child with a family doctor lead to unusual complications with later relationships.  His fear of death serves as prelude to his obsession with a mysterious poetic flight attendant.  O'Brien embroils William in the underbelly of American life in the 1960's, portraying the protests and conflicts over the Vietnam war from the perspective of the seriously disenfranchised.  William's dread and paranoia guide him inexorably to the polar opposite of organized government, culminating in a black comedy of warfare training that is the darkest and most twisted characterization of boot camp since FULL METAL JACKET.<p>O'Brien is not simply a protester with talent; he is a keen observer of the minutiae of life that makes life worth living.  His masterpiece in an already exceptionally written novel is his description of the night William and Sarah truly come together.  O'Brien captures the subtle nuances of the beginning of a courtship, a full-blooded depiction of one of those nights every<br>person has, a night we wish would never end.  They are initially thrust together during a college dance pair-off, where William confesses his past admiration of her in high school.  As the evening progresses, they slowly grow closer, as Sarah begins to see the human underneath the person she studiously avoided.  They even kiss, but despite the wonderful atmosphere O'Brien<br>constructs, Sarah denies that anything will ever happen between them.  And then, the next day . . .<p>`When I looked up, Sarah was there.<p>`Which is how it always happens - that fast.  She was simply there.<p>`We stood inspecting each other.  Her hair was pulled back in a businesslike ponytail.  She wore blue culottes and earmuffs and a silver letter sweater.<p>`"What you remind me of," she said after a moment, "is tooth decay.  No sleep, I'll bet.  Bad dreams."<p>`"Surprise," I said.<p>`"You could've called."<p>`"I could've.  I didn't."<p>`Her lips brushed across my cheek.<p>`It was all I could do to nod.  There was an absence of symmetry, a strange new tilt to the world.<p>`"Well," she said quietly, "a girl likes to be chased.  Hot pursuit.  The feminine mystique, I guess."<p>`Sarah shrugged.  She made a low sound, not quite a sigh, then took a step forward and turned and stood beside me.<p>`"Don't expect miracles," she said.  "You and me.  A trial period, understand?"<p>Something about O'Brien's phrasing, the atypical rhythm to his writing, brings about an air of aching nostalgia that is completely believable.  The curious but precise timing O'Brien uses captures William's slowly degrading mind perfectly.  And at the height of William's anxiety, O'Brien manages the substantial accomplishment of creating total empathy with William's madness.<p>THE NUCLEAR AGE can be an often unsettling read.  As O'Brien demonstrates the apprehension and fear that the nuclear race created in the twentieth century, he inadvertently captures the very real fears of people in the early twenty-first century.  We exist on a precipice of destruction and violence, and how we react to the pressure will define who we are, as it defined William.  THE NUCLEAR AGE presents one option, one course of action; let's hope that another one exists.</span>

                    <span>I was introduced to this book by my girlfriend, who picked it up randomly because she liked the cover. Turns out she loved the book, which inspired me to read it as well. This book ended up being a great introduction to O'Brien, in some ways lighter than many of his other works, but it still has of the undertones common to many of his books. Because Vietnam is not as key to this book as many of the other ones, I think it's more accessible to the general populace. So if you are weary about reading war books, you could pick this one up first, and if you like it, maybe move on to some of his other novels.</span>

                    <span>This book begins with the interesting premise of a man digging a hole in his backyard to escape from nuclear war.  However, the story quickly disintegrates into 4 decades filled with cardboard characters, implausible situations, and worst of all...mind numbing boredom.<p>The story is told in chapters alternating between the present (1995) and the past going back to the narrator's childhood.  The narrator grows up during the height of the cold war, dodges the draft, and joins the anti-war movement.  While this should be an exciting time, it instead feels like a drug induced sleep.  I never got the impression that any of the characters really cared about anything other than themselves.<p>Somehow the main character winds up rich with all his dreams fulfilled.  Except that his daughter is a whiny brat (I honestly can't stand writers that use italics in every sentence.)  So we are left with an anti-climatic ending that resolves absolutely nothing.<p>This book isn't scary, funny, or insightful.  It wanders aimlessly before dying without a whimper.</span>
