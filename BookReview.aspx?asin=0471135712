                    <span>I join the ranks of previous reviewers here who honestly feel that having read this book in high school would have almost certainly changed my life.  I, too, did very well in high school math competitions, but the maturity I am gleaning from this gem may have vaulted me into a different league.
<br />
<br />It contains hundreds of problems from various levels of competition, from AIME problems all the way through some of the toughest Putnam problems (which, if you know anything about the Putnam, are about as hard as competition problems come).  But the biggest help are the vital insights and exciting ways of looking at these problems.  Don't take my word for it--many past IMO contestants have suggested this book too.
<br />
<br />Particularly helpful is the way the author divides the book into sections based on often-used concepts and techniques.  For example, you will see applications of the pigeonhole principle from the most basic (e.g. "In a drawer with socks of 2 colors, show that after picking any 3 socks, we must have a pair of same-colored socks.") through some rather difficult ones (1994 Putnam A4, an Erdos problem, and more).
<br />
<br />The same goes for a multitude of others--the invariants section includes both the classic chocolate bar-cutting problem and Conway's rather difficult checker problem.  Then, not only does he solve the latter beautifully, but incorporates nontrivial questions that ensure the reader has completely understood the solution (e.g., "Could we have replaced lambda with an arbitrary integer?  Why not?").
<br />
<br />You don't have to be a math competition buff to gain from this book, however.  If you're simply interested in mathematical puzzles and problems, and are looking to expand your repertoire, this book will help you.  Anyone with a good dose of intelligence and motivation will benefit.
<br />
<br />For an additional problem book, check out Mathematical Olympiad Challenges by Andreescu and Gelca.  For purely Putnam treatment, there are several volumes written by Kedlaya.  And if you're a CS student, looking for honing those CS math skills to be razor sharp, you should definitely look into Concrete Mathematics by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik.
<br />
<br />Happy solving.</span>

                    <span>When I was in high school, I placed second in the Alabama State Mathematics Contest and won many others. However, I might could have been competitive with the IMO style problems had I had this book and would be much better off today had I seen this book earlier.<p>This book is for the exceptionally brilliant and the mentally tough.  It is absolutely necessary to approach this book in a different way from a standard math textbook. You MUST attempt the examples BEFORE looking at the example solutions, NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT OR FRUSTRATING. You may be bamboozled by the problems, but even trying to understand the problems before looking at the solutions and thinking about how a solution might proceed will pay huge dividends in the long run.<p>For example, in the first chapter Zeitz presents an example asking the reader to prove that the product of four consecutive integers cannot be a perfect square. The solution involves some clever algebraic trickery not visible to the inexperienced, but persistence and getting your hands dirty is key.<p>If you persist in spite of the considerable difficulty, you will find that you get better very, very quickly. You will also notice that it isn't just contest problems it helps you solve. I have found that I have solved my homework sets in the Berkeley graduate engineering program much more easily since working these problems. You will start to see creative and clever solutions where they exist in everything problem oriented.<p>PATIENCE PATIENCE PATIENCE!</span>

                    <span>As a high school student that is essentially bored with the regular, ho-hum classes that my school offers, this book is perfect.  It gives a problem-solving foundation for math enthusiasts desiring to compete nationally in contests like the AMC, AIME, and USAMO.  The problems are excellent and cover a wide range of difficulty (past ASHMEs, USAMOs, and, finally, IMOs); and the solutions are well-written, logical, and intelligible.  In short, if you are looking to "get better" at problem solving, this is the book for you.<p>Note: I also bought Problem-Solving Strategies by Arthur Engle.  Those, perhaps more advanced, problem-solvers that want even more of a challenge should purchase this book as well (as both books give very challenging problems, but Engel's is undoubtedly more advanced).</span>

                    <span>I just can't understand what all the hype is about! The book is almost silly. The book is too chatty, costly, many of the problems are boring, there are many typos, it gives little insight into the topics it covers, has too many cross references to be useful for a biginner( it's so very irritating! )... The author tries to give many suggestions on the psychology behind problem-solving but unlike polya he only manages to make the reader more *self-consious* and that makes the reader a bad problem solver. I just can't understand why almost everyone who reviewed this book is giving it 5-stars?? Is it just because of the author's reputation? or is it because only those who find the book useful bother to give it a review? or is it because people are too timind to voice their opinion in a place where the majority seem to disagree with them? Some reviews say it's 'comprehensive' but that's the last thing a 250 page super-chatty book can be! Maybe if you are a sophomore and know very well the topics covered in this book, then you may be able to add something to your problem solving skills by using this book. Otherwise, chances are that you will find yourself being hit from one part of the book to another like a tennis ball because of the cross references! And very few of the problems are designed to give the reader mathematical *insight*!<p> I bought this book reading the sample pages on this website.. the preface, the contents, the first few pages( they looked very interesting!!)and ofcourse all these reviews...... :(</span>
