                    <span>This book in fantastic. The author's voice and style make this not only easy to read but a joy to read as well. There are little tips and tidbits in each chapter that will make a good audio guy great and a great audio guy better. I recommend this book to anyone in the audio post world.</span>

                    <span>I decided to buy this book because I had used the forum on the DV.com website for information before, and Jay Rose's comments there had proven to be spot-on and well-informed.<BR>This book contains a thorough examination of all the factors which contribute to the quality of post-production audio. The level of information includes the spectrum from basic to advanced, but through Mr. Rose's clear explanations the advanced information should not go over the heads of the reader.</span>

                    <span>This is an exceptional book: clear, comprehensive, and full of the kind of information you need to edit professional-quality DV sound on your desktop. Written by a Clio and Emmy-award winning sound editor, it takes you step-by-step through the postproduction process. Included are chapters on acoustics, monitoring, wiring, sync, ADR, voice over, music editing, and effects. Especially helpful is the 77-track audio CD, which includes diagnostics to help you evaluate your speakers and examples that let you hear the techniques discussed in the book. There's also a glossary, index, and generous graphics. The first chapter is a troubleshooting guide that refers readers to sections that contain the fixes ("wind noises," for example, are addressed in filtering, dialog editing, and ADR). Perhaps best of all is Jay Rose's real-world approach to his subject--this book is like spending a few hours in his studio while he patiently explains how to achieve the sound you hear in your head. I ordered this book to help solve some specific problems in editing a short film; I'll keep it within reach of my editing station to help shape the next one.</span>

                    <span>This book has lots of good information for both the new editor and the experienced. Jays techniques for dialogue editing are through and every time I read this section something new shows up. <P>His method for audio centric ADR makes it available to more folks (many people can't do traditional ADR). It is quick and as easy as ADR gets.<P>He has a very good section for cutting music to video and over all does an outstanding job of explaining the audio post process. <P>If every one would read this book and follow the advice there would not be so many videos with poorly edited audio out there.</span>
