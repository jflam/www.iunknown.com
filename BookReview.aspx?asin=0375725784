                <span id="Label1"><P> "Well, this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter. So when something world come up, any little thing, some bill to pay or decision to make, he would just sigh, his eyes tired, his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. But Beth and I...Jesus, we were fighting with everyone, anyone, each other, with strangers at bars, anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration, a kind of arrogance born of fatalism, I guess, of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month, then basically anything could happen, at any time -- all bullets bear your name, all cars are there to crush you, any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour. This was San Francisco, you know, and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean, <I>wicca?</I> -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the <I>Real World</I> tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean, when we drive, Toph and I, and we drive past people, standing on top of all these hills, part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation, and part of me wants to run them all over."</span>

                    <span>First things first: the title is a joke. No, not a joke on you, more a joke on the author, but then again, this whole book is a colossal joke on everybody and Dave Eggers doesnt single himself out for a second. Don't be afraid of the "based on a true story" line, this is worth picking up. Incredibly cynical and self-conscious, looping through a mirror image of his soul and mind, he builds his poor bleeding heart to mythic proportions, allows you to smile tenderly through the pain,then tears it all down with self-mutilating humor, pathos, cynicism, and yes: wisdom. If you've ever felt that your life was one big tragedy, but sadly enough, didn't feel the nerve to speak out (what with all the famine, death, and war in this world) buy, steal, attain this book. The author address everything, all questions will be made clear. Granted, the genius line is a hard sell, but I've read this book three times now, and it really does keep getting better. I've haven't even read most of Shakespeare more than twice. Own it. Recommed it to others. (I recommended it to my own mother for crissakes).<P>"-but what do you have? You have nothing......You have what I can afford to give. You are the panhandler begging for change,and I am the man walking briskly by, tossing a quarter or so into your paper cup. I can afford to give you this. This does not break me."------from A.H.W.O.S.G. by Dave Eggers.</span>

                    <span>I won't waste your time with a long review. There are hundreds here you can read. I will just simply and succintly tell you that "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" is the best book I have ever read. Functioning both as a sprawling memoir and an experimental novel, this book shows more creativity, guts and heart than any book I've ever read. Dave Eggers ingeniously and deftly balances heartbreaking sadness with gutbusting humor. Many times I found myself laughing but acknowledging the sadness under the jokes at the same time. Never have I approached a more self-conscious book, and never have I been so surprised how well the self-consciousness works. This would be half the book were it not for the feeling that we are reading the book AS the author is writing it, including asides, concerns, and even places where he criticizes himself for the use of certain words or phrases. The most brilliant parts are when he has characters in the book tell him that he is getting the story wrong, or exaggerating a situation. He responds with literary theory and explains what messages he is trying to convey. And those of you who do not understand that the title is meant as a joke by a writer who himself claims to be insecure are not very avid readers, for you have skipped the absolutely essential forewards and addendums. A more clever, satisfying, brilliant book with as much balls as this one has will probably not be seen again for a long time. So good was it in fact that upon finishing it, I immediately turned the book over and started again from page one. Bravo, Mr. Eggers!</span>

                    <span>Frankly, I felt this was a heartbreaking work of staggering genius that sputtered and stopped just shy of greatness.<P>The first half of the book was brilliant. The middle was torturous. The end (being that it followed so closely after the agonizing middle) just didn't feel as captivating anymore.<P>I disagree, however, with the reviewer who criticized Eggers for not caring about his mother and sister. There is tenderness and profound sadness there, you just have to perceive it underneath the facade Eggers constructs. <P>His brutal portrayal of the death of a loved one and the complication of family relationships afterward is, perhaps, too much for some readers. I found it to be honest (probably the most honest aspect of the book). <P>That said, I recommend this book to those with an open mind, an appreciation for ironic humor, and a tolerance for an unconventional approach to writing. It was mad. It was refreshing. But it was just a little too unedited to live up to the title completely.</span>

                    <span>First off, the title is a lie.<P>The book is boring. The narrator does not care about the deaths of his parents nor the future death of his sister, so how is it heartbreaking?<P>Einstein was a genius. Shakespeare was a genius. Eggers is incapable of writing a book with a plot and characters.<P>Then, all the blurbs are lies, as they were all written my people on the McSweeney's payroll.<P>And then, all the insider tax and tuition snark-fests, held by pomo hipsters on college campuses are lies.<P>And then, all the creative-writing workshops which assign this book, as well as postmodern english classes which place it on the suggested reading lists are lies.<P>The sales numbers given by the corporate conglomerates are lies, aimed at bolstering their bottom line while Eggers aims to eradicate literature by spamming the bookstores with his crap, killing trees and displacing quality literature penned by indy presses.<P>Then, all the positive reviews here are lies, written by Eggers himself, as the New York Times reported.</span>

                    <span>There are so many other good books out there, why waste your time with this one? The title is lofty and ambitious and creates expectations for the reader that this work fails to realize (Of course, Dave, you did ask for it). No question to me that Eggers has potential to be a decent writer, but his smug (oh, but I try to be self-deprecating, and I almost mean it, too!), cooler-than-thou, "Are you in on the joke?" style gets in the way of what could have been, if not a work of staggering genius, a well-told coming-of-age story.</span>
