                <span id="Label1"><I>Blade</I> meets <I>The Crow</I> and <I>The Matrix</I> in <I>Underworld</I>, a hybrid thriller that rewrites the rulebook on werewolves and vampires. It's a "cuisinart" movie (blend a lot of familiar ideas and hope something interesting happens) in which immortal vampire "death dealers" wage an ancient war against "Lycans" (werewolves), who've got centuries of revenge--and some rather ambitious genetic experiments--on their lycanthropic agenda. Given his preoccupation with gloomy architecture (mostly filmed in Budapest, Hungary), frenetic mayhem and gothic costuming, it's no surprise that first-time director Len Wiseman gained experience in TV commercials and the art departments of <I>Godzilla</I>, <I>Men in Black</I>, and <I>Independence Day</I>. His work is all surface, no substance, filled with derivative, grand-scale action as conflicted vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale, who later became engaged to Wiseman) struggles to rescue an ill-fated human (Scott Speedman) from Lycan transformation. It's great looking all the way, and a guaranteed treat for horror buffs, who will eagerly dissect its many strengths and weaknesses. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>And I'll say it again:<P>What a STUPID movie!<P>At first it looks rather good when you look at the dvdbox. You would expect something like Batman mixed with the Matrix. But it's not! The storyline is horrible, everything rolls out of the closet, storyelements are taken for granted, and don't get me started about the actors and especially actresses.... what a bunch of losers! Where did they get them!? A mental institution?<BR>The only good parts are the settings and some of the special effects, for the rest I would say.....<P>TO BE MAKING FUN OF THIS MOVIE IS LIKE POOPING ON POOP!</span>

                    <span>This is a slick film. From the filming locations to the wardrobe worn by the actors, this film is definitely about style. The plot centers around a beautiful female vampire named Selene. Selene has spent the past few centuries hunting down and killing Werewolves. She lives for the kill and hates them with a passion. But fate is not always kind, and sometimes takes us on a very difficult path. As luck would have it, Selene falls in love with a handsome Werewolf. <P>This is not your typical, gothic Vampire flick. The Vampires and Werewolves in Underworld make good use of human technology to help them in their quest to annihilate one another. This movie is similar to your common action film in that it is full of high tech firearms, computers, hip clothes, and fancy cars. But it differs in that this one actually has an interesting plot. Kate Beckinsale is very sexy as Selene. She looks terrific in her black leather outfit. I highly recommend this movie.</span>

                    <span>Are you hungry for blood? Underworld is the latest attempt at re-vamping the myths about Vampires and Werewolves on screen. It presents us with a gothic tale of the "race-war" between the two species and takes a different look at the origin of both myths. In Underworld, the bloodlines of both species began as a "virus" that infects the blood, rather than the usual evolution derived from ancient mysticism and legends. This changes the perspective of the audience from the opening of the film and forces us to re-think anything we previously understood about lycanthropic and vampiric legends. It's a unique start.<P>Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity) leads the tale as Selene a vampire "Death Dealer" whose sole purpose is to execute all the "Lychans" she encounters, in the attempt to exterminate the race of Werewolves forever. The Werewolves, or "Lychans," are led by Michael Sheen (Mary Reilly) as Lucian, whose convoluted back-story is the basis for the mysterious plot of Underworld. The third and most unique character is Michael Corvin, played by Scott Speedman (Dark Blue,) a handsome human, whom the Werewolves believe holds the key to end the war. <P>Underworld's writing is the product of a team of authors: Danny McBride, Director Len Wiseman, and Kevin Grevioux (who also starred in the film as a Lychan.) Their combined ideas formed the script with the intent of making it a full-fledged mystery, designed to unfold as the film played out. It was for that reason they deliberately did not reveal too much information at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, there is so little information revealed in the beginning, that it causes the viewer to be a bit more than perplexed. Without the benefit of a back-story and with all the new mythology being introduced so fast, so immediately, the audience has to struggle for a grip on who actually should be the hero. Although Kate Beckinsale's character Selene is introduced first, it becomes quickly apparent, that either she is an "anti-hero" or there is something distinctly amiss with her psyche. Therefore, we start to search for an alternative hero, or at least someone to identify with. Using our past knowledge of Vampire/Werewolf legends and stories, we try to glean what could possibly be the reality of the situation. However, all the rules have been changed in this film, so our archives of knowledge on Lychans and Vampires have been declared null and void. Consequently, detecting which species is supposed to be the one to "root for" is indistinct until much later in the film. The problem with this is: at the beginning we miss a lot of the action sequences while pondering and trying to discern which species to identify with. The endless perplexity we experience detracts from the initial scenes while we try to integrate the new rules this script has postulated. If we weren't so busy contemplating heroes, we could better enjoy the action-packed sequences and spectacular effects! <P>The effects are truly something to behold. Various combinations of CGI, live action and Animatronics created new and original Werewolf transformations and Vampire agility in all manner of action sequences. There were definitely some action shots in this film that set a new precedent. Inspired by the constraints of their budget, the effects crew's ingenuity was brilliant. They came up with some amazing alternatives to standard action/effect sequences. This also affected the cinematography. To make certain shots happen, both effects team and cinematographer had to make suggestions and alterations to accommodate each other and incorporate the Director Len Wiseman's vision of bringing a graphic novel to life. Each scene is blocked and storyboarded and colored-he favors "blues" in particular-to look as if it were straight out of a comic book. The whole visual effect is stunning.<P>Despite the initial legend confusion in the opening of the film, Underworld does prove to be unique, interesting and plot-driven. Everything, from its super-fast pacing, spectacular effects, dark characters, sets, costumes and lighting, proves to be well worth watching. This film holds its own as a decadent, elegant, action flick, amidst the sea of pointless re-makes and story-starved-sequels in the action genre. Taken as a whole, Len Wiseman's distilled and surprisingly sanguine-less, cerulean vision can slake the blood thirst in any fan, hungry for action!</span>

                    <span>23 minutes of new/remixed material, the glossy slipcase boasts. New bonus features, it boasts. Don't be a fool (as I was) and allow an attractive package to convince you that you need to buy yet another version of a pre-existing DVD. I, for one, am getting rather sick of this "release-one-version-then-release-another-one-six-months-later" deal that movie studios and DVD distributors pull to squeeze even more money from our pockets--I'd much rather wait extra-long for a definitive version of something than buy multiple versions of it. I am not the biggest "Underworld" fan, either, but what this version had to offer seemed intriguing--considerably less so when I watched the actual film. The recut/new scenes are mostly pointless filler, adding additional weight to an already heavy film, and do nothing to further develop characters or enrich the plot. "Underworld" plays best as a guilty-pleasure in the vein of "Ghosts of Mars"--put your logic on the back burner for a few hours and just obliterate your senses with some art-directed action. Those fans of "The Crow" will undoubtedly love this cooler-looking version--complete with a comic- and storyboard book--but for the more casual viewer, I'd merely stick with the stripped down, original DVD release, which is sufficient, and undoubtedly cheaper.</span>
