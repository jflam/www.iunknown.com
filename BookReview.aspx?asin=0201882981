                    <span>I would give this book a ten-star rating if Amazon let me. This is simply the most comprehensive, useful, accurate, and readable GoLive book I have ever read.<p>Another reader posted a very poor review of this book, due to an isolated printing problem (missing pages). Shame on that reader for posting such a meaningless review! The publisher will gladly replace your book if you just bother to ask. Don't punish the authors and the content of this fine book for your own laziness.<p>This is a ten-star book, don't hesitate - buy a copy today!</span>

                    <span>I have found Real World Golive 6 to be a wonderful help to me in my html editing.  I am on my fourth site so I am definitely a newbie, but have found this book to be quite powerful.  It is definitely one that will stretch the ability of a newbie at times which I like because I don't need to buy a new book as my expertise grows.  If you run into a tight spot with Real World Golive because it is over your head, try using the standard manual in conjunction with Real World Golive to get you up and running again. Highest regards for this book.</span>

                    <span>While this book seems to have everything, it is laid out for someone who knows every term for everything.  If you don't come knowing everything about HTML, CSS, XML, etc., forget it.  There are far fewer hands-on sections, walk-throughs or advice than the other excellent Real World books.  This book is devoted to telling you in great detail how to use the software with what you already know.  I'm no slouch with HTML and have used Dreamweaver 3, but this book will leave many of us in the dust.  Buried in the intro, the authors tell you that if you're a beginner, start elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Real World GoLive 6 shows you how to hit the ground running, and it leaves all the other instructional manuals just standing.<p>As Adobe has continued to improve and expand the features and capabilities of GoLive, the latest in Glenn Fleishman and Jeff Carlson's series of books, Real World GoLive 6, continues to provide up to date tips and instructions on how to utilize the latest, most powerful web site construction techniques.<p>Though other GoLive instructional books are aimed primarily at the new users, this book's focus is in taking the intermediate user to a higher level of expertise. The new features in GoLive 6, such as integration of database content and Adobe Web Workgroup Server, are explained in an intelligible, almost conversational style. This isn't a book full of 'techno-babble' where you have to follow endless cross references and are still left somewhat in the dark, but a clear, concise plan as to how to construct highly professional and complex web sites.<p>Real World GoLive 6 takes the mystery out of using Cascading Style Sheets, custom JavaScripts, DHTML, and creating dynamically served sites through database integration. Site management, server issues, site synchronization, adding multimedia content, and other complex topics are all explained and demonstrated in easy to understand, step-by-step examples and exercises.<p>Nothing is overlooked. From instructions and tips for individual page construction using tables, floating boxes, HTML forms, to integrating these pages into a seamless web site architecture, this book covers it all.<p>I advise all my students, whether beginners or advanced, to purchase this book. Someday they will have a question about GoLive that they desperately need answered, and I recommend that the first place they look is in the Real World GoLive book.</span>
