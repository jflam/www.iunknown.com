                    <span>I have had the opportunity to use the designs in this book over the past year. The designs or "strategic activities" are creative and guarnateed to advance the planning process for a wide range of organizations.  The instructions have just the right amount of detail to adaquately prepare the facilitator. There is tremendous felxibility with each acitivity to accomodate longer or shorter amounts of time. The designs are <br>crip, imaginative, thoughtful, rooted in practice. Its a book I refer to again and again.  Its been an invaluable tool to my work.</span>

                    <span>If you have ever been involved in a strategic planning effort that fell short of expectations then this book is for you.  In plain language the authors lay out a planning framework with supporting involvement practices to gain organizational buy-in.  They provide explanations and case study examples to show the connections between "what needs to be done and how to do it."  A chapter titled "The Toolbox" covers the rational and procedures for involvement mechanisms that include "Nominal Group Process to generate ideas, Affinity Diagrams & Mindmaping to organize complex issues and Collapsing Consensus & Las Vegas Voting to help in problem solving & decision-making."  There are valuable discussions on organizing the planning effort and post-planning followup / accountability.  This volume supports any organizational effort to set goals, improve quality or enhance effectiveness in resource management through collaborative processes.</span>

                    <span>We have used these activities in a highly inclusive strategic planning process in our school district.  We wanted to involve many different stakeholder groups (parents, teachers, students and community members) in our district-wide planning effort.  Participants enjoyed these activities.  Our district now has a vision of the future that people are proud of and an implementation plan to make it work.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for those involved in planning.  In addition to the background and conceptual information provided in the book, the authors have included a variety of activities that can be employed to address specific objectives.  There are numerous exercises with "easy to understand" instructions on how to facilitate the activities.  I've used several of them recently and received excellent feedback about the process.  More importantly, the outcomes were great!</span>
