                    <span>Although quite adept in Photoshop, I thought this book gave me more "lessons" then I thought initially possible.  Overall, I thought it was an excellent read as one can read this over a weekend sitting in front of the computer and replicating each step 1 by 1, or just out on the couch for fun.  From the author's insights into game texturing, I was able to quickly gleam how I could instantly recreate the same effects and now am confident discussin game texturing techniques with anyone. I don't generally write reviews, but this one was worth it.  This is definitely a good book for anyone who wants to UP their skills and deepen their knowledge.</span>

                    <span>I think some people get off on writing negative reviews about books, my guess is that some of them did not even read it.  The fact is that this book will probably double your texturing skills.  Some very powerful, progressive, methods are taught.  In the end, you will be using photshop in a completely new light.  So what if some of the examples are from a game a few years ago, it does not matter.  The techniques will never any time soon be outdated.  Examples are just that, examples.  It is what is behind the examples that is of such high value in this book.  Apply what techniques this book teaches you, and use your creativity to make something that is not from a year or so ago.  I'm sure that is what the author intended, as is the case with most.  I guess some of these people who write these reviews are already game gods, and anything short of the greatest textures on the planet is of no use to them.  Its under 200 pages, but if you work the book the right way and take your time, it will take you almost a month to complete, even if you know photoshop.  As for a rehash of what is in his other book, I cannot comment because I have not read it.  The final texture tutorial in this book is almost like a Rite of Passage. It is as advanced and as complex as you will find anywhere in print.  If you can do it, you're well on your way.  Bottom line, there simply is not many texturing books out there, and this is probably the best one available at this time.</span>

                    <span>Anyone considering purchasing this who has bought David Franson's other book "2D Artwork and 3D Modelling for Game Artists" should think again. This book is just a much smaller version of that. I bought them both, and I was quite disappointed that David would just blatantly copy his other work. There are a few different tutorials but it's not worth paying the price, get the other book instead.  </span>

                    <span>I found this book really helpful as a beginner just starting to expand my horizons into making textures.  I read the other reviews and I guess that those people are further along or are trying to promote other books and other authors.
<br />I found the tutorials very easy to follow and I was able to make every texture and image, unlike many other books on the market which give you vague direction and provide end-pictures which look nothing like your own final result.
<br />I found the writing style very engaging which is unusual in this type of book -- most books of this type are so dry you can't even read two pages straight.
<br />If you are looking for a book where you can actually make every single diagram and illustration that the author claims you can -- this is your book.  </span>

                    <span>I returned this book. Not much of an opening sentence, but that's about all there is to it. The book itself is small and short, and as fast as this industry moves, is quite outdated. Now that in itself wouldn't be such a detrimental thing, as getting a book published often takes over a year from final copy to it showing up on shelves, and game engines are outdated as fast as video cards are. The tutorials and examples are pretty bland, exceedingly flat, and lacking a lot of the detailing that you see in other artist's work. I don't even remember there being anything about texturing characters, which is a major aspect of game texturing. He also doesn't go into the perks of working with layers as much as he should, and a lot of people will probably dive into the tutorials, screw up, and not be able to go back and change things. In games, modularity is king, and appeal comes in a very close second. Unfortunately, this book really lacks both, and you would probably do well to look elsewhere. While being more theory and less practice, Owen Demers' book "Digital Texturing and Painting" might be a better bet. The best bet though, is experience, and the advice and criticism of your peers. Use them.</span>
