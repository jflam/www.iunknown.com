                <span id="Label1">With clients from Vera Wang to Tina Turner singing their praises, Stephen Sills and James Huniford, of Sills Huniford Associates, have written the ultimate guide to creating a beautiful home. This book brings the luxury and sensuality of Sills Huniford's signature style to a practical level, addressing concerns like integrating technology into the home, devising the most flexible floor plan, and getting the most out of a small space and modest budget. Every aspect of style is addressed in clear language detailing the basic lessons of design. Their unmatched understanding of atmosphere, color, and design is brought to life in stunning and never-before-seen color photographs that prove both inspiring and practical. Written by Michael Boodro, a former editor at Vogue and current editor for the New York Times Magazine style section, DWELLINGS is certain to become a touchstone for a generation that is searching for a new level of style and sophistication in the way they live.</span>

                    <span>This is NOT a "decorating book" for for someone about to redo a room in their home, and looking for ideas. The book has a curious layout I found interesting: small size, no dustjacket, heavy on text; that should tip off potential readers that this one is a little different. It is more like a design essay (and it's highly readable), with photos, close-ups of fabrics, endpapers spread throughout with fancy script font, etc. There is no "how-to" here, no HGTV budget tips, no "oh THAT'S what I'll do with my lamp!" inspirations. You just sort of curl up with this and learn about their approach to design (they probably hand this to potential clients). The book is a luxury, so spend money elsewhere if you are looking for design reference.</span>

                    <span>This book looks good at first glimpse but then it falls apart. The admittedly stylish graphic design cannot compensate for the small pictures, the trite prose, and the old ideas. I expected this book to offer something really fresh but it didn't. I feel majorly ripped off.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be like a stylish but vacant house. It looked good from the outside, but once I got inside the book, there wasn't very much in there to keep my interest. I actually became annoyed with myself for spending money on this when I tried to read this book and realized that the authors have nothing new to say. I've read it all before. Many times. ("It is your personality that brings a room alive." Oh really? I read that 20 years ago in my mother's old Better Homes and Gardens decorating book. "The bed will influence all other choices in the room." I paid money to read that? )<BR> I also find it annoying that they keep talking about themselves in the writing.-who cares? The pictures are too small. Although the rooms look pretty enough, I kept wanting to see more of each room or to have room pictures used larger, because it was frustrating that I felt I couldn't see enough of the rooms or enough of what is in the rooms. (They take a whole room pictures of a bedroom or a living room and use it on the equivalent of maybe a quarter of a page and put some fabric design or wallpaper pattern behind it. Ick.)<BR>I definitely did not get my money's worth on this book.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most elegant books I've ever seen. The linen texture and tipped on photos are gorgeous and the photography inside is incredible. The photos show beautiful rooms and I love the way they give ideas and information that I can use in my house. I found plenty of ideas I'll try to copy and I know I'll give this as a gift--it's such a nice package.</span>

                    <span>As a big fan of these designers' work for a long time, I was thrilled to see they had finally written a book about their unique approach to luxury home design. Classic, simple, clean, yet the most luxurious ideas and feel make the ideas in their book great to look at and not so intimadating to try on one's own.</span>
