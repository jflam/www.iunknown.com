                <span id="Label1">COM (Component Object Model) forms the foundation of OLE and ActiveX as well as Microsoft's vision for componentized, distributed computing. <i>Inside COM</i> explains COM from the ground up, beginning with a lucid overview of what COM is and what benefits it offers programmers, then delving into the details of its actual operation. While Rogerson provides code samples in C++, the book isn't about C++ nor is it overwhelmed with program listings. Rogerson masterfully starts with a high-level view that doesn't get swamped in unnecessary detail then later fills in the gaps and addresses advanced topics. He offers just the right approach for programmers who might be intimidated by COM's apparent complexity.</span>

                    <span>A great look at COM under the hood. The style is clear and friendly, and the code is very well-written and documented. The author starts the first chapter with an excellent introduction that establishes the merits of COM as a component technology as well as the benefits of component-based programming. The following chapters continue with the development of COM Components from DOS command line programmes to fully-working COM Dll's.<P>One of the great things about this book is how the author endeavors to explain the cryptic and confusing terminology of COM. I especially enjoyed the explaination of the concept of COM Apartments, which is the best treatment of the subject that I came upon to date.<P>One has to keep in mind that this book is about COM, and just that. Active X controls are barely touched upon. ATL is not used at all. Instead the author builds his own light-weight library of classes, and that is the only drawback to the book that I can see. <P>It's a great book for understanding the enternals of COM, but you'll probably need another to cover ATL, which is largely the standard library for writing COM and Active X components in C++.</span>

                    <span>Hi.<P>In Inside COM, Dale Rogerson breaks down a software architecture that defies the limit of software reusability via an innovative model: Component Object Model. Rogerson demonstrates a very good understanding of COM. And in this book, he shares his in-depth knowledge via a breakdown of the foundation of COM. The concepts and advices Rogerson presents are imperative for understanding the architecture and creation process of COM components. For instance, the author analyzes object containment and aggregation and demonstrates fully implemented examples of both forms of components. Furthermore, he discusses the importance of reference counting in COM and possible problems programmers face when implementing aggregated components such as memory leak. Rogerson breakdown of COM architecture in this book definitely helps programmers learn COM at its core and move one step closer to designing and implementing their own COM components.<P>COM design and implementation is an involved process. I believe even the experienced COM programmers would agree. However, in Inside COM Rogerson provides a clear analysis of the theories behind COM and demonstrates each aspect of COM architecture with valuable C++ examples. Lastly, he concludes the book with a complete C++ implementation of a set of COM components that utilizes most if not all the theories he discusses throughout this book. COM architecture offers developers an unparalleled flexibility and Inside COM is a key book to understanding COM.<P>I recommend Inside COM to advanced C++ programmers and real-world COM developers.<P>Kuphryn</span>

                    <span>This book begins by assuming the reader knows little more than basic C++. In the second chapter it introduces some simple C++ classes about which the reader will think to herself, "okay, this is simple". From there it builds: adding incremental changes to the original C++ code, gradually making it more useful, explaining each change as it goes. By the end of the book, the original example has grown up into a full fledged COM component, written completely from scratch. No wizards, no templates. At this point the reader will not only be able to recognize the elements of a COM component, but more importantly, she will understand *why* COM works the way it does. The mystery surrounding the ATL and Visual Studio wizards evaporates, and the developer can see them for what they really are: simple shortcuts.</span>
