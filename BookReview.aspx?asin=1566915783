                <span id="Label1">Think getting away from the more than six million neighbors one has while living in the San Francisco Bay Area is difficult? This region possesses more parkland and a greater number of diversity of trails than any other comparably sized metropolitan region in the country. All of these outdoor havens are remarkably accessible and author Ann Marie Brown offers the best ones in Foghorn Outdoors 101 Great Hikes of the San Francisco Bay Area. This book provides detailed information on the trails found in the regions' numerous state and national parks -- from mountaintop rambles on Mount Diablo and Mount Tamalpais to seashore strolls at Point Reyes and Ano Nuevo. All trails are rated according to difficulty and the time required for hiking, and offer tips on weather, ways to avoid the crowds, best family hikes, and much more. Special attention is also given to wildlife habitats and areas of botanical interest. Insightful, informative, and enlightening, Foghorn Outdoors 101 Great Hikes of the San Francisco Bay Area is a must-have for casual or experienced hikers alike.</span>

                    <span>Day hiking is one of my passions and I have been looking for this kind of book ever since I moved to the bay area. I have been dreaming of packing a light day pack and hitting the open trails in this ever so stressful valley. This dream came true a couple of weekends ago when I found this book. Finally I have started to put some miles on my boots again.<P>What can you expect from this book? Well, you will find a wealth of information on the trails in this area. Each trail comes with a pretty detailed map with short but good directions. The book also rates the level of each trail, elevation change and distance. It also points out things like pet accessibility, parking and times to go. The information is precise and detailed. There are also additional hiker information for the trails. I love this book and would consider it a great price for the freedom it gives you.</span>

                    <span>Foghorn Outdoors is one of our favorite publishers. Among their authors, we thoroughly enjoy books by Maria Goodavage (The California Dog Lover's Companion), Tom Stienstra (California Hiking), and Ann Marie Brown. Ann Marie Brown writes fantastic hiking guides; especially for folks like us that love to do dog friendly, easy day hikes while on vacation. It's a great way to enjoy an area. All hikes include information as to whether or not they are dog friendly (wonderful for planning purposes). All are from one to a few hours. The hikes are graded as to their difficulty, from easy to strenuous, and, yes!, the hikes are rated with two to four stars for overall quality and scenic beauty. Icons are included to provide additional information on the trail. All these features are great for planning, especially when you're a visitor to the area and want to find those hikes that are most appealing to your interests. The directions to the trailhead and for the hike are clear and easy to understand. Areas covered are the San Francisco Peninsula, the East and South Bay, Marin, Napa, Sonoma, and the Santa Cruz Mountains. We've done some of these hikes and have picked out more for our next trip. They truly are the 101 Great Hikes of the San Francisco Bay Area. If you are heading to the Bay area and like to hike, we highly recommend a copy of this book to accompany you on your travels.</span>

                    <span>For advanced hikers this book misses the mark. I would have liked more detailed hiking descriptions and more off the beaten track destinations. Longer distance hikes are also needed in this book.</span>

                    <span>I owned the first edition of this book (the one with the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover) and I just loved it. It completely changed the way I feel about living in the Bay Area. There are so many wonderful trails around here and this book takes you to the best of them. I just recently bought the second edition (the one with the red cover) to give to a friend, but I wound up keeping it for myself because I saw that the author added trail options for every single hike in the book, so now there are really 202 hikes in the book and not 101! I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who lives in the SF Bay Area.</span>
