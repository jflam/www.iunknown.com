                <span id="Label1">When Carl L. Becker's classic study of the text of the Declaration of Independence first appeared in 1922, it marked a great departure from the passionate and patriotic tenor of many existing historical analyses. Becker claims his work was well received by all reviewers save one, who criticized its preoccupation with hard cold documents. In the 1941 introduction to this edition, Becker defends his approach, stating: "I was aware that men had bled and died for freedom.... But on this occasion I chose to write a book about the document itself ... a state paper of sufficient renown to be classed with the world's classics of political literature." <P> Becker describes the rhythm of the first line of the Declaration of Independence as "that felicitous, haunting cadence which is the peculiar quality of Jefferson's best writing." He goes on to define the purpose of the document, its views, where those views arose, and how succeeding generations have accepted or modified them. Chapters such as "Historical Antecedents of the Declaration: The Natural Rights Philosophy," "Drafting the Declaration; The Literary Qualities of the Declaration," and "The Philosophy of the Declaration in the Nineteenth Century" distinguish this book as one of the most complete studies of America's--and arguably the world's--most important historical document.</span>

                    <span>In high school, kids spend time reviewing the Declaration of Independence and learning its meaning. This book goes well beyond that to inspect the thoughts and ideas that were prevalent in the late 18th century and how they influenced the document. Becker goes into great detail about natural rights theory according to John Locke and explores the ins and outs of its implications. This to me was the strongest and most enjoyable part of the book. He also explores the thoughts and ideas that were circulating Britain at the time. <p>Building on this foundation, he weaves a tale as to why certain things were worded as they were (like Britain being run as a ruthless tyrant), and why certain things were left out altogether (like slavery). He also closely examines the changes that took place in the drafts and attributes them to individuals who proofread Jefferson's draft. I really could have done without his granularity in this area.<p>In all, this was a fascinating read. For those of you who want to extend your knowledge beyond the simple presentation of the document you received in high school, I highly recommend buying this book!</span>

                    <span>I have read this book, off and on, several times.  It never ceases to amaze me.  I tend to be a controversialist and rely upon this book often to help those who seem convinced that the Founding Fathers were of a particular religious persuasion.  While foundationally on a personal level this may be true, in general they bowed down to a higher power: Reason.  Yet this was not new to them nor were their political theories.  Their roots came from somewhere else and that somewhere else was from the European soil they had left.<p>Becker does an awesome job dissecting the Declaration and its influences primarily from Jefferson through Locke.  The natural rights philosophy chapter is awesome.  This book is over seventy five years old and its arguments have been revisited and even countered but the book is still foundationally necessary for anyone who seeks to study the Declaration of Independence.  In terms of studying the Declaration, there is before Becker's book and there is after.<p>There are many revealing insights and oddities that appear when Becker displays the lines that have been cut from the original draft (e.g. notice there is no mention of slavery in the final version; the reasons for its excision are included in the book).  These little tidbits opened my eyes a bit to the relatively benign history of this document that I had been taught.  A little knowledge is a dangerous thing so have a little fun and check this book out.</span>

                    <span>Carl L. Becker's book on the Declaration of Independence first appeared  nearly eighty years ago, and yet it is still a valuable and stimulating  study of its subject.  It is dated now, for two large reasons:<p>First,  Becker wrote before the revolution in studying the history of ideas, and  thus unavoidably predates the close-focus examination of the controversy  between Great Britain and her American colonies in the years from 1765 to  1776. Two recent books should be read alongside Becker's monograph --  Pauline Maier's AMERICAN SCRIPTURE: MAKING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE  (New York: Knopf, 1997; Vintage paperback, 1998), and John Phillip Reid,  CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, abridged ed. (Madison:  University of Wisconsin Press, 1995).<p>Second, Becker focuses on Jefferson  as *the* author of the Declaration, neglecting that he was actually the  draftsman selected by the Continental Congress and his colleagues within  the drafting committee.  Thus, the Declaration -- no matter what Jefferson  said about it in later life -- was not primarily a window into his own  thinking about natural rights and democracy, but rather the final statement  by Congress as to the reasons for breaking ties with Britain.  To be sure,  later generations have read it as an expression of Jefferson's mind --  rather than of "the American mind," as he put it.  But, as Maier  shows in AMERICAN SCRIPTURE, Jefferson's thinking was nowhere near as  unique or advanced on these subjects as later hero-worshipping biographers  have suggested.<p>In particular, as Maier has shown, the age-old dispute  about whether Jefferson was or was not influenced by Locke is somewhat  beside the point.  Even so, Becker's fine book is indispensable for  deciding whether we should read the Declaration through Lockean or  Jeffersonian lenses, and whether we should regard it as a codification of  American aspirations or as a hypocritical catalogue of principles we cannot  live up to.<p>R.

                    <span>This easy to read book disects the wording and phrases in all the various drafts of the declaration.  It explores the origins of the ideas and phrasing used, and discusses why individual words or complete phrases were  changed, added or removed as they were debated first in committee and later  by the Continental Congress.  This book is commonly cited by other authors.   As an example, it serves both as a source for and wonderful companion to  Bernard Bailyn's book "The Ideological Origins to the American  Revolution"</span>
