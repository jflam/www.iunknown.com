                <span id="Label1">This manual-style book instantly dives into Eckhart Tolle's principles of "living in the moment," which could be a jarring experience for readers who haven't read his preceding book, <I>The Power of Now</I>. For the initiated, though, this makes an excellent companion guide--rich in exercises and meditations to help readers get out of their minds so they can live more peacefully in their bodies. Sometimes it's hard to fathom what on earth Tolle is talking about: "To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of 'feeling-realization' is enlightenment." Be patient. All concepts will be revealed (or at least more carefully explained). Ultimately, Tolle leads readers into a new form of thinking (or actually <I>not thinking</I>) that erases the consuming habits of waiting, worrying, and being in fear. The first step is ending the "delusion of time." He asks, "Are you always trying to get somewhere other than where you are? ... Is most of your doing just a means to an end?" If so, Tolle has a book full of advice for you. As simplistic as this may sound, Tolle's work has  spiritual merit and depth, especially for frantic Westerners who find their lives diminished by packed schedules and busy-ness. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>When first introduced to this book, I was highly skeptical. After all, I have already read many religious, spiritual and philosophical texts. Reading used to fulfill me momentarily, as there was a gradual "let-down" as spiritual sensations became "medusa"d into cold stone intellectual mind-stuff. This book was able to point past itself, allowed me to watch myself inspite of mind-stuff, and to be able to find peace in the present moment.  Practicing the Power of Now, as the title suggests, is more condensed and instruction-oriented than the Power of Now.  People have asked me which one to recommend first.  I guess you just have to go with feeling.</span>

                    <span>Thinking that I could learn something new about myself and the ability to 'practice' living in the Now, I realized I'm always living in the Now. It comes with realization and if this book helps someone, that's wonderful, but it didn't help me. I already practice living in the presence of God and God is always in the Now. 
<br />
<br />Tolle's descriptions of the mind and of meditation may be great for others who are just starting out on a personal journey of finding Truth. The mental aspects of the mind can be programmed and this book, I think, expounds on that premise.

                    <span>When I read this book, I found it to be very true. But I have never managed to integrate it into my daily life. I have tried just to do nothing, be present, and it tires me. It seems to me that his method of finding peace is to force it. It also seems to me to be a very apathetic way of life.
<br />
<br />I do not think this book is all crap, but it is way too extreme to be adapted for most humans. Of course it is good to be present, and not to be concerned too much about the past and future, but I rather suggest something in between what "normal" people do and Tolle's teachings, than to take things to its extremes.
<br />
<br />As many already have mentioned, this book is a repetitive zen ripoff. For people who are not familiar with this kind of books, I suggest reading something a little less extreme. This book can be dangerous.

                    <span>I have studied many spiritual paths for over 30 years, and the wisdom Eckhart Tolle provides in Practicing the Power of Now is truly enlightening. I learned much from this book, and it is one of the few that I highly recommend. I learned much from the wisdom provided, and once applied, I felt a genuine release of the negativity that I used to feel. This is another rare contribution that I HIGHLY recommend, which is why I give it the five stars it deserves.</span>

                    <span>I see that some readers are concerned about repetition in the various publications and question whether economic motives are the driving force. I do not know Mr. Tolle and withhold judgment. However, through many years of experiential reading I recognize when books consist of far more than words. The wisdom of the author's higher consciousness is being directed through the printed media. It's there for the taking by all who will slow down and allow it in. Many will recognize that following an evolving workshop teacher over time allows the student to partake of the increasing wisdom carried and shared by the teacher. Although the logical premise in a series of writings may remain the same, later compositions might convey increasingly higher "energy hits". Looking at the "value added" component might be a consideration when deciding what to purchase. As with everything else, individuals should use their own discretion to get a feeling sense of what might be good for them. The rich energy behind the words in this volume sent me to deep places within myself. I suggest being fully present with each sentence, one at a time, in order to get the most out of the reading experience.</span>
