                    <span>Bruce Schneier has an M.S. in Computer Science from American University and a B.S. in Physics from the University of Rochester but he is self-educated in the areas of computer security and cryptography. An acknowledged expert in the field of cryptography, he has written eight books and dozens of articles on topics as wide ranging as techniques for securing installations of the MacOS to the detailed specifications of an encryption algorithm. He used to be president of Counterpane Systems, which was a consulting firm specializing in cryptography and computer security. He is now Chief Technical Officer of Counterpane Internet Security, Inc., a company he co-founded, which provides world wide real-time security monitoring services.<P> Secrets & Lies is an attempt at writing a book to provide everything you wanted to know about cryptography, computer hacking, and the security issues of computers and computer networks. The book is written in three main sections. The first concentrates on the modern electronic environment and the threats to security and commerce that exist within it, and how these weaknesses and threats compare to the more traditional security threats that have existed for years. The second section deals with the main categories of technologies that exist to secure computers and computer networks, and with the weaknesses of each of the types of security. The third section deals with how to develop a threat model, how to analyze a system for security vulnerabilities, and the future of data network security.<P> Secrets & Lies contains a lot of information arranged as a broad overview of information technology security. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a technician's handbook for securing a server or network. The system administrator or network operator may find some of the sections, such as how to analyze a system for security vulnerabilities, very useful but will not find a lot of answers on how to secure their particular network or system.<P> The main points that the author is attempting to impart can be discovered fairly quickly are that security is a process and not a product, security should be layered like an onion, security is like a chain in that it is only as strong as it's weakest link, and finally that security should be applied to the entire system and not just individual pieces. Yes, the book does read as if a computer security consultant wrote it, which is exactly what the author has been doing for a good part of his life. Having said that, the book is very readable and would be understandable to most business people, whether a person is an IT professional or a financial department manager. If new to the IT field or IT security a person would benefit greatly from this book.<P> Another theme of the author's, though it is only mentioned once, is the idea that computer security rests on the three pillars of integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Though much of the book is admittedly written with the goal of explaining how each of these "pillars" can or can't be accomplished, a disservice is done by not mentioning these principles earlier and providing them a higher level of importance. The technologies, the threats, and the weaknesses of the technologies receive the limelight in this book but the big "so what" is why the technologies even exist. The "why" is explained by the three pillars and though they are a conceptual idea it is important that the reader understand their importance prior to getting distracted by 128 bit encryption which is, after all, only a means to an end.<P> The IT professional; however, may find the book overly long and wordy. To make the different technologies understandable to almost anyone the author made free and extensive use of analogies that can at times be quite lengthy and simplistic. The analogies do accomplish the goal of clearly explaining the underlying principles, operation, and problems in several areas such as PKI and certificates but the IT professional who already is familiar with the topic will cringe at some of the simplistic explanations.<P> This is a good one over the world familiarization book on digital security. IT professionals should read this book, though they might want to consider skipping the first six chapters. The first six chapters are; however, an excellent primer for managers who are unfamiliar with data network security and the huge challenge posed by securing information systems and networks.<P>PJZ</span>

                    <span>Schneier's job is security. How do you get more customers? By scaring them. He does plenty of this in this book, and even admits at the end that part of his agenda is to drum up business for his newly restructured company, Counterpane. Of course, this admission directly follows Schneier's comment that the best way to secure your network is by outsourcing (read: hiring Counterpane to do it).<P>That said, aside from the standard-issue security hype and redundant examples, Schneier has outlined the important parts of the security process in a way that can be understood by all. His emphasis on addressing threats, and not just vulnerabilities, is very welcoming. Too many times, authors and companies spend all of their time and money addressing every known vulnerability. By prioritizing the fixes according to the capability and intent of the perceived adversaries (hackers, corporate spies, etc.), the overall security is greatly enhanced. If there's no threat, then even the most vulnerable system is secure.</span>

                    <span>If Bruce Schneier has acquired a habit, it is the ability to take the same old material and rehash it into different books, year after year. My guess is that, next year, he'll use another slightly different angle and try to sell you the same basic information. What you need to do, as a consumer, is step back and see this book for what it is: supplemental income and marketing for Bruce Schneier. <P>Years ago, Bruce was laid off from AT&T Bell Labs. Since then, Bruce has been using rubes like you to augment his salary. Let's face it; if Bruce were a Ken Thompson or a Claude Shannon, he'd probably still have his job at Bell Labs. But he isn't and he doesn't. Instead he wrote a book and touted himself as an expert to an industry of people who didn't know any better. <P>Secrets and Lies is just a frankenstein book. Different parts from Applied Cryptography were ripped off and sewn back together to create a book that moves slowly and talks at a grade school level. I suppose he's probably targeting MBAs with this book. Bruce probably figured that the MBA crowd would be scared away by the strange diagrams and formulas in Applied Cryptography.<P>Recently I spoke with a PhD, from Brown, who performed decades of research in number theory. He recommended "Cryptography in C and C++," by Michael Welschenbach. He also said "I don't know why people think Applied Cryptography is such a good book. He [Schneier] doesn't seem to understand the mathematics very well." Pick up Applied Cryptography sometime and compare it side-by-side with Welschenbach's book. You'll see what that PhD was talking about. <P>What I find truly onerous about his books is the condescending tone that Schneier adopts when addressing the reader. It's if he's saying "I am so much more elite than you, I can't even begin to tell you." The truth is that Bruce Schneier is a lot of style without much substance. What he lacks in ability he makes up for with moxie. Having lived in Minneapolis, I'm more than familiar with the type of yuppie pretenders that live on Hennepin Avenue with their nose piercings and their tattoos. Bruce, that ponytail doesn't fool anybody. You're just another suit with something to sell.</span>

                    <span>I first tried reading the Authors other book, Applied Cryptography, but that was way too technical for my needs.<BR>Then along comes this book, at just the right level. I encourage everyone to read this to get a basic appreciation of the issues and underlying principles. The only disappointment was there is very little material on Chip/Smart Cards; this is a fast-evolving area of study, and I hope there is another edition soon with a chapter on this topic.</span>
