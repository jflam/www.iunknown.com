                    <span>Tom Doak has written a wonderful book on the how's and whys of golf course architecture.<P>His pleasant writing style means the book is easy to read and full of plenty of useful information to both the player and designer.<P>The book does not offer a lot of information into the specifics of construction, instead focusing on all the details of how to consider routing of holes, placement of hazards, trees etc.<P>Tom reviews, in historical context, many of the world's great holes and uses them as examples of how they achieved their design goals and what made the holes great.<P>Tom does not forget to use this forum as a way to educate potential developers about the important job the golf course architect.<P>I recommend this book whole-heartedly.</span>

                    <span>Of all of the books that attempt to teach the lay person about golf course Architecture, this one is the most useful. Thomas, Mackenzie and Hunter are all classics, but this one is updated to modern times and is a must read for anyone who thinks he or she loves the game of golf. <P>Also check out Tom's other book The Confidential Guide To Golf Courses.</span>

                    <span>I am a real estate developer. Two years ago, one of my project called for a championship 18-hole golf course. My financial partner is a die-hard golf lover who flies around the globe with his bag of clubs. To get a cram class in golf course architecture, I picked up Tom Doak's book in a local architectural bookstore. I admit I don't like to read thick books full of pictures and bullshits. Tom's book is concise and down to the points. The book price was great. I don't mind to pay a designer $500,000 to design a course, but I do care books are overpriced. Most of the readers are young people who have the right in the world to learn a new trade. Tom's book is enjoyable by everyone. To him I gave the credit that his course must also be enjoyable by everyone. To hire a good golf course designer is understandably costly and worth every cents of it. Although my partner's business was hindered by Asian financial crisis. We will still come back and do the project. You can bet your dollar on whom I will call first!</span>
