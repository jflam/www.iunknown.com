                <span id="Label1">Aimed at the experienced C/C++ developer, the new edition of Jeffrey Richter's <I>Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows</I> supplies expanded coverage of essential advanced Windows programming techniques and APIs. In addition, the book includes excellent material on Windows 2000 (including future 64-bit versions of the OS) and use of some C++ for sample code.<p> This book's strength has to be its coverage of essential under-the-hood operating system features, like processes and threads, synchronization objects and memory management techniques, plus the APIs used to work with them. In each section, the book zeros in on how Windows 2000 and Windows 98 manage these system objects. (Windows NT 4 isn't mentioned here, however.) Short, effective examples, several of which incorporate the author's reusable custom C++ classes, demonstrate each operating system feature in action. Several useful utilities highlight details of how Windows works, with programs that let you view threads, memory objects, and other kernel objects.<p> With its coverage of Unicode and 64-bit Windows 2000, this is a book that will take your codebase into the future. Besides describing important APIs, the book provides programming tricks and tips for many useful advanced coding tasks (such as local thread storage, sparsely mapped memory files, using DLLs, and Windows hooks.)<p> Clearly written and filled with technical details on Windows 2000, this book is a great resource for any C/C++ programmer who wants to know what is really going on inside the latest Microsoft OS. In all, this title will be an essential "upgrade" for any reader of an earlier edition and will no doubt deserve serious consideration from C/C++ programmers wanting to get the most out of their Windows code. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Windows 2000 and Windows 98 advanced system programming techniques; 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 2000; Windows error messages; Unicode strings; kernel objects and security; processes; jobs; managing threads; scheduling; priorities; thread synchronization with critical sections; events, mutexes, and custom C++ classes; fibers; Windows memory architecture; managing virtual memory; thread stacks; memory-mapped files; default and custom heaps; DLL basics; thread-local storage; DLL injection and API hooking; Windows structured exception handling (SEH) basics; C++ vs. Windows exceptions; exception handlers.</span>

                    <span>Obviously the author is a computer scientist who understands what engineers and programmers need to know. This is the internals document you won't find on MSDN. Definitely a MUST READ for anyone who is truly serious about designing systems or applications around ANY Microsoft Windows technology. My design is a CE appliance but this is still an essential read. No hype. No "around the edges" focus on technologies designed to hide implementation details. This book gets right to the heart of the kernal. The light bulbs have been going off since I picked it up. <p>Thank you Mr. Richter, and Microsoft should thank you. Were it not for this book I would have abandoned Microsoft for a much more expensive technology.</span>

                    <span>The title of this book suggested to me that it was the book I needed if I wanted to learn the Windows API.  Unfortunetly after struggling through it I've reallized it's targeted to an audience who already has knowledge of programming in the Windows API.  I think a better title would have been something like "Tips, techniques, and common shortfalls for the Microsoft Windows Application Programmer."  A waste of money on my part since I would need to buy his earlier book, and then by the time I would have mastered the basics that would allow me to move on to this book C# .NET will be wellestablished and although maybe not obsolete, the old Win API will not be needed.  So this one is going on my shelf and I doubt I will ever make much use of it.  The only reason I don't give it a lower rating is because it does have interesting notable information on Unicode even for me, and were I of the experienced, intended audience, then lots of the other contained information would be very interesting and beneficial from what I can tell.</span>

                    <span>When you want to know how windows works, there are 3 people (outside of Microsoft) to go to: Jeffery Richer, Matt Pietrek and John Robbins. This book deserves a spot on every serious developer's shelf. It covers a lot of under the hood topics that are difficult to find elsewhere.<p>Even though .NET is starting to gain ground, a lot of the low level details of the OS have not changed and a good knowlegde of win32 can never be a bad investment.</span>

                    <span>jeffrey richter is one of few masters who really understand windows programming! this book is absolutely a classic for advanced windows programmer. But it 's not suitable for beginner. I think one who wanna learn this book should a prerequisite background such as charles petzold's "programming windows".<br> The book tells many advanced skill which is must in windows programming. The best programmer should not only know how to write codes ,but know why he write these codes. It's possible only when he understand the mechanicsm of the system running.<br>jeffrey richter tells you all of the necessary background in the book. So don't hesitate, buy it!</span>

                    <span>Hi.<p>This is one of the most, if not the most, powerful Windows programming book I know for developing Windows program using C++. Jeffrey Richter does not bother with all the GUI tools. He shows the readers some of the key techniques Microsoft has done to Windows at the kernel and how Windows communicate at the kernel level via a messaging system. From multithreading and synchronization to multiple processes; from DLL and DLL hooking to file-mapping, Windows programmers learn Windows programming concepts and tools that will ultimately improve speed, efficiency, and stability in their Windows applications. <p>This is a *must have* book for C/C++ Windows programmers.<p>Kuphryn</span>
