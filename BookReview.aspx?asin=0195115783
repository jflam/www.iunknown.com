                <span id="Label1">During the 1952 World Series, a Yankee fan trying to watch the game in a Brooklyn bar was told, "Why don't you go back where you belong, Yankee lover?" "I got a right to cheer my team," the intruder responded, "this is a free country." "This ain't no free country, chum," countered the Dodger fan, "this is Brooklyn." Brooklynites loved their "Bums"--Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, and all the murderous parade of regulars who, after years of struggle, finally won the World Series in 1955. One could not live in Brooklyn and not catch its spirit of devotion to its baseball club.  <P>In Brooklyn's Dodgers, Carl E. Prince captures the intensity and depth of the team's relationship to the community and its people in the 1950s, showing how the team extended its influence well beyond the sports arena. He captures both the racial intensity surrounding Jackie Robinson's breaking the color line, and the controversy it generated on the team, in baseball, and the nation. He takes a hard look at the Dodger's ubiquitous presence in the life of Brooklyn, the team's closeness to the children, female fans, and Brooklyn's diverse ethnicity. Prince goes on to open the door to the male culture of Brooklyn's bars, the wonderful baseball played by thousands of Brooklyn's boys on the Parade Grounds, including many who made the leap to the Dodger's minor league farm system, as those who made the ultimate jump to the majors. And Prince doesn't ignore the underside of the Dodger experience: the paternity suits and "baseball Annies," the routine baseball-related 50's sexism, and the ethnic conflicts that went with the Brooklyn territory.  <P>In this superb volume, Carl E. Prince provides a stirring history of the depth and intensity of the relationship between Brooklyn and its Dodgers in the golden years after the Second World War.</span>

                    <span>This addition to the considerable literature about the Brooklyn Dodgers of 1947-1957 is by an academic historian who seeks to place the Dodgers within the broader social and political context of the era. The book captures the atmospherics of the time with a mostly credible and readable account of one of the great teams of all time.<BR>Academic history today means race, gender, class and some of that in this context seems a bit forced. There certainly is an important race story here in the person of Jackie Robinson. The author, consistent with the academic perspective, has difficulty coming to grips with both Robinson's and Dodger General Manager Branch Rickey's support of integration with their views on the Cold War. This reader did not find it unusual that people opposed to the Soviet Union would also support, and take considerable risks in supporting, integration in baseball. Much of the race angle in this volume is familiar territory. Some which is not familiar is questionable. The author brands a player of the era, later a prominent broadcaster, as a racist and does so on what appears to be very thin evidence - a not unusual on the field scrape with Robinson. Similarly forced, on the gender angle, is the characterization of the colorful Dodger fan Hilda Chester as a "single mother", even though her child was an adult. That women were vastly outnumbered by men watching baseball games in bars in the 1950s seems to have little to do with the Dodgers.<BR>The author's best point is his explanation of why the hatred of Walter O'Malley has lasted though successive generations, a phenomena not associated with other franchise moves. The Reason: the Dodger move did not just re-locate a baseball team, it destroyed a distinct culture, which is probably the best explanation.<BR>There are some factual errors in the book, one of them particularly surprising coming from an academic American historian. Perhaps the aversion to "right wing" politicians explains it. In 1952, Richard Nixon made a TV speech which came to be known as the "Checkers" speech - it saved his career in the face of charges of fiscal impropriety. Checkers was a dog given to Nixon's daughters as a gift. The author asserts that the dog was present on the TV set as Nixon gave the speech. That did not occur.<BR>The author also attempts to "deconstruct" the common wisdom about Dodger pitcher Billy Loes. Loes had the reputation as something of a flake, but the author asserts that he was a chess-playing intellect who knew exactly what he was doing. The account given here has Loes planning to make enough money in five years and then quit, having made his fortune and "that is exactly how long his career lasted". The deconstruction does not stand up. Loes' major league career lasted eleven years.<BR>For those who cannot get enough of Dodger literature, this short volume is worth reading if only to see how an academic would view the story. Those who want to read just one book on the subject should stick to Roger Kahn's classic The Boys of Summer or Peter Golenbock's Bums.</span>

                    <span>I probably should give this book one star because it goes against everything the Dodgers were about--The Dodgers signal triumph"sociologically" was that they showed that private places both exclusive and inclusive make for a healthy community. A healthy community is not driven by ism's or explicit ideology--rather it is driven by the triumphs and mistakes of ordinary men any women. Women "liberated" McSorley's bar.We are poorer for that Ebbets field provided a real chance for community conversation and for neighborhood stability--a chance that Robert Moses destroyed--that destruction produced a "culture" of which this author is a product.</span>
