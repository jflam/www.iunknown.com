                    <span>One thing I've consistently noted in reading reviews on Black Studies Books is that apparently white reviewers completely miss the point of these books, namely that American slavery is considered by most historians to be the most cruel and brutal ever and that Trans-Atlantic slavery, in general, is NOT the same thing as other forms of slavery---especially those in Africa before European nation contact.  Genovese does a lot of work in clearing up that misconception and misunderstanding. Specfically, he fixes the historical white wash that Stamp does in making the conditions of slavery more important than the existence of slavery.  Genovese is perhaps one of the ranking last words on slavery.  The book lends itself to an indept psychological examination of slavery which more accurately than Stamp's suggest that people do not always act in the better material interests even when they are aware of the consequences of their actions.  Genovese indicates there was a strong material motive for slavery---what else could justify the extreme expense of it.  But also, Genovese is one of the first scholars to begin to examine the consequences that whites suffered in dehumanizing themselves by dehumanizing others---a condition that exists today in the form of white supremacy.</span>

                    <span>Genovese's work, while extremely long and, I think pretentious at times in its tone, it is extemely well researched and is currently the last word on  slave culture and the interaction between master and slave on southern  plantations.<p> One of his most striking observations that I can still  rember reading even after five years is his concept of paternalism and how  masters and slaves viewed the concept differently.<p> Masters felt it was  their duty to take care of their "children" the slaves by  providing food and certain privilages, like whisky on Christmas and New  Years. In return, masters expected obedience, but even more crucually, love  in return. Slaves on the other hand saw those "privilages" as  rights and would act up if certain privilages were taken away. When  emancipation came, Genovese argues, that masters were really quite  emotionally hurt when their slaves decided to run away--the masters came to  see themselves as the only way that their "children" could  survive. The hurt was even more acute when the slaves joined up with the  union army to attack the very plantations and masters that took care of  them.  One can easily see how this feeling of ungratefulness could lead to  cruelty and violence in the south following the civil war. <p>When I was in  college a few years back, this book was seen by my professors as _the_  final word on the subject of 19th century slave culture</span>

                    <span>This was one of the most interesting books I have read in history (up  there with Darnton's The Great Cat Massacre). There is the tendency to view  blacks of slavery times as victims and victims only; this book conveys the  richness of the culture and more importantly their humanity; The chapters  on courtship rituals were extremely entertaining and fascinating. I haven't  read widely of the time period, but this ranks as the best of what I've  read so far.</span>

                    <span>"Roll, Jordan, Roll," by Eugene D. Genovese goes into great  detail on the subject. While Genovese is hardly an apologist for Southern  slaveholders, he fully documents their case, citing numerous sociologists  and historians who state that the physical living conditions of most slaves  exceeded that of the working poor of Europe (and in many cases America as  well). Virginia planters such as the people I descend from tended to treat  their slaves better than those on the frontier or people like the ancestors  of Edward Ball (Slaves in the Family), who owned enormous rice plantations.   Don't get the idea that anyone gets off easy. The hypocracy and cruelty of  the slaveholder class is documented in painful detail. The book is at times  overly academic, but Genovese quotes extensively from court decisions,  slaveholder correspondence and accounts by former slaves and those who  fought for their freedom. Whether your interest in the subject is academic  or personal, I doubt you will find a more thoroughly documented account of  America's most "peculiar" institution.</span>
