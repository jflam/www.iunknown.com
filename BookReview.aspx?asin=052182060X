                    <span>Andrew Appel's textbook (Modern Compiler implementation in Java) has been prescribed as a Course Textbook. Given a choice, I strongly recommend to take it from the library or any place where you can get it for free for one semester/quarter. This book is not worth the money and is an absolute waste. Not only does it not teach you anything about compilers, but if you already know something, then it serves to confuse you.
<br />
<br />The author has tried to explain things using an example and "steps" through the process of writing a compiler. So in that sense, if you are just looking to write a compiler and be done with it whether you understand it or not, then this book might be considered OK, though not good in any sense. 
<br />
<br />No theory about compilers is explained and the author seems to be talking to himself throughout the text.</span>

                    <span>I've read through several compiler texts over the past few months as I work away on a compilers project for school.  I would have to say that this text, the required textbook for my class, is not in the least bit useful.  Most of the material in the book is not covered in any real depth.  If you are looking for a useful book on compilers, I would recomend "Compilers" by Aho, Sethi and Ulman (the Dragon Book), or "Crafting a Compiler" by Fisher and LeBlanc.  Both books are much more thorough.  The Fisher's book is also quite easy to read and understand.  Appel's books only saving grace is the occasional modern view of things.</span>

                    <span>I love the chapter layout and the explanations of compiler concepts contained in this book. The language is a bit dry and somewhat mathematical at times. It may not be a perfect fit for every one. However, it was just what I needed to help me understand graph coloring and flow analysis. I like that he uses pseudo-code adaptable to many different languages in different places in the book. Originally, I bought this book strictly for its explanations of register allocation and liveness analysis. Those chapters were good, but flipping through, I can see that the remaining chapters may clear up other questions I may have as I become a more advanced compiler writer. <p>Overall, I am glad I bought this book. I own several rather academic books on compilers as well as some more practical books such as Writing Compilers and Interpreters by Ronald Mak and A Targetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation by Fraser/Hanson. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. Overall, I like this Appel book for its good examples of difficult to understand concepts.</span>

                    <span>This book does show you how a compiler is implemented, literally.  The author has a compiler already coded which he breaks down piece by piece and shows you how the pieces work.<p>Unfortunately, instead of only giving you what you need to know for a specific piece, alot of future material is added too soon because it's already in the code.  What would've been good is to trim out that stuff and give examples of code that wasn't part of the complete compiler but explained a specific point and only that point.  <p>Too much time is spent explaining pre-existing code that implements the modules in a ready-built compiler, and not enough time is spent describing what each module in a compiler is supposed to do and how you'd do it yourself or alternative ways of implementing functionality.<p>If only there was a compiler book that was halfway between this one and the Dragon book...</span>

                    <span>It's so sad that the rating of this book is this bad since I love this book so much. This book might have some weaknesses but I believe that this book is well worth getting. As far as I know, there're few compiler *textbooks*, other than this, that tells how to implement various modern PL concepts. As one guy said, the parsing algorithm stuffs are not any more an essential part of compiler course and modern compiler implementation should focus on how to implement modern programming concepts. After all, compiler is a *language* processor, *language* provides us *abtractions*, and we should focus mostly on how to implement those abstraction mechanisms in a compiler course, I believe. I agree that this book alone may not be sufficient for a complete introduction to the compiler writing (Dragon book and Muchnick's could be used together) but this book surely has its own benefits.<p>I think there's a subtle difference between the viewpoints of the PL guys and compiler guys. E.g. compiler guys might be interested in how to speep things up and PL guys might be interested in how to invent a new abstraction mechanism and implement it. I believe this is the best textbook, known to me, with the latter viewpoint. <p>Postscript to the guy who said Prof. Appel does not know OOP:<br>This book uses the Interpreter pattern where Interpreter pattern is just an oo-counterpart of the recursive data type definition in functional programming.</span>
