                <span id="Label1">Open source provides the competitive advantage in the Internet Age.  According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers  interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of  open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will  install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for  collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by  many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun  Microsystems to IBM to Intel.   <i>The Cathedral & the Bazaar</i> is a must for anyone who cares  about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the  information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and  lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied,  debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young,  "This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open  source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems,  and to the success of open source users and the companies that  supply them."   The interest in open source software development has grown  enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback  edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and  2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing  the benefits of open source software has been key to its  success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source  within companies, independent vendors will become the open source  story in 2001.</span>

<br />This books starts off with a very good history of the development of the Linux operating software.  This open source development process started the author thinking about the two software development methods, the Cathedral method, where a large corporate structure hires programmers to develop software, keeps the source code secret, and charges large amounts to recoup it costs, not from the original product development, but from the expected legacy problems, technical support, bug fixing, software updates, etc.  On the other hand the bazaar method, encourages open source software.  Open source software encourages a programmer or group within the hacker community to gain ascendancy, to possess and maintain and steer the software to keep it relevant.  The Author's point is that with most business models in the future the Cathedral method (read Microsoft) will not be able to compete with the Bazaar method (read Linux).  In the Cathedral method the programmers must be hired, the bazaar method the hackers are attracted to a problem, become more dedicated, revisions and bugs are handled at internet speed.  The author tells of many real-life business experiences companies have had adopting the open source method.  The middle of the book explains the hacker ethic and how the hacker community operates.   The reader learns the true meaning of "hacker" v.s. "cracker" and the true meaning of free software.  The author predicts that open source software will make deep in-roads into the Fortune-500 companies.  That their investments in hardware and records may be dependent on one software company's decision to continue supporting that software revision is the problem.  Open source software would provide a proliferation of hacker communities willing to constantly update older software.  The author appears to know his stuff and progressively throughout the book the author lets it leak out that he is one of the hacker community and is a player/spokesman in this software battle   I found this book a real eye-opener, can Microsoft's workforce  continue to support software like Windows 2000 with 60 million lines of code, as opposed to Linux taking advantage of a worldwide army of hackers reporting bugs, writing patches, and keeping hardware drivers updated.  Time will tell.
<br /> This book was enough to prompt this reader to obtain a copy of Linux just in case..

                    <span>Raymond does a very good job of explaining the pros of the open source model. His work is a little weak in explaining the other side. In the essay "The Magic Cauldron" He asks what are the payoffs ? He does only a moderate job of portraying the strengths of the closed source approach. 
<br />
<br />Having read "The hiistory of the Internet" several times I thought that the chapter "A breif History of Hackerdo" would be a yawn fest but it was very interesting. I would still disagree with many of the conclusions Raymond draws, especially about the economics and business case of open source but I found his analyisis of the motivations of hackers very interesting. In all I liked the work very much. 
<br />
<br />The work is very well written and well thought out. It gives the strengths of the open source approach very well. It also gives a lot of insights into "Hackerdom" and "Hackers"
<br />
<br />If you are interested in a book on Open SOurce This is a very good read. </span>

                    <span>Eric Scott Raymond is described as "An Accidental Revolutionary," as he took a leading role in analyzing and documenting the changes and growth of the Open Source (or "Free Software") movement that he, as a programmer, is part of. He's one of the "famous" people in hacker culture.
<br />
<br />This collection of essays by ESR gives the reader a glimpse into the world of Hackers (good programmers, not to be confused with people who break into computers, those are "crackers"). He goes into how and why it works, what the pros and cons of open source vs. closed source software is, and predicts where things will go in the future.
<br />
<br />Because this book is separated into individual essays that he has written, it's easy just to go through and read what you want. But to any person who is playing a part, or who wants to play a part in the hacker world, the whole thing is a must read. It gives you a lot to think about when it comes to the open source world, and builds up a great respect and understanding of the people pioneering it.</span>

                    <span>It's a very good book, it's a book that I'd recommend to all the (major) hackers that I know. I'm sure that this is quite obvious, in that this book is mainly good reading for hackers or hackers-to-be, but I would just like to restate that you would most benefit from this book if you also already have an open source project, or is thinking of open sourcing a project that you have running.</span>

                    <span>The Open Source movement had done for Computer Science what Creationism tried to to to the field of Biology.  A political mass movement that has turned many in the field against the computer industry.  For academics, this dogmatic illogical movement is nevertheless appealing, because it offers an opportunity to situate intellectuals and "hackers" into a false position of importance in the history and evolution of the computer industry.</span>
