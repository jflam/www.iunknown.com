                    <span>Wrox books are always a disappointment. This book does not include any decent example. On top of that does not include any source code. The author say's you can download the source from wrox website but its not there. Do not buy this book or any wrox book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great, easy-reading book for who wants to get the feets on network programming with .NET.<p>It covers the basic you have to know about networks and network protocols and then covers how to work with that on .NET.<p>The thing I like most on this book is that they loose almost no time with the common-places of distributed apps with .NET (the ones that every other book will cover, such as remoting and web services). The book covers really how to use TCP, UDP, and application level protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP and other.<p>Other aspect is that this book is really easy to follow and after you start you can't stop reading. I've received it on a friday night, so, I've consumed (devored) it on the weekend and I believe I would read it again...Great reading.</span>

                    <span>Not too many books attack the Network Programming side of what the .NET Framework can offer.  I believe that this is a great book for anyone wanting to delve into the realms of protocols and get down to the nitty gritty!!! -Cool Book-</span>

                    <span>What does C# , network programming, and .NET technology have in common? This book! It doesn't matter if you are new to network programming or a seasoned developer - this book will be valuable to any level of experience.The author leads the C# programmer through the basics of network programming and then builds upon advanced concepts utilizing .Net technology.  <p>Although the entire book does a great job explaining important concepts such as socket and Internet programming (excellent coverage relating to protocols), my favorite section deals with secure network communications using .NET technology. Here the authors provide much needed and valuable information such as encrypting network traffic, using certificates and SSL, and authenticating and authorizing users with Kerberos and NTLM.<p>If you are a C# programmer who wants to learn network programming using .NET technology, this is the book to get.</span>
