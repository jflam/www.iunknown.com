                    <span>Following the wait for this to come out as well as Rossi's landmark season, this DVD was a huge let down.  Barely any qualifying footage, no post-race interviews and some races seemed to be over almost as soon as they started.  Previous seasons were much better produced and I hope this is a temporary blip.....  </span>

                    <span>I was sorely disapointed in this video. The quality when compared to previous editions of the series is poor. One can tell that they rushed through the production and did not put the effort into this edition that have been in the past ones.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The image quality seems OK (2002 was the best), the commentary is very good (Toby Moody and Julian Ryder), but there's very little racing!!!
<br />
<br />In 2003, Rossi won his third championship on a Honda. At the end of the season, he announced a switch to Yamaha for 2004. Few were expecting him to win from the outset, and expectations for the first race were enormous ... and we get 4 minutes of race coverage! Not just for this race, but pretty much the rest of the season, we get less than 5 minutes per race.
<br />
<br />On the 2001 DVD, each race was given 8 or 9 or even 13 minutes. The trend has grown worse each year, and the 2004 review hit a real low. It's pathetic that the VHS tapes from the 1990s contain almost twice as much racing as the DVDs of the 2000s.
<br />
<br />MotoGP fans should boycott Duke until this craziness stops.</span>
