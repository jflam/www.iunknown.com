                    <span>What a waste of money.  Between choppy instructions and confusing examples, I think I know less about pivot tables than I did before.  Leave it to someone who works for Microsoft to botch up a book on pivot tables.  
<br />Save yourself the headache and do not buy this book.  You've been warned.

                    <span>I bought this book after first beginning to use pivot tables and appreciating how easily they could be used to create and populate tables to present descriptive statistics.   I had hoped that this book would show good examples of how to use pivot tables and further understand their features.   This book really added very little to the basic understanding that I developed by simply experimenting with Excel and the various commands associated with pivot tables.  It really has a low information-to-page ratio.   Two much better  resources on the topic are the website http://www.datapigtechnologies.com/ExcelMain.htm (really fine FREE online tutorials) or the book Excel Data Analysis: Your Visual Blueprint for Creating and Analyzing Data, Charts and PivotTables that provides quite a bit of information on pivot tables, along with a number of other topics in a much-better written book than this one.   </span>

                    <span>This book was disappointing.  The best part of the book is the section where he describes how to do tasks using the "old way" -- without Pivot tables -- that is not what I bought this book for!!  I agree with the other opinions that state that this book was rushed out in a hurry -- with poor quality.    One reason for this is that many of the examples require you to type in your own data instead of providing an example file in the files that you can download from the web site.  There are missing or mistaken instructions.  I was looking for a step by step example based approach and this book left me scratching my head in many cases.  They spent several pages describing the Pivot Table Wizard.  But this description is of little value if you don't tie it to an example or examples.  Examples are used  later, but as I mentioned before,  the examples were done in a hurried and sloppy manner.  How about testing the instructions in the book with real users next time!</span>

                    <span>It used to be when you see the imprint, APress, you expect a certain level of programming sophistication.  This book is just a "Pivot Tables for Dummies" book at twice the price.  Be warned you will get no code except in the last chapter. The rest of the book is pictures and a beginner's level tutorial on how to use Excel wizards.  This book is more suited for someone in the Marketing Department and should have been appropriately labeled as such. </span>

                    <span>Spreadsheets and SQL databases are represented as tables. That is, as rectangular grids of data. But in many ways, the common spreadsheet view is quite limited, though powerful within its context. Spreadsheet functions are often tied to specific cells as inputs. Then, interchanging two rows might cause the result to be different. A SQL view is more robust. Typically, you use data in a given column. The rows from which you take that data are selected based on criteria met by values in another column or columns. Hence, swapping 2 rows in a SQL table usually has no effect on an answer.
<br />
<br />In essence, this is what PivotTables offer. Cornell doesn't seem to describe it in such a fashion. He writes for a spreadsheet user who has no acquaintance with SQL. Certainly, this is a larger audience. But if you have a SQL background, then the idea behind PivotTables is easy to grasp. 
<br />
<br />Most of the book deals with the mechanics of how to use PivotTables. Necessary, but secondary, once you realise what's going on.</span>
