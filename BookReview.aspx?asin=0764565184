                    <span>This book is a great book for the amateur scientist or anyone who has an inquisitive nature. If you know someone who likes to take things apart to see how the "really" work or is forever asking "how" and "why" things work the way they do, this book is especially for that type of individual.<P>From airplanes and cell phones to viruses and other areas of interest, the book contains a wealth of informative facts and trivia. A terrific book for the money; it is quite in-depth but easy to read and understand.</span>

                    <span>Generally a really good book, although the transition from the website to book is not exactly the most smooth one. It feels like a lot of the good stuff is lost, and it doesn't really seem like the same quality as on the website. <P>There are 124+ topics ranging from airplanes to dieting. There is lots of information and little sidebars with all kinds of interesting facts. You'll learn everything from how nuclear power works to how turbochargers work and even learn how to decode all those zero's and ones in the Mice, bits, and Bytes section. You'll walk out knowing way more then when you walked in and when anyone says I wonder how this works, you'll come out looking like a genius.<P>But it also has a few minor problems. The writing can get a little confusing, and there aren't as many visual aids to help you understand (It might just be me, I'm a visual learner). The articles sometimes don't feel complete, you might reach the end and think "that's it!" Many times you find yourself returning to the website because you didn't understand the article. This might not be a bad thing after all because at most, you'll start learning all kinds of new stuff anyways.<P>Overall, it does have its problems, but it's good outweighs it's bad and is highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Overall this is a good book, filled with all kinds of interesting information. However, I felt that the level of editing polish was poor. Typos and illustration errors are frequent, and the writing style is uneven and awkward at times. It's also clear that the authors of each article did not read the other articles, because the same information is sometimes redundantly discussed in two or three separate articles. What's worst, though, is the number of outright factual errors: a proton does not have neutral charge, the abbreviation for microseconds is not ms, etc. My advice is to wait for the second edition, or buy one of the many similar books from other publishers instead.</span>

                    <span>Based on the amazing aggregate of information collected upon the famous web site HowStuffWorks.com, How Stuff Works is an exciting reference as suitable for curious adults as it is for inquiring children that explains, in practical terms that any lay reader can easily understand, the functional principle or mechanism behind a vast array of common inventions, tools, and ideas. The casual browser will learn a wealth of information from how four-stroke gasoline engines work to how file compression works, clearly illustrated with detailed diagrams and enhanced with sidebar commentary. The more serious reader will come away from How Stuff Works with a notably higher understanding and appreciation of the technological innovations so many others simply use and take for granted. How Stuff Works is superb for educational leisure reading, and is a highly recommended gift book for any friend or family member who is curious about what makes everything around them tick!</span>

For example they explain how mp3 file compression format works. I got the book as a christmas gift and find myself contantly going back to the book to find out how something works.</span>
