                    <span>If you're using the James Stewart Early Transcendentals textbook and you're COMPLETELY lost, you MAY find this CD ROM helpful. However, just about everyone else will find this product to be a complete waste of time and maybe even insulting. The description given (by Amazon) is so misleading that it's nearly dishonest. Do not waste your money on this; the Internet has plenty of free web sites where you'll find much better help at understanding calculus.<p>Only the most basic, introductory concepts are covered. As the textbook begins to probe a concept more deeply and the material becomes challenging, you'll find that there is no companion material on the CD ROM. <p>Where this becomes particularly insulting is in the way this remedial material is presented. It's literally childlike, on the level of a 10-year-old boy. These are actual descriptions from the box: "Basketball-playing robot and friendly Mars Rover take you through an explanation of derivatives-"; With the help of a colorful hot-air balloon, the greedy landlord..."; "A greedy boss and a skateboarding robot help you master the concept of area." Nothing like this appears in the product description on Amazon and nothing in the Stewart textbook leads you to believe you're purchasing a $... kid's cartoon. If you're taking college calculus you're way past this level of intellect and you don't deserve to be ripped off and insulted!<p>I challenge the publisher to refute my statements or at least use the above product descriptions, from the box, as the product description here on Amazon. Amazon, you're a good company and you shouldn't associate with this product.</span>

                    <span>I'm taking first year Calculus at a local University.  When i started I had no idea what was going on because i never took Calculus in highschool.  Our prof introduced us to JTC and i ended up getting an A in the course. Here's why: JTC is highly visual and interactive with a nice blend of 3D animation.  A variety of problems and solutions help you understad what you're doing, and more importantly what it's used for.  Put it together and you get a deeper understanding of the subject. This is a first addition so there are a few bugs that still need to be worked out.  But no major one's that I've found. Overall, this is an excellent peice of software and i highly recommend it to anyone taking or teaching Calculus.</span>
