                <span id="Label1">Boat noodling. Boat lovers suffer universally from this benign affliction. In its mildest form, boat noodling is nothing more than wondering why that sloop in the next slip is faster than yours. In a more significant manifestation it could mean serious daydreaming--drifting off for extended periods, sketching design ideas on the back of an envelope. Chances are, if you've picked up this book just to see what's in it, you're beyond help. <p>Naval architect Dave Gerr offers the perfect antidote, a browser's reference to understanding how boats tick: all you've ever wanted to know about boats--power and sail, racer and cruiser; dinghy and motoryacht. <p>In the clear, friendly, nontechnical style that has made his column for <i>Offshore</i> magazine so enduring and popular, Gerr explains everything from how thick a hull should be to why one sailboat tips less than another, from choosing an engine to designing a rig for your trawler yacht, from building a dinghy to simple rules of thumb for dozens of design quandaries. <p>Gerr writes for the boat noodler in all of us--those seriously interested in learning and dreaming about all types of watercraft. There is no better way to become a better sailor, equipped to handle any contingency. And there's no better place to start than right here. </span>

                    <span>Subtitled Insights and Esoterica for the Nautically Obsessed, this book is a direct hit on its intended audience. Read it once through quickly, then enjoy it over and over again like a favorite song, and you will learn an amazing amount about every sort of boat an individual is likely to own or dream about. Gerr covers design and construction, sails and motors, and boats from homemade paddleboat to liveaboard oceangoing cruiser either motor and/or sail, and everything in between. He covers more about boats than you could imagine he would, and writes wonderfully.<BR> It is difficult to say in a few words how useful, or how enjoyable, this book is. I love it.</span>

                    <span>Love the book. It is full of "Rules of Thumb" that can save tons of time when trying to design a boat or solve a problem. The techniques shown are great for practical application. The author has an uncanny ability to teach complex subjects in a down to earth easy to understand manner. Highly recommended for boatman, yacht designers, marine engineers and naval architects.</span>

                    <span>While not as technical (unfortunately) as the author's The Elements of Boat Strength it does contain a wealth of information for the curious. The book is a collection of magazine articles but Mr. Gerr must have done a lot of editing-they flow together nicely. Quite readable.</span>

                    <span>This is a book filled with detailed information about boats and boat design. What is covered is well explained; however, the overall approach is scattered. The initinal chapters just seem to wander about from one boat design story to another, and then the author even diverts to "mystery" story telling in the style of Mike Hammer. The author uses a lot of math, but it is not presented in a high flown manner which is often done by those who are good at math. The math explanations are not only straight forward, but they are always set up in a way that applies the math to the real world of boats and boat design. The math helps the reader see why certain boats behave in certain ways.<P>Overall this book will enhance the knowledge of anyone who owns a boat but does not have a degree in boat design. Very useful.</span>

                    <span>This is a great introduction for people interested in boat design. The chapters are essays covering different subjects. From propeller size to composite exotic materials for boat construction. One thing I like with this book is that Dave Gerr doesn't skip the details, like a lot of other introduction books. He gives the numbers for calculating boat speed, hull thickness etc. The only thing I find to critisize is that the book lacks some explaining pictures. Sure, there are plenty, but I need more to understand some of the stuff.</span>
