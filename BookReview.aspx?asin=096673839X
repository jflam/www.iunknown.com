                    <span>This book is almost too good to share. If you're a business owner, you won't want to talk about it at those Chamber of Commerce meetings - or anywhere else your competitors are hanging out! <P>I write local advertising copy everyday, and what Michael Corbett provides as answers in "33 Ruthless Rules...", are the questions every media sales representative should be asking potential clients. In turn, if local business managers put these 33 Rules into practice, they'll know what what want, when they want it, and how to get it from their local advertising plan. In less than 200 easy-to-read pages, you'll discover all you need to gain and strengthen your grip on any local market.<P>This book should be required reading for Marketing Students, Media Sales Reps, and definitely for local business owners and managers.</span>

                    <span>I've been successful in several small businesses, and this guy is right on the money. I've learned the hard way (wasting money, trying to do my own thing) and I've learned the easy way (books, seminars, studying "doers"). Let me tell you--this book could possibly save you YEARS of time. The author clearly knows what he is talking about, and I can confirm this from my own experience. You will NOT be disappointed reading and applying the advice given in this book. I've bought so many useless "theory" books over the years, it's nice to run across something that has some excellent, solid advice in it. Get this one, apply what you learn, and watch your business take off.</span>

                    <span>As an advertising sales manager, I reccomend this book to fellow sales managers as the new bible for walking in the shoes of retail. As a business person, you would be crazy not to take the teachings of this book to heart. Remember the definition of "crazy" is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. It all makes perfect sense. This should be required reading for all student of marketing.</span>

                    <span>If you had to choose only one book on advertising, take it from me, this one is it.<P>I think this book should be on the shelf and in the hands of every business owner who uses local media. There isn't anything close to this information from anything I've read. It's more than common sense, it's crucial sense. <P>If you pair this with the copy ideas of Roy Williams (The Wizard of Ads) you'll have the most important references available today for advertisers. Not since "Positioning" has there been a more powerful look at how to make advertising work; what to do, what to avoid doing. <P>I have made many mistakes common to most advertisers and I now understand why Michael Corbett says over 90% of local advertisers are not happy with their results. If I only had this information 20 years ago I'd have saved myself countless wasted dollars. If you have anything to do with advertising, selling it, buying it, teaching it, and you don't have this book....you have an impotent advertising arsenal.</span>
