                <span id="Label1">This is the essential new field guide to the birds of Chile. Representing a great diversity of habitats, from the Andes in the north down to the tundra and sub-Antarctic rainforest of Tierra del Fuego in the far south, Chile is the breeding ground or temporary abode of 473 known species including 9 found nowhere else in the world. <i>Birds of Chile</i> covers them all, embracing not only the mainland but points offshore such as Easter Island as well as the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, plus the Falklands and South Georgia. In addition to being a friendly and fruitful birding destination in its own right, Chile is the starting point for many Antarctic cruises.<p>Succinct, identification-focused text and distribution maps share a page opposite each of the 97 color plates to allow quick and easy reference. Between the boldfaced English name and the scientific name comes the Spanish name as used in Chile; this is important, for birders will find their quest far more enjoyable and effectual if they can explain to Chileans exactly what they are looking at, think they are looking at, or hope to be looking at.<p>Since Chile's list of resident species is yet far from conclusive, vagrants and rarities are also included. Indeed, some birds once thought to be accidentals in Chile have since proved to be regulars, including the Westland Petrel, Least Sandpiper, Cliff Swallow, and Golden-billed Saltator. Compact, comprehensive, and easy to use, Birds of Chile is the essential field guide to the birds of this spectacular and tourist-friendly country.<UL><br>* The essential new field guide to the birds of Chile<br>* 97 color plates with succinct text and maps on facing pages for quick reference and easy identification<br>* All 473 known species breeding in or visiting Chile, from the Andes in the north down to the tundra and sub-Antarctic rainforest of Tierra del Fuego in the south<br>* Also covers points offshore such as Easter Island as well as the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, plus the Falklands and South Georgia<p>Compact, portable, and user-friendly</UL></span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic field guide. The plates are excellent and the descriptions detailed. I'm no expert birder, but with this guide I've been able to clearly ID far more birds than what was possible using Sharon Chester's guide (which is a great quick-start for spotting, but otherwise not detailed enough), or the Collins book "Birds of Southern South America" (which is good, but too expansive for focus solely on Chile). It is obvious that a lot of work has gone into "Birds of Chile", yet it is an infinitely user-friendly guide. Thanks to this book, I find I try to get out more to see what's around.<P>My only gripe with the book concerns its durability under wet conditions. Chile is a rainy country, and my copy suffered on a typical hike in the rain. That's a minor gripe, however, and I probably could have taken extra measures to protect it.<P>One side note: If you are planning a birding trip in Chile, it would be nice to bring an extra copy to leave behind for someone you meet here. Field guides are usually imported, very expensive, and hard to find. I haven't seen this one in the stores here yet, and I'm sure that many folks would be glad to receive a copy.</span>

                    <span>Backcover statement for Jaramillo's "Birds of Chile" as the first bird fieldguide for the country is false: back to 1986 Araya and colleagues published "GuÃ­a de Campo de las Aves de Chile". But it was a quite simple work, all black & white drawings, succint descriptions, and almost nil encroachment with ID problems. So for practical purposes Jaramillo's guide is really the first reliable one for Chilean birders... and visiting foreigners as well.<BR>Introductory chapters are excellent. Plate-facing descriptions are very good and don't fear tackle with the toughest ID puzzles. Distributional maps are the first critical for a lot of species (Thinocoridae, Oreopholus, Chilia, Phleocryopes,etc.). Plates include some masterpieces, e.g. Sheldgeese (plate #24), Treerunner (68), Hummingbirds II (62). A few (#11,#54) rank below average, and would deserve reassesment. Also some inevitable mishaps affect the book: the missing initial text for Juan FernÃ¡ndez Firecrown (page 150), wrong-written words ("AzÃºl", p.152) .... minor defects easy to amend in future editions.<BR>No doubt Jaramillo's book inaugurates a new era in Chilean ornithology. That's why I give it five stars level.</span>

                    <span>I bought, shared and very actively used the Jaramillo field guide in Chile during December 2003. I birded the Santiago region, Chiloe and Patagonia. Chilean guides accompanied me on all occasions and all wanted to purchase the book. There has never been anything better for Chile, and that probably applies to Antarctica too.<P>I did not give the book a five because I did not think the paintings are arranged in a way that clearly separates similar species. Nonetheless, the book is a four plus and I recommend it strongly to anyone birding Chile.</span>
