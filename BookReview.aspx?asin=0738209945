                <span id="Label1">Parents who are fed up with the pressure to turn their children into star athletes, concert violinists, and merit scholars-all at once!-finally have an alternative: the world of Slacker Moms, where kids learn to do things for themselves and parents can cut themselves some slack; where it's perfectly all right to do less, have less, and spend less.<P> Slacker moms say "No" to parenting philosophies that undermine parents'-and children's-ability to think for themselves. They say "Yes" to saving their money and time by opting out of the parenting competition. And they say "Hell, Yes!" to having a life of their own, knowing it makes them better parents.<P> In this witty and insightful book, author Muffy Mead-Ferro reflects on her experience of growing up on a ranch in Wyoming, where parenting-by necessity-was more hands-off, people "made do" with what they had, and common sense and generational wisdom prevailed. We should all take her sane lead!</span>

                    <span>Muffy Mead-Ferro has written a funny, humane and topical book for motherhood today. She's done far more than just share funny slacker moments so moms will feel less guilty, she's given us her perspective, drawn on her childhood on a cattle ranch in Wyoming, on how to raise self-reliant and confident children. She reminds us, in touching and funny ways, that character is not built with educational toys and toddler-gyms. Although my youngest is 14, this book has changed the way I handle his homework, messy room and video games. Parents everywhere need to read this book.</span>

                    <span>I read the book and I've read the other reviews and frankly, the negative reviews are so totally off base that it's unbelievable. The book is about not taking things so seriously as a parent, not ignoring your children! Have fun with them and don't give them the mistaken impression that they are the center of the universe - the world just doesn't work like that! I have to admit - I am a soccer mom - but for slacker reasons. I get to spend time with my kids in the car, time in which there are no other distractions than a good laugh with my kids. I don't have to clean my house or cook dinner on soccer trips. When waiting for my kids to be done with practice, I get to read and do other things that I enjoy.<BR>Don't take this book too seriously or too literally. Have fun with it and apply as needed. <BR>I intend to give this book as a shower present for every new mom I know. It's not about how to parent, it's about how to do it with a good attitude that kids and parents can live with!</span>

                    <span>Finally!!! I am given written permission to let my kids be kids and me be an imperfect Mom and human being. I am the mother of two boys, three and six, and frankly watching them make their own mistakes, and letting them see me make mine, is what I think makes our family special. I live in a place where kids have day planners and birthday parties are budget breakers. <BR>Confessions of a Slacker Mom is not the typical parenting book. It is a refreshing insight into the thoughts and concerns of a mom just like me, who realizes money and "stuff" can't fix every problem or guarantee your success as a parent. <BR>My favorite memory of the book is "if your kid doesn't have stitches by the age of seven, you are over protective". <BR>If you think you can bail your kids out of every problem and prevent every scratch and scrape (why would you want to?) then this book is not for you.</span>

                    <span>It's an easy, quick read, although we advertising writer types always did have a knack for concise thoughts (i.e., "where's the beef?") Personally, I'm a stay at home mom, and my worst day home with my son is better than any day back at the office working for somebody else. So yeah, I was a little disappointed with Chapter 8 and the whole justification for letting strangers raise my kid. (Sorry, they can go to preschool when they're three, that's not so long to be out of the rat race.) But her observations are funny and it's true that our society does overindulge, advertisers are a parent's worst enemy and the experts don't have all the answers. And some mommies do get a little Stepford-ish...oh admit it, you do. (I've never scrapbooked either, I thought it was a noun.) The book made me realize how uptight I am so much of the time, so I might loosen up just a touch... except during PMS, then all bets are off!</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I found her annecdotes thorougly entertaining, and often laughed out loud. <BR>It should be clearly understood that this is not a "how to" parenting book, and should never be mistaken for one. Instead, it is one woman's account of trying to navigate through the incredibly tricky maze of parenting. Fortunately for us, she she presents her take on the whole thing through a wonderful sense of humor. If you can't laugh at yourself as a parent, perhaps this isn't a book for you.<BR>I congratulate Muffy Mead-Ferro's courage to question some of today's "modern wisdom" about raising children and instead, listen to her gut about what's right for her children. And I commend her ability to "confess" about it!<BR>I agreed with her about some things in the book and disagreed about others, but that's what makes this book so fun to read. We all have our own styles of parenting and should trust our instincts enough to follow them. Although I consider myself a slightly more experienced mother (I have kids ranging in age from 15 to 4), I gleaned some wonderful nuggets of wisdom from her childhood days on a Wyoming Ranch. These were some of my favorite parts.<BR>I have recommended this book to many friends, and have purchased it for several gifts. It's a great read for parents of all ages.</span>
