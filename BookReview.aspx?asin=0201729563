                    <span>I agree with the reviewer before me that this book is clear and pragmatic. Where the more traditional methods for scalability and performance are more scientific and will give more confidence in the end results they are usually cast aside because developers do not understand them. With this book they have no excuse. The methods given are easy enough to be understood by code jockeys, and effective enough to be used by software engineers working with tight deadlines.<P>This book is valuable for other reasons too. The author obviously understands the Java development environment and its pros and cons, and also knows databases. Any developer who reads this book will come away with a better understanding of web application design and development, and will also understand the backend systems, such as relational databases, XML and web services.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>While this book uses J2EE as the basis for scalability and performance strategies in web application development, it is also useful regardless of the development and technical environment.<P>The author begins this book with the clearest and easiest-to-follow descriptions of performance and scalability and how to measure them that I've ever read. The same treatment was given to web applications architecture, which is the second topic in sequence. I like Mr. Barish's straightforward, conversational writing style and use of simple (but effective) illustrations, graphs and examples that make complex concepts easy-to-grasp.<P>I stated above that this book can be used outside of the J2EE environment, and here are the chapters that are generic enough to accomplish this: 1 (Scalable and High Performance Web Applications), 2 (Web Application Architecture), 4 (Scalability and Performance Techniques), 5 (HTTP Client/Server Communication), 10 (Effective Database Design) and 12 (The Future of Web Applications). While each of these chapters are well written and go into sufficient detail for developers and architects I particularly liked chapter 10 because he explained relational database fundamentals and SQL programming with such clarity that I got more from the 42 pages that comprise this chapter than I did from a 300+ page book on the topic. The follow-on chapter on JDBC and SQL is as well written. Another reason why I liked chapter 10 is many developers understand how to develop servlets and components, but do not have sufficient understanding of relational databases. This book rectifies that, which is particularly important since most real world applications are data intensive and need to connect to databases.<P>Additional strong points about this book include: code examples are only given to reinforce a concept or show an example. Don't expect to find a recipe book based on code - this book is about making it scalable and giving it performance characteristics. The J2EE-specific parts of the book use realistic examples and propose real world approaches. However, the strongest aspect of this book is the author stays focused on scalability and performance throughout the book, always ending each chapter with scalability and performance hints that are related to the chapter's topic.<P>This book is for architects and software engineers who are building applications that support business-critical needs. It's clear, concise and exceptionally well written.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book although repeats a lot of basic information like the internet is mostly comprised of TCP/IP, and then there is UDP over IP. The most shocking thing was to see the Author refer to UDP as Unreliable Datagram Protocol, where as that is the most common pun made of UDP, but it really stands for User Datagram Protocol. <BR>If one is willing to ignore such basic errors and continue on still trusting the author, they would find some useful concepts. This book hence can be used as a concept Dictionary, where one could pick the book go to the index, and look up the concept like web caching, connection mgmt etc, and read about it, along with performance and scalability implications. <BR>If you keep your expectations low, then its a good book. But well at $45 retail price, how many people would keep their expectations low ?</span>

                    <span>You can think of buying this book if ( and only if ) you haven't even heard about SQL, relational DBs, HTTP and server side java. If you have even a beginner level knowledge of any topic above you won't find any new info in this book: it's extremely shallow. One of the worst technical books I've ever seen ( there was nothing to read ).</span>

                    <span>I found the book to be extremely readable, informative, and well-presented. It's a nice introduction for people who are new to web server applications programming and performance/scalability issues in distributed systems, and it's a nicely written and well-organized refresher/reference for people who already are somewhat familiar with those topics.</span>
