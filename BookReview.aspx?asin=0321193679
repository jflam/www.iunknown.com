                    <span>This is a book written for the software engineer/developer/programmer/analyst (collectively called "developers" in my review). The book basically acts as a roadmap for improving yourself as a developer, making yourself more valuable to your current and future employers (whether they realize it or not).<P>This book introduced me to Steve McConnell's Professional Development Ladder, a way of evaluating your current level of professionalism and learning what areas of knowledge you need in order to progress. It also talks about software engineer licensing (Texas does it), the newly accredited Software Engineering degree program (this replaces Computer Science in many respects), and the Software Engineering Institute's Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.<P>Many of these resources can be found around the Net, but this book neatly consolidates a lot of information. It also includes a lot of information (mainly statistics) I would not have found elsewhere, such as ROI's for specific software engineering practices (simply measuring productivity can return 150% in 12 months or 600% over 36 months, page 116), the exact makeup of the huge productivity gap between different developers (communication factors alone account for a 53% productivity difference, page 137), and an interesting and realistic diagram showing how professional licensing affects the pool of good and bad developers.<P>The roadmap extends all the way from the entry-level developer or new high-school graduate all the way up to industry leadership.<P>I give this book 5 stars not for the book alone but for it combined with the resources at McConnell's web site. If you want to excel in your field as a developer, these two taken together give a lot of great advice.</span>

                    <span>Steve McConnell became my personal guru after Rapid Development, That book opened my eyes to best software practices. Code Complete is required reading. His new book Professional Software Development is more philosophical. He describes how to be a true professional. Also what companies need to do to become more professional, and what the whole software industry needs to do. Steve is my guru because he says that people and process BOTH matter. Good people using good processes are better than good people using bad processes. Bad people are bad no matter what processes they use. Steve's writing is wonderful and easy to read. My manager must read this book! Thanks Steve!</span>

                    <span>As the author of the software's industry's classic tomes, "Code Complete" and "Rapid Development", anything by Steve McConnell is required reading. However, I believe that "Professional Software Development" along with its parent text, "After The Goldrush" is highly unlikely to have the impact of his earlier work.<P>McConnell remains at his best when detailing the problems of the industry and few will argue with his call for the adoption of established best practices and the creation of a better-qualified, structured and more accountable profession. The contentious area is his attempt to base this profession on engineering; a discipline that many feel is not an appropriate metaphor for the distinct and unique task of producing software. <P>Other industry authorities, in particular, Alan Cooper, have eloquently and convincingly denounced this view of software design and construction as engineering, and it seems to lead the author into some increasingly strange territory, for example his bizarre proposal that prospective software practitioners should study traditional engineering topics!<P>In swimming against the tide of movements such as Cooper's Interaction Design, Fowler's Agile Development and Beck's Extreme Programming, I would suggest that McConnell's ideas on creating an engineering-based Profession, are unlikely to see widspread adoption outside of the large-scale developers of in-house, scientific applications. <P>For all this, the book is still an interesting and stimulating read, but I suspect that many are still hoping that McConnell will return to his area of true expertise - the software construction process - and revise Code Complete to incorporate the latest methodologies and environments.</span>

                    <span>In this single book, Mr. McConnell has managed to summarize all of the arguments for 'building software the right way'. It is non-intuitive to individuals who have little or no training in software engineering, including programmers. When I used to interview VB programmers my first question was always 'Describe the Implements keyword'.<P>For many business people they feel that if you are not coding then you are not making progress, which is just plain wrong if you are in the early stages of a project. This often puts us (as project leaders) in the position of educating the client. This book is incredibly helpful for just such an endeavor. There are so many great points that I have used in helping me overcome the non-intuitive parts of development.<P>The statistics for our industry are abysmal (in terms of budgets over-runs, cancelled projects, etc.). If everyone read this book, and stopped coding for a few hours and actually THOUGHT more about the problem (especially for OO development - doing UML, CRC Cards or SOMETHING) in my opinion (after coding for 20 years - 13 of them professionally) our industry would be in much better shape. Even better would be if you can get your team using design patterns, pair programming (in many cases this is a good idea but not in all), agile development techniques, and other general 'best practices'. <P>I am constantly under pressure to code before it is appropriate to do so. It is hard to explain to a CEO that you need time to do what they believe is 'drawing pretty pictures'. However, reducing dependencies (and when you have them, making them dependent on abstract classes and/or interfaces NOT concrete implementation), not to mention model/view/controller type patterns are the difference between turning on a dime (say adding a web services API in a few weeks) or spending 6 months on a rewrite.<P>I cannot say enough good things about this book.<P>Kind Regards,<BR>Damon Carr, CTO<BR>Monetaire<BR>www.monetaire.com</span>

                    <span>This book is a brilliant, enjoyable explanation of the steps we can take to make our projects and software organisations run better. <P>To realize the benefit of this book, you must actually Read The Book, which some of the other amazon reviewers have apparently not yet been able to fit into their busy schedules. The reviewer of 'examples of bad management' never read past the first section, which is called 'The Software Tarpit.' It is indeed about why projects are poorly managed, but it is only 55 pages out of 225. Sections 2, 3 & 4 contain abundant specific suggestions about how to meet schedules, budgets, and other project goals. <P>The reviewer of 'heavy on opinion, light on content' says he reads 5 books a day. The book has numerous notes at the end of each chapter, and is impressively well researched. I surmise this reviewer missed the 'content' during his speed reading. <P>The reading-impaired agile revolutionaries criticise the book for not discussing agile. This book also does not discuss object-oriented design, the Rational Unified Process, East Indonesian basket weaving, or the tooth fairie because those are different topics. Apparently some people think that every book should discuss agile, regardless of the book's topic. <P>This book is short, sweet, and to the point. It does not tell you how to debug your current project (see the author's Code Complete for that), but it will tell you how you and your organisation can improve in the long run. My company has already realised benefits from adopting the ideas in this book, and it is mandatory reading for programmers and managers.</span>
