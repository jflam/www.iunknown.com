                    <span>I have just finished watching this video, and I feel that I have not wasted my time. This film is based on the true story of George Adamson. Adamson became famous as the man who set the lioness Elsa free in a film called 'Born Free'.<P>In 'To Walk with Lions' Adamson has become an old and eccentric man who lives to free lions from zoos and circuses. He takes in an English milkman, Tony Fitzroy, who needs a job. When the new aide realizes that he is going to replace a workman who was killed by a lion the week before, he wants to leave straight away: He thinks that Adamson is crazy, but after some time Tony decides to stay after all.<P>This is a beatiful film: The landscape is fantastic and the script is filled with good comments, laughter and exitement. After a short while you start to like George and Tony, even though neither of them can be called 'average guys'. This is a film that I want to recommend. It is great for animal lovers and everybody else who likes to enjoy a good story.</span>

                    <span>This movie was true and very entertaining, with romance, action, heart and soul. It had a message for everyone, no matter what country you live in. We found hope from the things they are doing today in Tanzania... No movie has touched my husband and I as much as this one. If you can only see one movie this year, make it To Walk with Lions.</span>

                    <span>This movie was full of inaccuracies. Tony Fitzjohn did not take the lion cubs and raise them. This kind deed was done by Gareth Patterson who truly respected George Adamson. Gareth Patterson wrote about this in his books titled The Lions Legacy and Last of the Free. This movie should have focused on George Adamson and it should have been more accurate and realistic. <P>If you want to see a movie with the real George Adamson, as himself, then make sure to view the entertaining and touching movie titled Christian the Lion! He is also featured in the movie titled An Elephant Called Slowly. Both of these movies are available on video. Why watch a fake when you can watch the real thing!</span>

                    <span>This movie suffers from what so many biopics do: it's a series of incidents and not really a story with a well-structured plot. And it should have focussed more on George Adamson. But the acting is good and the animal shots great. Some of the dialogue is great. I know Tony Fitzjohn, and the actor who played him was well cast and looks and sounds a lot like him. And the Fitzjohn character is true to what Tony Fitzjohn is like...and I mean that in EVERY SENSE of what his actions are in this movie (I'm trying to be polite!). But the story was so much about Fitzjohn--he even narrates it--and Fitzjohn is really such a minor character among conservationists in Kenya, I don't know why they zeroed in on him. The movie was a flop, so it obviously wasn't a wise choice. I mean, why not a film on Richard Leakey, just to mention one name? Or one that focused more on George Adamson and less on Fitzjohn? Well, Tony, you didn't become a household name with this film, as I'm sure you were expecting and hoping. But good luck with Mkomazi.</span>

                    <span>I have always been a huge fan of the Adamsons and followed their lives in great detail. I always wished I could have met George Adamson before his death and I remember the shock I felt when I learned how he died. Richard Harris does a spectacular job portraying Mr. Adamson. He's got the charactor down pat. I also enjoyed the very brief appearance of the woman who played Joy Adamson. I wish they had more of her in this movie. I thought, however, that the storyline needed a lot of work. I wasn't impressed with how the Tony Fitzjohn charactor was portrayed. I appreciated that it was written from a point of view of a person who was not obsessed with the Adamsons like I was, but making Fitzjohn the focal point of the movie drew away from the real story. I also thought parts of the ending, which were based on true life, but changed to make more dramatic, was a little over dramatized. But, overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone, Adamson fan or not.</span>
