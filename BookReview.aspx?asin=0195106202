                <span id="Label1">In 1997 the American people will celebrate with great fanfare and publicity the fiftieth anniversary of Jackie Robinson's explosive entrance into major league baseball. Robinson has become a national icon, his name a virtual synonym for pathbreaker. Indeed, much has transpired between this young African-American's first bold strides around the baseball diamonds of a segregated America and General Manager Bob Watson's pride in assembling 1996 World Champion New York Yankees. Recognizing this monumental event in America's continuing struggle for integration, Jules Tygiel has expanded his highly acclaimed Baseball's Great Experiment. In a new afterword, he addresses the mythology surrounding Robinson's achievements, his overall effect on baseball and other sports, and the enduring legacy Robinson has left for African Americans and American society.  <P>In this gripping account of one of the most important steps in the history of American desegregation, Tygiel tells the story of Jackie Robinson's crossing of baseball's color line. Examining the social and historical context of Robinson's introduction into white organized baseball, both on and off the field, Tygiel also tells the often neglected stories of other African-American players--such as Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella, Willie Mays, and Hank Aaron--who helped transform our national pastime into an integrated game. Drawing on dozens of interviews with players and front office executives, contemporary newspaper accounts, and personal papers, Tygiel provides the most telling and insightful account of Jackie Robinson's influence on American baseball and society.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book to learn more about Jackie Robinson and his relationship with Branch Rickey. Jules Tygiel gave me that (in an unbiased, thorough manner with great historical perspective) and then some! I gained an increased appreciation for the role of the Negro Leagues in the development of Major League baseball. I gained insight into the changing perceptions of baseball management, players and fans toward African-Americans and their contributions to the game. I was momentarily transported to that time, not as long ago as I would have thought, where non-white players were treated as second-class citizens. It was really an eye-opener. In addition, Mr. Tygiel's style was so honest and even-handed that I can't wait to read his book, "Past Time: Baseball As History," which I ordered today!</span>

                    <span>This scholarly yet readable look at baseball integration from 1947-1959 goes well beyond the inspiring story of Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey. Author Jules Tygiel also informs about such secondary figures as Larry Doby, Bill Veeck, Hank Aaron, Pumpsie Green, etc. Tygiel shows that integration proceeded slowly and in the face of strong resistance - the Boston Red Sox didn't add a black player until 1959, three years after Jackie Robinson retired. We also see how baseball integration spurred civil rights, while hastening the end of the Negro Leagues. I'd have liked more coverage of baseball's declining attendance after 1949 (probably caused by television), and the suspected correlation between athletic dominance and underclass poverty. Still, BASEBALL'S GREAT EXPERIMENT is a well-researched look at an interesting period in sports history.</span>

                    <span>I have a better understanding of integregation and how it affected every American no matter what his race or beliefs.  Baseball was a pioneering vechicle for social questioning and challenged many men other than Branch  Rickey and Jackie Robinson into greatness.  They were courageous men who  had to fight convention and who lead other Americans to follow their  example.  I realize the impact integration had on everyone involved Black  or White: the team owners, the players, broadcasters, vendors, and  families.  Many individuals sacrificed to improve their freedom and the  freedom given to other humans.  Mr. Rickey and Mr. Robinson are not  portrayed as mythological figures but rather as real men I can respect more  because they are like all of us.  I am convinced that Mr. Robinson endured  because he had strong character and determination and he believed in  "the experiment."  I feel I know him better now that I know more  about his struggles and triumphs.  I kept reading because everything was  explained simply and with logic and with an absence of bias.</span>

                    <span>Professor Tygiel's book is the definitive work on the importance of Jackie Robinson to American history.  Tygiel writes a well-researched, dynamic narrative that illustrates Robinson's incredible achievements and strength  of character.  This book, unlike others on Robinson, focuses on the years  before and after 1947 as well.  By doing this, Tygiel reveals the impact of  Robinson's achievement in the context of the emerging civil rights  movement. Jackie Robinson's story was not his alone- it was the story of  the ballplayers who came after him. The book also shows how Robinson's  courageous seasons personified the changing American conscience  regarding  race in the post-war era.</span>

                    <span>The early twentieth century saw baseball achieve almost mythical proportions in popularity.  In 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and became a myth himself.  He forever changed the way the game was played and helped the cause of civil rights everywhere.  Tygeil writes passionately about Robinson's character and achievements and puts them in perspective with the time he lived.  After reading this book, you will never look at baseball or civil rights the same.  This is not just another book on baseball.  This book shows how baseball changed humanity.</span>
