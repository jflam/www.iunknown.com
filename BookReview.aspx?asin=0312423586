                    </div>
                    <span>This is the kind of book in which people who have just met each other speak sentences to each other like, "This difficulty of being." Other reviewers have commented that the dialogue is implausible. This is true, but I don't mind that so much as the fact as all of the 'good' characters speak in exactly the same implausible way, and they all sound exactly like the prose of the book itself. It is relatively easy to spot the bad characters, because they, the philistines, speak in plain literal sentences, and we are supposed to hate them immediately upon meeting them. 
<br />
<br />Much of the novel concerns itself with the best friend, Peter Exley, who is completely indistinguishable from the protagonist itself, except for the fact that throughout most of the story nothing very interesting happens to him. To add to these problems, the novel is set in a fascinating place, and then gives you no sense of that place.
<br />
<br />The best part of the story was the romance. Some people may be understandably squeamish about a romance between a 17 year old girl and our 33 year old male protagonist. It probably would have creeped me out a bit more, except that the girl's older, very sick brother becomes friends with our hero, giving the whole thing a poignant flavor reminiscent of Dickens. I wished the author were a little less modest than Dickens in describing the physical nature of the romance; this was handled so euphemistically that I actually had to re-read paragraphs to ascertain whether anything was happening between the lovers. Anyway, there are some extremely nice, touching scenes among the sister, our guy, and the brother, who despite being bedridden of disease much of the time, seemed to be more alive than any other character in the book.
<br />
<br />There is certainly some excellent prose here, along with some prose that seems to be rather in love with itself and/or trying a bit too hard. Then again, I am the kind of reader who is less concerned with exquisite sentences and more concerned with an exquisite story. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>There is a great deal to enjoy in Hazzard's writing. While this is not a "novel of action" despite its troubled setting, I had no difficulty with its slow pace. Steadily-paced novels appeal to me.
<br />Knowing fairly well the localities described - the Hiroshima area, Wellington, Hong Kong - (and loving them), I very much enjoyed her  finely tuned descriptions. She creates atmosphere extremely well. 
<br />But after a while (a few pages, in fact) the language becomes annoying, stilted, even cloying. Many of the people in this novel are (to my view) stuffy and cold. I am not much worried by that. But the language she ascribes to them goes too far and Aldred and his painful young girlfriend are prissy, precious creations and I tired of their interaction. I was hoping she would run off with the explorer's son! 
<br />The result (for me) appears over-worked. Far too much effort has gone into the English and I quickly resented the author's style.
<br />If Shirley Hazzard wanted to depict a group of pretentious, foppy folk, she has succeeded, but despite some wonderful descriptive passages, and not a little humour, I was glad to reach the final paragraphs. Nonetheless, I will try her earlier, greatly acclaimed works.</span>

                    <span>Obviously, I'm not the only one who didn't care for this book. While I did enjoy Hazzard's writing style, I found the characters to be bland and unlikeable. I just didn't get much of a "feel" for any of them. I liked the plot, but it didn't really go anywhere. Actually, I feel bad even writing a review since I didn't finish the book--I only made it to page 65 before I gave up. Let this review be a caution to others who are thinking of starting this book!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This novel is a rewarding read for people who enjoy great writing.  Ms. Hazzard's prose is beautiful and her descriptive ability is astounding.  I found myself rereading paragraphs simply because of Ms. Hazzard's command of the language and her ability to summon mental images.
<br />
<br />What I found disappointing is Ms. Hazzard's narrative capabilities.  The plot can be confusing, and at time I found myself rereading, not for the beauty of her writing, but because I had failed to understand what was happening.  Also, characters appear who are exquisitely rendered (Peter Exley, for example), but Ms. Hazzard then seems at a loss with what to do with them and they simply fade away.
<br />
<br />Other reviewers have compared this book to a great painting and that is the perfect analogy for this novel.  Ms. Hazzard has the ability to paint great word pictures. The problem arises with the back-story of how and why some characters arrived in the painting in the first place and where they would eventually go.
<br />
<br />I do not mean to be too critical in this review.  This is an excellent book and certainly one worth your time.</span>

                    <span>It is true, as many of the previous reviews have pointed out, that The Great Fire is often difficult to understand and moves slowly, but after working my way thorugh the first third of the book, I suddenly realized I was reading a masterpiece.
<br />
<br />Now I shall re-read it slowly and lovingly, savoring the glorious prose and wondering at Shirley Hazzard's genius.</span>
