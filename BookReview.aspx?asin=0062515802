                    <span>I read one chapter of this little book (about 3 pages)every morning, and I've found it's a perfect way to start the day. Victoria Moran writes with passion and compassion, and each chapter offers a concrete way to improve your life in small, practical ways that don't overwhelm at all. Her words aren't going to change huge portions of your life... but they will change the ways in which you look at your life and approach each day. Over time, these small adjustments add up into greater peace and happiness - not because the world is different, mind you - your kids still have whiny days, and your boss can still be irrational.... but taking the time to restore yourself (even just by reading for 10 minutes) makes a huge difference in how you deal with those things.<P>Mostly, the advice deals with how to live fully in the present moment, appreciate the small things (like a cup of good coffee or the touristy things in your town that you take for granted). The big key for me is that she's never 'preachy' and doesn't use language that assumes shared religion or spirituality. She just writes as if she's a friend saying something profoundly - and simply - wise.<P>That's worth 10 minutes of anyone's day, in my opinion. This is going to be my new 'small gift' to have on hand for anyone at anytime.</span>

                    <span>Creating a Charmed Life is a series of 75 essays, each exploring an idea that will pave the way to a positive, life-affirming habit. Each essay is about 3 pages long, starts with a catchy title and a quote. Examples: "Get Ample Shine Time", "Practice the Vacation Principle", "Stop to Realize", "Honor Your Cycles" and "Breathe"!<BR>I enjoy Victoria Moran's style; it is beautiful, fresh and very friendly. The book is full of insights and wisdom, and will direct you to many positive habits that will make your life happier, easygoing and fulfilled. <BR>Victoria Moran gave us, busy women, a gift by writing this very useful book. Reading it is obviously not enough. Put these "sensible spiritual secrets" into practical use, and enjoy a charmed life.</span>

                    <span>Victoria Moran greets her readers with pure, radiant, personally affirming love as she teaches the basics for leading what she calls a "Charmed Life" using a practical, short-to-the-point approach which very reader friendly.<P>In other words, Moran gives readers the "What to" and the "How to" and allows the reader to easily apply the teachings. <P>Her tips are elemental and simple - and valuable to hear repeatedly. <P>They include such steps as:<P>Redefine "Lady"<BR>Make the bed<BR>Let go of Your Mountain (She adds, "I take care of life, God takes care of the Mountain.")<BR>Dig in the Dirt (The amazing realm where matter and spirit meet - that was probably my favorite section in the entire book.)<P>What inspired me the most about this book is something simple and elegant like this could be successful enough for her to write many other versions.<P>For those of us who write, this is a big inspiration.</span>

                    <span>I stumbled upon this book while surfing on the web and I am so glad I did! I do not like cutsie, preachy books about how to live your life so I was a bit dubious about it at first. I had nothing to worry about. Reading this book is like sharing a cup of good coffee with a dear, and wise friend. It rolls all the wisdom you have heard through out your life, and then some, into one short, entertaining, enriching read. I will buy a copy for all the women in my life.</span>
