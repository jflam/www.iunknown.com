                    <span>This book is hard to beat when it comes to detailing the causes of WWII, particularly in the European theater. I have read many different books on WWII history and thought that I had a pretty good grasp of what happened, when it happened, how it happened and the eventual results, but upon reading this book, I realized that there were much that I did not read about. Shirer filled in many of the gaps in my knowledge of this crucial period in history.<P>Considering the amount of names, dates and details that Shirer put in the book, he has managed to write a large work that rates very high on readability. At no point in the book did it get dry (at least for me). He has managed to weave together his voluminous research into captured German papers as well as interviews and correspondence with those involved into a very coherent, "story-telling" way. <P>The reason I didn't rate this book the full 5 stars is because Shirer, as a journalist and not a military historian per se, couldn't resist injecting his strong personal biases and prejudices throughout the entire book. I understand that a certain amount of personal bias is sometimes inevitable in a work written by a journalist, but when those same views get repeated over and over again, it just becomes plain annoying.<P>The first glaring bias that gnawed on my nerves was Shirer's repeated attack on some of Hitler's henchmen because they happened to be homosexual. He was trying to make a point that Hitler employed some of the worst scums of the earth during his early rise to power. I would fully agree with the fact that these men were scums because they were also murderers, thieves.... but homosexual? To place someone's sexual orientation (and we're not talking about pedophilia here) on the list of the world's biggest crimes shows Shirer's worst inconsistencies - you simply can condemn Hitler for being the worst bigot in the world and yet demonstrate such glaring bigotry yourself.<P>His personal attacks also get very tiring after a while. True, Goering was one of the most despicable characters to come out of the Nazi era, but when an author of a supposed work of history chooses to refer to him time and time again as "the FAT Field Marshal" or "the CORPULENT Field Marshal", it kind of takes a lot away from the reader's sense of the author's objectivity. Moreover, the fact that Goering wasn't a thin man doesn't have anything to do with the events of that period. For that matter, Churchhill was no model of fitness either, but the author doesn't point that out at all.<P>Sometimes, Shirer lets his personal biases contribute to silly inconsistencies. One moment, he'd be talking about "typical German clumsiness", and a few chapters later, while talking about another event, he would write about "typical German orderliness". Which one is it? Were the Germans slobs or perfectionists? Maybe he just shouldn't have made generalizations so freely like that throughout the entire book. Tell us the events that happened and let us make up our own minds. In similar ways, Shirer also seems to be torn between deciding whether Hitler was a genius, or a bumbling maniac. His views on that differ from chapter to chapter.<P>It may seem like I've written more about the book's weak points than its strong ones. The thing is, the book is invaluable as far as WWII history works are concerned. I'm just trying to emphasize that although you won't be disappointed with the mountain of details offered by it, it is also extremely important to know that this book must be read with an open mind, knowing that the author has liberally injected many of his personal biases into the narrative. At no point should it be considered strictly a work of history (in the vein of Stephen Ambrose's "D-DAY" etc. for example). Shirer gives you history the way HE wants you to see it.</span>

                    <span>Don't let the size of this book deter you from reading what is truly a masterpiece. William Shirer's look at one of history's most ruthless regimes is nothing short of outstanding. It is a well-written and utterly absorbing account of Hitler's rise to power, his reign of the Third Reich, and his subsequent fall. Shirer's painstaking and extensive research, coupled with his clear writing, provides the reader with a terrifying account of the horrors of Hitler's reign of terror. It is truly amazing to me that one man could mesmerize a country and lead them into a war they did not want and felt they could not win. The only drawback to the book is this: I am admittedly weak in geography and would liked to have seen a few maps of pre-War and post-War Europe throughout the text. In addition, maps of troop movements and campaigns during the War may have provided a clearer picture of the expanse of the German Empire at its height; however, the lack of maps certainly did not detract from the written work. Overall, a truly exceptional book that should be read by anyone who is interested in German/European history, WWII, or Adolf Hitler.</span>

                    <span>On the very eve of the birth of the Third Reich a feverish tension gripped Berlin . . . Wow! what a great first sentence! Having read this book almost thirty years ago, it still remains the best and most complete history of the Third Reich I have read. Shires purpose is not merely to describe the events that led up to the founding of the Reich and its eventual destruction; but to discover and document the intrigues, treachery, motives and aberrations that precipitated its rise and fall. <P>I will let others review the history and critique Shire on his research, I would like to comment on the beauty of his prose as he describes what must be the most hellish and destructive state that has existed. Historians have the tendency to be dull, they get so caught up in explaining facts and documenting the movement of armies across strange and foreign landscapes, that the reader tends to get lost in a maze of statistics, foreign names, and seemingly insignificant details. Shire avoids this common pitfall. For instance, after quoting from a German generals diary which described Hitlers intentions in occupied Poland, Shire describes the Nazi intentions in vivid prose. . . Nazi terror. . . forerunner to dark and terrible deeds. . . Nazi barbarism reached an incredible depth. Although Shire, in the introduction of this book made the assertion of strict objectivity, he did not let his objectivity hide the awfulness of Nazi atrocities. <P>Although well written, it is not an easy book to read. Its sheer length of over 1100 pages may be daunting to the faint of heart; yet, if you are not familiar with the Third Reich and want to have an understanding of the people whom were instrumental in its raise and fall, no other book will give you better oversight and understanding of it than The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</span>

                    <span>Many people have remarked that Shirer wasn't the most objective observer of the Third Reich. Some reviewers have stated that they would have preferred a volume devoid of personal biases and slanted observations, believing themselves competent to form their own opinions of the characters involved. If you count yourself one of this group, don't read Shirer. Don't read, for that matter, any book written by a human. I am more than content to base my opinions of Nazi leaders on Shirer's observations. He was an incredibly intelligent man in the best position possible for giving us an outsider's view into the otherwise murky world of Nazi Germany. How else do we form conclusions about men and women who died 60 years ago if not by cannibalizing the observations of others? It is impossible for anyone lving today to form an accurate picture of any historical figure without relying on the words of previous observers. Where else but from Shirer could we have learned that Hitler was commonly reffered to as a "Teppichfresser" ('carpet-eater' - referring to his occaisional fits of rage that ended with him drooling on the floor and knawing at the carpet) by those who disliked him? By the very nature of its author and the circumstances under which it was written, this book will probably never be surpassed in providing a broad, yet incredibly insightful view into the Third Reich.</span>

                    <span>This is truly an incredible work of history -- almost journalism, seeing that Shirer was actually present during most of the build-up of the Nazi state. His combination of documented scholarship and personal insight produce an extremely accessible while still very detailed account of what happened and, more importantly, why the events occurred the way they did as a result of the individual and state-level beliefs and motivations.<P>That said, however, the book has one critical flaw, in that it fails to offer a reasonable answer to the most fundamental and desperately important question: how did so many people (the German public) allow such abominable atrocities to occur in their name? Shirer's answer basically comes down to bloodlust and a will to dominate being fundamental to the German national character. This is simply unacceptable, a complete cop-out on the very question that he is probably solely positioned to fully answer. There is *no such thing* as 'national character'; cultural differences to be sure, but no people are fundamentally so different from the rest of us that they take wholesale slaughter and oppression as a natural way of life.<P>Perhaps there is no rational answer, and I can't hold Shirer responsible for finding one. But to blame the nature of the German is akin to the bigotry that brought the Nazis to power. I think the question of how Naziism gained so much support while being so extremely evil must be visited and re-visited until we recognize how to stop it. Common decency is the last hope of mankind, and we now know an entire nation can abandon it. Bush's 'Americans aren't like that' arguments aside, we need to make sure we know how to prevent it happening to us.</span>
