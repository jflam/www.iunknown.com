                <span id="Label1">Victor David Hanson, author of the highly regarded classic <b>The Western Way of War</b>, presents an audacious and controversial theory of what contributes to the success of military campaigns.<br><br>Examining in riveting detail the campaigns of three brilliant generals who led largely untrained forces to victory over tyrannical enemies, Hanson shows how the moral confidence with which these generals imbued their troops may have been as significant as any military strategy they utilized. Theban general Epaminondas marched an army of farmers two hundred miles to defeat their Spartan overlords and forever change the complexion of Ancient Greece. William Tecumseh Sherman led his motley army across the South, ravaging the landscape and demoralizing the citizens in the defense of right. And George S. Patton commanded the recently formed Third Army against the German forces in the West, nearly completing the task before his superiors called a halt. Intelligent and dramatic, <b><i>The Soul of Battle </i></b>is narrative history at it&#8217;s best and a work of great moral conviction.<br></span>

                    <span>This book is one that belongs on any armchair military historian's shelf. It makes a persuasive argument in favor of the sueriority of militias organized from democratic societies. <P>Hanson argues that the moral power of the three armies led by Epaminondas, a Theban, Sherman, a Union general in the American Civil War, and Patton, commanding the 3rd Army in Europe in WWII, was decisive in their ability to vanquish three slave states - Sparta, the Confederacy, and Nazi Germany. The democratic militias were ideological warriors fighting for a cause.<P>One of the particularly interesting features of Hanson's analysis was the fact that the democratic militias were able to demobilize so quickly. Their generals were not leading armies of conquest with imperial designs.<P>One problem with the book is that the sources Hanson used were narrow. The works cited are small in number.<P>The book is well written in a prose that is easy to read. It does suffer from a couple of glaring mistakes that should have been caught by an editor. But overall it is a very engaging book.</span>

                    <span>The Soul of Battle is a brilliant work crafted by a master of both ancient and contemporary sources in Military History. Shunning the relativistic analyses expounded by many recent military historians, Victor Davis Hanson offers instead three historical armies of liberation, each of whose commanders and soldiers fought for real moral imperatives. By comparing Epaminondas, Sherman, and Patton to other giants of military strategy--Alexander of Macedon, Napoleon, and Hitler--Hanson accurately exposes the real difference between the former generals, who believed that armies could be vehicles of liberation, and the latter rulers who used armies as tools to subjugate, not free. Readers conversant with classical works will especially appreciate Hanson's exclusive use of primary source literature in his treatment of Epaminondas. The reforms of this Theban general, famous for his innovations of novel phalanx tactics--later borrowed by Philip and Alexander of Macedon--are supported by an abundance of ancient source materials. Anyone familiar with Hans Delbr√ºck's Warfare In Antiquity will be delighted by Hanson's readable prose and illustrative accounts of how the Theban general altered the way Greek columns operated on the classical battlefield. We also learn that just after Napoleon made himself emperor through his effective, but costly, direct approach, Sherman, who eluded politics, utilized the indirect approach, saving the lives of his men by "cutting a swath" through southern slave-holding territories. Under Sherman's command most unionist soldiers aspired both to reunite the nation, and to give slaves a real share in the American constitutional ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Many of the French soldiers of the levee en mass also fought for democratic principles. However, the French had a very different leader. Napoleon, as Michelet has written, was "pitiless to the common people," and it was the men of France, not their Corsican leader, who were the "true heroes of the Revolution." Napoleon's "children" were sadly mistaken in the notion that their "Pet√Æt General" had a real faith in the same ideals that drove them forward. Napoleon understood well that the effectiveness of moral principles to create an esprit de corps among his soldiers did not depend on his own humanitarian ideals. Indeed it was a young George S. Patton Jr., who recognized the value of ideology in creating the victorious French armies. In his "The Secret of Victory," a study on Marbot and other writers of the Napoleonic Wars, Patton wrote that the French soldiers had often been moved by intense emotional inspiration. It was the very faith in abstract principles such as, La Patrie, Libert√©, Le Peuple Souveraine, and La Gloire that had been among the prime motives of their greatest feats of arms. Patton, as Hanson rightly points out, hoped to engender such passionate morale in his own armies. But Patton, unlike Napoleon, believed in the values with which he inspired his men: armies could and did exist to save lives. And when lives were at stake, quick action was always better than hesitation, courage always better than fear. In addition, Hanson's comparison of Alexander to Hitler could not be more precise. Both leaders intentionally allowed atrocities throughout the duration of their campaigns in order to subjugate the "uncivilized" peoples to their East. Alexander's pan-Hellenistic cause was little different than Hitler's pan-Germanism; his policy was the same. Rape, plunder, murder and the razing of cities was the order of the day. As Arrian recounts, festivals of Bacchian glee followed each Macedonian victory where soldiers were encouraged to drink away their guilt and revel at the expense of the eastern peoples they had brutalized and robbed. It is dead wrong to assume that dressing up like a Persian at such debauched costume parties was the same as "attempting to merge Greek and Persian customs through example." If Alexander had not burned Old Thebes, Tyre, Gaza, and Persepolis-- repositories of nearly all the knowledge and high culture of the Eastern world--such a "blending of cultures" might have been possible. Alexander's actions prove his intent.  Battle is always bloody, nearly always catches up the innocent in its violence, and is often little more than a tool utilized to solve disputes over foreign policy among nations. At their worst wars promote the selfish and inhumane policies of autocratic leaders such as Alexander, Napoleon and Hitler. But Epaminondas, Sherman and Patton serve as paradigms to remind us that the act of battle can also have a soul or deeper purpose more profound than the more common and insidious reasons for which it is most often employed. As surely as wars can be waged as a means to enslave, they can, have been, and must be fought to free any who are oppressed victims of inhumane policies. And it was exactly because Soul's three generals fought for such moral imperatives, infusing the spirit of their armies with their own principled ideals, while additionally evading the temptation to become caught up in the games of high politics, that each was hated by his own leaders. These three great men of history nevertheless overcame jealousy, as well as internal politics, in order to further the cause of freedom. The point is exactly that democratic armies DO NOT always produce men of such moral calibre--they are few and far between. Hanson's perceptive arguments, then, finally disabuse us of the common misconception that men everywhere, and at all times, fight only to save their own skins and those of the men in their individual units--an uncompounded answer to a complicated question now pass√©, and discredited. Instead, ideology counts, and those with the higher moral imperatives can, through perseverance, win in the end. This work belongs in every serious military historian's library. Geoffrey Parker's comment that, "Hanson is fast emerging as our foremost living military historian," stands repeating. Like Thucydides' Peloponnesian War, Soul of Battle truly is a "history for all time", and like Hanson's Western Way of War this work will rank among the great classics of military history.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Hanson has created an interesting book, comparing the battles, motivations and organization of three great leaders Epaminandous, Sherman and Patton. He again studies the character of the societies they came from and how this is reflected in the armies and in the way the leaders handled the battles. I found the section on Patton especially interesting, especially his thesis that Eisenhower and BRadley (especially the latter) were at times incompetent. I am sure this is not old news, but the arguments made were quite convincing. <P>Another argument that is interesting and not completely drawn out is that society had possibly changed around battle preventing Patton from executing his war plan to his best ability. The idea Patton expounded of killing as many of the enemy as possible with as few American casualties as possible seems to have been somewhat politically incorrect. The advent of better communications also meant the leader had less freedom of action. It would be interesting to read more on this thesis.<P>Finally, one small flaw that bothers me, Mr. Hanson can get a bit repetitive. For example he dwells on General Patton's lack of supplies so often and uses almost the same sentences all the time. It is like he feels we forgot what he said a few pages before.</span>

                    <span>The Soul of Battle : From Ancient Times to the Present Day, Three Great Liberators Vanquished Tyranny by Victor Davis Hanson is an interesting journey through the history of warfare and the impact that a democratic army may have on the outcome. Focusing on the Theban General Epaminondas conquest of Sparta, General Sherman of the Union Army and his march to the sea and General Patron's race through France and Germany, Hanson posits that citizen armies raised from a democratic populace and led by extraordinary leaders create the most lethal fighting machines the world has seen. This is especially true when soldiers see their basic morality challenged by their enemy. In such circumstances, these democratic armies are not only victorious but also ruthless in the pursuit of their goals.<P>In describing the conquests of the three great liberators, Hanson excels. His descriptions are more than just a narrative of the events, but a clear and extraordinary analysis of what made the three liberators and their armies click. Hanson clearly and justifiedly is a fan of the three. <P>However, if the book is purportedly more than just the story of the three great leaders and their armies, that is where it loses some of its strength. While a democratic army can be a devastating force, history reveals exceptions. For instance, while Patton's armies defeated the Nazi's, the American armies were routed by the Chinese in Korea and the British and French armies were defeated by the German blitzkrieg. Moreover, from Alexander to Genghis Kahn to Napoleon, history is full of examples of dictators leading armies of conquest and overwhelming their opponents. Hanson should have discussed theses other examples and explored why they are not inconsistent with his theory.<P>What Hanson, does discuss, but what could have been focused on more, is that the democratic armies were not professional armies like the ones of Alexander or Napoleon. Both the armies of Sherman and Patton, the soldiers were ordinary citizens who were called up to fight antidemocratic forces and who quickly reentered civilian life after their mission had been accomplished. <P>All in all, the reading of the book was a positive experience even given the limitations of Hanson's theory.</span>

                    <span>This was a very interesting read. The general theme is marches of liberation by "...militia..."armies which is to say, non-Regular, war-raised armies, through enemy territory, specifically, the territory of warrior societies with core beliefs in their alleged racial and military superiority. Suffice it to say that Hanson's three generals disprove those theories pretty conclusively.<P>Hanson starts with Thebes v. Sparta in the 4th century B.C.E. and the campaign of Epaminondas. This was a revelation to me. I had known next to nothing about Greece between the end of the Peloponessian War and the rise of Macedon and had never heard of Epaminondas before reading another book of Hanson's a few months ago. Learning that Sparta, undefeated and ,literally, uninvaded for centuries, had been humiliated and had seen its enslaved dependencies freed over the course of a winter's campaign by the Theban Epaminondas made for interesting and fast-paced reading. <P>Hanson presents a lot of contrarian perspectives, for example his characterization of Alexander the Great as, essentially, a homicidal maniac. Similarly, and more broadly, Hanson inquires why Athens, a ruthless imperial power, is more valued today than Thebes, which, after all broke the power of Sparta and which did not seek hegemony even at the peak of its power. This seems, however, to overlook a broad range of Athenian cultural achievment, not to mention Marathon and Salamis. Further, within 5 years of Epaminondas' campaign, he died in battle, following which Thebes was submerged in the Macedonian conquest. Bad timing there on Thebes'part. <P>Turning to the analysis of Sherman's March to the Sea(and beyond),Hanson seems a little harsh in his treatment of the Army of the Potomac, which after all had to fight the best Confederate commander and the Army of Northern Virginia in territory highly favorable to the defending force, with limited room for manuever. He also ignores the point that Grant eventually did outflank Lee when he crossed the James and attacked Petersburg, while Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia awaited frontal attack 50 miles away in their lines in front of Richmond. That is the very type of deep strike that Hanson praises Patton for wanting to make.<P> As is well known, however, this deep strike failed because the Union generals on the scene at Petersburg, with overwhelming strength on hand and a day and a half to attack, bungled matters so badly that Lee was finally able to shift troops to that front and hold the position. Had this stroke been succesful, as it deserved to be both in conception and execution up to the point of actual attack, the War would have ended before Sherman took Atlanta. So, Grant and the Army of the Potomac were not the bumblers that Hanson paints. <P>Having said that, Hanson does an excellent job giving Sherman the credit he deserves, which has been largely denied him due to the dominance of the pro-Southern view of the Civil War.<P>Turning to Patton, Hanson is again excellent but this section is hard to read because of the staggering consequences which followed the repeated refusals of Patton's superiors, Generals Bradley and Eisenhower, to allow him to go forward and cut behind retreating or bypassed German forces. These consequences, Hanson argues, included the failure to win the European War in 1944, many thousands of Allied combat deaths, probably several million death camp victims,and Soviet domination of eastern Europe for 50 years with the resultant Cold War. Hanson is unsparing and convincing in pointing out what he sees as the high command errors that led to these consequences and the consequences themselves.<BR> <BR>This book was written after the First Gulf War and before the Second. An interesting and unintended aspect of the book, given current events, is Hanson's analysis of what each of the 3 commanders in question would have done at the end of the First Gulf War and the obvious comparison to our current strategy, operations and tactics in Iraq. For a point of reference, I write this review on 11/14/03, while our forces are apparently intensifying operations in the "Sunni Triangle", following several weeks of intensifying attacks against U.S. and allied forces. I'll leave matters there. I recommend this book.</span>
