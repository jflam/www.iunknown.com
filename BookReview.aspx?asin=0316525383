                <span id="Label1">Mother-love is profound, however a baby comes into a woman's life. For  Rose Lewis, the journey to motherhood begins with a letter to Chinese officials,  asking if she can adopt from the "big room with lots of other babies." The  infants in that room in China are each missing a mother, but Lewis is missing  something, too--a baby. She travels to China to meet her new little girl and  falls head over heels in love. Taking her baby home to America, Lewis introduces  her to all her family and friends, and they begin their life together. <p>  A touching love story, <I>I Love You Like Crazy Cakes</I> will warm the cockles  of any new parent's heart, especially those who have recently adopted a child.  It's an ideal story for lap-time reading, and will inspire parents and kids to  talk about their own first "meetings," whether at birth or in an adoption  agency. Jane Dyer, illustrator of the bestselling <I>Time for Bed</I> by Mem Fox, <I>Oh My Baby, Little One</I> by Kathi  Appelt, and many other marvelous picture books, uses a pastel palette of  watercolors to capture the tender moments between the American mom and her  rosy-cheeked Chinese baby. (Ages 3 to 6) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>I didn't care what was inside this book. I had already fallen in love with its cover! And then more joy upon looking at the adorable illustrations and the author's simple, loving words describing her journey to China and picking up her baby girl. This is a book with few pages but volumes of enchantment and love. I am an adoptive mother, and our little girl was 4 days young when we brought her into our house. I felt the same joy Rose Lewis expressed. I especially liked Lewis's feelings for the Chinese mother who could not keep her baby. I too cried tears for our unknown birthmother and like Lewis hoped that somehow the grieving mother knew her child was safe. Even though Lewis described her love for a Chines baby, her book speaks equally well to anyone who adopts a baby anywhere in the world. I wish her book had been available when our little girl grew up. Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice? </span>

                    <span>As the adoptive mom of a six year old adopted from China almost five years ago, I have been looking for a book to share with my daughter that could evoke the feelings we have about her special place in our lives. This comes very close. The story of this adoption journey to China rings true -- it is based on the author's own experience. Lewis' text is loving and joyful --tinged with the longing and sadness that is often part of adoptions. An essential element of this book and one that I especially appreciate is the author's mention of her feelings for her daughter's Chinese mother. We have read and re-read "I Love You Like Crazy Cakes" at our house and it has sparked very necessary and important discussions with our daughter. Dyer's lovely watercolor illustrations are charming --and add to the warm loving tone of the story - it's just wonderful!</span>

                    <span>A beautiful book; strong loving feelings are projected from the mother to her daughter. The positives of adoption are explained with empathy for the child's situation. Children reading this will feel proud of their origins, whilst feeling safe and secure in the care and love of their parents. Beautiful illustrations reflect the texts message of love and bonding between mother and daughter.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book, but think that it is especially appropriate for single adoptive women. The adoptive mother is mentioned, but not an adoptive father or adoptive partner. The book is adorable, no matter what the adoptive parental situation is, but if you are a single adoptive mom, you MUST get this book.</span>

In "I Love You Like Crazy Cakes", my children can understand that sometimes Mommys and Babies become a family by being united via airplanes and adoption officials and guess what? The amazing love is the same. <P>I especially loved that the author shared the gratitude and love for the "other" mother who provided the gift of this baby into her life. Beautifully stated and at times, overlooked.<P>The illustrations must be mentioned also: they are stunningly beautiful with the emotions of the subjects literally entering my heart from the page.</span>
