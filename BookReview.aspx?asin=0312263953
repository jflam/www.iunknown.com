In <i>Slightly Chipped, </i>they get hooked on the correspondence and couplings of Bloomsbury; they track down Bram Stoker's earliest notes for <i>Dracula; </i>and they are introduced to hyper-moderns. <i>Slightly Chipped </i>is filled with all of the anecdotes and esoterica about the world of book collecting that charmed readers of <i>Used and Rare.</i><br></span>

                    <span>The Goldstone's "Used and Rare" is a gem of a book-collecting tome, and one that I recommend over "Slightly Chipped". Those who devoured U&R will be disappointed by the leadenness of their followup title, particularly as their former spark and enthusiasm for modern firsts isn't as evident in SC. Rather, they detail the truly uninteresting such as unexpected (to only them) Manhattan hotel's valet charges... Also, large portions of "Slightly Chipped" are devoted to quotations, a tactic that feels like mere filler in a volume this slim. Anyone captivated by "Used and Rare" will no doubt wish to pick up SC, but I'd suggest you wait until it appears in paper -- this is one hardback modern first that won't be increasing in value.</span>

                    <span>Many of the Amazon reviews are, in my opinion, accurate relative to a degradation from USED AND RARE, the Goldstone's first book extolling their rare book exploits. However, SLIGHTLY CHIPPED is nevertheless a fun and enticing read.<P>In USED AND RARE, the Goldstone's are introduced to the world of used and rare (appropo title) books via a bet to purchase a substantive yet cheap birthday present. USED AND RARE throws the reader into the incredibly obscure but fascinating "cult" of rare book collecting. For the bibliophile, this is analogous to an "edge of your seat" mystery. For the unafflicted, perhaps just a different albeit fun ride. SLIGHTLY CHIPPED is the sequel (Book 2 of 3 in the series) to USED AND RARE and continues the Goldstone's journey toward "BiblioNhirvana." By the way, Book 3 in this series is WARMLY INSCRIBED (if interested).<P>SLIGHTLY CHIPPED finds the Goldstones as now seasoned collectors of rare books and dives into a variety of peripheral side stories which detracts from the "romance" of the original storyline. Perhaps the most interesting tangental story in this offering was the Goldstones venture to the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia. This foray was specifically to view the manuscript to Bram Stoker's DRACULA. They go into great detail in describing the Museum, Stoker's biohistory, and the manuscript itself. This is truly a fascinating story.<P>On the other side of the coin, we are subjected to the same level of detail regarding Bloomsbury. I'll not bore you with the detail of this equally obscure mini-series of books except to say that while potentially entertaining, it was out of place in this book. This type of off-tangent minutae is the only reason this book is "slightly chipped." <P>Another side story is the auction of the contents of the Duke and Duchess of Windor by Sothebys. This auction ultimately brought approximately $24 million and included a number of collectible books. The Goldstones go into great detail as to how they obtained admittance to the auction (as contract writers for "Biblio" magazine) to the procedural aspects of the auction itself. This discussion is interesting, if for no other reason than to glean the details of an auction of this size and notoriety. <P>One of the more poignant issues raised by the Goldstones is their discussion of the internet's dramatic and unexpected (at least to them) impact on rare book collecting. This reader picked up numerous resources to locate and secure first editions and other rare tomes. Its quite obvious that the internet is becoming the leader in used and rare book offerings.<P>This should be considered a solid followup to USED AND RARE albeit less entertaining. Still, if collectibles or general book knowledge is your cup of tea, you will absolutely enjoy this book. A word of caution: read these books in order 1) USED AND RATE and then 2) SLIGHTLY CHIPPED.</span>

                    <span>If you like name-dropping and looking down your nose at honest helpful people, you might like this book. The Goldstones seem pretentious and obnoxious. Too much of the book is filled with discusions of fashion and restaurants. I was hoping they'd talk more about books.<P>The book is a disservice to book lovers. I wish someone would write a book about book collecting that was infused with a love of books, rather than this blather. Save your money. Buy books by Nicholas Basbanes and John Dunning and John Baxter and Robert Wilson and Paul Collins instead.</span>

                    <span>Having first read Used and Rare I was disappointed in the quality of this work. This collection of essays is too disjointed, never really focusing on anything for long enough or maintaining a single theme. While the stories themselves are entertaining it just isn't on par with the rest of the Goldstones work. Having later read Out of the Flames I must say that the Goldstones need to stick to one topic per book and not to try another collection of essays without a common thread between them.</span>

                    <span>"Slightly Chipped", by Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone is the second offering on what is supposed to be their continuing exploration of the world of book collecting. However, just as in their first book, "Used And Rare", the topic of books serves to provide these people with a continuous stream of targets for abuse. Please do not take to heart their description of what it is like to collect books nor of what type of people you will likely encounter while doing so.<P>To give you an idea of how far this book routinely strays from the alleged topic, what follows are direct quotes. The first takes place at a gathering at a library amongst a small group who are present to learn about very rare books. Any one of the volumes could be the subject of an entire book, but books are just a tangent in this brief and shallow memoir. While they do not hesitate to name the person they describe, and also list his occupation, I offer just a fragment out of the respect for privacy they show no concern for. "He was the kind of person whom Hollywood casts as the computer junkie who uses the Internet to lure young women to his apartment for.................." This is what they choose to describe as books from nearly a millennia ago are passed around the table. A book by William Morris is part of the evening's discussion. Mr. Morris produced some of the most prized limited editions of the late 19th Century. Here, that is almost a footnote when compared to his personal life, which rambles on for pages.<P>These people cannot even visit a bookstore that I know well, without adding this bit of irrelevant mean-spirited commentary on Torrington CT. ".thus providing the grimness and depressedness of Torrington for that much longer". Canton is described as, "hardly a town at all", and they quiz the owner on why he is located in such a difficult location. Our authors have moved to Fairfield CT. since their last book, an area that allows them to name drop the famous and wealthy, one of whom had to change homes because the light at The Yacht Club shone into his bedroom. What any of this has to do with books is beyond me.<P>Collecting books is a wonderful hobby. Shop owners generally will spend vast amounts of time, sharing their knowledge and love of books. I have been present when booksellers have taken a personal check for several thousand dollars on the final day of a show, from a person they never met, hours before they were to fly across the Atlantic to their shop in England. As a group, book collectors and dealers are wonderful people who share what Author Nicholas Basbanes has called, "A Gentle Madness". The authors do not enjoy this state of mind, rather, like the title of this book what rests upon their shoulders may be slightly chipped, however a large portion remains firmly in place.</span>
