                    <span>I felt that Circle of Love was a really great way to learn about the emotional aspect behind the horrible kidnapping that took place in Argentina during the "dirty war". It did not cover much of the politics of the situation because the book encompassed the testimonies of mothers and grandmothers of the missing. Although the stories were at times redundant and very heart-wrenching, I was able to read the book feeling as though I had learned a great deal. I think anyone can benefit from reading the unbounded love that these women felt for their children and the pain and ridicule that they endured in order to find answers as to where their loved ones had been taken. These stories are REAL women who are still fighting this in hopes that justice might be found.</span>

                    <span>Circle of Love Over Death really opened my eyes to what was happening to the people in Argentina. It was shocking to read the stories of what happened to these people. I cannot even begin to imagine the kind of pain the mothers went through when their children disappeared and there was absolutely nothing they could do. Matilde Mellibovsky did a wonderful job of portraying the hurt, despair, and helplessness of the mothers as they did everything they could think of to find their disappeared children. I think this a great book that really touched me. However, some of the stories did seem a little repetitive.</span>

                    <span>"Our children were not taken as prisoners from a battlefield; totally defenseless, they were abducted from their homes, from the street, from their places of study and work. Our struggle has taken years of ceaseless searching and every other possible method, but it has been carried out by legal, constitutional, non-violent methods-with a clean face."<BR> Circle of Love Over Death gives you a first hand testimony into the horrors and ugliness that Argentina battled through for many years. Through the eyes of each of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, you find an emotional and physical struggle to find the answers that they were never given, where their children are. This book touches on every human emotion possible and really gives you a true understanding of how one political force can take out an entire country.</span>

                    <span>In Circle of love over death, mothers whos children were taken away during the turbulent 70s in Argentina, gave their testomonies of the abduction and what came after. Before I read this book I had no knowledge of this sort of thing ever happening in Argentina. The haunting tales of the mothers showed the pain of losing a child, or children for as little reason as they were helping the poor. This book also showed how these women were able to bond together after the loss of their children to fight for the knowledge of what happened to the children. This book covers the events in Argentina since the 1970s, and describes the pain and horror of the mothers as the search for information about the whereabouts of their children, even twenty years after their abduction. I think this book was very informative and made us aware of situation that was not well publicized in the united states at all.</span>

                    <span>"I look at you who look at me, who perhaps would like to know, and I, from my tremendous clarity I, from my insomnia, am going to ask you, if you have any children..."<P>I had heard of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo before reading this book, but having read it I now feel as if if I know the Mothers. Their testimonies were beautiful dedications to thier children who dissappeared, and thier voices important to understanding the horrendous experiance they have had, and continue to endure. Perhaps the boggest problem I had with this book was the feeling of redundancy of the testimonies. As I was reading I desperatly hoped that the testimonies would explore different instances, and feelings. I think it was important for these mothers to have the opportunity to voice their feelings and their heartache, however.<P>If you have never heard about "disappearances" in Argentina, or you simply want to find out more, this is a very useful text.</span>
