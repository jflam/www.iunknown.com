                <span id="Label1">The original printing of <I>Testing Computer Software</I> set the standard for the emerging field of test engineering with a full tour of the state of the art in managing the testing process. The reissued text makes this classic out-of-print text available once again. Though it relies heavily on older examples (including MS-DOS) and has not been updated, this text is still a worthwhile resource for practical-minded advice on the realities of testing.<p> The best thing about <I>Testing Computer Software</I> is its practical point-by-point guide to everyday software testing, from creating a test plan, to writing effective bug reports, to working with programming staff and management to fix bugs.<p> That said, this book's early frame of reference shows how far we've come. (The book relies heavily on MS-DOS examples and features some truly embarrassing anachronisms, including the mention of testing dot-matrix printers and even EGA/VGA video modes.) The bibliography stops at sources from 1992 and features many references from the 1980s. Nowadays, automated software testing tools are the staple of any testing strategy. This book even advocates a wait-and-see approach to the "new" Microsoft Test.<p> These limitations aside, there is still a good deal to mine here. Much of the approach to testing is still very valid for any aspiring or working test engineer. Clearly, readers of the first edition will have little reason to upgrade to this second edition, but for anyone who appreciates a "classic" (and indeed a pioneering) text in the field of software testing, it's good to have <I>Testing Computer Software</I> in print again. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: test case design, test planning, project lifecycle overview, software errors, boundary conditions, bug reports, regression testing, black box testing, software quality and reliability, managing test teams, printer testing, internationalization, and managing legal risk.</span>

                    <span>When I first read this book over eight years ago I was less than enthusiastic.  At the time I felt that the approach was not rigorous enough.  Over time I came to appreciate the pragmatism and how the approach in this book reflects the realities of software testing instead of a rigid, purist view as an unattainable ideal.<p>Everything the new or intermediate test professional needs to know is covered.  The practices and techniques provided will foster sound QA practices and will step you through developing test strategies, and from those, developing and executing test cases.  These are the real essence of testing, and this book covers them exceptionally well.<p>I like the coverage of testing systems and artifacts that are not software - documentation, hardware, and localization testing advice shows that testing is not limited to software.  As importantly, the chapter on legal consequences of software defects will show testing in a perspective that is often overlooked, even by seasoned test professionals.<p>If you are new to software testing, or have some experience, but no formal training, this book will provide you with the right way to approach software testing, and will give insights that would take years to learn on your own.</span>

                    <span>This book contains clear explanations of testing terms and processes. Want a job testing? read this book. You will know what your prospective boss is talking about and be able to meaningfully contribute to the team. There was one reviewer complaining about the author's constant use of 'her' and 'she' throughout the book. When you read the book, you will notice that the author actually alternates consistently between female and male pronouns. Even if this wasn't the case, get over it. Maybe get an introductory psych book or go on Dr. Phil to try to overcome your insecurities and inferiority complex around women. You'll be better off for it.</span>

                    <span>This is probably one of the best books for learning software testing techniques. If you are new to software testing and don't have a "mentor" to teach you the techniques I would recommend this book, then check out some of the modern structured "risk-based" testing process books, such as Testing IT by John Watkins to get up-to-date on what has changed in the testing world since 1992.</span>
