                    <span>it might be a good beginner's book for understanding the basics of web services. When you start dealing with realworld web services architecture situations, all you get from this book is just how to make a simple hello-world JAXRPC, JAXM example working -- beyond that i had no more use of the book. The chapters on SOA, transactions, practical considerations, security are nothing but theoretical junk with no example proof. After browsing all the pages, I don't find anything which show how to build a working java Web services architecture. The word architecture is abused and does'nt make sense for this title.</span>

The book suggested website www.webservicesarchitecture.com is not working at all. I find no response from the publisher and author as well.</span>

                    <span>Java Web Services Architecture addresses the most difficult aspects of web services including security, registries, components, reliable messaging, and long-lived loosely coupled asynchronous transactions. These are the concepts of web services that the experts agree will ultimately be the most important, but for which the standards, protocols, and tools are not yet fully baked. The authors explain these missing-piece challenges, describes the ultimate solutions, and helps the reader develop a web-services architecture for their organization.</span>

                    <span>Web Services are self-describing, modular applications. The Web Services architecture can be thought of as a wrapper for the application code. This wrapper provides standardized means of: describing the Web Service and what it does; publishing it to a registry, so that it can easily be located; and exposing an interface, so that the service can be invoked - all in a machine-readable format. What is particularly compelling about Web Services is that any client that understands XML, regardless of platform, language and object model, can access them. <P>This book is probably quite good in that it sets out to explain some facts about java, web services and architecture. It's comprehensive in it's nature and tone. This book provides a snapshot of the current state of these rapidly evolving technologies, beginning by detailing the main protocols that underpin the Web Services model (SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI), and then putting this theory to practical use in a wide array of popular toolkits, platforms, and development environments.<P>The technologies presented in this book provide the foundations of Web Services computing, which is set to revolutionize Distributed Computing, as we know it. If you haven't been exposed to this kind of software and the mind set that is involved with it you might do well to get hold of this publication and read it from cover to cover.</span>
