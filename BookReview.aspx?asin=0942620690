                    <span>Rosemarie Ionker's beautiful doll clothes are famous for details like smocking and embroidery. Her designs have been sold through "Boneka/Petite Creations" and have been featured on high quality collector dolls. I have long considered these clothes the finest the doll world has to offer, so I was thrilled to find her latest book of patterns tailored for small dolls.<P>This book has patterns for dolls that are 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 inches tall. Almost half of the book is filled with pages and pages of patterns, drawn simply and clearly labeled for each size doll and by the pattern piece. There are also many pages of stunning photographs showing off Ionker's completed creations. The text is high quality and to the point. She offers tips for pattern adjustments as well general sewing tips, information on fabrics and embellishments, and, of course, directions on how to use/assemble the patterns.<P>The patterns in this book are for dolls representing children, and not adult proportioned fashion dolls. There are pattern pieces to clothe both boy and girl dolls. The dolls shown in this book range from Ginny, to Wendy Lawton's 9 inch dolls, to small porcelain, vinyl and wood dolls. Ionker will let you know how to clothe them all, with photographs documenting the differences and directions on how to find the right fit.<P>I would recommend this book for those seamstresses who have had at least some experience sewing. Sewing for small dolls requires some special tricks and a lot of patience! Ionker's work, though, can inspire and direct those advanced beginners to making more detailed clothing for small dolls.</span>

                    <span>I have to admit that I haven't tried the patterns in this book as of yet, but know that they will fit as beautifully as those in Rosemarie Ionker's previous book. The photographs of small dolls and the fashions that can be made from the patterns in the book are absolutely beautiful and mind-blowing and well worth the price of the book alone. The instructions on altering patterns and on sewing such tiny garments is equally outstanding. I highly recommend this book.</span>
