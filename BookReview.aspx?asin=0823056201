                    <span>OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS BOOK! i am a high school art teacher looking for a starting point on how to revamp my graphic design class. Although this book is college level and the illustrations by the students are amazing, i use the exercises to get my students to really challenge themselves and get their creative juices flowing. I especially like the layout of how the author gives the problem on one page, and then shows how each student chose to solve the problem on the following pages. Every exercise in this book is challenging, creative, and most important, fun to do. i tried them myself. it was interesting to see the results from each student and how different they were. i wish i had problems like this when i was a graphic design major in college. i highly recommend this book if you are an educator looking for great visual problem solving projects.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a basic tutorial on graphic design, and this isn't it.  However, it has many lessons on how to think "out of the box" regarding graphic design and layout.  I'm a software engineer looking to improve my web layout and icons/logos used in my software.  This book forces me to think in new ways, so I'm glad that I got it.</span>

                    <span>I am launching a high school commercial art program in the fall of 2000 and, while doing research, stumbled upon "Visual Literacy."  It stopped me dead in my tracks; the quest for a concise source of design  principals, assignments, and assessments was over.  I kept telling myself  that it was too good to be true, you simply cannot find a resource that is  so complete,  comprehensible, and engaging.  I chalked it up as a fluke and  proceeded to continue my research.  To resume the search was a waste of  time, Visual Literacy was the total package.  Two thumbs way up.</span>

                    <span>I think this book is an extraordinary source for designers to expand not only the way they work but the way they find new and different solutions for problems. <br> Richard Wilde, takes you in to exciting exercises and  techniques to free your potential, to relax and look for deeply  introspectation, motivating your imagination to go beyond cliches.<br> The  best way to describe this book will be quoting Albert Einstein: Imagination  is more important than knowledge, knowledge is limited, imagination  encircles the world.</span>
