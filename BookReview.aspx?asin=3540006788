                <span id="Label1">Originally published in 1981, this was the first textbook on programming in the Prolog language and is still the definitive introductory text on Prolog. Though many Prolog textbooks have been published since, this one has withstood the test of time because of its comprehensiveness, tutorial approach, and emphasis on general programming applications. Prolog has continued to attract a great deal of interest in the computer science community, and has turned out to be a basis for an important new generation of programming languages and systems for Artificial Intelligence. Since the previous edition of Programming in Prolog, the language has been standardised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and this book has been updated accordingly. The authors have also introduced some new material, clarified some explanations, corrected a number of minor errors, and removed appendices about Prolog systems that are now obsolete.</span>

                    <span>This is an extreme valuable book on the Prolog programming language that every computer science person should own.  Prolog itself is actually a fairly simple language to learn, albeit slightly obscure.  It's reputation for complexity comes from its non-standard implementation, but if you don't enter into it expecting it to look and behave like other languages then you should be all right.  Once you get past the mathematics and logic, you should be able to get your mind working in that particular direction.  This book is a very handy guide for getting the programmer into the Prolog mindset as well as bringing one up to speed on all the (sometimes very confused) syntax.<p>This book, like Prolog itself, is not for the beginning programmer.  If you have a good background in logic or mathematics, then you should find this book to be very rewarding.</span>

                    <span>Prolog is a complex subject, especially for someone not well familiar with mathematical logic. Thus, it is very important how the foundation would be laid down. Typically the books I had read on Prolog tend to two extremes.  They are either too condensed for such a complicated subject as logical  programming, or too broad and mathematically intensive.  I would put this  book into the first category. Though very concise and well structured, this  book does not seem to be a good primer. I would rather recommend the book  of Ivan Bratko "Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence  (International Computer Science Series)" 2nd edition (the third edition of  this book is due in August 2000). Ivan Bratko had managed to find the  optimal style of presenting both the essence and the practical aspects of  the language. Bratko's book covers various practical applications of the  language and manages to convey the basic concepts of Prolog without  overwhelming the beginner with too abstract or too condensed  passages.<p>Nevertheless, "Programming in Prolog" could be a very good  programming reference once you are relatively comfortable with the  language.</span>

definitive guide to Prolog, but is now fairly
dated and of historical interest. As I understand
 it, Clocksin has updated the 1981 work several times</span>
