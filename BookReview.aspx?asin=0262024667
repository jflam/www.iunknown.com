                <span id="Label1">We live in a dynamic economic and commerical world, surrounded by objects of remarkable complexity and power. In many industries, changes in products and technologies have brought with them new kinds of firms and forms of organization. We are discovering news ways of structuring work, of bringing buyers and sellers together, and of creating and using market information. Although our fast-moving economy often seems to be outside of our influence or control, human beings create the things that create the market forces. Devices, software programs, production processes, contracts, firms, and markets are all the fruit of purposeful action: they are designed.<br /> <br /> 	Using the computer industry as an example, Carliss Y. Baldwin and Kim B. Clark develop a powerful theory of design and industrial evolution. They argue that the industry has experienced previously unimaginable levels of innovation and growth because it embraced the concept of <i>modularity</i>, building complex products from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together as a whole. Modularity freed designers to experiment with different approaches, as long as they obeyed the established <i>design rules</i>. Drawing upon the literatures of industrial organization, real options, and computer architecture, the authors provide insight into the forces of change that drive today's economy.</span>

                    <span>This is an important book.  John Holland, who is heavily referenced, foreshadowed its publication when he linked the concepts of real options and complex adaptive systems in a talk at the Santa Fe Institute in late  1998.<p>The authors clearly and persuasively explain how modular design  adds a tremendous amount of value through the creation of real options.   Furthermore, modularity allows for the evolution of both design and  industry.<p>In the 1960's, IBM created the System/360, the first modular  family of computers.  As a result, IBM launched an industry -- and lost  control over the tremendous value it stimulated.<p>"Design Rules"  was recommended me by one of the authors' colleagues, who thought that I'd  "eat it up."  I did, and I'm hungry for Volume 2.</span>

                    <span>Opening the "black box" of technological and industrial progress, Baldwin and Clark introduce the notion that technology is a set of tasks and the organization mirrors the design of the artifact that it produces.<p>The authors model builds upon the work of John Holland, Stuart  Kauffman and Brian Arthur (from the Santa Fe institute) on Complex Adaptive  systems (CAS). CAS have four properties:<p>1. Each of these systems is a  network of many agents acting in parallel. The control of these agents is  highly dispersed.<p>2. The CAS has many levels of organization, with agents  at any one level serving as the building blocks for agents at the higher  level. Furthermore, CAS are constantly revising and rearranging their  building blocks as they gain experience. Baldwin and Clark carefully  document four layers operating in the computer industry, The global  financial system, the markets for goods and labor, organizations, and the  design and production of computers. In Addition, the authors describe the  six "modular operators", the complete set of options that can be  used by agents to modify the system that can be used at any level.<p>3. All  CAS anticipate the future. The various models, whether implicit or explicit  assumptions, are constantly tested, refined and rearranged as the system  gains experience. Baldwin and Clark assume that designers "see and  seek" value, with value being measure in the global financial  system.<p>4. CAS typically have many niches, each one exploited by an agent  adapted to fill that niche. Moreover, the very act of filling a niche opens  up new more niches. Thus, there is no equilibrium in these models, it is  not about a "punctuated equilibrium". The process is a constant  search for an improved fit with the environment. Moreover, the clock speed  of the process should match the environment.<p>This book has deep  implications for practitioners and scholars interested in understanding the  "new" economy. I highly recommend the text.</span>
