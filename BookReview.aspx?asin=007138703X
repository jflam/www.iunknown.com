                    <span>I learned nothing. There is a list on nearly every page...this guy loves his lists. I'm a list person myself but OVERKILL. I got too bogged down in the lists and couldnt ever make myself concentrate on more than two pages at a time. I hate to admit it, because I usually give a book an even chance and will try to finish it, but I GAVE UP. 
<br />
<br />Learn how to write something other than a freaking list and I'd be more than happy to give your book another go.</span>

                    <span>This book has some useful information, however, I feel anyone with 5 years of consulting experience has already learned most of what the author has to say.  The book is not so much about how to be a consultant but more of a self-congratulatory summation of the arrogant authors life. The real price of this book is not the cover price; it is the time wasted sieving through the desultory monologue to obtain useful tools to improve your success as a consultant. An alternative to buying this book is a 10 minute conversation with a successful consultant.    </span>

                    <span>Alan Weiss tells it like it is. If you want to learn from one of the best...read EVERYTHING Alan Weiss writes! Alan's insights and experience are second to none. I personally own just about every book Alan Weiss has written. He is not only a consultant's consultant, but he is also a gifted writer as well.
<br />Alan Weiss's advice, insights and knowledge will take years off your learning curve. This book is a must for your library.

                    <span>Alan Weiss discusses the nuts and bolts of growing a solo consulting practice to million dollar level. He discusses marketing, relationship building, logistics, and numerous 1% improvements that taken together can provide significant benefit. He discusses steps from conceptual agreement through proposal writing to value based pricing.</span>

                    <span>If a successful, wealthy business person could somehow articulate all they've learned in a neat little package, this is what Alan Weiss has done.  It is the perfect book.  It has given me a wealth of knowledge of the consulting field, the knowledge to make it grow, and most importantly Alan has convinced me that it is possible to become a wealthy business owner and still maintain a company of one employee, me.
<br />
<br />I have just completed the book and wrote notes in most of the margins.  I use it now as a reference book, because it now acts like an encyclopedia.  This is the second consulting book (about the 20th business/management book) I've read and it is by far the best one.  Real practical knowledge.  Buy it, Keep it, Use it!!  </span>
