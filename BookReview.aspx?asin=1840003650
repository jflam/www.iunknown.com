                <span id="Label1">"The holistic healing approach now popular in interior design here is applied to the use of color....begins by explaining how the energy produced by different colors affects one's moods and discusses how chakras...are influenced by color. Rather than suggesting various color schemes...focuses on individual colors and how their use in a home can create different moods."--<i>Library Journal.</i><br></span>

                    <span>Tangerine Orange. Shocking Pink. Azure Blue. These are just a few of the colors offered in Color Healing Home. For those of you who love modern interior design but would like something other than beige and variations on white, then this is THE book for you. The book is divided by color and each color is showcased in beautiful modern rooms. Worth its weight in gold!! A+++++++++</span>

                    <span>I really like this book. The photos are beautiful. The author discusses what effect different colors have on your mood, i.e. paint your bedroom deep blue for restful sleep, red can cause exhaustion if it's not used sparingly, magenta-pink encourages introspection, etc. This book gives you lots of interesting ideas for adding color to your home, beyond just slapping paint on a wall.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my all-time favorite books ... and I have a HUGE collection of books on color and decorating.  Whenever I look through these pages, I want to do my rooms in every color I see, loving each page more than the next.  If you ask me which was my favorite color, I will say, "All of them!"  But then, my passion for color is the reason I bought this book in the first place.  As soon as I opened it, I had to have it.<p>The book is broken down according to the colors of the spectrum and the color therapy use of each color (i.e., there are sections for "energizing," "uplifting," "balancing," "refreshing," "calming," "meditative," "romantic," and "grounded").  Each individual color has two or three photos.  But this book doesn't just separate the colors as simply as red, orange, yellow, etc.  It elaborates by breaking each color down into numerous shades and tones of that color.  For the violet part of the spectrum alone -- which is classified as "meditative" in terms of color therapy purposes -- there are pages for the shades "very violet," "deep purple," "mood indigo," "fresh lavender," "lilac time," and "purple haze."  Each has several photos.<p>Throughout the book, there are pages (and photos) for such luscious colors as "sunflower," "aquamarine," "fruit pastels," "sugar candy" ... and there are natural/neutral colors represented as well.<p>Just looking through this book cheers me up and inspires me.  It is intelligently written as well.  I highly recommend Color Healing Home to anyone who would like to bring more color and joy into their life.</span>
