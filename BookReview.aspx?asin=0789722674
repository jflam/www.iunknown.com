                    <span>I received this book for Christmas and thought it would be like most other HTML books, rather "incomplete", as in skipping around and not really covering the topics. But, I was terribly wrong! I have been using it for 4 days now, and have read every piece of information on the 165 pages I have consumed hungrily.<p>Even though I already know HTML, this book helped me realise, that, since I taught myself HTML by looking at other people's pages, I learned a slap-dash method, and when I read this book I see all the places where I've gone wrong. <p>It is extremely thorough, and covers all topics you could possibly need to know about HTML 4.0. I think the CD is an extremely good idea, because I didn't have an editing environment already, and I sure didn't have any of the animation tools I will need later on in the book! So, now, I'm fully equipped (as they say). <p>I would reccommend this book to any novice through advanced reader. Everyone can learn something from this book, and have fun doing it! I never thought I would enjoy going through and taking notes and highlighting a 1,000+ page book, but I LOVE IT! I come back from my run every morning and dash to the computer and start working in this book. Please consider this book before any other!</span>

                    <span>This book attempts to do too much. The title is a misnomer -- it covers topics well beyond HTML, including JavaScript, CGI, WYSIWYG, and database -- none in sufficient detail to be meaningful. Lots of superficial overviews with bits of flashy code and screen shots. No beginner could pick up this book and implement any techniques without additional resources; no intermediate or expert builder will find enough to be satisfied.</span>
