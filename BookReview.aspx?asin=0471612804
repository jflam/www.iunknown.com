                    <span>Just when you think that surely nothing more could ever be written on networking, the guru herself, Susan RoAne, weaves a masterful extension to connecting with people for synchronistic
<br />(or lucky) outcomes. She clearly outlines the right traits of "lucky" people and then proceeds to relate illustrative story after story. Read this book. Take the advise. Get "lucky"

                    </div>
                    <span>I am a self-confessed fan of Susan RoAne and her work. Recognized internationally as "the networking maven," she knows her specialty well and communicates it effectively. And that won't be my last understatement!
<br />
<br />Essentially, RoAne's message is that you create your own luck by reaching out to others, by building relationships, and by practicing proven techniques of opening the doors of opportunity before you hear the knock. The book is built around eight traits of success:
<br />Talk to strangers, make small talk, drop names, eavesdrop and listen, ask for and offer help, stray from your chosen path, exit graciously without burning bridges, and say "yes" when you want to say "no."
<br />
<br />As you move smoothly through the pages of this book (it's written to be read easily), you will enjoy focused illustrations that illuminate the vital traits. RoAne shares a wealth of meaningful stories that bring her messages to life, then explains again the process to follow to achieve your desired results. You can tell this book was written by a former teacher; the emphasis on learning shines through. Each teaching is an inspiration; readers will find themselves motivated to put their new knowledge to work. Summaries and action plan starters at the end of each chapter encourage application of the learnings. For some, the experience may be, in at least a small way, life-changing. 
<br />
<br />In the first paragraph of this review, I used the word "maven." This is a Yiddish word meaning "an expert, a knowledgeable person." That definition is one of many that are included in a glossary at the end of this book. RoAne uses several Yiddish terms in her writing, so the reader gains an understanding of this language. There's even a thorough index to add value to this volume. 
<br />
<br />"How to Create Your Own Luck" is highly recommended for everyone who wants to smooth their path through life. It will be particularly valuable for people in business (not just sales), entrepreneurs, students entering the world of work, prospective retirees...and the list goes on. Your biggest challenge will come when you finish reading the book: you'll have to decide if you want to covet it, or pass it along to someone else.

                    <span>I know so many people personally and in business that walk around with their eyes on the ground trying to figure out how to get what they want.  RoAne makes it very clear; the answer's right in front of you!  Success is a true "can't see the forest through the trees" scenario.  How To Create Your Own Luck helps you smack right into one of those trees and clear your blurred vision of hopelessness.  It's a great book for young entrepreneurs like me!</span>

                    <span>Susan Roane as usual makes her points through humor and wit.  Some of the greatest success stories are when people broke the rules and created their own path.  Through her book, Susan shows how each of us are capable of greatness by not stepping over those little clues and opportunities.</span>
