                <span id="Label1">Albert Frey worked in Le Corbusier's atelier in Paris, but he is  most closely associated with the 1940s and 1950s desert architecture of Southern California, and with the work of architects such as Richard Neutra and John Lautner.   <P>This exquisitely designed monograph on Albert Frey focuses on two houses he built for himself in Palm Springs, California, one in 1941 (with an addition in 1953) and the other in 1964. Although both houses have a modern aesthetic, including glass walls and concrete construction, they are fully incorporated into their surroundings, in keeping with Frey's principles of paralleling nature in his work. This title, which was developed in collaboration with Frey himself, includes color and duotone photographs commissioned especially for this book. The book is exquisitely made and comes in a plastic slipcase.  <P>Please note that this is a limited edition of only 2500 copies.</span>

                    <span>The captionless pictures are an amateurish mish-mash--a wall here, a cupboard there, a flower pot, etc.--that intends to explain the houses by showing their components. There might be one or two actual pictures of the complete houses, but they're not especially flattering. Makes you appreciate professional photographers. No technical info either. There is an interview at the end, however, if you're willing to buy the book for that.</span>

                    <span>In London I stumbled on this beautiful book at the Tate museum. Interestingly Palm springs modernism seems to be a highly sought after style here and this book embodies the best of that look. I never knew Frey did the detailing of the Villa Savoye and helped execute the built in furniture. It is great to see that Europe architecture migrated and that within Europe today, the look that Frey designed for his own homes is very much appreciated and admired and inspires. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this book is invaluable.</span>

                    <span>Albert Frey's work is among the best fifties modernism has to offer. Unfortunately there is not as much literature about him as for instance on Neutra. 'Albert Frey Houses 1+2' tries to fill in the gap and focuses on the two desert houses Frey has built and extended over the years. The designs and changes are documented by colour photographs, instead of drawings. This approach unveils the tactility and vivid colours of Frey's work, but neglects the spatial qualities of his plans. Because most people have been introduced to his architecture by black and white pictures, this book now shows that the designs are much more complex and lively than expected. Pictures of personal items and private photographs are printed among the architecture and reveal Frey's sources of inspiration. The last few pages are dedicated to an interview, and are very inspiring. Frey turns out to be a very clever and sensitive person, who in many ways has been way ahead of his time. Drawback of this 'picture'-book is that it only serves as an introduction to Albert Frey's work. Because the focus of the book is on only two of his houses, and its approach is mainly visual, it leaves the reader behind with an urge to find out more about this gentle architect and his buildings.</span>

                    <span>visually, palm springs is back as one of our culture's most interesting spots. the mix of sand, glass, and metal that is modernism's desert design signature is in perfect shape here. albert frey, who perhaps more than anyone helped to shape that look, gets to showcase the two homes he built and lived in here. (one no longer exists, the other overlooks palm springs central from high atop palisades drive.)<P>the photos are from his personal archive, which author/collaborator jennifer golub (a producer at ad agency chiat day) was able to get him to open. the words are frey's too. since he's 95, we're lucky he talks to us now before its too late.</span>

                    <span>There have been very few books about the modernism of Palm Springs. But this book on FREY 1 & 2 homes brings to bear something unique in books on architects and their homes. Ms Golub seems to spend alot of time exploring the thought process of Frey who deserves credit for bringing modernism to California and Palm springs in the 40s. Shots of antennas, Silos and other geometric forms contrast and inspire the industrial beauty and simplicity of FREYS own work. Beautiful photography with a sensitive assembly of Freys own homes and inspriration make this a must have for anyone interested in this period of architecture. The fact Frey also designed icons in Palm springs such as the arial tram and many public buildings including the still standing winged gas station make this first time photo essay a special piece. ALso, since Frey is 95 and still living in his original home today, the relevancy of this work is enhanced by his endorsment of this treatise on his most personal work.</span>
