                    <span>So you heard all this hype on Web Hacking, and want to know more about this matter.<P>Well, if you think about the web as an e-commerce platform, then just Buy 'Web Security, Privacy & Commerce' by Garfinkel and Spafford, an excellent and classic book.<P>Are you interested in 'pure hacking'? I mean 'perl scripts', cross site and traversal attacks, hackers jargon, and all the related issues..... then buy 'Hacking Web Applications Exposed' by Scambray and Shema. Excellent book too, and excellent authors. But beware, it is not for newbies. You MUST have a lot of background to fully understand the attacks.<P>Now, what about an easier generic book, covering the same issues as the others but in a step by step and kinder way.? A book to start from zero, but leading to understand all the currently related themes. Well, if this is what you want, then 'Web Hacking' is your book. It covers all that need to be covered in this area. In an easy and well structured way. The reading is very light and the authors 'break down' of the matter, makes the contents very intuitive.<P>The book is structured into four main sections (covering the same areas as the previously referred books) :<P>** The E-commerce Playground <BR>** URLs Unraveled<BR>** How Do They Do It?<BR>** Advanced Web Kung Fu<P>It includes also, several interesting appendixes (specially useful the 'cheat sheet' appendix).<P>A lot of simple case studies (of the kind 'Bob and Alice') are presented as well as some more technical analyses (Code Red, Nimda etc.)<P>If I were to select a book as a reference for a first course on web security, 'Web Hacking' would be my choise. Definitively.</span>

                    <span>Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense is quite similar to 'Hacking Exposed Web Applications' by Joel Scambray & Mike Shema. <P>Both Hacking Exposed Web Applications and Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense will clearly open one's eyes to the risks of web hacking. Forgetting for a minute the myriad vulnerabilities that effect many software products (including Windows, Apache, ColdFusion, and more), both books show how poorly written software, and misconfigured web servers make the penetration of web servers child's play.<P>Both books provide step-by-step instructions in a easy to read style for hardening web servers against attack. For those that have read previous and are comfortable with books in the Hacking Exposed serious, Hacking Exposed Web Applications uses the same easy to read and well organized style. Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense has almost the same amount of content, but is written in a slightly more technical manner. <P>Both books clearly explain how hackers gather information, acquire targets, gain control, and afterwards cover their track. Anyone interested in ensuring their web servers are secured should definitely read these books. <P>Both books have a lot of value even for those who are not so security conscious. For those with an interest in security, one's eyes will be open to the myriad places where vulnerabilities lie, from software, to scripts, mark-up files, and more. Anyone concerned with web server security should definitely read these books, or at least ensure their system administrators do.</span>

                    <span>This no-fluff book weighs in at just under 500 pages that are guaranteed to quell any feelings of complacency you may have about the safety of your website. One of the gnawing concerns I live with is that my website will be hacked. I can't say this book made me feel better about that fear, but it brought to light a number of things to talk to my people about. Using real-world examples, it explains the kinds of openings hackers look for, and the ways they exploit those openings to do their damage. In some senses, this book is not just a warning, it is also a how-to for Internet security. <P>The general premise of this book is that no one is safe from attack, and if you're not already a victim, that's only a matter your good luck so far. Read this book. Study it carefully. Keep it on the nearest, most convenient bookshelf. New kinds of attacks are being developed all the time. But this book will prepare you for what's out there so far, and give you some insight into the kinds of things to watch for in the future.</span>

                    <span>"Web Hacking: Attacks and Defenses" is a book the shows how, and in some cases why, web platforms are compromised. In addition to explaining common methods to victimize web systems, the authors provide a basic background on web technologies. Combined with integrated case studies, "Web Hacking" stands as a strong introduction to the art and science of attacking web platforms.<BR> <BR>"Web Hacking" offered several appealing aspects, and several disappointing drawbacks. On the positive side, I found the numerous tables very helpful. These included lists of ISAPI filters, MS SQL stored procedures, form elements, and other web technology items. The authors also share their methodology for assessing web platforms, simulating their checklists and evaluation matrices. The appendices were appreciated as well.<BR> <BR>On the negative side, "Web Hacking" suffers from subtle typos. This can be beyond the authors' control, but annoying nevertheless. For example, 0x11111111 is 255 decimal, not 256 as shown on page 371. More troubling was the authors' repeated criticisms of network based intrusion detection systems. While NIDS are not perfect, they do serve purposes the authors don't seem to appreciate. Encryption may prevent NIDS from collecting the content of a session, but what if we only care to collect transactional data summarizing that session?<BR> <BR>Incidentally, Barnaby Jack's work on the buffer overflow section (chapter 14) was worth reading. Overall, "Web Hacking" belongs on your bookshelf, although many may find "Hacking Exposed: Web Applications" to be more comprehensive.</span>
