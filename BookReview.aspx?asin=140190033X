                    <span>I really liked Dr. Wayne dyers 101 ways CD but this CD collection is out of focus. After spending 6 hours on this CD , I could not figure out his message !!.. 
<br />It seems Dr. Wayne forgot that readers/listeners should get some advise when they hear this. He gave many examples and cases but some of them are really weak examples and weird and not upto his point at all. 
<br />Dr.Wayne , We love your CD's but this collection is waste of money..

                    <span>...But there's a reason these CD's are so inexpensive.  In the set that I received two of the CD's were mis-labeled.  The labels on the CD's: "How to Get What You Really, Really, Really, Really Want" and "Improve Your Life Using The Wisdom of the Ages" were reversed.  It didn't really make any difference, but this is perhaps the reason these CD's are so [inexpensive].<p>Aside from that minor inconvenience, this CD program is fantastic!  You won't find everything that is in his books on the CD's, but they're great for getting an overview of his books and his philosophy for living.  I enjoyed listening to them on a recent cruise and found them to be inspiring and life-changing.  I continue to listen to them in my car and at home on occasion.  I also have loaned them out to friends and business associates who are too busy to read the books but have enjoyed listening to them on flights or between appointments in their car. <p>While some of the material is redundant between the 4 CD's, I find that I gain a new insight each time I hear his antecdotes. If you have enjoyed his books, this is a no brainer and the price is right!</span>
