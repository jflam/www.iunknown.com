                <span id="Label1">Everyone has heard about animals that are now extinct. But author Bradley Trevor Greive wants everyone to learn about animals that can be saved?and then to do something about it.In inspiring narrative and striking photographs of everything from humpback whales to pigmy possums to African spoonbills, Greive and wildlife photographer Mitsuaki Iwago spell out Earth?s diverse animal inventory. They highlight species that once were plentiful but now are scarce?some that are now sadly extinct?and point out specific dangers that other animals face.The authors also present a call to action: ?To preserve our home and the priceless creatures that dwell within it you need only see the world as it is and have a vision of how it could be.? Priceless is a must-have book for everyone interested in the environment, biodiversity, and in all life on Earth</span>

                    <span>Reading through Priceless is a bittersweet experience. It is a joy to look at the wonderful photography of Mitsuaki Iwago, and also a joy to learn amazing facts about some of these animals and to detect the passion for conservation and wildlife protection in author Bradley Trevor Greive's text. But there is a sadness: we learn how difficult it is for most species to adapt to the vast changes made by humans to this planet, so difficult that many of them could not do it, and no longer exist.<P>We learn that "even polar bears from the Arctic Circle and penguins from Antarctica, creatures from the two most isolated and pure economic systems on earth, have a substantial build-up of toxic industrial chemicals stored in their fat deposits"; we learn that the first bomb dropped on Berlin during the Second World War killed the only elephant in the Berlin zoo; that the last passenger pigeon in existence died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. The most important lesson from the book, however, is that if we don't do something soon to stop poisoning our world, ultimately us humans will be the ones suffering.<P>But the book ends with a message of hope, telling us that there are ways we can make a difference and giving suggestions of things we can do. Greive finally pays tribute to Gerald Durrell, celebrated zoologist, conservationist and author. The last 25 pages give information and facts about all the animals featured in the photographs throughout the book.<P>I strongly feel that if everyone read through this book, they would appreciate their planet a little more and want to help things change for the better. If I could afford to do so I would give it to everyone I know. It is very easy to read, the text on each page limited to a few sentences which apply to the photographs. The photos range from light-hearted and whimsical to completely awe-inspiring. The perfect gift for animal lovers and environmentalists, but I urge everyone to take a look. It is an inspiring experience.</span>
