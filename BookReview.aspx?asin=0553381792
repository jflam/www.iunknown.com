                <span id="Label1">From David L. Robbins, bestselling author of <b>The End of War</b> and <b>War of the Rats,</b> comes a novel of searing intensity and uncompromising vision. Part mystery, part legal thriller, it is a story of crime and punishment set in a small southern town during one brutal, hot, and unforgiving summer that lays bare the potential of the human heart to hate&#8211;and, ultimately, to heal. <br><br><b>Scorched Earth<br></b><br>The inhabitants of Good Hope, Virginia, haven&#8217;t felt the cooling effects of rain in weeks. The crops are withering. The ground is parched. There is no relief in sight. With the town a tinderbox waiting to explode, all it takes is a spark to ignite all the prejudice, the rage, and the secrets that are so carefully kept hidden. And then, in the midst of the terrible heat, a tragedy occurs. A baby is born and dies in her mother&#8217;s arms. The child, Nora Carol, is buried quickly and quietly the next day in a church graveyard. It should have ended right there&#8211;but it didn&#8217;t, for Nora Carol is of mixed race.<br><br>The white deacons of Good Hope&#8217;s Victory Baptist Church, trying to protect the centuries-old traditions of their cemetery, have the body exhumed. That night the church is set ablaze, and the sole witness is the only suspect&#8211;Elijah Waddell, Nora Carol&#8217;s father.<br><br>Nat Deeds, a former prosecutor and an exile of Good Hope, is pressed into service as Elijah&#8217;s attorney. With a politically savvy prosecutor and a vindictive sheriff aligned against him, Nat knows it will be nearly impossible to get Elijah acquitted. But Elijah refuses to accept a plea.<br><br>As the evidence mounts, Nat begins to suspect there is something his client isn&#8217;t telling him, and the next revelation turns Good Hope into a powder keg: a body is found in the ashes of the church. Now Elijah is accused of murder, and the case is no longer a matter of winning or losing, but of life or death.<br><br>The only way Nat can save his client is to scratch and claw for any shred of evidence, even if he has to bend the law to find it. As the summer heat intensifies and passions reach their boiling point, Nat must navigate through the incendiary secrets kept by friends and neighbors, by the guilty and the innocent, to an act of justice that has nothing to do with the law.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></span>

                    <span>The venue for SCORCHED EARTH is Good Hope, Virginia, where blue-collar mill workers Elijah and Clara Waddell endure the anguish of parenting a deformed baby girl, Nora, an infant so handicapped that she dies in her mother's arms in the hospital delivery suite. The child is quickly put to rest in the cemetery of the Victory Baptist Church in the plot of Clara's maternal family line. But, there's a problem. For over two-hundred years, the congregation has been exclusively white. Nora is of mixed race, Elijah being Black and Clara Caucasian. Victory Baptist's thirteen deacon's subsequently vote, over the objections of the young pastor, the spiritually tortured Thomas Derby, to have the child exhumed and re-buried in the cemetery of the town's Baptist church for Blacks. The night after the exhumation, Victory Baptist is burned to the ground, and Elijah is arrested on-site for arson. Nat Deeds, a former county prosecutor who quit his job and fled Good Hope after his wife admitted to sleeping with another man, and who's now struggling to set up a private law practice in nearby Richmond, is pressured by the presiding judge to return to his birthplace and defend Elijah, who adamantly insists on his innocence. Deeds must now go up against his old boss, the posturing Ed Fentress, who's prosecuting for the commonwealth with the next election in mind. Nat hasn't a shred of a case, and it gets worse when the body of Amanda Talley, the teenage daughter of the county sheriff, is found in the burned rubble of the church. Amanda had apparently been raped, then burned in the fire.<P>I believed Elijah when he claimed to be innocent. Indeed, I immediately knew who did it. And, for a few pages near the end, it appeared I was right. Pretty darn smug I was, too. At that point, I would've extolled SCORCHED EARTH not as a mystery, but as story of three childhood acquaintances - Deeds, Derby, and Talley - grappling with personal demons. But a final plot twist at the end caught me completely broadside and made me feel the fool. I guess I should read more.<P>Robbin's has a flair for descriptive writing and an understanding of humanity. As an example:<P>"Mayhem is the by-product of civilization ... It's the effluent of good intentions, loyalties, contracts, desires, and love ... The quietest of us, the simplest of us ... is a keg. A fuse burns inside everyone. What is different in each man and woman is only the length of the fuse." <P>Robbins has previously written two superb novels of World War Two: WAR OF THE RATS and THE END OF WAR. Focusing on a vastly different milieu, SCORCHED EARTH is as good, or better, as anything John Grisham has written about local politics, race, and justice in the Old South. I can't recommend this book too highly.</span>

                    <span>A friend recommended this book, or I never would have discovered it. I'm so glad I did. A bi-racial baby dies ten minutes after her birth, and she is buried in the cemetary of the white church, which her mother's family has attended for generations. The deacons of the church decide to exhume her body and have the family bury her in the black cemetary down the road. That night the white church burns under mysterious circumstances. Did Elijah, the black father, burn it--along with the young woman inside? The rest of the book is a legal battle to determine who<BR>the arsonist/murderer really is. The book was fascinating, and the writing was poetic at times. There were unexpected twists and turns to the ending. It is exactly the kind of book that makes a very satisfying read for me.</span>

                    <span>while at times a bit overwrought, this is a superbly written novel that climaxes nicely. the characters are well developed and you find yourself caring for their outcomes. while I guessed the ending early on, I often thought I had guessed wrongly and only in the end did I find that I had guessed correctly.<P>a good read, although sometimes it takes awhile to get to the dialogue.</span>

                    <span>Everyone in the county seemed to like Clare and Elijah Waddell, or at least treat them politely; but when the interracial couple's infant is buried in the all-white Victory Baptist Church cemetery, seemingly good people react out of hate. In the story that follows, David L. Robbins weaves an intricate tale of intrigue that I found so difficult to put down that I read all 300+ pages in two sittings. Robbins manages to paint such a descriptive picture of the town and it's people that the reader feels like a part of the story; yet the story moves quickly and every word holds the reader's attention.<P>This is the first book I have read by Robbins but it will certainly not be the last!</span>

                    <span>When you start this book, you know it is going to be well written, but you sure don't know how it is going to turn out. Robbins mixes race - a mixed race couple - with crime, a sympathetic lawyer, forensic science, a troubled priest and small town politics - sexual and other. It is more than a "legal thriller;" it's the story of people caught in their peculiar enviornment in a time of crisis and how they react. I really enjoyed the book, and there's an interesting legal twist at the end. Read it.</span>
