                <span id="Label1"><div><i>Making Documentary Films and Reality Videos </i>is the perfect text for students of filmmaking who would like to make a documentary. Barry Hampe, who has made more than 150 documentary films and videos, traces the two main approaches to documentary--recording behavior and re-creating past events&#8212;and shows students how to do both effectively. Covering all the steps, from conceptualization to completion, the book includes chapters on visual evidence; documentary ethics; why reality is not enough; budgeting; and casting, crew, and equipment selection.<br></div></span>

                    <span><P>In this book, Barry Hampe provides great advice, helpful concepts, and breaks down the documentary process into digestable servings. The book is divided into four sections: 1. An introduction to the concepts and guidelines of the Documentary genre 2. Preproduction 3. Production 4. Postproduction. Barry Hampe fills in the pages with experience, knowledge, and writes in a manner combining the ideas he discusses with pithy examples and stories which he uses to drive his points home. The book has a generous layout, placing information thoughtfully and easily into the reader. Included in the book is a wonderful filmography (including refrence info on where to find and order the documentaries listed), a well rounded bibliography, and even directions to join the International Documentary Association. <P>I used this book as my introduction to documentary production, because though it is based on Hampe's work specifically with behavioral documentary, the information is easily transferable to any documentary/reality video project. The book stresses concepts in creating a form of reality through visual medium, called verisimilitude, and Barry Hampe demonstrates very carefully the indepth process in which an audience recieves the final cut out of what was originially a simple idea. If Barry Hampe can communicate his ideas so clearly in writing this book, I imagine his documentaries must be stunning.</span>

                    <span>I came upon this book after making 23 drama videos for autistic teenagers. Recently we looked at producing a day-in-the-life type documentary with cutaways of professionals commenting on the activities. I honestly found this book to be a mine of information. Almost any question I found myself raising was addressed in some form in this book. Consequently structuring the doucmentary in terms of narrative, visual arrangement, verisimilitude, camera and sound has become clearer. <P>I would have liked the chapters on the Documentary Idea and Writing the Documentary to be longer. Personally, I would have benefited more from extending the discussions here. Also the author tends to drive the book along at a fiercely anecdotal rate which is great if you can imagine yourself in the author's shoes, but may not suit everyone's style.<P>Overall I found this to be a most useful manual and certainly find myself returning to it for advice. What better recommendation can I offer?</span>

                    <span>Anyone with romantic notions of filmmaking will be brought back to reality with this book. Barry explains, in no uncertain terms, the ins and outs, the nuts and bolts and the day-to-day reality of filmmaking. His understanding comes from the broad perspective of a film student, professional, festival judge and mentor. He covers the gamut of what to expect of yourself and the process of creating a finished product that an audience other than your family will appreciate. His wisdom and pragmatism is refreshing and realistic. Anyone thinking of venturing into this highly competive world would be well served by reading this book. It will help you decide if you have the vision, patience, flexibility and fortitude to venture forward. If nothing else, it will help you appreciate the dedication and artistry that went into the next documentary you see.</span>

                    <span>I'm about to begin my first documentary film project and though I'm working with a skilled filmmaker I need all the help I can get. <P>In preparation I read, "Making Documentary Films and Reality Videos" by Barry Hampe. This book covers A-Z regarding documentary filmmaking and to boot, it's a great read! Within the first few pages, my thoughts on how documentary film is made were quashed and replaced with new and correct information. Mr. Hampe draws from personal experiences which are cited throughout, and this makes the book read a bit like a story, not so much like a dry textbook. I zipped right through it, learned a tremendous amount, and have pages marked for future reference. Thank you Mr. Hampe!</span>
