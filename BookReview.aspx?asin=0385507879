                <span id="Label1">Something strange happened to the Enron Corporation in the early 1990s: It went from a company that traded in tangible goods to one that dealt in pure abstractions, with shoddy accounting practices, astonishing compensation packages, and smoke and mirrors to obfuscate this new reality.<p>  Company auditors, Sherron Watkins among them, warned top Enron execs from CEO Kenneth Lay on down that the company&#146;s increasing reliance on cooked books and phony reports "will implode in a wave of accounting scandals." As anyone who played the stock market or watched Enron suits do the perp walk on the evening news a couple of years ago will remember, that&#146;s exactly what happened. <I>Texas Monthly</I> editor Swarz and Watkins team up to offer this account, rich in anecdote and numbers alike, of what went wrong and who made it so. Though even-handed throughout, they serve up plenty of righteous scorn for the corporate leaders who enriched themselves as the company disintegrated, and for the name-brand politicians who abetted them.<p>  Though Osama bin Laden&#146;s pawns barely dented the U.S. economy, observes Alex Berenson in <I>The Number</I>, Lay and his lieutenants brought it to its knees. Swartz&#146;s and Watkins&#146;s eye-opening account will rekindle new indignation over unpunished crimes and well-rewarded hubris, and it ought to be required reading in business schools henceforth. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    <span>Imagine the life of Sherron Watkins: a posh job with one of the most successful energy companies in the world, all of the amenities that come with wining-and-dining important contacts while negotiating deals worth millions --- and a nagging suspicion that something within the company you're working for isn't quite right. There were thousands of Enron employees, all with the same upward mobility and satisfying salaries that Sherron Watkins possessed. So what set Watkins apart from them? It was the fact that she was willing to risk sacrificing it all to expose the corrupt practices that had made Enron so profitable.<P>In POWER FAILURE, the entire history of Enron is explored, from its inception in 1985 to its demise in 2001. Written by Mimi Swartz with assistance from whistle-blower Sherron Watkins, this book will take the reader on a journey that includes Enron's earliest successes and failures, the super-charged management conferences, the politically incorrect Enron trading floors and the Senate Hearing Room's investigation and subsequent trial.<P>But POWER FAILURE is much more than just an expose on a corrupt corporation. It also provides a frightening view on what the big-business atmosphere has become. The story of Enron shows how delicate the balance of politics, money and business practices is, and how thin the line between legal and illegal can be.<P>Swartz and Watkins effectively tell the story of Enron without a hint of tabloid exploitation. And with all the exploitations that occurred within Enron, that's nothing short of a miracle. They give an accurate, honest perspective on all of the events that took place in the history of the corporation and portray the characters of Enron without bias. That's not to say that there's no negative statements made about people throughout the book --- just that they're given in a diplomatic manner. The book is written in an informative yet entertaining manner, complete with entertaining sidebars and humorous anecdotes to keep the reader's attention. And they have included plenty of pictures to point out just who the evildoers are. This is a must read for business people, tax evaders, anyone who plans to cheat the system, or the average Joe who wants to know what really happened at Enron.<P> --- Reviewed by Melissa Brown</span>

                    <span>April 23, 2003<BR>I'm just finished 'Power Failure' the inside story of Enron's failure. The book is by Mimi Swartz and Sherron Watkins of Enron fame. It is a very well written and entertaining: I was pleasantly surprised. Sherron was a key part in the rise and later fall of 'Enron'.<P>Sherron actually ran some of the 'Off-Balance-Sheet' for Andy Fastnow. The book brought up lots pertinent history of 'Corporate America's' use of 'Off-Balance-Sheet' stuff and other revenue recognition policies and how the accounting firms aided and abetted. The book gave rise to one important question, how was it able to happen: it's evident that there is more fraud to be discovered. <P>It's my opinion that this book will be included in the other now famous period pieces like: 'Where are the Customers' Yachts?' By Fred Schwed, 'The Great Crash' by John Kenneth Galbraith and<BR>'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator' by Edwin Lefevre <P>What happened at Enron reminds me of a 'Tom Clancy 'book, lots of movement and bad people.</span>

                    <span>Ken Lay was the product of a very religious background in a small Midwestern town. During work on his PhD in economics, he became enamored of the world of stocks. He parlayed InterNorth, a small energy company into Enron. He was a rich man, having made $4 million in stock value increases from the merger of Houston Gas into InterNorth, later renamed Enron. He was also the highest paid CEO in the United States. The company's strengths were also its weakness: the constant risk-taking; the high debt load to ward off potential takeovers; "impassioned embrace of deregulation;" constant reorganization; and instant adoption of the hottest new business ideas. They were soon struggling for cash.<P>	In the meantime, Lay had created a new culture at Enron. It was his belief that all one had to do was hire the best and the brightest, provide a free environment, and things would take care of themselves. He also had trouble saying no to anyone. He hired an old friend to be the "bad guy," but it soon became apparent to all that if you made money for the company you could get whatever you wanted. <P>	Watkins was hailed in 2001, following the collapse of Enron, as a heroine for her "whistle-blowing." Whether her actions actually constitute that appellation is open to question. Certainly she was an insider, and her account reveals a great deal more of the financial shenanigans in greater detail than the previous book I reviewed, Anatomy of Greed. She interacted constantly with Lay, Skilling and Fastow, and if she got really nervous about what she was seeing, perhaps whistle-blowing was just a way of protecting her posterior. <P>	What started out as a new paradigm, a different way of delivering energy, soon became a case of the blind leading the blind, or a corporate version of Dumb and Dumber, as the board and Enron employees began creating numerous new ways of hiding losses, even making losses look like revenue. It was a huge, ever-increasing house of cards.<P>	Watkins is an accountant and naturally had a strong sense of the financial improprieties the company had embarked upon, but the impending doom she warned of in her now-famous memo to Lay should have been obvious to everyone. Enron's own head of research said presciently, "Every era gets the clowns it deserves." <P>	If they ever make a movie of this book, it will have to be a comedy. It is astonishing how stupid many of the "best and brightest" graduates of American business schools were, as they bellied up to the trough of corporate greed. Sherron made an attempt to meet with Ken Lay, but first she had to convince his personal secretary to arrange a meeting. The secretary informed Watkins that "Ken gravitates toward good news. . . ." It did not bode well for the meeting. Another insider told her to make the presentation as simple as possible and eliminate any accounting jargon. She obliged and reworked her presentation so that her two-year-old daughter could understand it. The meeting was a flop, and it was clear to her that Lay could not understand - or perhaps did not want to understand - a thing she was talking about. <P>	Ironically, Osama Bin Laden's exploits barely dented the US economy. Lay's machinations and the subsequent stock free fall provided a vicious slambang.</span>

Nothing new, which is disappointing given her immunity from prosecution, and too long in coming. Technically proficient ghost writer.</span>
