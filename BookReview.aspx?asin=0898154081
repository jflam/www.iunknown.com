                    <span>Creativity is what we need more of in the 21st Century. It is hard to break out of the rut of habitual, conventional thinking. That is why I recommend reading and re-reading and working with the techniques in this amazing book to get the ideas you need. It will change the way you think.</span>

                    <span>Since reading Thinkertoys my life has changed. Creative thinking has become a challenge to be welcomed rather than a tedious task to be avoided.<p>At any time, I am able to access principles which produce successful cognative strategies. Making one's way through Mr. Michalko's varied topics and exercises affords a fascinating journey. Part of the fun lies in the author's judicious choice of illustrative examples. Expanding one's ability to think creatively is a talent anyone can acquire. Read this remarkable book.<p>Note that the first letter of each of the above sentences combine to spell SCAMPER. This has become my favorite blueprint. It could be yours also.</span>

                    <span>This book is a treasure. I was depressed and defeated at work until I read this book. It seems that most people spend their time trying to figure out why things don't work and why things can't be done. Michalko turns that around with his creative-thinking techniques. Now, for the first time in a long time, I find it a joy to go to work and look for creative ways to get things done and make things work.</span>

                    <span>I find myself picking up this book when I need a creative kick start -- as a small business owner, it helps me shake things up and think outside the ordinary.<p>It's not magic, as some of the reviews seem to imply.  But if you read it with an open mind, it will definitely help you develop a better sense of business creativity.</span>

                    <span>Here's a nice bag of tricks for folks with thick heads. It reminds me of those late-1990s computer magazines, full of tips that aren't sophisticated enough for folks who know something about computers, but aren't likely to be employed by folks who are computer phobic.<p>Michalko's offerings might help you think things through. But if you're a deep thinker, you won't need it. And if you aren't, you may miss some of the subtle import.<p>Still, if you're stuck, y'gotta start somewhere...</span>
