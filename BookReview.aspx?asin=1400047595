                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Read twice - cover to cover, and have picked up several great tips.  I've enjoyed better performance and organization based on having incorporated a few changes recommended in this book into my day.  Great book!  Worth the money.</span>

                    <span>I found 'Organized for Success' very helpful, even though I work out of my home and do not aspire to be a CEO.  The concept of 'spotlighting' runs counter to the current emphasis on multi-tasking, yet it makes a lot of sense.  I also particularly liked the presentation of different people's styles of organization.  I perpetually search for the best way to organize my materials and time.  With the various examples and their framing, I think I have, in fact, discovered my personal style.  (Time will tell.)  I, also, actually enjoyed reading the book.  Organizing may seem dull to many people.  Ms. Winston's style was both relaxed and informative.</span>

                    <span>Overall, a disappointing book with very little original material and with really only 2 well supported principles: (1) Get an assistant to do most of your organizing and (2) How you organize depends on your own personal style. The author's material on how to use an assistant to implement organization principles may be of value to those who actually have one, but very little of it is applicable to those who don't. And the book jumps all over the place in recommending tips and tricks, so I did not find any convergence to very many "principles." I agree, organization can be very personal, but the author seems to try to capture so many individual techniques, that to say there are organizing principles here is very much a stretch.
<br />
<br />If you really are serious about some good solid principles with beginning to end techniques to organization, I would recommend David Allen's book Getting Things Done. If you simply want a cursory overview of many existing organizing tips and tricks, than half this book may be of value. And if you do indeed have an assistant and want to utilize him/her better, then the other half is for you. Otherwise, little or nothing new here to read.
