                    <span>I would agree with all previous reviews that this book is a must-have for all trekkers heading to the Everest region. I used it myself quite extensively on my trek there in May 2001, and it was most useful. The only thing I can add is that not only does it have very detailed maps and practical advice for the trekker, but it is also very compact and leightweight, which is very important if you are going to heights of more than 5,000m! The books' binding is sturdy and paper quite thick, which is good for backpacking (it will not fall apart after a week of trekking). I think this book is the best buy.</span>

                    <span>Before my trip to Nepal I ended up purchasing almost every english book on Nepal I could find. The Bezruchka book is definitely the bible on Nepal but is very large and doesn't have specifics about the Everest region. This book by Jamie Mc Guinness is very up-to-date and has great trail and village maps which are very accurate. There are suggested itineraries which are very nice but the format is easy to follow on the trail in case you decide to go on your own route. The suggested day hikes for acclimitisation days were very good too.</span>

                    <span>This book is far better than any of the general trekking in Nepal books if you are heading to the Everest region. The itineraries are great. The maps are very helpful and the directions completely eliminate the need for a guide. If you are planning on heading to the Everest area, this is a must have.</span>

                    <span>Trekking in the Everest Region is an outstanding guide to the area. It completely obviates the need for a guide on the Everest Base Camp trek. The maps are outstanding, and the itineraries are better than the ones given by Lonely Planet. Can't say enough about it</span>
