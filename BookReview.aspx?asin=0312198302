                    <span>Here's a book that's great for experienced as well as new kissers. Anyone who cares about the romantic aspect of kissing will love it. The best thing about the book is that William Cane tells you how to do thirty different types of kisses. Most readers probably only know the french kiss so they'll learn a lot of new kissing techniques. The other benefit of the book is that it answers every question you could think of and is the most detailed treatment of the french kiss in print. After reading it you'll enjoy kissing more. Some other reviewers obviously didn't get the humor in the book but there's plenty of it, which is another big plus. A must read!</span>

                    <span>This book is very childish and the author often forgets that he's suppose to give us information on kissing. Sometimes, he just goes off into wild romance-style passages. I didn't buy the book for that. I want info, info and more info. There are some things that are interesting, but the author seems to have little to offer himself. He shares very little of his own experiences and constantly quotes anonymous school-girls throughout the lamo-book. I don't hate the book, it's just not informative enouph. The author constantly seems to take the woman's side in most issues. What I hated most about this book was that if your ever in a jam with something, lie to get out of it. What happened to honesty? If your going to be in a relationship and be a phony then you may as well not be in one.</span>
