<br />
<br />Some people claim it a rule of nature that we humans are naturally lazy when it comes to cleaning, organizing, and simply putting things away where they belong. Well, I for one choose to think I am too busy for all of the above, especially when it comes to my computer. The only time we give our computers a concern is when they become sluggish and crash. Many of us tend to hoard all the junk we think we cannot do without taking up valuable space on the hard drive. After a while we face the decision of either calling the computer tech for a in-home-expensive service call, head out and buy that costly new machine, or we reformat and pray that we have all the original discs and that we save all important files properly. 
<br />
<br />Wait, it really is not all that drastic. There is help and it is contained between the covers of this new computer-self-help book with a basic 12-step process that shows you how to completely cleanup your computer's hard drive and making it run like a new machine. Although the authors "highly recommend that you complete all of the main Degunking tasks in the order they are presented" you do not have to tackle them all at once.
<br />
<br />In fact, if you are short on time you can do this process in small amounts. The first thing I did after reading this book is to reorganize all my files into a more manageable system. Instead of completing the 12 steps at one sitting the book offers Ten-Minute, Thirty-Minute, One-Hour, Three-Hour, to a Half-Day Degunking sessions that help you clean up your computer at a pace that suits your lifestyle. Whichever timeframe you choose you will most certainly see the progress immediately as your computer becomes organized and more manageable. Thus, it will run faster and problem free. In just a few hours you will speed up your computer, secure it from "dangerous hackers", and have it run as a well organized machine, functioning like a new computer, only it will be a more effective and secure system.
<br />
<br />This book is very easy to use, written in a language that everyone will follow along easily, but its expert assistance will easily guide you through the technical processes of fine-tuning your computer. With extensive sidebar help and tons of amazing screen shots you can see how easy this process really is once you begin. This book not only shows you the how to fix problems, but it easily explains why the problems got there in the first place, thus helping you become aware for the next time. There is also a troubleshooting section guiding you through the common problems; you will see just how easy it is to correct them. This book is a must have for all home computer users.</span>

                    <span>Degunking Windows is about cleaning up a PC from the inside out - deleting unnecessary files, uninstalling extraneous programs, scrubbing the registry, organizing desktop items, cleaning up and organizing email and attachments, optimizing and tweaking software settings, and removing spyware. The emphasis is on regaining control of your PC and keeping Windows and your applications lean and smooth.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book for people who are looking for a "good housekeeping" approach to taking care of their computers. The fact that the book explains WHY you should do many things makes it easy to apply to everyday activities.</span>

                    <span>I have been a computer tech, a systems and network admin, and computer builder.  This books took all of my years of experience and condensed it down to easy to follow instructions with pictures and even showed me a bunch of things about Windows that I never knew.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to fix there come computer because it is bogged down with spy ware and ad ware, or some one who reallys wants to learn the secrets they never tell you about Windows.  This books shows the options that you can't get to with any icons and micro$oft doesn't want you to know about.</span>

                    <span>Once it got going, my computer ran pretty well. But booting up got to be so long, I would turn on the computer before I took my morning shower, so it'd be ready for checking my email whenever I got out. A couple of years of installing and uninstalling various whatevers had "gunked" up my computer.
<br />
<br />So to get my computer back to its out-of-the-box speed, I knew that I was going to have to search through the nooks and crannies of my computer, clearing the cobwebs behind the closets of my little information nook, and blowing the dust off piles of folders and files. But where to start? And how could I be sure not to delete something that would cause a catastrophic meltdown (like my wife did with our first computer back in 2001)?
<br />
<br />Luckily, the library had a copy of Degunking Windows. The first page outlines a 12 step program for cleaning up your computer. Although it has a couple quick fixes that can be done anytime, I decided to follow the book's 12 step program, since I had the better part of an afternoon to kill and I have never done a 12 step program before.
<br />
<br />Following the book's directions, I discovered hundreds of .jpg files that I didn't need anymore, and that didn't even include my digital camera pictures. Where did all these .zip folders come from? The books even tells you about more obscure files like dump files (.dmp). 
<br />
<br />I tried to uninstall all those programs I never use. Even though I had uninstalled the evil KaZaa many moons ago, I knew there were remants of it festering on my hard drive. KaZaa was like a bloated tick. You could remove it's body, but the head was still under the skin, waiting to get infected. One thing that was slowing down my boot-up was some KaZaa remnant trying to load something that wasn't there from start up. Degunking Windows showed me how to find and remove it.
<br />
<br />Then I cleaned up the system tray. I whittled down something like 10 items to now two items. Next up is the registry. Yee-haw!
<br />
<br />I'm only halfway through the book and my boot up is significantly faster. You can practically eat off my destop now. Sweet ergonomics! I haven't even defragged yet.
<br />
<br />I guess I should mention that the book is specifically targeted toward users of Windows XP, although some of the suggestions are globally applicable.

                    <span>The main focus of my site is security- not Windows maintenance. I tend to spend most of my time examining new ways to protect and safeguard my computer, not clean it up. However, perhaps because I install and uninstall software frequently to test it out and surf the Web an inordinate amount of time doing research, my computer becomes cluttered and fragmented faster than most and the information found in Degunking Windows is exactly what the doctor ordered. 
<br />
<br />If you follow the default Windows installation you may already be starting out with a significant number of applications and utilities that you will never use taking up hard drive space and possibly memory and processor resources. As you surf the Web your computer caches information in Temporary Internet Files which can take a significant amount of drive real estate if not kept in check. As you use programs data that in theory belongs together is actually written to random areas scattered about the hard drive. Over time this file fragmentation can slow your computer down and cause excessive wear and tear on your hard drive. 
<br />
<br />Joli Ballew and Jeff Duntemann do an excellent job of helping you to find the things that are slowing down and cluttering up your system. They explain in plain-English what you need to know to remove unwanted programs and optimize your Windows machine for maximum performance. Keep the book handy because you will need to go through this cleanup periodically- maybe a couple times a year.
