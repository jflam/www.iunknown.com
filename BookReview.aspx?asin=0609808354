<br />               Book Review: The Life, Death, And Afterlife of Notorious Of Big
<br />                                      
<br />                                          By: Cheo Hodon Coker

<br /> 
<br />
<br />      The Notorious B.I.G. aka "Biggie" has left the rap game in body, but his music lives 
<br />
<br />on.  Unbelievable; The life, death, and afterlife of The Notorious Big which was written 
<br />
<br />By: Cheo Hodon Coker.  I gave it a five star rating; because it gave a better 
<br />
<br />understanding of Biggie problems and emotion that he faced on the streets of Brooklyn, 
<br />
<br />New York to the Hills of Hollywood, California.  Coker makes it clear that Biggie 
<br />
<br />conquered the music industry with his street rhythms to win number of awards.  Never 
<br />
<br />the less he come short to explain why when Biggie saw his wife Faith they did not talk to 
<br />
<br />each other for the last time.
<br />
<br />
<br />    The book was a good Biography of Notorious Big.  It rest; fill with a lot of street 
<br />
<br />talking just as know Biggie to talk on a day to day bases.  The book makes it seem as if 
<br />
<br />McPherson 2
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Biggie was the person telling the story that how good the book is.  It also explores a lot  
<br />
<br />of interesting issues that not many people are willing to talk about.  Biggie had attended 
<br />
<br />Catholic School and getting a lot of things from his mother, who was a teacher, young 
<br />
<br />Biggie did not have much to do.
<br />
<br />
<br />   By the age of 16 he had dropped out of High School and had become a crack dealer.  
<br />
<br />Coker often said in the book that biggie just wanted more. Sean Combs, a  Music 
<br />
<br />Producer, who pay Biggie money to stop selling crack. Biggie would not stop 
<br />
<br />because he had just had a baby and the music was not giving him the money he wanted 
<br />
<br />Combs one time had to went down south to get Biggie, because Biggie was down there 
<br />
<br />selling crack. Biggie often says that he did not think that he could make it in the rap 
<br />
<br />game. 
<br />   
<br />       Then come the war "East Coast" VS "West Coast", which the Media put a lot of 
<br />
<br />paper to the Fire and made it bigger.  It ended up with the death of Tupac death, and then 
<br />
<br />soon it would be Biggie turn. 
<br />
<br />   Over the entire book was a success I would recommend that people take out of there 
<br />
<br />busy life and read this book, most of all the rappers in the music busy now. It would also 
<br />
<br />help to stop the "Beefing" of rappers.

                    </div>
                    <span>A must read for anyone interested in the history of hip hop.  Before I read it, I had only heard of the Notorious B.I.G.  Now I feel as though I know him - personally.  <p>During the 90's, when gansta rap and the East coast vs. West coast fight broke out, I was too busy working on my Bachelor's and Master's degrees to pay much attention to anything else.<br>I had also heard of Suge Knight and Sean Combs, but only from newspaper reports.  Reading this book really filled in a lot of the details for me.  Suge Knight is portrayed in a postive light as really caring for his artists and seeing to it that they were treated right.  He became violent only when he thought that those artists were being taken advantage of, and that they (as well as he) were losing part of the money they were entitled to.  I had always wondered what had prompted this violent streak of his.  I remember the newspapers would only report the latest incidents, never try to explain them.  The book also explains what it is, in fact, that Sean Combs does.  I had always wondered: Is he a rapper? A producer? An executive?  And, how did he amass so much money?  Combs had always been a mystery to me.  To some extent, he still is, but the book goes a long way toward solving this riddle too.<p>This book explores many interesting puzzles like these and shows how intricate relationships within the hip hop community had become, even by the 90's.  Biggie Smalls is portrayed as a flawed yet sympathetic character.  At first, he's a child attending Catholic school in uniform, who feels different from all the others hanging out on the corner.  His mother is a teacher, he's fatherless, and while not rich, he's by no means poor.  His mother gets all the latest gear for him so he doesn't go out and get in trouble.  As he grows older, however, the lure of quick profits grows stronger, so that by the time he's 16, he's dropped out of school and become a full-time crack dealer.  The book wants us to believe this is so he can buy even more of the latest gear, and that he's never statisfied with what he's got.  I'm not sure that that's the whole story, but surely his life was never as bleak as what he depicted later in some of his songs.  One gets the feeling that somewhere along the line, something just isn't right - either with the world, or with Biggie.  Then, once Biggie becomes a rap star, he says in the book that he never expected to, that rapping was just a hobby and that the profession he had actually chosen was that of the crack dealer.  So, we're expected to believe that this rap star thing just happened as a fluke, and came just as much as a surprise to him as to the rest of the world.  Maybe all this is so, but if it isn't, the book makes no alternative explanations, nor even attempts to.  All we're left with, instead, is an incomplete portrayal of the man who would later become known as the Notorious BIG.  All in all, despite the inadequacies in the portrayal, one is still able to admire and respect the genius and charisma of this man.  This is both a tribute to the man and to the author.  It makes us aware that even legends have character pitfalls, yet we're still able to remember and love them for who they were.</span>

                    <span>I am so glad that I read this book. This book glorified Biggie as a everyday fella not a superstar. How good of a person he was and what he did for others including the ones that hated on him, which were many.<p>This book gave a first account on how he went for "ashy to classy" and how hard he tried to keep it once he found out that he really had talent for music rather than talent for selling crack.<p>What I didn't know, but really didn't surprise me was how much of a playa Biggie was. He had his wife Faith, Lil' Kim and Charlie Baltimore and I am going to say that it was more than that. It bugged me out him and Faith never even spoke to each other when the saw each other on the night he died. I guess it is true that you never know that last time you may see someone for good.<p>I love the loyalty of his true friends from St. James, mainly Lil' Cease. This book also showed you how grimey Lil' Kim really is. What devastated me that most was how his relationship between him and Tupac just crumbled over bullsh--, straight bullsh--.  If you ask me my opinion and this is just my opinion, I think Tupac what just in the wrong place at the wrong place, just like the rest of his situations. Now, don't get me wrong that's my boy too, he just makes bad judgements, just like Biggie staying out in Cali, like everything was cool.<p>Overall, this book was the best biography I ever read. It was straight up real, it made you feel as if Biggie was telling you the story of his life himself.<p>Later!!!</span>

                    <span>The greatest rapper of all time is one "Frank White".<br>Cheo Hadari Coker broke down The Life, Death and Afterlife of the Notorious B.I.G as we (the fans) wanted it. The book illustrates Biggie's life in greater detail than what other writers (who didn't even personally know him or even listened to rap) have written. <br>When Christopher Wallace stepped into the rap game,he saved the East Coast. He put balling to another level and he made dirty thugs wanna look classy and yet he maintained his street cred and represented Brooklyn to the fullest.<br>This is the book that will hopefully convert the Biggie haters - you know, the staunch Tupac supporters who think fake ass Tupac was the better rapper. Hopefully it will answer the questions that need to be answered about Who Biggie is, what made him and  what kind of a person he was to his friends, family and his neighborhood. <br>Plenty respect goes to the author for this magnificent story - The Story of The Greatest Rapper.</span>
