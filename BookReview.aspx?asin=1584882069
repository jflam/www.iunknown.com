                <span id="Label1">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), elliptic curve DSA, the secure hash algorithm&#133;these and other major advances made in recent years precipitated this comprehensive revision of the standard-setting text and reference, Cryptography: Theory and Practice. Now more tightly focused on the core areas, it contains many additional topics as well as thoroughly updated treatments of topics presented in the first edition. There is increased emphasis on general concepts, but the outstanding features that first made this a bestseller all remain, including its mathematical rigor, numerous examples, pseudocode descriptions of algorithms, and clear, precise explanations.Highlights of the Second Edition:"Explains the latest Federal Information Processing Standards, including the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1), and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"Uses substitution-permutation networks to introduce block cipher design and analysis concepts"Explains both linear and differential cryptanalysis"Presents the Random Oracle model for hash functions"Addresses semantic security of RSA and Optional Asymmetric Encryption Padding"Discusses Wiener's attack on low decryption exponent RSA Overwhelmingly popular and relied upon in its first edition, now, more than ever, Cryptography: Theory and Practice provides an introduction to the field ideal for upper-level students in both mathematics and computer science.More highlights of the Second Edition:"Provably secure signature schemes: Full Domain Hash"Universal hash families"Expanded treatment of message authentication codes"More discussions on elliptic curves"Lower bounds for the complexity of generic algorithms for the discrete logarithm problem"Expanded treatment of factoring algorithms"Security definitions for signature schemes</span>

                    <span>The first edition of this book was one of the few excellent text books on cryptography. It is now somewhat outdated, so a second updated edition was much anticipated. Indeed, the second edition does improve upon the first edition in many ways. There are lots of updates and new exercises. Its major shortcoming, however, is that important chapters such as random number bit generation and key agreement have been deleted and deferred to the second volume of the second edition (which, according to the preface, is a works in progress). I have used the first edition in a crypto course I teach, but will not use the second edition in future course offerings because of the missing coverage of important topics. Also, even when the second volume is published, it would be too expensive for students to purchase both volumes ...</span>

                    <span>This book is well suited for software developers, students, and research scientists alike. The first edition has proven to be an invaluable source of information on cryptology. The second edition covers a subset of the material from the first edition. However, the text has been revised, expanded, and new material has been added that covers more recent results in the field. A forthcomming companion book has been promised that will cover the remaining material (e.g., zero-knowledge proof systems). Readers that are interested in combinatorics should also consider picking up a copy of "Combinatorial Algorithms: Generation, Enumeration, and Search" by Stinson and Kreher.</span>

                    <span>As other people have pointed out, this is not a mathematics book, and it is not an algorithm (recipies) book. It could be a great book for people that are interested in learning these tools to actually use them, either in a research or product development context (something besides homework). Unfortunately, the number of typos, in key mathematical expressions AND PORTIONS OF THE EXPLANATIONS is staggering. Go to the author's web page and you will find that some chapters, like 4 for example, average more than one typo per page (and some of these 'typos' are full sentences, or math expressions that do not look like anything that is actually printed on the page). If you do not have that errata sheet handy, you will waste a lot of time trying to understand the text, or trying to solve the exercises. If you are trying to learn from this book, without attending a class and without the errata, you will simply give up. It is a real shame because it has all the makings of a great book.</span>

                    <span>This is the textbook for an undergraduate math course in cryptography in my school, so it was forced on me. The author does a good job introducing the theory and background math, but I would say there are not enough examples worked out to understand how it is used. For instance, Chapter 2 on information theory and entropy was difficult for me and the treatment in the book was too abstract, with just one example cryptosystem worked out. Other than that, it is pretty good, and some sections are particularly well-written (eg on block ciphers, AES, etc). Only 3 stars since it's much too expensive!(considering this is only volume 1 <2 is in the works, if not completed yet> - what a rip-off scheme.)</span>

                    <span>The philosophy underlying the previous edition stays the same. The presentation of concepts is rigorous but neither difficult nor trivial, suitable for readers with basic notions of linear algebra. Moreover, new material has been added.<P>Chapter 3, which deals with block ciphers and linear and differential cryptoanalysis, is very well-written. This is the best presentation of such a subject in few pages I have seen until now.<P>Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 have been significantly updated and expanded with concepts and techniques that are fundamental in order to understand current researches and state of knowledge in Cryptography (e.g., random oracle model, semantic security, new attacks against public key cryptosystems, an in-depth introduction to elliptic curve ...).<P>Compared to the previous edition, more emphasys has been given in some parts to security proofs (e.g, chapter 4), and several new exercises have been proposed at the end of each chapter.<BR> <BR>Other readers have pointed out that there are some typos (the author has made available an errata list on his home page) but I think that the value of the book is not reduced in any way.<P>In my opinion it is a great book for people who want to be introduced to problems, ideas, and techniques used in Cryptography.</span>
