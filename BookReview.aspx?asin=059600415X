                    <span>It's nearly impossible to memorize all the minutiae of regular expressions, especially over multiple language implementations.  Tony Stubblebine's book Regular Expression Pocket Reference by O'Reilly is a nice way to help you out without digging through endless pages.
<br />
<br />Chapter List:  About This Book; Introduction To Regexes And Pattern Matching; Perl 5.8; Java (java.util.regex); .NET And C#; Python; PCRE Lib; PHP; vi Editor; JavaScript; Shell Tools; Index
<br />
<br />Like most pocket references, this book is small (93 pages), but there's a lot of information packed into a small space.  Each implementation chapter covers the metacharacters and metasequences that are supported in the language's implementation of regular expressions.  This is followed by the language functions, examples of regular expressions, and a list of additional resources the reader can use to learn more about regular expressions in that language.  If you don't know anything about the subject, this book (in my opinion) isn't going to help you out much.  It assumes that you already understand the material and you're looking for a reference guide to find quick answers.  And that's fine.  This book has a definite purpose and target audience, and I think it does a very nice job of hitting the mark.
<br />
<br />For me, this would be a perfect companion book to Mastering Regular Expressions (also by O'Reilly).  Mastering is considered one of the definitive volumes on the subject, and having this pocket guide on hand to jog your memory on lesser-used points would be perfect.</span>

                    <span>Based on the .NET chapter it would appear that the author tackled too many implementations. It looked like all of the .NET stuff came from the SDK, sans discussion & examples. <p>Developers worrying about an expression to be executed on several different platforms might find this type of overview helpful. How many folks do that though?</span>

                    <span>This book packs a great deal of information into only 93 pages. That may partly be a result of the terseness of most, if not all, of the regular expression syntax; a metasymbol of more than two characters would be considered long-winded! Yet the high information density is likely also due to the manner in which Stubblebine has distilled the operators and rules, as well as the meaning and usage thereof, down to the bare bones. But this does not imply that the book is bereft of examples. Most of the sections contain at least one, and sometimes several, code fragments that illustrate the regex elements under discussion.<p>(...)</span>
