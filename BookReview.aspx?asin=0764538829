                    <span>I've never written a review before, but I'm so lost after reading this book that I had to warn others before they come down the same road.
<br />
<br />I agree with "a reader" that the author will "introduce a topic but, before developing it, tell the reader that she'll explain later how it (method, procedure, &c) should be accomplished."  It's enough to drive a person crazy.  Also, if you run into a problem, too bad.  Troubleshooting is a nontopic in this book.</span>

                    <span>I delved into HTML several years ago and fooled around with it on my personal website but the tedium of having to code every single whisker of a webpage led me to try FrontPage 2000. I loved it but never had the time to learn it well. It speeded my page production but I wasn't satisfied with the results. I put webpage work aside for a couple of years then recently decided to dive in with the completely worked over FrontPage 2003 and dedicate myself to learning it well.<p>Dornfest's book was a perfect way to break off the rust while at the same time becoming acquainted with the new capabilities of FP2003. I generally am afraid of the DUMMIES series because the authors can go too far trying to be informal and funny, while neglecting the meat of the subject. A page with a cartoon is a wasted page for me when I want to know something. Dornfest shows welcome restraint, holding off on the jokes for the most part and carefully explaining how FP works in clear prose.<p>The presentation is patient and I found no glitches where something different happens on the screen from what is described in the book. All the basics are here along with introductions to more advanced topics and a great collection of sites to visit for further learning.</span>

                    <span>This book is totally disjointed. The author will introduce a topic but, before developing it, tell the reader that she'll explain later how it (method, procedure, &c) should be accomplished. This infuriating tactic happens repeatedly thereby making it impossible to learn anything. I also suspect that the author does NOT grasp the underlying theoretical/architectural concepts of FrontPage, much less (X)HTML, enough to provide the reader much more than a blind how-to guide.  She never explains WHY we choose this option, WHY we pick this menu item, WHY we highlight this text, WHY we insert this file, and so on...
<br />
<br />If you don't believe me, look at the reviews of this same author's "FrontPage 2002 with CD-ROM" previous version of this book.
<br />
<br />Be skeptical of glowing 5-star reviews from critics who find absolutely no fault with the books they are reviewing.  "Before reading xxxx I knew absolutely nothing but after devouring this paragon of perfection I am now totally conversant with the subject of yyyy."
