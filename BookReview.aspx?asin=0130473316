                    <span>I accidentally purchased this book on an Amazon review, and was sorely duped.<P>This is not the book for a beginner or intermidiate looking to set up his home network with step by step practical instructions. This book is better suited for the IT guy in training for a company with about 250-500 employees.<P>If you have formal computer training, don't mind being inundated with terms like WINS, DHCP, PSTN, CCITT, LSA, NVRAM, NWLINK, and enjoy reading dictionaries in your spare time just for fun, I highly recommend this book.<P> I guess my strong negative reaction came because I thought I was purchasing a "guide to installing a small office / home office network."<P>Instead of practical and sensible solutions, I got the extremes in spectrum: Simple explanations like this: "Sometimes the NIC drivers are out of date or they perform poorly, causing windows errors. In this case the most current upgraded drivers for the NIC should be installed." (Wow! Upgrade drivers? Who knew?! Thanks for telling me! I never would have known that!) while the majority of the time I felt like this author couldn't get out of "professor" mode, and is talking to a class that already has months of his lectures already under the belt. ( I'm just glad I'm not the woman married to the man.)<P>For those that need practical and sensible solutions to building a home network, I found Windows XP home networking by Paul Thurrott much more concrete and even sensually pleasurable to read by comparison. AND GET THIS: I was actually able to build a home / small office network with the Thurrott book.<P>For those of you on the LQT and don't mind a little PROVO while working your NICNT, I wish you a big UNATKO, and hope you find a little YCORLL on your Xray 818 Charlie Foxtrot. <P>That's a Roger big 10-4 over and out- cuz' he's got you covered.<P>Peace - Out</span>

                    <span>This book is a necessary addition to your library if you are studying for certifications such as MCSE, MCSA, MCDBA, ORACLE, SUN JAVA 2, CIW, MCAD, MCSD, and so on. These certifications generally test your ability operate (writing programs, installing OS, creating and managing Websites and databases, etc) in a corporate environment with Server machines and Server software such as Windows 2003 Server or Linux. Use this book to build a small but cheap test network to approximate a real corporate network - the principles are the same. Then purchase the Microsoft certification books from amazon - MS PRESS books usually have trial editions of the enterprise level software that would be quite expensive for a poor student. Then study your heart out and be free to experiment as you wish. And yes, I did get my MCSA this way. Good luck!</span>

                    <span>I looked at many networking books when trying to setup my home network. The books aimed at home networking were all too simple, but the corporate networking books were a bit over my head. SOHO Networking addressed everything I needed, including how to use a server on my home network -- most home networking books only consider peer-to-peer networking. I now have a mixed wired and wireless home network running a file server and 5 computers, plus a Tivo Series 2. This book explains everything well in an easy-to-understand style that does not oversimplify.</span>

                    <span>This text is a must for anyone who wants to understand, plan or build a SOHO [small office home office] LAN [local area netword] with Broadband Internet access. It will save the reader many times the cost of the book in obtaining the system the first time around, whether he/she builds it him(her)self or contracts a vendor to do the work. The reader will not longer be force to rely solely on salespersons.<BR> Text explains Client/Server LANS and Peer-to-Peer LANS. Various means to interconnecting PCs, hardwired Ethernet Cat 5/Cat 6 cabling to be the connectivity of choice where one can make holes in walls.<BR> Separate and distinct in the Broadband/DSL Connection. And the security issues resulting from 24 & 7 connection to the Internet Provider.<BR> Finally, the text gives a flash view of where all this technology is going.</span>
