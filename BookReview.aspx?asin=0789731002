                    <span>This book covers an important topic that other Excel authors skim or omit.  It is just a shame that there is no CD or download for the examples presented in the book.  I wrote the publisher and was sent a zip file with a couple of files, but not nearly enough to be able to practice or try out the techniques described in the book.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>As a health care analyst, I do lots of research using Excel.  I stumbled across this text at a discount book sale and have used it constantly since then as a resource.  A large portion of the book deals with pivot tables, one of the truly powerful Excel functions.  But it covers much more than  just this.  Several of my MBA friends have browsed through the book and  lamented they did not have this resource when they were in B-school.  It's  unfortunate that it is out of print.</span>

                    <span>It's too bad that this book is out of print - it is one of the best I have in my library, as it gives both beginners and experienced "Excellers" the insights they need to make use of the Data  functions Excel offers. I hope the publisher sees this and offers this  fantastic book to the market again. As the lines between spreadsheets and  databases continues to blur, this book gets more important....</span>

                    <span>I waited 3 months for this book (which was out of print) and it has been well worth the wait.  This book provides all the bells and whistles plus a whole bunch of other advanced functions which you wouldn't have thought of  in dealing with data lists in Excel. Admitted, managing data with Excel  isn't recommended in a lot of circumstances, but sometimes you have no  choice.  You might have too few data for using a full-fledged database; or,  more likely, people tend to avoid using database programs for managing  their data, with the result that you often get raw data entered with Excel  - and you have to return a certain output to the original source in Excel  format.   My work involved quite a lot of this, and this book has offered  wonderful solutions for almost all of my work needs. If you think you know  a thing or two about using Excel, especially in data management, this book  will make you think again - and help you become more productive than ever.</span>
