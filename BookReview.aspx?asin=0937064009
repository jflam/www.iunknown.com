                    <span>The Hua Hu Ching portion of the book is self explanatory.  The Tao Teh Ching can be read and applied at any level.  If you are truly looking for some assistance then I recommend 8000 Years of Wisdom, books 1 and 2, by Master Ni.  Each chapter of the Tao Teh Ching is read and then expanded upon by Master Ni, with questions from students.  Some people will like this and some will not.  What is important, is to find what works for YOU and aligns with YOU.</span>

                    <span>This review speaks to the Hua Hu Ching portion of the book. For the record, I have only read the first 30 chapters of the HHC, but Chinese is my first language so I think I may have some insight into the matter of translation. The fact is, if these writings were given a literal word for word translation it would be quite confusing to the English reader, so some explanation is necessary. In fact, many who know the Chinese language does not understand the original text.<p>So as far as the complaints that it is not poetic or that it's wordy and cumbersome, isn't that just being occupied with the words? The essence of the phrase "the tao that can be told is not the true Tao" (wish I had a nickel for every time that's been quoted as an admonition) doesn't mean poetic expressions, expressions that are more beautiful or ones that make you feel better is any more true, it isn't about any of that. The tao is not about an emotional state either, that it cannot be expressed through words doesn't mean you would be more concerned or preoccupied about how it isn't satisfactorily expressed through words. This is the same with all translations, and even with the original language itself. AT BEST you enjoy the beauty of an English translation, not the original text. To do that you really have to know the Chinese language, frankly it is just far too different from English. <p>Having said that, here are some quotes so you can judge for yourself:<p>"An integral universal being knows that nothing which can be put into words is the integral truth. He does not ask people to follow, his only interest is to serve. He does not indulge in worry, but simply does his work."-23<p>"Kind prince, there are two kinds of disciples who follow the Universal Integral Way. One kind understands it intellectually and is able to speak about it well, while the other actually lives it with his whole being."-30<p>"The subtle cosmic body of the Universal One cannot be seen in any beautiful form, because to the Universal One there is nothing which can be considered as form.<br>"Kind Prince, as soon as the Universal One is mentioned people immediately formulate images in their imaginations. Then they try to make reality conform to their imaginary concepts. The Universal One is truly imageless, yet in the attempt to make it conform to an image, people distort its reality and separate themselves from it."-6<p>So as far as the content itself, I would simply say it reflects understanding, and the above would be a sample of that. If you are really more interested in a beautiful expression, this is probably not the translation for you.</span>

                    <span>On the Tao Te Ching portion of the book: This elucidation by Ni is supposed to represent the Southern Internal Alchemy school's view on the Tao Te Ching.  This version is not as poetic or beautiful as some others, but is clear and effective in delivering its message, without confusing the reader too much.<br>On the Hua Hu Ching portion of the book: I do not like this portion of the book.  The message may be valuable, but the format is in that of a conversation between Laozi and a prince, and is old fashioned in language so it is confusing and harder to understand.  This is just my opinion, and some of my friends enjoyed this format, and maybe you will too, but I prefer Brian Walker's version, which is based on this very translation, but is instead a sort of poetic summary, condensing each chapter to its essential lessons.</span>

                    <span>Over-reliance in many spiritual texts on enigmatic wording does not inherently promote understanding of what cannot be directly spoken. This book is perhaps slightly less poetic - and certainly less cryptic - than most translations of the Tao Te Ching. And it is a welcome tradeoff for it's well-conveyed manner. (I have not read other translations of the Hua Hu Ching for comparison, so I will not comment on that part of the book.)<p>With plain, direct, and gentle wording he gracefully illuminates. Yet, it is so worded such that each passage still leaves a silence at the end of it, offering the reader the space to dwell on that which cannot be put into words.</span>
