                    <span>   I checked this book out through the library first. But it is one of those books that is so good I just had to get my own copy.  You'll love the way Mr. Pine brings together the best quotes on specific passages in this Sutra. It is tremendous. Readers who enjoy this book will also thrive with author Vernon Howard.  </span>

                    <span>Most English translations of the Diamond Sutra are based on a single text, usually one of the traditional Chinese versions. While often interesting and even beautiful, these translations fail to address the subtle and not-so-subtle variants of interpretation found in other readings, some of which can significantly affect the meaning of the sutra.
<br />
<br />In this volume, Red Pine has assembled a synthesis of ALL significant source texts, including the Muller/Conze and Gilgit Sanskrit editions as well as major Chinese and Tibetan renderings. The result is indispensable, both as a survey of the available readings and as a work of devotional art in its own right.
<br />
<br />The book begins with a complete rendering of the sutra in spare, unadorned English. This is followed by a detailed look at each of the 32 sections, combining Red Pine's own thoughtful ideas together with quotations from several other commentators. Pains are taken to point out differences in the readings of various translators and in the existing Sankrit source texts. We find, for instance, that despite Conze's claim of offering a "literal" translation of the sutra, he actually omitted many features of his Sanskrit source.
<br />
<br />Red Pine traces in minute detail the evolution of Subhuti's understanding of the Buddha's discourse. Unlike some commentators, who dismiss the second half of the sutra as a mere re-emphasis of the first, Red Pine demonstrates how the Buddha re-uses Subhuti's original questions to skillfully penetrate his subtle midunderstandings and delusions, one by one, until the mystery of the Buddha's "body" is transcended in a single thought.
<br />
<br />No one interested in Buddhist literature should fail to add this book to their library. I look forward to a lifetime of returning to it again and again. The body of merit earned by Red Pine for realizing this monumental work will be great indeed ... which is to say, no merit at all. :)
<br />
<br />The Buddha tells Subhuti that no one encounters this sutra unless they are already enlightened. Do you dare to believe this?</span>

                    <span>The Diamond Sutra is a spiritual treasure and a key text of Mahayana Buddhism. Estimates for its date of composition range from the second century B.C. to the third century A.D.  The original texts are in Chinese and Sanskrit.  There are two related explanations for the title "Diamond Sutra":  1. the teaching of the sutra cuts through diamonds or 2.  the sutra itself is the diamond that in its radiance and strength cuts through and illuminates everything. The text consists of 32 chapters (the chapter divisions are not in the original sources) and about 30 pages. The Diamond Sutra is one of the few texts of whatever type that will repay endless study and which can transform the life of the receptive reader.<p>Red Pine has produced a translation and commentary on the Diamond Sutra which help greatly in exploring it. The organization of the book bears discussing.  The book opens with a translation of the sutra, unadorned by commentary, which consists of about 30 pages.  The translation is followed by a Preface in which Red Pine gives some background on the text and on Buddhism, sketches out his interpretation of the text, and explains to the reader how he came to the Diamond Sutra over the years.<p>The longest section of the book consists of a commentary of about 400 pages arranged in 32 sections, one for each chapter of the Diamond Sutra.  Each section begins with the text of the Chapter followed by Red Pine's commentary on the chapter as a whole.  He then reproduces again a smaller portion of each chapter -- a paragraph, sentences, or sometimes only a phrase --and offers commentary on it.  The commentaries are sometimes Pine's own.  He also draws down a selection of the enormous commentary the Diamond Sutra has generated over the centuries. Some of this commentary dates from early Chinese sources and other portions of it are contemporary in origin. I found the various commentaries fascinating in themselves and useful in starting to approach the Diamond Sutra.<p>Pine also gives the reader familiar with the original sources an analysis of textual variations.  More importantly, he offers the general reader a glossary of the many names, places and sources to which his commentary refers, which are likely to be unfamiliar to those approaching the Diamond Sutra for the first time.<p>There is a great deal in the commentary, and in the Diamond Sutra itself, comparing the teaching of the Sutra, with its emphasis on the Bodisattva, who works with compassion for the salvation of all sentient beings, with the earlier, Theravada, school of Buddhism, with its emphasis on the Arahant and on individual enlightenment.  There is deep discussion in the Sutra on no-self, and on non-attachment. It is a text that will reward repeated meditation and readings.<p>Red Pine's book will help the reader begin with the Diamond Sutra and its difficult teachings.</span>
