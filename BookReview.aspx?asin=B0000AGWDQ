                    <span>I am from Cleveland Ohio home of the CLOWNS... but have been a part of the RAIDER NATION for about 18 years now. Yes I was saddened by our loss in the super bowl but we still had a great season. The DVD is only 22 minuets long but true RAIDER fans will love it seeing touchdown after touchdown. If you're a part of the RAIDER NATION get this DVD, you will still love it if not you probably like one of the teams we have trampled in the past. SILVER AND BLACK FOREVER. BACK IN SIVLER and BLACK in '04</span>

                    <span>The fans are a joke? You're all a joke - who teh hell do you follow out in Hanford? Sounds liek your a little confused. Lets see what do we have: the winning-ist team in teh NFL, worldwide recognition, a huge true fan base, not some fair weather fans like the 40whiners. For the niner fan: Oh yeah, we can actually tailgate at our games and unlike the whiners fans, we stay until the game is concluded. At least we got to the super bowl - where the hell have the niners been? They have been whinning and complaining about nothing. Whether we win or loose we'll always be the best team in the NFL! So why don't you go play with your legos you dork.<P>GO RAIDERS!!!</span>

                    <span>I think it is very funny that you have all these other idiots saying chokland faders and how funny it was to see the Raiders lose, it is funny that they took the time out of there day to watch the Oakland Raiders complete 2002 season. A little to much extra time for the computer geeks! I guarantee if you had to get on the football field with any team you might go back to your porn chat room with 80yr old men who you think are 18yr old girls! Ya it sucks that they lost the Super Bowl to a coach who knew every move the quarterback would make but it sure did take talent to make it there! Stay in your chat rooms weenies!</span>

                    <span>Raiders ended their 2002 Season right where everyone knew they'd go...down the Superbowl toilet. To join all the other teams that went to the Superbowl, only to get their behinds handed to them! This DVD is a laugh a minute...seeing how their former coach, Chucky, made them as well as Mr. Davis look like fools...in their own home state...in front of most of their fans. And the costumes these dummies wear in the stands! This team's a joke, the fans are as well, and look how they're doing this year! I guess they're going to have to wait another 20 years to get back to the Superbowl...it'll probably be a worse loss!</span>

                    <span>Being a pretty ardent anti-Raider, you might think I wouldn't find this particular presentation to be worth watching. Well, you'd be wrong, 'cuz I ALWAYS love watching videos that have happy endings! Oh sure, there were many low points during the Raiders' 2002 campaign, such as compiling a winning record and claiming the AFC West title for the third consecutive year. Then there was that dreadful day when it was announced that starting QB Rich Gannon was selected as the year's most valuable player. Well, to be completely honest, no one else in the league deserved it more than him (God, how it pains me to admit that)...<P> But there were also a few high points, such as my beloved Niners beatin' them in overtime at the Coliseum in week 9. I love putting the game's winning kick on a loop, so I can watch it over and over and over again, my laughter growing louder with each viewing! Heck, I even enjoyed watching the Rams take 'em apart in week 6, and I'm supposed to hate St. Louis more than I do the Raiders! <P>But those two games paled in comparison to the coup de grace: former Raider coach "Chucky" Gruden and the Tampa Bay Bucs' league -leading defense demolishing their top-ranked offense in Super Bowl XXXVII. Gannon showed why he was chosen MVP by throwing five TD passes in the game. Only problem was, three of the TD passes went to the wrong team! On the upside for Oakland, Jerry Rice padded his Super Bowl scoring record with a late TD reception, and they managed to return a blocked punt for another score.<P>In conclusion: I was very gratified to see the ChokeLand Faders get put down at the end of the season like the third-rate wannabe b@d@$$e$ that they are! If only they included 'highlight' footage of the vandalism that went down in Oakland after their pathetic performance in the big dance, this platter would be a bona fide laugh riot!<P>'Late</span>
