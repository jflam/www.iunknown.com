                    <span>This is the story of Georg Grossjohann's rise from Feldwebel to Major. He saw and survived his share of combat. As is somewhat common in German memours, he talks of what happens between battles, but not of the battles.<P>The book has merit if you wish to experience a little of how the German army worked. He was a member of several infantry units - in the early war years Germany created cadres for new divisions by splitting existing formations; later he was moved around to support ad hoc reactions to Allied victories. He always managed to get wounded or transferred in time to avoid destruction.<P>The most interesting portion of the book, in my opinion, is when his unit is pretty much wiped out and he becomes available for other duties. I never realized there were "bridge commanders" or "town commanders". Now I know.<P>In summary, the book is thin on combat but has good info on the various duties and experiences of a combat offocer.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a book about everyday life and combat in the backbone of the Wehrmacht-the common infantry division. At a time when there is a growing stack of memoirs, monographs and photo books about parachute, panzer, and both famous and obscure Waffen-SS units, Georg Grossjohann's Five Years, Four Fronts is a refreshing and important look at the wartime experiences of that vast majority of combat soldiers and tactical commanders who served in the hundreds of infantry divisions that bore the overwhelming brunt of the fighting for the Germans in World War II. Beginning with his service in the invasion of Poland and ending with his release from rather brief American captivity, this is a book by a professional soldier that is especially long on military reminiscences and mercifully brief on personal details about pre- or post-war life.<P>Although there is a great deal about combat in this book, there is not a lot of "blood and guts." With most of his combat experience as a commander at the company, battalion, and regimental levels, such was not the author's focus. However, readers should be aware that the author was rather highly decorated, earning the Iron Crosses, 2nd and 1st Classes, the German Cross in Gold, and the prestigious Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (there are even photos of the certificates for the latter two included in the book-a nice touch in an era when there are so many phonies, from all armies, publishing their "memoirs."). Major Grossjohann was also wounded in combat twice, and a photo of the certificate for his Wounds Badge in Silver is also included in the book.<P>The engrossing narrative is written in a straightforward and sometimes wry fashion, and includes numerous flashbacks to the author's earlier service as a enlisted man before the war and even before the Nazi era. These help build a 3-dimensional protagonist, and also provide rare insights into the little-understood processes by which so many non-commissioned members of the pre-war German Army were developed into the officers who led German soldiers into combat from 1939 on.<P>This book features introductions to each chapter written by an American professional historian with the assistance of another WWII German officer to doubly ensure objectivity. These introductions provide historical overviews of the fighting at the strategic and operational levels, and really help make the author's micro-historical, personal views much more meaningful for most readers.<P>Supported by a couple of dozen photos from the author's private collection and an unusually large number of tactical maps to allow the reader to follow the action, this is a superb book that is indispensable for understanding the German Army in World War II.</span>

                    <span>"Five Years, Four Fronts" by Georg Grossjohann is a fabulous look into the life of a young Wehrmacht officer from his time before the outbreak of WWII to its end. Unlike many books that are similarly dedicated to the views from a single soldier, those of Grossjohann are steeped in broad vision. For example, while individual battles are discussed Grossjohann places them squarely within the context of the overall theatre of operations, making them more than personal snippets of information. Amazingly, despite this broad perspective, Grossjohann does not get trapped into the position of defending or apologizing for actions of the whole German war machine. This is a refreshing change from the plethora of recent Axis biographies that have emerged in recent years. A reader can enjoy Grossjohann's journey in proper context without feeling disgust, anger or pity. Rather one can walk away feeling one has gotten a rare glimpse into the life of a truly honest and fair soldier who fought bravely for his country - in this case a German rather than Allied soldier. Quite an amazing experience actually!<P>While "Five Years, Four Fronts" does in fact cover (at least) five years and four fronts (as Grossjohann traverses back and forth across Euro-Asia moving from command to command and up through the lower ranks of the Wehrmacht) readers will not get an in-depth look at a large number of battles spanning the entire war. Rather the reader sees how a good lower-level officer can be move from one situation to the next as needed and how that officer (Grossjohann) perceived his place in this opera. The combat discussions are in fact quite good but not numerous, so if this is what you are looking for this may not be your cup of tea. However, if you want more in your personal historical accounts (as I did) "Five Years, Four Fronts" soundly delivers. <P>As is typical of so many other Aberjona Press books, it is the extra detail that pushes the book into a "must have/must read" category. The Preface provided by T.C. Mataxis, Brigadier General, US Army (retired), sets the stage for a book that is MORE than just another German soldier's story, but rather the story of a warrior demanding respect from peers of all nationalities. The Historical Commentaries at the beginning of each chapter further set Grossjohann's text within the larger context of the war (spatially and temporally). These facts together with Grossjohann's style and Aberjona editing make "Five Years, Four Fronts" a solid 4.5 star book - easy to pick up and read but hard to put down!!</span>

                    <span>If you want a historically correct WWII book on the "German" mulit-front war from a first person perspective, this is the book for you! Grossjohann provides a candid and often stark view of the realities of combat for an infantryman in the German war machine. Outstanding job!!!</span>

                    <span>Thrilling, breathtaking, and inspiring to say the least. Georg Grossjohann draws from his five years of bitter fighting during the Second World War to give the readers a real taste of what it was like to experience fighting from 1939-1945. The book covers some of his training right before the war and then begins the story of Major Grossjohann's ordeal covering five years of combat and four fronts(Poland 1939, France 1940, Russia 1941-1944, France 1944-1945, with little stints of leave throughout the German territories during WWII). The book is so real, colorful, and descriptive one can picture themselves actually on the front with Major Grossjohann. The stories of battle are very vivid and real, leaving a very detailed image/picture in the head of the reader. <BR>This book is not like many other books that are written by generals and seem to go on forever without saying anything....this book teaches the reader so much from start to finish. Instead, the book is written by a field grade officer who was in the thick of the fighting and has lead more counterattacks, attacks, and defenses than any of us can imagine. He teaches the reader more about human bravery, kindness, honor, professonalism, death, and personal loss than many books out there. <BR>I suggest this (and any other book from the same company) for any person wishing to learn about World War II or how to be a leader (for those who aspire to be officers in the military) or for to anyone who just wishes to know what it was like to be an officer on four fronts during a conflict. It would behoove readers to pay close attention to what Major Grossjohan says as the book has so many invaluable lessons to convey to its readers.</span>
