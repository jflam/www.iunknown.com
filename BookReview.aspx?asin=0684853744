                <span id="Label1">"Bunts," explains peripatetic political commentator and baseball rhapsodist George Will, "are modest and often useful things." So is his latest, fittingly titled foray into the National Pastime. Unlike his splendid <I>Men at Work</I>, which offered long, detailed exegeses on the way Tony Gwynn, Orel Hershiser, Cal Ripken, Jr., and Tony La Russa sweat the details of mastering specific aspects of the game, <I>Bunts</I> is a less unified, but wider ranging collection of Will's shorter baseball journalism--columns, essays, and book reviews--assembled chronologically from 1974 through the 1997 season. Each piece may be brief, but taken individually or as a whole, the collection is certainly useful, and like a good outfielder, it covers plenty of territory.<p>  Will, to be sure, is an elegant writer, a little verbose at times, but dependably knowledgeable, stirringly erudite, thoughtfully opinionated, and, here and there, delightfully personal--as in the volume's leadoff hitter in which he traces his own conservative principles to growing up a Cub fan. His lineup continues with a breezy ode to Louisville Sluggers; encomiums to Casey Stengel, Camden Yards, Ripken, Gwynn, and Curt Flood; a startling about-face on the DH; an early homage to <I>statsmeister</I> Bill James; and indictments on the selfishness of Ted Williams, the callousness of the owners in labor- and fan-relations, and the sordid personalities of Pete Rose and Billy Martin. The volume ends with a pair of doubles in the form of larger essays on Jon Miller and the distinctive craft of broadcasting, and a concluding one on the state of the game.<p>  "Baseball," Will observes, "is a habit. The slowly rising crescendo of each game, the rhythm of the long season--these are the essentials and they are remarkably unchanged over nearly a century and a half. Of how many American institutions can that be said?&quot The answer, of course, is not many, which is why <I>Bunts</I> provides a necessary and pleasing public service. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>This book contains more than 70 articles written about baseball by George Will between 1974 and 1997. Many of the essays are from the week of opening days or a post script of a season that just ended and these essays all have a similar tone and information, but all of them are well written and contain numerous facts, opinions and insights. The book also covers significant events in the history of baseball--the banning of Pete Rose, the strike of 1994, the fight for free agency and of course the yearly collapse of the Chicago Cubs, which is the team for which Will is a lifelong fanatic. This is not the best book of baseball stories I've read, but it is entertaining and thought provoking, so it deserves to be read by baseball fans and should be picked up by sports fans who want to learn why baseball is the most elegant sport and why it has so many diehard fans. </span>

                    <span>Those who have read Will's "Men at Work" already are aware of the author's knowledge of the game as well as his talent to put it into words.  This is a compilation of the author's articles on Baseball that have appeared primarily in his newspaper columns over the years.  Mr. Will, a spokesman for the political right, discards his politics for these excursions into his passion.  Indeed, one is surprized by how often Mr. Will sides with the players in the labor/management diputes that litter modern Baseball.  The author shares his nostalgia for the past and his appreciation of the heros of the present.  If he seems a bit caught up in his Cubs and Orioles, he can be forgiven because the reader has his/her own favorites.  We know the frustration and joy of the same loyalties he shares with us.<p>I read the first two thirds of the book one "column" at a time between other books.  I did so because I had read "The Best of Jim Murray" some years ago and did so over the course of several days.  By the mid-point of that book, I came to the realization that Mr. Murray had written the same column for decades.  It was just a matter of changing the name of the subject.  You don't catch on to that reading two or three columns a week.  Well, I read the last third of the book in the course of several hours.  I did not get the same reaction that I got to Murray's book.  However, I lost track of the number of times the total season attendance of the 1935 St. Louis Browns (80,922) was compared to the Opening Day attendance of the 1993 Colorado Rockies (80,227).  There were other such repetitions of facts and figures that were noticeable when the book is read cover to cover.  I suggest you savor the articles and let the book entertain you throughout the course of a summer or a year.  However you choose to read it, don't miss this intellectual appreciation of what was once known as "America's Pasttime".</span>

                    <span>Bunts by George F. Will is a collection of works written by Will between the years 1974 and 1997.  Throughout this book, Will discusses the major changes in baseball, such as the designated hitter rule, unionization, recent franchise additions, free agency, and more.  A long-suffering Chicago Cubs fan, Will, in several funny articles, describes what it is like to be a fan of a tema that hasn't won a pennant since World War II.  A skilled political columnist, we are drawn into the argument over free agency and designated hitting.  I love baseball, but sometimes find books about the sport to be tedious and overly stuffed with statistics.  While this book does contain statistics (Will knows a great deal about the sport he loves), you're not smothered by them.  It was a pleasurable read.  The only part of the book I disliked was the rehashing (several times) of the strike disputes and how many times Will felt it necessary to prove that the owners were wrong about free agency.  But believe me, you can get through that.  Besides, this is a compilation of works - it's not like he intentionally meant to repeat himself.  Will's reflections on baseball are remarkable considering that the man never played the sport professionally and is just an avid fan - so much of a fan in fact that he once owned stock in the Cubs franchise!  The pictures are great, and the things I learned from this book.  I thought I knew alot about baseball, but George F. Will proved me wrong in a way that I found to be interesting and alot of fun!</span>

                    <span>My grandfather taught me never to trust a man who wears a bow-tie, but I have to give George Will credit for his deep knowledge of the sport (which never bogs down into pedantry) and - a far rarer commodity in baseball writing - his sterling prose. You don't have to agree with his sour political conservatism (which, in an impressive display of self-knowledge, he attributes to being a Cubs fan) to find this a cracking good read.</span>

                    <span>Baseball carries a unique distinction from the other major sports in America because of its long history and stubborn resistance to change. Will understands this, and the pieces collected here in Bunts display both a  genuine affection for, and a keen understanding of, our national pastime.  Combining the sharp analysis and scholarship one expects from George Will  with a surprising amount of humour and wit (who knew?), Bunts will quickly  become a favorite of any baseball fan (and help many a non-fan understand  what the fuss is all about). George Will - sentimental romantic. Go figure.</span>
