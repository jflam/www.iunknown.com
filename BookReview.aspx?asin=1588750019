                <span id="Label1">"This book is about the summer I spent seeing North America, meeting North Americans, and trying to figure out how people live," writes author Philip Greenspun after losing his companion. You'll come face to face with examples of the stunning ethnic, scenic, and cultural richness of the continent.  <P>Meet both sides of the language war in Montreal, bored youths in the MidWest, North Dakota Harley riders, struggling single mothers in the Yukon, and free spirits in Alaska. Join Greenspun as he travels up the spine of the Rocky Mountains into Canada and then up the Alaska Highway. Splash down in a float plane and spend a week with 20 bears.  <P>Work your way through the Inside Passage on the Alaska Marine Highway and get inside a salmon processing factory. See if Greenspun survives touring Vancouver, Vancouver Island, and the Pacific Northwest with old friends and new. Ask about polygamy in Salt Lake City, mountain bike the Slickrock Trail, and learn how to cope with AIDS in Utah. Follow Greenspun back to Boston and MIT.  <P>Features 133 color photographs of the people and places Greenspun encounters from Boston to Alaska and back.</span>

                    <span>I recently became interested in traveling and when I first picked up this book, I was excited to read about the different parts of the author's trip and hear about the places he visited. However, by the end I found there was more to it than just where he had been and what he had seen. What separates this piece of writing from others is that it reads very smoothly, as if the author is telling the story in person. I found that certain bits and pieces of information from conversations with strangers were effectively chosen. By focusing on interesting dialogues, it is easy to understand how these people have changed the author's outlook on strangers and life in general. His struggle for answers and meaning on this trip reminded me of Eugene Henderson's struggle in Bellow's novel "Henderson the Rain King"...in the end they both seem to find that what they are looking for is actually much closer than it seems. <BR> The photography in this book is some of the best I've ever seen...the pictures from the Yellowstone chapter were especially beautiful. If they were blown up, I bet they would look fantastic in a frame on the wall. Greenspun has definitely strengthened my desire to get out on the road, see new places and meet new people. Travels With Samantha proves that everyone can potentially gain from traveling; all it takes is an open mind...</span>

                    <span>Greenspun's 1993 summer holiday trip, 14 weeks from Boston to Alaska and back, turns out to be an interesting read. Although he often discribes himself as a typical MIT computer science nerd, he seems to have no trouble meeting people and engaging in various conversations with him. In fact, he's surprisingly good at it. <P>Philip appears to have a very strong (American) opinion on just about everything and that is quite noticable in this book as well. Added to the constant stream of meeting people and summarizing his conversations with them, this can make TWS a somewhat though read after a while.<P>The photography is very nice, very effectively showing the places Greenspun visited. It could also be classified as "calendar-type landscape/wildlife photography". Fortunately, the sheer beauty of landscapes, the Alaska bear photographs as well as several portraits to go along with the names in the story, make up for this.<P>Summarizing, I should say that I am very happy that this 1994 web publication is available in print. I enjoyed reading it on the web while I was a student and happily re-read the print edition.</span>

                    <span>This book is one long cross-country ego trip. Travel with Greenspun and marvel at his oh-so-beautiful photographs and fawn over his oh-so-meaningful insights into the world. Listen as he reduces the complexities of life, love, and international politics into glib metaphors about tossing "garbage over the wall into the street." And read in awe as his cosmopolitan mind laments Jewish Israelis that harbor an "Arab mentality." A more apt title for this 368 page lovefest would have been "Travels with Myself." If only his writing talent was a match for his conceit, this might have made a good read.</span>

                    <span>I read Philip's writings from his trip few years ago, just as he was publishing it on his (at that time unique and very vaulable for a beginning photographer) web. In fact, I downloaded all the artciles, printed them myself and made a book of them at home. And I read and I even made some notes out of it. So, now, few years later, i decided to buy the book, because: I had though I would like to have a real book, and I wanted to test Amazon.com shopping. Well, After have it read once again, as a real book, I am somewhat disapointed. First, there are actually less pictures than within the original articles still avalable on the photo.net. Second, the print quality is not very good, and so, in fact, if I tried, I could make better looking photographs just printing the downloaded stuff on my computer printer. And this is a professionally printed book. And, for photographs, low quality of print matters very much. So, that is why I am disappointed. Still, the reading's fine and easy, and in fact, it is the kind that lets you (me) rest while reading, so, it is ok for me. I read Joyce too, but when I want to.</span>

                    <span>I gave this book to my wife and said "here's my midlife crisis trip." Greenspun takes a trip across the country that every photographer dreams about. Its one of those trips you could have taken during the summer break from college (as Greenspun does) but never thought you could. He hits all the big National Parks: Yellowstone, Glacier, Denali, Katmai, Arches, Canyonlands and shoots rolls and rolls of film. The pictures are excellent; maybe not worthy of a National Geographic cover, but they are very good. <P>One reason for taking the trip was to emulate Steinbeck in "Travels with Charlie" and get in touch with his fellow Americans. I think Greenspun does a good job recounting the stories of everyone he meets along his way. He comes across as very judgemental in his opinions and in the questions he poses. This can upset some readers, but I saw it as a way of arousing conversation from the people he talked to.<P>Another aspect of this book was that it was a weekly travelogue that Greenspun emailed out to friends via the internet as he travelled. He did it essentially to prove he could. Now as the Internet is so pervasive, one gets an intriguing feeling reading this book thinking "Yeah, I could do that with my Thinkpad, too." Well, this guy DID it, albeit with his Apple, and before anyone else, too.</span>
