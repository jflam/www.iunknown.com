                    <span>Hirsch does a great job of whetting my appetite to get to Lake Powell. The explanation of the whole process of renting and operating a house-boat is just what I was looking for! I wish he had included a little more detail about communications with marine radio and cell phones, and he could have just gone into more detail in every chapter. I appreciate the expense he went to in the colored pictures. Overall very satisfied! I would recommend it as a resource to anyone headed to Lake Powell!</span>

                    <span>This book tells you everything to bring and everything not to. I haven't even gone on the trip yet, but all my friends have already bought their copy and read it cover to cover. Bob, if you read this, thank you for being so clever yet informative. The pictures in this book and breathtaking!</span>

                    <span>I wish I could rate it at 6 1/4 stars!!!!! Mr Hirsch is not only one of the finest travel writers of our time, on a par with Paul Thoureux, he is , I dare say one of the finest writers working today in the English language. Bob fills his informative tribe with humor and amusing, entertaining and extremely well written anecdotes. One wonders if it is even worth going to Lake Powell on your own, after you've experienced it vicariously so well through the author. Bob's love and respect for his family, and indeed his love of the entire human experience, is amply demonstrated through his locacious musings of the wonders of nature and their almost religious significance to Bob in his Lake Powell outings. I am honored to have beeen a part I hope in introducing you to this incomprehensibly wonderful work of literature.</span>
