                <span id="Label1">Over 2,000 species, from the tiny spider mite to the massive blue whale, are profiled in DK's astonishingly wonderful <I>Animal</I>, produced in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and more than 70 expert zoologists. To call this book "profusely illustrated" is to seriously underrepresent page after page of breathtaking photos capturing each creature in sharp images, thrumming with life. Even the page borders are covered with collages of animal skins to indicate which class of organisms is represented in that section--every inch of this heavy book is gorgeous.<p>  Besides heft and beauty, <I>Animal</I> has authority. Editors-in-chief David Burnie and Don E. Wilson are top biologists, and they have assembled a crack team of consultants for each section of the book. For instance, Richard Rosenblatt of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography takes charge of the chapter on fishes, so all the classification, behavior, and distribution data is up-to-date and full of the kind of detail that comes from years of professional specialization. In addition to basic size, location, and status information, each animal gets a short, one- to two-paragraph description, enough to give a feel for the creature:<p>  <blockquote> The blackfin icefish produces a natural "antifreeze," enabling it to survive in the subzero waters of the Antarctic. It lacks red blood cells and hence looks rather pale, but has excellent blood circulation, and a strong heart which weighs as much as that of a small mammal. Its large, toothy mouth led to it being called the crocodile fish by 19th-century whalers. </blockquote><p>  Biodiversity has never been more at the forefront of biologists' concerns, and <I>Animal</I> reports on the issues critical to ecology, from habitat loss to the species that are most endangered within each class. <p>  This book is an ideal browsing reference for all experience levels, as well as a delightful addition to the collection of any animal enthusiast or classroom. Of necessity, not all species are covered, but as a general source of information down to the genus level, <I>Animal</I> excels. Don't be put off by the price! Extraordinarily beautiful, biologically accurate, and packed with furry, feathery, finny, many-legged delights, <I>Animal</I> is one of the very best science books of 2001. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>This book arrives in a cardboard box type cover to protect your investment.<P>Once you open up the box, you will find one of the most beautiful books on animals you have ever seen. Not only is the photography superb, the details are fascinating. The contents are divided into eight sections: <P>Introduction, Habitats, Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fishes and Invertebrates. An Index helps you find the animal you are looking up super fast. <P>As a reference, this is outstanding, clear, comprehensive and thought-provoking. If you are a wildlife enthusiast, you will enjoy the photographic portraits of each animal. Each species profile is supported by symbols showing habitat, size, population and conservation status. <P>An introduction to the animal world helps to explain classification. The animal groups are listed and there are four pages to summarize the classification scheme used in this book. <P>The Habitats section is especially interesting as it describes how animals survive in grasslands, deserts, tropical forests, temperate forests, coniferous forests, mountains, polar regions, freshwater, oceans, coral reefs and even urban areas. Each page shows the habitat and then pictures of the animals living there. <P>The rest of the book is set up in a similar way for each section. First there is an introduction for the CLASS (Mammalia, etc) and then there is a introduction for each ORDER (Marsupialia). Then the families and species with detailed information. There is a map next to each animal picture showing where they live, their social unit, status, length, weight and pertinent information. <P>The Glossary helps to explain terms like species: a group of similar organisms that are capable of interbreeding in the wild and of producing offspring that resemble themselves.<P>The section on cats was especially beautiful, however in reality, cats really need their own book. >^..^<<P>This book is just gorgeous!</span>

                    <span>This book is unbelievable from cover to cover. It's both a spectacular learning tool and a book that you'll keep forever and always refer to. It's been extremely helpful to me already as I continue through school toward a job working with animals and docenting at the zoo, and it would be equally as helpful to anyone of any age who shares this interest. The pictures are real and breathtakingly beautiful, and the book's organization couldn't be any easier or more perfect. I highly recommend this book as a reference or simply as a good read, because it is just as interesting and helpful either way. Animal is now the most beautiful book I own, and packed with interesting and vital information.</span>

                    <span>This book is simpy outstanding. Few books can rival the wide scope offered by Animal on a vast range of organisms which include invertebrates, birds, reptiles, mammals, fish, and amphibians. The book is adorned with magnificent color photos of each organism and a compact description that provides adequate amounts of info on the organism. Although some common species are excluded, it more than makes up for this with the amount of species covered. For every common species excluded, I ran across three new species I had never heard of. This book is an extraordinary guide to the vast array of wildlife in the world. There are few books that I have found as informative and enjoyable to read as Animal. It truly is a definitive guide to the world's wildlife and I highly recommend it.</span>

It is an outstanding effort in every way and the team that put it together should be awarded. Every library should have it and every school. A great gift for animal lover such as myself. Its on my coffee table and will be read for many months to come. </span>
