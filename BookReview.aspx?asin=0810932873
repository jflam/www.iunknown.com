                <span id="Label1">Architectural trends come and go, but stone endures. It speaks a rich visual language of texture, color, and pattern that no other material can convey. Stone has inspired American builders for more than three centuries, and today's architects continue to refer to the traditional construction methods and regional styles that connect stone structures to their natural surroundings. In 200 gorgeous color photographs of a vast repertoire of residences, inside and out, this glossy, handsome tome traces the development of domestic stone architecture in the United States. Providing general descriptions of featured styles and building techniques, as well as intriguing personal histories of the private homes, the informative text crosses the country as it covers everything from Dutch colonial farm houses to eclectic Victorian mansions to whimsical stone cottages to modernist expressions by Frank Lloyd Wright and others. For anyone interested in design, old houses, or American history, the book is a must.</span>

                    <span>Stone Houses is a splendid survey which focuses exclusively on residential architecture in the USA. The book begins with several breathtaking photographs of historical sites in the Southwest where the Anasazi built beguiling settlements out of local stone over one thousand years ago. It then proceeds to document numerous stone structures of interest from colonial times right through to the present. Moreover, in addition to his commentary on the buildings presented within the pages of this beautifully realized volume, Lee Goff provides a thoughtful discussion of the qualities of stone itself which makes for such a superb, durable building material in the first instance as well as an inspirational source for imaginative residential design. To quote briefly from the introduction: "Stone has different moods. It can be warm or cold, protective or inhospitable. Before all else, however, stone evokes an image of power, strength, impregnability and endurance. Even more subliminally it conveys a sense of the primordial...Instinctively, we feel the millions of years ago the stones were formed. Thus, the materials of nature become the material of shelter, and the form the shelter takes in turn reflects the origin of the stone and the house's setting, connecting the dwelling and its inhabitants to the most permanent world of all-the natural world."<P>Stone was the first material used for shelter. It can be (and has been) assembled in any number of creative, aesthetically pleasing ways. Stone Houses takes us on a wondrous tour of many of the possibilities inherent to this medium of construction. "Whether cottage or ch√¢teau, cabin or castle, stone houses embody feelings of romance and the picturesque. Their walls speak of permanence and history; their stones give whispered accounts of their prehistoric creation. They are an ongoing part of what Tennyson referred to as 'the eternal landscape of the past.' "</span>
