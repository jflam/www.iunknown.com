                    <span>I've read the MSPress Certification book, BOL (SQL server Books Online), and neither come close to the under standing this book gives.  Things I've read 5 times over in the other aforemenioned book and still didn't get an understanding, I read once in this book and understood right off.<p>I wished I had this book before taking the admin exam (I passed, but caught heck doing it).<p>aaron@aaronford.com</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book for sql server programmers. Not like the other books where you find lots of cut and paste from BOL. I feel every sql server programmer should reed this book. Lots of insight and very good information on sql server. Only a person who loves sql server can write a book like this. A must read!!</span>

                    <span>Occasionally I have the need to leave my IBM/Lotus programming platform and interact with data stored in Microsoft SQL Server 2000.  I even have it running on my laptop as a higher-end alternative to Access.  I found that the book, Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming by Robert Vieira (Wrox) is a very good reference for manipulating data in that environment.<p>Vieira concentrates specifically on the programming aspects of SQL Server 2000 as opposed to teaching you how to administer the server.  He does touch on an administration overview in chapter 30, but it's not something you'd read in order to pass an administration exam.  Although the title does say "Professional", this does not mean you have to be a veteran SQL programmer to benefit from it.  The earlier chapters cover the fundamentals of RDBMS technology, as well as how SQL is used in a SQL Server 2000 environment.  The further you get into the book, the more you'll find subjects that are either more advanced or cover techniques you'll use in application development, such as how to build triggers and stored procedures.  While you will learn all these skills within the SQL Server 2000 platform, the core technologies are transferable to just about any RDBMS.  Time spent with this book will continue to pay off regardless of what database system you need to use at any given time.<p>While the content is technical, the writing style is conversational and approachable.  It's actually quite easy to read the material and digest the concepts without trying to fight against the author's style.  If you have need to work with SQL Server 2000 from a development standpoint, this is definitely a book to consider to guide you along the way.</span>

                    <span>Rob is a natural at teaching his craft, which he knows extremely well. You can tell he is a professional that has mastered his craft and enjoys sharing the information that is essential for anyone to become a true professional in the field. Rob is also very honest. Some writers mention this book v. the 7.0 book not being different? Rob addresses this in the first few pages of this book, as an honest and good man would. You see, there are more differences between 7.0 and 2000 than some people have picked up on is what I believe. Sure there is much similar information. That packaging, title and Rob's own words are quick to show and tell you that. But all in all it was worth a new book for the 2000 upgrade. In fact, there are some MAJOR changes in 2000, so it's worth it just to learn about those and the same great in depth information. I've noticed a second edition of this title but can never find it available. I own this version from the year 2000, and believe me it is ragged from constant use, but would pay for the second editon if I could find it just for any new information Rob has to dispense. I feel this informtion is so well presented and such a great all around tutorial, reference, guide, all in one book I'd pay for the updated info in a second editon gladly. <br>Thanks Rob. I personally think you are the best. I wish I worked for you! You are not only a master and completely professional, but you have that magic quality of not being full of yourself in any manner and humble in fact....a very admirable trait. <br>A reader who is appreciative and better for your great work.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the reviewer Wendt, who complained that this book is too much like its earlier edition. I borrowed a copy of this new edition and compared it to my copy of the previous. Partly 'cus I was wondering if I needed to upgrade.<p>But not really. Wendt is correct. If you already have an earlier copy, then you should save some money and stick with that. The extra new stuff here is pretty minor.</span>
