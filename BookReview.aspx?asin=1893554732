                <span id="Label1">"Massive illegal immigration from Mexico into California," Victor Davis Hanson writes, "coupled with a loss of confidence in the old melting pot model of transforming newcomers into Americans, is changing the very nature of state.  Yet we Californians have been inadequate in meeting this challenge, both failing to control our borders with Mexico and to integrate the new alien population into our mainstream."  <P>Part history, part political analysis, and part memoir, "Mexifornia" is an intensely personal work by one of our most important writers. Hanson is perhaps known best for his military histories and especially his social commentary about America and its response to terror after 9/11.  But he is also a fifth-generation Californian who runs a family farm in the Central Valley and has written eloquent elegies for the decline of the small farm such as "Fields Without Dreams" and "The Land Was Everything." Like these books, "Mexifornia" is an intensely personal look at what has changed in California over the last quarter century.  In this case, however, Hanson's focus is on how not only California, the Southwest, and indeed the entire nation has been affected by America's hemorrhaging borders and how those hurt worst are the Mexican immigrants themselves.  <P>A large part of the problem, Hanson believes, comes from the opportunistic coalition that stymies immigration reform and, even worse, stifles an honest discussion of a growing problem. Conservative corporations, contractors, and agribusiness demand cheap wage labor from Mexico, whatever the social consequences.  Meanwhile, "progressive" academics, journalists, government bureaucrats, and La Raza advocates envision illegal aliens as a vast new political constituency for those committed to the notion that victimhood, not citizenship, is the key to advancement.  The problems Hanson identifies may have reached critical mass in California, but they affect Americans who inhabit "Mexizona," "Mexichusetts" and other states of becoming.  <P>Hanson writes wistfully about his own growing up in the Central Valley when he was one of a handful of non-Hispanics in his elementary school and when his teachers saw it as their mission to give all students, Hispanic and "white" alike, a passport to the American Dream.  He follows the fortunes of Hispanic friends he has known all his life--how they have succeeded in America and how they regard the immigration crisis.  But if "Mexifornia" is emotionally generous at the strength and durability of the groups that have made California strong, it is also an indictment of the policies that got California into its present mess.  But in the end, Hanson strongly believes that our traditions of assimilation, integration, and intermarriage may yet remedy a problem that the politicians and ideologues have allowed to get out of hand.</span>

                    <span>Hanson addresses the issue of Mexican immigration with compassion, concern and genuine outrage. He has the misfortune to live and have deep roots in what I've always understood to be ground zero for the worst pathologies and grossest contradictions of the Mexican immigration issue, which is greater Fresno. This is quite simply the finest and most important book about California written in the past 20 years. <P>To reiterate what he takes pains to point out throughout the book: it is not racist to make an honest examination of the state of affairs in California society today. We all have a stake in the successful development of our society as a unified people regardless of race, religion, socio-economic status or ethnic background. The traditional American model of assimilation has proven successful at building a roughly equitable society In opposition to this the modern multicultural model is based on a much more pessimistic and basically racialist view of society. It believes that people are inherently incapable of joining together across our differences. It rejoices in a grotesque caricature version of those differences. <P>I hope that policymakers and opinion leaders will read this book and respect Hanson's experience if not his conclusions.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book on a timely subject. The massive flow of illegal immigration in the US has been largely ignorted by politicians. The PC crowd have succeeded in labeling anyone as racist who brings up this subject. Only Victor Hanson Davis has the courage to address this growing problem. The massive influx of immigration in California is not the only area where this problem is most acute. The Eastern parts of the US are also suffering from this problem. Hanson, the philosophic military historian tackles this controversial issue with the same passion and factual analysis that he has applied to all his other books.<P>Hanson writes with clarity and vision. His determination to take on non-historical topics is broadening his perspective, and making him something of a sage on the current American political-social scene. With his anti-establishment views toward the University elite who are detached from the every day problems in America today, Hanson provides cogent reasosn why this problem should be addressed before it is too late. In a society that is fearful to address anything controversial, Hanson is a refreshing voice of reason. His arguments will no doubt be frightening to ultra-liberals, but those who read him carefuly will see that he attacks both Left and Right in this country. Hanson is more middle of the road than many Americans today can admit. He speaks for many who have been cowed by a heavy-handed media, and by demogogues who use race is a means for power. For those seeking a refreshing voice of clarity, with a strong grasp of history, Victor Hanson Davis has finally arrived!</span>

                    <span>Outstanding! This book is writed by someone who truly sees both sides of this issue. Well thought out, well written, and well researched. A very balanced look a problem out of control. Thought provoking. Don't be fooled by anyone who tells you the book is racist, it simple is not! This is a fair look at what we as a state/country did in the past and the how and why it worked, and what we are doing now and why it is not working. A must read.</span>

                    <span>It's about time someone write about the growing problem in California, especially Southern California. Most people who call this text or others like it racist are dead wrong. Racism, like communism before it, is a red-herring. I grew up in Southern California. Drive through East Los Angeles and tell me how you feel when you see the Mexican Flag flying high. It makes you wonder if many Hispanics have an agenda. In Santa Ana the common language is Spanish. Assimilation into American life is obviously not working. This text raises honest concerns. A book to accompany this would be Alien Nation by Peter Brimelow. As a side note Mexicans didn't exist until the Spanish colonized the "New World". Spanish was brought to the Americas by Spaniards. It never existed in the "New World" before their arrival. It's as foreign as it can get.</span>

                    <span>While I'm sure the author is NOT a racist, many of the rave reviewers of his book on this site seem to be ("bronze tide!?!" Good Lord!). Something to consider--what's lost in all of this is the fact that many of the areas of the US in question--in particular, California, the Southwest, and Texas--have long histories of latino and indigenous presence dating from before anglo settlers arrived. A conflict or two fought on dubious pretexts gave this country legal dominion over those territories, but hardly gives us the right to blithely talk about the "newcomers" to "our" land. There are Spanish-speaking families who have lived in the San Joaquin valley for generations, since before the war--it seems a bit rich to call them "foreigners" when they speak the language they always have. And there are the descendents of folks who left those parts during times of conflict and are now coming back. And there are economic refugees fleeing a country whose problems might have more than a little to do with the fact that said country lost half of its national territory in a war with the US as it was attempting to enter modernity, or that millions of its citizens work in low-wage, non-union American factories run by businesses who don't like all the crazy perks that greedy American workers demand--health care, a pension, a living wage etc. The names of the places tell a story too--Los Angeles, San Antonio, San Diego. There's a more complicated history to be considered--and "immigrant" might not be as good a term to use as "returning refugee". Something to think about.</span>
