                    <span>it may not be that common.
<br />
<br />Not that I am being demanding or exceptionally critical, however, the author himself did admit that people nowadays had become so sophisticated that he or she could manipulate his/her own body language that the real meaning behind many of the movements/gestures discussed in the book should be judged by the readers themselves. If that's the case, what's the value of this book then? The content of it is just too simple, if not sometimes naive. I am sorry that I had made a mistake for buying and reading this book.
<br />
<br />For those who want to study about body language, "Never be lied to again by David J. Lieberman" is a much better choice. For those who want to improve their knowledge on courtship and dating, "How to make anyone fall in love with you by Leil Lowndes" will satisfy you well.

                    <span>OK, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. Don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from Lowest Rank First and read all the 1 star reviews as well. That way you can REALLY get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. Sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - "it's great!!" or "its sucks!!" But amongst all the one star reviews I discovered some smart punters whom i SHOULD have read before buying the damn book myself. Yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews I realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. This book is TERRIBLE. It gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. And the photos - MY GOD! Its Mr Steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for "flirting" and "body language" I've ever ever seen. And in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that I find highly disturbing. Yucko. As others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, I would. Avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague. </span>

                    <span>Secrets of Body Language is easy to read and understand. It's a very intuitive book on body language subtleties that you may have not noticed. Dozens of illustrations, good advance on conversation. Great for the well mannered who want to improve of their social graces in their professional lives. Also a great list of resources is included.

                    <span>I just bought this book and I love it.  A good book on "how to" books to pick up women.  It's simple, honest and the author did his research. This book is one of the best books I've read on the subject. There's a lot us guys can learn in this book. The title is accurate. This book is a must have. A great investment. 
<br />Here are othe books I recomment:
<br />1)"How to 'Pick Up' Beautiful Women" by John Eagan - By Far The Best Of All The Dating Books!
<br />2)"U.S.S." by Leil Lowndes.
<br />3)"How to Meet the Right woman" By Roger Ratcliff
<br />4)"Understanding Women" By Romy Miller
<br />You can find more books under the subjects of "how to pick up women", "how to pick up girls" and "dating" on this site.</span>

                    <span>         This book is completely worthless.  It teaches a person absolutely nothing of any value and has intuitive truths that are easily seen even by the most ignorant, unfocused people I know.  His theories on body language are inaccurate astrologicalesque blatherings.  The author has a very powerful belief in his writings which makes it even harder to read knowing that he thinks he is providing people with valuable and useful information.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! </span>
