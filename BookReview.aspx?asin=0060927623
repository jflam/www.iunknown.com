                    <span>D'Este's biography of General Patton is as thorough and balanced a treatment of this great man as I have ever seen. I re-read my old copy of Farago's "Patton: Ordeal and Triumph" (just recently re-printed) afterward, and discovered just how different the two accounts are. Both books are essential reading as they give you different (but not disparate) views of General Patton. Both are unashamedly pro-Patton while acknowledging his human flaws. 
<br />
<br />"Genius For War" attempts to delve more deeply into Patton the man than any previous biography. It also helps to detach the General's story from the image portrayed in the fine 1970 film "Patton." Ultimately there is far more to General Patton than the movie could ever convey. However, "Genius For War" conveys this depth quite well. 
<br />
<br />One comes away from "Genius" feeling that Patton's story has finally been told with far more accuracy. I had only one quibble with the account, and it is of minor consequence. I felt D'Este was too invested in portraying Patton as dyslexic; perhaps his information sources were biased on this matter. While the author quickly dismisses the possiblity that the General may have suffered mild traumatic brain injury (perhaps from numerous falls from horses), his descriptions of the General's behavior actually raise this as a credible possibility. While it raises an interesting question, I doubt if 60+ years after the General's passing that anyone will be able to definitively answer that question. 
<br />
<br />This is unquestionably one of the most engrossing, readable biographies I have ever experienced. I give it my strongest recommendation, and thank the author for his efforts. I can think of few books I have enjoyed so much.</span>

                    <span> The best book I have read about one of our most successful and colorful member of the Army Officer's Corp. The Good Colonel has done a great job of blending the big story & kitchen details with some telling points and insight.His writing skill and research are worthy of the highest marks. Altogether Good to Go! </span>

                    <span>Recommend this one.  D'Este is one of my favorite popular history authors and he certainly came through with this one.  Of the many works on Patton I have read, this one seems to catch the soul of the man closer than anyother.  The book is a easy read, comfortable and extremely informative. This is one of those I will reread soon.  Certainly recommend you add this one to your collection.</span>

                    <span>Many biographies of Patton deal with individual issues as well, and some issues better than, this classic military biography, but in terms of a birth-to-death study this has no equals. It is neither hagiographic nor harsh. It is fair, thorough and informative.</span>

                    <span>Carlo D'Este has written a colossal an exhaustively documented biography of the unparalleled General Patton. 
<br />
<br />He starts portraying Patton's ancestors. In many biographies is usually  neglected  the micro history of the subject. Frequently, as in this case, is essential to understand the character. Patton is the offspring of deep rooted American families. Remarkable warriors populate his lineage. Then is not surprising such a Fighter emerged from that soil.
<br />D'Este follows Patton thru his earlier steps, his education, first at VMI, then at West Point. His struggle with dyslexia and with a physical condition that was not superlative for the burning activity that Patton displayed.
<br />Next: Patton falling in love, marriage and early experiences as Cavalry officer is shown; his first contact with "real war" at Mexico with Pershing's Punitive Expedition; his WWI career with the new tank forces and his meteoric ascension to Colonelcy.
<br />Then the dark and stark interwar period, with the rank reduction included and the regular army boring life is presented in detail. 
<br />Finally the last and more known portion of his life: from Africa, as warrior and diplomat; thru Sicily and the "slapping episode"; the rupture of Normandy's stalemate till the crossing of the Rhine.
<br />
<br />D'Este constructs a solid biography, presenting the "real" Patton with his merits and drawbacks. Patton is neither an icon nor a monster; he is a human being convinced of his destiny and committed to fulfill it.
<br />A superb book to be sure!
