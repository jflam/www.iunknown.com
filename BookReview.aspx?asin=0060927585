                    <span>Panic To Power is a great starting place for those wanting to learn more about stress, anxiety, and more.  Stress leads to anxiety and stress can cause many health problems.  I know because I have been there and my stress turned into Anxiety Disorder, which led to Panic Disorder, severe Panic Attacks, Agoraphobia, Bi-Polar and more.
<br />
<br />This book offers tips on Positive Self-Talk, Self-Esteem, Nutrition, Assertivness, Medication suggestions and so much more.  It is so true to life that you will even laugh and really think hard at times.  I have ordered the Attacting Anxiety program from Midwest Centers which Lucinda started many years ago.  The actual workbook reads, "A Self-help, Self-Awareness Program for Stress, Anxiety, & Depression."
<br />
<br />In case you do not know know; Lucinda has a degree in nursing and her grade point average was 4.0.  Just watching the "Jump Start" tape/CD with her, Dr. Fisher, and others is a sign that there is hope.  I also enjoy listening to the CD lessons.  It is also available in cassette format.  They will work out a payment plan for you and you may request information to be sent to your doctor.  There is a possiblilty that your insurance may cover part of the cost however, you and your doctor may have to do some detective work on that part.  More information is in the "Panic To Power" book on how to do this.
<br />
<br />I highly suggest that you at least check it out.  I learned things by watching the "Jump Start" CD and reading this book that in ten years of treatment with various doctors they never ever told me.  Since I read the book and watched that CD, I am now more involved in my treatment.  When I went to my next therapist visit, I inquired as to why in 10 years not one single doctor or therapist offered this information, which would have kept me from ending up where I am today.  I urge you to order this book and read it.  If you read this book and like it, there is no doubt you will benefit from ordering the program.  Please do not wait, your life is waiting.

                    <span>I am very familiar with the pain of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia for I suffered from these maladies for several decades. During those years of suffering I believed that my problems were purely mental and underwent treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, and hypnotherapists. I took various prescribed medications and read many books such as this, but experienced little relief. And then something wonderful happened: I began taking a daily supplement of chelated magnesium (for a different ailment) and shortly thereafter experienced a significant diminishment of anxiety in addition to cure of the ailment for which I had originally taken the supplemental magnesium. There seemed to be no explanation for why taking supplemental magnesium caused this wonderful loss of anxiety until the publication in 2003 of the important book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean. Early in her book Dr. Dean reveals that a major cause of anxiety and panic attacks is deficiency of magnesium and that magnesium deficiency is quite common in the U.S. Therefore, I beg all sufferers of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia -- whatever else you may do -- please purchase and read The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean and please try the magnesium supplementation which she recommends. It may change your life as has changed mine.</span>

                    <span>I have been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks most of my life, and it got worse after I suffered a series of stressful and traumatic life events. 
<br />Lucinda knows what us nervous wrecks need to hear-- we are not weird, we are not crazy, we are not alone. She has been there, and she can speak the language. She repeats this comforting information often in this book. As a highly anxious person, i need that repetition. The more I hear it, the more I live it and believe it.
<br />She does not say anxiety is your fault, but she does say we create it so we can change it. That is a comfort.
<br />I am making progress, and combined with a good therapist and low doses of an anti anxiety drug when needed, this book has helped me. I have noticed my dependence on medication has decreased. The first day after I read the book, I was drug free the entire day. It was bliss.</span>

                    <span>When I was in my early 20's I suffered terribly from anxiety.  I could not sleep for more than 20 minutes a night and was a walking mess to put it mildly.  Friends and family members kept telling me to snap out of it and traditional therapy really didn't help much either. I ended up purchasing Ms. Basset's tapes from her infomercial and shortly thereafter purchased this book as a supplement.  The book is not as good as the tapes but if you can't afford the tapes then I'd recommend giving the book a chance.  If for nothing else the book will comfort you with the knowledge that anxiety is not a dirty little secret, you aren't crazy and you can do something about your problem.  Within 5 weeks of working on the techniques Ms. Bassett discusses I was able to get myself off of medication that I needed to sleep, be able to drive on major thouroghfares (I was terrified of this previously) and was able to finally respond to people who kept telling me to just get over it.  Obviously this book is not for everyone.  I think it is best geared to those individuals who are just learning about anxiety (as I was at the time). When you are faced with an anxiety disorder I'll be the first to tell you that anything is worth a shot.  You have nothing to lose other than the anxiety itself. Worth taking out of the library if the purchase price is to much for you.  </span>

                    <span>Anxiety and Panic attacks are not a figment of one's own imagination nor are they something to take lightly. They are real and they can drain they very life and soul out of your life. They can cripple you, drain you, and make life not worth living in a very short time, if you don't get a handle on them.
<br />
<br />This book will help you do just that. Although no substitute for her entire programme, Lucinda's book From Panic to Power will get you started on the road to recovery with some knowledge that will help you get your head around what panic anxiety are all about; what can cause it, ways to stop it, ways to maintain your recovery. 
<br />
<br />While not adequate as a "stand alone" resource in my not-so-humble opinion (I purchased her entire 15 tape set complete with videos and manual), this is a good "teaser" that will introduce you to Ms. Bassett's proven method for dealing with Anxiety/Panic for good!
