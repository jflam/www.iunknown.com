Focusing on the publishing, health, finance, music, and design industries, they describe 100 viable computer-oriented home-based enterprises in part 1 and include resources for further information. In part 2, they explain how to use computers to manage finances, fulfill administrative duties, complete marketing chores, and perform other tasks.</span>

                    <span>This is another of Paul and Sarah Edwards'home business books, originally published in 1997. Much of the information here is similar to the computer-related material in their "The Best Home Businesses" book. Unlike the other book, this one has an Index.
<br /> 
<br /> While my comments about their other book obviously hold for this version of that information, the rapid changes in the computer industry make this a trickier buy unless you are already fairly computer savy, in which case you probably wouldn't need it anyway. The tremendous upsurge in outsourcing computer jobs to other countries, as well as sheer technological progress, has changed the face of some of these job categories considerably. You will need to research much more current information before committing to a business mentioned here.
<br /> 
<br /> That said, they do provide a good basic overview of what each business might entail. If you do not know much about computer-based business, this would be a good primer to see if something along that line interests you. I would recommend, however, that you do much more research with current information sources before you make a decision.

                    <span>Warning!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!!<p>It is a complete wast of money.<br>Even though this book was written a few years ago, there is absolutely nothing in it that could even possibly be helpful.   Basically, they just give you a little synopsis of 100 different potential business, from catering, daycare, tutoring, etc ; Businesses that are going to cost you a lot more than you could ever make in profits.   And most of the websites they give you(few and far between) and just about all of the newsgroups they give you are gone.<p>There are many books out there about how to make money at home with your computer, and just save yourself the time and most importantly, the money, and look somewhere else...</span>

                    <span>This was a great, informative book!  If you are thinking of a home business, or already have one in action this is the book for you.  I work from home, but what I got was added ideas that I can combine with my already existing business.<p>There are 100 ideas for computer based business.  Each one has idea's and resources to help you get started.  I found the explanation for each was very detailed and if you have any creativity what so ever you take it and go from the idea's listed.<p>This really was a very useful and resourceful book!</span>

                    <span>Almost every home has a computer these days, and this book gives you good ideas on how to actually make that electronic box more lucrative than playing computer games, surfing the internet, or just a word processor.

                    <span>This is a good book with some good ideas, and it is cross-referenced so that you know what kind of business each idea involves.  There are some ideas that I did not think of, along with additional resources listed.<p>The only problem is that the book is very dated now.  This book was born when the internet was still gaining in popularity.  One of the job descriptions suggests that companies are still unsure of how the internet can best be used.<p>I'd love to see an undated version of this book.  Until then, it's a good, but limited resource for my needs.</span>
