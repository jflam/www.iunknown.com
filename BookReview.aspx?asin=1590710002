                <span id="Label1"><div>Readers of <i>Golf Magazine</i> will immediately recognize Major General (ret.) Sir Richard Gussett, the riotous imaginary uncle featured in David Feherty's column "Sidespin." In this first volume of his misadventures, Gussett sets his sights on the most prestigious prize in golf, the petrified middle finger of St. Andrew, patron saint of Scotland. Presiding over Scrought's Wood, the world's most cantankerous golf club, Gussett must motivate his merry band of members through the battles with incontinence, single malt Scotch, peculiar handicaps, and a litany of other unmentionable afflictions in order to seize the finger in a "friendly" competition with their ancient rivals, the dreaded and notorious MacGregor clan.<br><br>Feherty's fanatical fan base will rejoice, the driving range addicted will tee off, the USGA will have "no comment," and anyone who loves the game or knows someone who loves the game will not be able to resist Feherty's storytelling and golfing gravitas. <br></div></span>

                    <span>David Feherty's comic novel about the loveable inhabitants of the Scrought's Wood Golf Club, and their raunchy adventures on and off the links is a pretty funny story, with a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled in amongst piles of bathroom humor.<P>The writing is okay, though it leaves something to be desired, and even the most die-hard Feherty fan will grow weary of the barrage of bathroom jokes. Do we really need to know that a caddy pooped his pants in an airplane once (although the subsequent episode involving that caddy and a red sweatshirt is one of the funnier moments in the book)?<P>I laughed quite a bit at this book, and even if it was a little heavy-handed with the toilet humor, it has some absolutely hilarious moments. If you like golf and David Feherty's sense of humor, then you'll enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>In A Nasty Bit of Rough, by David Feherty, Gussett sets his mind to win the most prestigious prize in golfing history, the finger of St. Anderew, patron saint of Scotland. Though this novel, Gussett goes through battles with peculiar handicaps, single malt scotch, and other afflictions in order to win the finger in a competition with the McGregor clan.<BR> This is a pure delight for those who love the game of golf and for those who like to laugh out loud for hours. If you like an easy book to read and a book that is about raunchy old men, then this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>Forget about the title of this review - golf is just the backdrop for this hilarious book! It would have been just as funny on the shuffle board courts of south Florida. (Hey, there's an idea!) Try as I might to restrain myself to keep from waking my sleeping kids, I laughed out loud about every five minutes as I read A Nasty Bit of Rough! The characters were comical, the dialogue was knee-slapping funny and the story moved at a great pace. My only hope for Christmas this year is that Mr. Feherty isn't done with this oddball crew!</span>

                    <span>David Feherty's fiction book is a book I found enjoyable when I first read it, at least a year ago. I picked it up again, and this time had time to finish it (origianlly it was from the library). The antics of Uncle Dickie and his fight against the evil Scottish clan are some of the greatest I've ever read, which may not seem like a lot from me, but I read a lot. This book is perhaps the greatest golf book of its time. If you enjoy comedy or golf, this is a book for you. I also would like to reccomend "Bermuda Grass" by Keith Miles and "The Putt at the End of The World", by various authors.</span>

                    <span>This story is crazy, bizarre, absolutely unbelievable. And its possibly the funniest book I have ever read. I woke my wife up with belly laughs and had commuters looking at me with disbelief as I roared with laughter on my train. Just thinking of this book puts a smile on my face. A must for all golfers!!!</span>
