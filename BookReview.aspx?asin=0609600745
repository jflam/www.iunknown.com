                <span id="Label1">Much more than merely a book about nothing, this is a concentrated guide to cultivating a sense of serenity. Simple living expert Sarah Ban Breathnach calls it a "charming prescription for harried hearts and overwrought minds" that's "filled with persuasive reminders that we do too much and live too little." From its bits of well-taken wisdom ("Learn to say, 'I don't know,'"), to tranquil seaside photos, to little lessons on how to meditate, procrastinate, even turn a bath or wine tasting into intensely spiritual experiences, <I>The Art of Doing Nothing</I> is bound to help even the most high-strung, PalmPilot-toting folks remember exactly how it feels to fully relax. <I>--Erica Jorgensen</I> </span>

                    <span>The kind of book you will want to keep around to remind yourself that doing nothing could be a full time job. Beautiful writing,simple, memorable exercises. The photography is rich, subtle and deliciously sensual. This little book is intelligent and wise.</span>

                    <span>The author makes a pointed effort of using a tiring collection of little used eight letter words...in combination. End result: endless, rambling sentences. The content is quite dull and uninspiring. Exasperating considering I expected this piece to be a beautiful, pleasant read. To follow the author's recommendation, one must reside near a surplus of speciality and gourmet shops. For those of us in the middle to lower economic range, try a fragrant bubble bath from a local dollar store, lock yourself in the bathroom and listen to music. <BR> The photographer is to be commended for her artistic talent. Although, as a heterosexual female, I would have much prefered a picture of a naked man floating in a pond to that of a naked woman!<BR> The Art of Doing Nothing is worth...nothing. Not your time nor your money.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book in conjunction with "The Art of Imperfection" - and was completely disappointed with both books. This one particularly was, how shall I say, strange? I was expecting to get something out of this book and received nothing. No mind-opening statements, no inspiration, nothing. I wouldn't waste my money again.</span>
