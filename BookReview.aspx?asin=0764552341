Ever wondered how great outfielders get a good jump on an incoming ball?

In their down-to-earth style, they cover all the bases, including:    <ul>    <li>Getting in shape, from warm-ups to free weights    <li>Playing the field: batting, baserunning, pitching, and defense from catcher to shortstop    <li>Landing the best seats in the park    <li>Baseball online, on the air, and on the newsstand    <li>How to play fantasy baseball    <li>How to snag off-the-field baseball jobs    <li>All-time and current Top Ten players, pitchers, fielders, and more    <li>A glossary of &#8220;baseball speak&#8221;    </ul>   <p>   You&#8217;ll get a baseline knowledge&#8212;and find out details and trivia even the most die-hard fans don&#8217;t know. If you&#8217;re looking to walk the walk, or just be able to talk the talk, step up to the plate: <i>Baseball For Dummies</i> delivers the goods.    </span>

                    <span>Joe Morgan is probably one of the more astute baseball minds there is today. For the true baseball fan, his analysis is usually right on the mark and insightful. However, he does not translate well into "...for Dummies" book. I purchased the book for a friend, hoping it would provide a basic understanding. But Morgan gets too in-depth too quickly. The level of explanation is too high for the non-fan (the "dummy") and too low for a true fan.</span>

                    <span>This book is fun to read and very well written. However, it seemed to try too hard to suit all audiences. The danger in that, of course, is that it doesn't do a great job for any one type of reader. I got this book for the basic baseball knowledge it contains--I recently got "hooked" on baseball, and wanted to know more about the rules, how to keep score, how statistics are computed and what they mean. And there is some of that in this book. However, a great deal more of the book is aimed at little leaguers--how to pick out equipment, how to practice, and so on. Then there are the sections on great players. I think the readers who pick up this book are going to want more in-depth information on the particular area they are interested in. So, this book may be your first book on baseball, but it won't be your last! Just whets the appetite, so to speak.<P>The book tries to do too much, and would have better served the reader by concentrating on one area. Nonetheless, Joe Morgan comes across as very knowledgeable and a great guy!</span>

                    <span>Baseball for Dummies covers many different subjects, from great players to practice drills to how to set up a league. It may range over too many subjects - the beginning fan doesn't need to know about practice drills, and a Little Leaguer doesn't need to know about the great players. I think this book is better for novice players than for novice fans.</span>

                    <span>This is a good baseball starter book. It is not "great" as some of the other Dummies books that I have used. Some of it is more involved than I would expect, yet some of the more detailed sections skip important details that should have been included. Still, it is probably one of the better buys in this genre.<P>I have played ball over several decades and I even learned a couple things from this book. The coverage was fairly good and the strategies for the different positions and analysis of their requirements and difficulties was something that only a true professional could provide with conviction.<P>This list of "records that are least likely to be broken" were entertaining and convincing -- some things that I probably would not have thought of.</span>

                    <span>Joe Morgan was a small man who became a Hall of Famer and the greatest second baseman ever by dint of hard work and intelligience. In Baseball for Dummies he translates that intelligience into a comprehensive primer that will captivate baseball novices and diehards. Joe starts with the basics ("This is a baseball..") and gradually moves the reader up to the more nuanced aspects of the game. The book is accessible to anyone who can read, yet it never talks down to the reader. And the prose is lively enough to interest even the most casual fan.<BR>I've seen the other books that try to reveal how baseball should be played. None of them are as informative or focused as the terrific guide.</span>
