                <span id="Label1">As the symbolic heart of Russia, Moscow, which recently celebrated its 850th anniversary, has enjoyed a renaissance as one of the world's great cities. The capital's once somber streets now buzz 24 hours a day with purposeful activity, and joint ventures between east and west have already opened plush new hotels, internationally-stocked shops, and well over 1,000 eating establishments. Her sister-city, St. Petersburg, host of Russia's Golden Age and cradle of revolution, and surely Russia's soul, celebrates its 300th anniversary in 2003. One of the most graceful and well-proportioned cities in the world, filled with baroque and classical architecture, intersected by canals, it is easy to see how St. Petersburg became the inspiration for musicians, artists and writers such as Rimsky-Korsakov, Pushkin and Dostoevsky.  <P>This book contains a wealth of information on the two cities and the regions surrounding them: fully updated histories and cultural connections of the cities, information on finding accommodation, shopping and restaurants, details of museums, architectural landmarks and theatre and comprehensive tours of each city. Also included is an indispensable guide to the Golden Ring, a series of ancient Russian towns set in the stunning countryside around Moscow.  <P>&#149; Second edition of a best-selling guide with detailed cultural, historical, religious and political studies of these fascinating cities &#149; An itinerary to the Golden Ring of ancient Russian towns surrounding Moscow &#149; Indispensable facts and practical information for the traveler &#149; Literary excerpts from writers such as Alexandre Dumas, Alexander Pushkin and Fyodor Dostoevsky &#149; Special topics include essays on the Russian Circus, the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Catherine the Great and the Siege of Leningrad &#149; This edition coincides with the 300th anniversary celebrations of the founding of St. Petersburg &#149; 126 color photos &#149; 16 easy-to-use maps and plans</span>

                    <span>The best way to see any country or city is with a trusted friend, someone who has lived in the place and has a special love for it.Through their intervention you meet the country as if it were a cherished acquaintancce, seeing the most interesting sides of it, tempered by its challenging aspects. Nordbye has been traveling to and within the former USSR for over 25 years. She conveys a love of the country and its people that is as infectious as it is realistic. There is none of the misanthropic cynicism or boundless blind enthusiasm of other travel guides here. Instead, there is everywhere a reveling in the beauty of the country's eclectic, chaotic nature--on one page, we read that Moscow has more casinos than Las Vegas, on the next there is a wonderful historic passage on cows in Red Square. Flip to a random page and you are led to the place that Russia's finest carriages were once built or to the small cemetery where Turgenec is buried...This book is a delight!

                    <span>Friends who've been to Russia kept raving about this book. They found it the old cliche: an indispensable companion for finding their way around. So did I when I eventually followed in their footsteps. And no wonder. Based on information from a person in fourth degree of separation from the author, I found out that Ms. Nordbye has been in and out of Russia on a pretty regular basis since she studied at Moscow U. back when the KGB still bugged your room. Not only does she write travel books, she's also a director of offbeat documentaries and has led many an expedition in and out of Russia, and particularly these two cities, where her knowledge of where to go and what to see has satisfied the narcisisum of even the most jaded Hollywood types. In this book, you get the benefit of Ms. Nordbye's linguistic and historical knowledge as well as a frequent travelers' tips on pop culture, lodging and cusine. If you're going to Russia you're going to go to Moscow and St. Petersburg. BUY THIS BOOK!</span>
