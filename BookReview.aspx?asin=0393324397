                <span id="Label1">This powerful, unsettling book gives us a rare glimpse behind the closed doors of global financial institutions by the winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics.  <P>When it was first published, this national bestseller quickly became a touchstone in the globalization debate. Renowned economist and Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz had a ringside seat for most of the major economic events of the last decade, including stints as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist at the World Bank. Particularly concerned with the plight of the developing nations, he became increasingly disillusioned as he saw the International Monetary Fund and other major institutions put the interests of Wall Street and the financial community ahead of the poorer nations.  <P>Those seeking to understand why globalization has engendered the hostility of protesters in Seattle and Genoa will find the reasons here. While this book includes no simple formula on how to make globalization work, Stiglitz provides a reform agenda that will provoke debate for years to come. Rarely do we get such an insider's analysis of the major institutions of globalization as in this penetrating book. With a new foreword for this paperback edition.</span>

                    <span>As noted on this book's cover, there are few people in a better position to examine the problems of globalization than Joseph Stiglitz. This book is mostly an indictment of the faulty economics of the globalization process, especially as practiced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Despite that focus on the economics, Stiglitz successfully integrates first-hand economic knowledge with the larger issues of globalization, especially social justice in developing countries. <P>His main focus is the poor economics practiced by the IMF in their so-called mission to stabilize world financial markets. Instead, the IMF is guilty of pushing the ideology of free markets, which is not supported by economic data and has little connection to the real world. The free market ideology does not even have credence in the US, as we have social safety nets and economic regulations to protect citizens against market failures. However the IMF, as a condition for monetary aid, forces developing nations to enact simplistic free market systems before they have regulatory structures or institutions in place, leading to all kinds of economic chaos and suffering. Stiglitz provides evidence that such narrow-minded economic bullying by the IMF was a key factor in the Asian financial collapse of the late 90s and the continuing financial anarchy in Russia.<P>The most chilling indictment here is that the IMF and World Bank are less concerned with the development of poor nations, than with religiously pushing the vested interests of their main stakeholders: Wall Street fatcats and financial speculators who make quick profits off currency fluctuations and cheap exports. Meanwhile the nations who follow the IMF's rules, like Bolivia and Thailand, suffer long-term consequences. While his writing style gets repetitive as the book progresses, Stiglitz provides solid evidence of why globalization, at least as practiced by American vested interests, is a cause of great worldwide suffering and resentment against the US.

                    <span>I could not put this book down after I got my hands on it! Mr. Stiglitz is a Nobel Laureate in Economic Science who had the chance to serve both in the Clinton Administration and also in the World Bank. He therefore had much insights and experiences to impart to the readers. This book did not disappoint. It is packed with fascinating anecdotes and his interpretations of the events relating to the global economy, global finance and global institutions during his tenure as an economic adviser to the White House and the Chief Economist at the World Bank. He articulates the original roles of the public institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO and shows how they do not live up to their supposed mandates. He exposes the disastrous policies of the IMF which had led countries after countries, on its crusade to impose the Gospel of Market-Fundamentalism, into desolation and devastation. Martyrs made out of the IMF's ideologically-driven zeal and unaccountable behaviors littered the trail on which the IMF carried out its missionary programs. Dr. Stiglitz also highlighted how the IMF and U.S. Treasury, and the Wall Street embellished their misdeeds with tricly phrases, chopped logics and misinformation; how the U.S. decision-making bodies pushed the developing countries to open up for trade while erecting trade barriers themselves to protect the vested commercial interests in the U.S.'s constituency. The chapters on the East Asian Crisis and the Russian situation are especially fascinating. One inevitably gets drawn into the stories as they unfold in the book. However, this book is far from being a cynical and unconstructive compilation of complaints and indictments. Building a more just, more equitable, and sounder global economic and financial arrangement is in the front and center of the book. Dr. Stiglitz points the way forward with a unique vision and a touching passion. His compassion and his belief in how globalization and economic science can improve the welfare of the poor and the disadvantaged shine through. As a trained economist, I highly recommend this book to all those who are concerned or simply curious about the excesses and the potentials of globalization and its future. This book is full of insights and gems of economic reasoning. For those who have trainings in economics, it is a very good book to show how economic thinking is applied to real world situations. For those who do not know much about economics, read this book slowly will also yield significant dividends in understanding our world and the huge stakes involved in the process of globalization. Five stars!!!</span>

                    <span>There are actually at least four books published in the last eight years with the title "Globalization and its Discontents," and for Joseph Stiglitz's book the title is probably a bit misleading. This is NOT a general indictment of globalization. When it comes to international economics, Stiglitz is the consummate insider: he was recently the chief economist for the World Bank, for crying out loud! You won't find him protesting on the streets at the latest WTO meeting.<P>This book contains something better: a tightly argued, detailed critique of the ideologically-driven free-market policies that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been pushing down the throats of developing nation after developing nation. Stiglitz makes the following major points:<P>* The IMF has a deep faith in the power of free markets to solve all economic woes, and sees the primary historical effect of market intervention as stifling, rather than enabling, the development of truly free markets;<P>* This position of the IMF is, however, poorly supported by the bulk of economic evidence from the last three or four decades of globalization, and more nuanced models of free-market development (some of which were developed by Stiglitz himself) show that an active government role is typically crucial in the development of healthy indigineous free markets;<P>* The conditions under which the IMF makes loans to developing countries generally harm, rather than aid, the short- and long-term economic health of these countries for the lower- and middle-class populations;<P>* IMF-imposed conditions generally ARE good news for foreign investors, whose risk the IMF loans are in effect underwriting;<P>* The economic ministries and cabinates of developed countries themselves, such as the U.S., generally adopt policies much more moderate such as those of the IMF, casting doubt on whether the IMF is really the source of much economic wisdom at all.<P>All these points in a dense yet well-written book that covers cases of African debt, Russia after the fall of communism, the East Asian crisis, and more. The book takes some intellectual energy to read but it's well worth it. I learned a great deal about the last ten years of international economic development, and I recommend Stiglitz's book highly.</span>

                    <span>I have read over 50 books on topics related to economics, and the socio-political aspects of globalization, free-markets, and their history. This topic has, for years, fueled passionate debate among Keynesians and liaise faire economists to name a few. And today, with globalization affecting everyone of every walk-of-life, this debate is making its way into the local coffee shops and hair salons.<BR>Of the 50+ books mentioned, there is not one that I would direct the general population to. Yet it is ever more crucial for the masses to understand how globalization drives the politicians they vote for, who in turn enact the laws that determine how globalization will affect us all.<BR>Dr. Stiglitz's book requires at least a basic education in economics to follow references to John Smith, Keynesian economics, Marginal Utility, and the interplay of state taxes and interest rates, for example.<BR>For those with a basic knowledge of such things, this book is a must read -- for two important reasons:<BR>1) It was written by Noble Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, former economic advisor to the Clinton Administration and Chief Economist at the World Bank. You can no longer argue the topic as a learned individual if you don't read this book (agree with it or not).<BR>2) Whether you believe Dr. Stiglitz has a bone to pick with the IMF, it is difficult to ignore his passion for doing what he believes is right. The overriding theme is Dr. Stiglitz's insistence that organizations driving developing countries toward globalization, through market liberalization, do so with transparency -- allowing proper and constructive critique and debate to play a democratic role in ensuring that scarce resources and the impoverished of the world aren't taken advantage of. <BR>And finally, after reading this book, you will learn how the IMF, World Bank, and others work to indoctrinate developing countries into the world economy. In Dr. Stiglitz's view, reforms are prematurely accelerated to ensure that financiers receive their expected return on investment -- often at the expense of a heavily indebted nation.<BR>Whether you believe this or not, it is plausible, and demonstrable, through history, that the interests of the wealthy have great potential for abusing resources and the less fortunate. With the stage set in this manner, coupled with secretive closed-door meetings at the IMF, it is a conceivable scenario that the IMF has, at times, made matters worse in a weakened economic and heavily indebted country. In researching my master's thesis on globalization, I have corroborated stories and case histories that support Dr. Stiglitz. <BR>Well, heck, you should see how the creditors came after little-ole me when i lost my house to a flood in the same year that I was laid off from my job due to recessionary conditions! Financiers are not in the mercy business.</span>

                    <span>Of all people Joseph Stiglitz is eminently qualified to write this book. His experience and background make him a clear authority on the issues at hand, those of course being the extreme ineptitude of the World Bank and IMF in handling international development. A little research reveals that these two organizations have not always chosen the best path but Stiglitz shows these economic actions with the background information that highlights a frightening level of incompetence. <P>Interestingly, this book points out that these two world powers ultimately only represent the interests of the bankers that control them and have consistently failed to help the poor that they were created to serve. In many cases they have even made bad situations worse using extremely questionable economic prescriptions. Stiglitz gives well referenced examples of spectacular ineptitude that make me surprised these organizations can even exist.<P>However, as the book wears on it becomes clear that Joseph Stiglitz has had a distinguished career as an economist for a very good reason. He knows what's going on and skillfully gives readers access to the seemingly insane inner workings of the World Bank and IMF. The first three chapters are introductory and bring the reader up to speed. This is where the book doesn't do so well. These chapters are boring and essentially repeat the same thing over and over again for three chapters. While I can see the necessity I don't think they work for their intended purpose. I may not have finished the book if it wasn't the only material available at the time.<P>While it misses in the beginning this book really picks up towards the end, the chapters on Russia and the East Asia Crisis are particularly good. Most importantly Stiglitz offers rational, straightforward ways to solve the problems that he outlines here. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the way international finance works. You may want to skip the first two or three chapters though...</span>
