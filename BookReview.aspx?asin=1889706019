                <span id="Label1">Created by a mom for moms and anyone else, Mom's Guide to Football is a handy game-time reference guide that explains the basic rules and terms of football for on-the-go sports moms.  What is a "down" or an "onside kick" or a "blitz"?  Where do "linebackers" play?  These and many other terms, explanations and quick facts are provided in Mom's Guide to Football.  Field graphics for player positions and common referee signals  are also colorfully detailed.  This handy game-time guide is laminated and folds like a map to store in a purse or breast-pocket for the next game!</span>

                    <span>"Mom's Guide to Football" is only a laminated pamphlet; I was disappointed that it was so short. The good part is that the lamination makes it water resistant for using at games. However, the info is brief and can pretty much be memorized easily. Also, $4 for shipping is insane. It should have been sent U.S. Mail for 37 cents - it fits in a business sized envelope. However, it was mailed in a large box. Greatly overpriced and I was greatly disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I bought this guide for a friend of mine who said, "Oh, I love coming to your football games, but I don't know the first thing about the game, so I never know what I'm watching." It has a very high-level outline of basic offense and defense with a description of each position. There's a list of common penalties with brief descriptions. It has a glossary of common terms & a list of football equipment, although the latter seems to be intended for use as a shopping list when Mom goes to the sporting goods store. And it all fold flat like a map!<P>Don't get this for someone who knows what a first down is; that's how high level it is...</span>

                    <span>I bought "Mom's Guide to Football" because my two boys, ages 9 and 11 play in youth football. This handy publication answers all of those little questions I've had about the game, and it makes the game itself more interesting to me now. I even like to watch football with my husband now! The Mom's Guide to Sports series is excellent!</span>
