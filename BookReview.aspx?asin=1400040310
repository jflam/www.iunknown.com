                <span id="Label1">As commander of the Continental army, George Washington united the American colonies, defeated the British army, and became the world's most famous man. But how much do  Americans really know about their first president? Today, as Pulitzer Prize-winner Joseph J. Ellis says in this crackling biography, Americans see their first president on dollar bills, quarters, and Mount Rushmore, but only as "an icon--distant, cold, intimidating." In truth, Washington was a deeply emotional man, but one who prized and practiced self-control (an attribute reinforced during his years on the battlefield).<p>  <p>  Washington first gained recognition as a 21-year-old emissary for the governor of Virginia, braving savage conditions to confront encroaching French forces. As the de facto leader of the American Revolution, he not only won the country's independence, but helped shape its political personality and "topple the monarchical and aristocratic dynasties of the Old World." When the Congress unanimously elected him president, Washington accepted reluctantly, driven by his belief that the union's very viability depended on a powerful central government. In fact, keeping the country together in the face of regional allegiances and the rise of political parties may be his greatest presidential achievement.<p>  <p>  Based on Washington's personal letters and papers, <I>His Excellency</I> is smart and accessible--not to mention relatively brief, in comparison to other encyclopedic presidential tomes. Ellis's short, succinct sentences speak volumes, allowing readers to glimpse the man behind the myth. <I>--Andy Boynton</I><p>  <p>   <p clear="left"> <strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="cc6600">Amazon.com Exclusive Content</font></strong> <br> <strong><span class="GW-dp">Curious about George?</span></strong> <br><I>Amazon.com reveals a few facts about the legendary first president of the United States</I>.<p>   </a><table cellpadding="5" align="left"> <tr> <td> <img bordercolor="black" border="1" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/books/promos/washingtonbust.small.gif"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><font size="-2"> Washington bust by Jean Antoine Houdon. <br>Courtesy of the Mt. Vernon Ladies' Assoc.</font> </td> </tr> </table><p>   1. The famous tale about Washington chopping down the cherry tree ("Father, I cannot tell a lie") is a complete fabrication.<br><p>  <p>  2. George Washington never threw a silver dollar across the Potomac River--in fact, to do so from the shore of his Mount Vernon home would have been physically impossible. <br><p>  <p>  3. George Washington did not wear wooden teeth. His poorly fitting false teeth were in fact made of cow's teeth, human teeth, and elephant ivory set in a lead base.<br><p>  <p>  4. Early in his life, Washington was himself a slave owner. His opinions changed after he commanded a multiracial army in the Revolutionary War.  He eventually came to recognize slavery as "a massive American anomaly."<br><p>  <p>  5. In 1759, having resigned as Virginia's military commander to become a planter, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis. Washington&#146;s marriage to the colony's wealthiest widow dramatically changed his life, catapulting him into Virginia aristocracy.<br><p>  <p>  6. Scholars have discredited suggestions that Washington's marriage to Martha lacked passion, as well as the provocative implications of the well-worn phrase "George Washington slept here."<br><p>  <p>  7. Washington held his first public office when he was 17 years old, as surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia.<br><p>  <p>  8. At age 20, despite no prior military experience, Washington was appointed an adjutant in the Virginia militia, in which he oversaw several militia companies, and was assigned the rank of major.<br><p>  <p>  9. As a Virginia aristocrat, Washington ordered all his coats, shirts, pants, and shoes from London. However, most likely due to the misleading instructions he gave his tailor, the suits almost never fit. Perhaps this is why he appears in an old military uniform in his 1772 portrait.<br><p>  <p>  10. In 1751, during a trip to Barbados with his half-brother Lawrence, Washington was stricken with smallpox and permanently scarred. Fortunately, this early exposure made him immune to the disease that would wipe out colonial troops during the Revolutionary War. <p clear="left"> <strong><span class="GW-dp">Timeline</span></strong> <br> <I>Important dates in George Washington's life</I>.<br> </a><table cellpadding="5" align="right"> <tr> <td> <img bordercolor="black" border="1" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/books/promos/washingtonengraving.small.gif"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><font size="-2"> Engraving of Mount Vernon, 1804.

                    <span>The best biographical work I have encountered in a long time (and certainly not the only one).  Do not miss this.  Instead, ask yourself, if a nation of about 2 million beats a superpower to win independence, writes the best document in legislative history, and survives at an unpresedented scale (unprescedented when taking current factors into account)--when such a feat is accomplished, why NOT learn everything there is to learn about the moovers and shakers of the era?  Sure, he did not do AS MUCH as some others in areas of the overall framework of the constitution, but this is worth reading.  Naturally.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book seemed like it was written by two authors.  One, who wrote the portion that covers events up to the end of the Battle of Yorktown takes great pains to demonize Washington.  The character presented is a power hungry, egotistical, condescending, inept, deceitful, first class jackass.  The author fails to even discuss how such an odious character came to be held in such high esteem by his contemporaries that he was unanimously appointed head of the Continental Army before there even was a Continental Army.  
<br /> 
<br />The second half of the book, starting with the end of the Revolutionary War, takes a completely different approach and praises Washington to no end.  This later characterization makes him out to be the second messiah.  On multiple occasions, the author compares Washington to Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon, Lenin, and Chairman Mao - all of who come up short in comparison to Washington.  The one area that seems to trouble the author and hence the reader was Washington retaining his slaves for the duration of his lifetime.  The author seemed unable to conceive of the values of an Nineteenth Century Virginia Gentlemen and couldn't come to grips with the discordance of so obvious a character flaw in so great a character.</span>

                    <span>I don't really respond to the long reviews, so I'll try to keep this short.  The book was very informative as I didn't really know all that much about the man himself...and after reading it I'm not sure that I know him any better or not.  That is probably exactly the way G-Dub wanted it I suppose.  
<br />
<br />Technically, the book was a little heavy, and meandered towards the end, but overall it kept my attention really well.  The book actually should have probably been a couple hundred pages longer as I felt that some critical moments seemed to be glossed over.  Oh well, I really enjoyed it though.</span>

                    <span>I would pretty much echo the review of Mr. Hanson below.  This is an interesting, well-written book that presents some novel analyses (at least to me) of Washington's character and motives.  But I was left wanting more.  This is certainly not a true biography of George Washington.  If that is what you want, grab Flexner's single-volume "Indispensible Man".  I got more out of it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book graphically brings out Washington's greatness.  From his early years as colonel of the Virginia militia through his service as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Army, his Presidency of the Constitutional Convention and his service as our First President, elected by two unanimous votes of the electors, Washington becomes flesh and bones.  The wooden man that we all remember from school suddenly is human.  And he walks out of the book, truly a great man, head and shoulders above the founding fathers, all of whom were great in their own right.  
<br />
<br />Anyone who loves this USA will come to understand that one man deserves much of the responsibility for what the US has become.
<br />It is apparent that the result came from the slimest of chances.  The colonies were vastly diverse and the central unifying characteristic was their admiration for Washington.  I came to the conclusion Washington was the binding agent that more than anything else held this nation together.  
<br />
<br />This book presented the facts leading to that conclusion.</span>
