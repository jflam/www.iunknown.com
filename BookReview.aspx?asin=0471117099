                <span id="Label1">Cryptographic techniques have applications far beyond the obvious uses of encoding and decoding information. For Internet developers who need to know about capabilities, such as digital signatures, that depend on cryptographic techniques, there's no better overview than <b>Applied Cryptography</b>, the definitive book on the subject. Bruce Schneier covers general classes of cryptographic protocols and then specific techniques, detailing the inner workings of real-world cryptographic algorithms including the Data Encryption Standard and RSA public-key cryptosystems. The book includes source-code listings and extensive advice on the practical aspects of cryptography implementation, such as the importance of generating truly random numbers and of keeping keys secure.</span>

                    <span>Most books that focus on cryptography tend to be academic and very dry reading. Not this one; Schneier has crafted an easy to read book that covers cryptographic techniques and issues.<P>The book is divided into four major sections: Cryptographic Protocols, Cryptographic Techniques, Cryptographic Algorithms, and a section called "The Real World" that discusses examples of how cryptographic protocols and algorithms are actually used. It also discusses political issues.<P>The book contains the source code (in printed form) to many of the algorithms discussed in the book. The algorithms include: DES, IDEA, Blowfish, RC5, SEAL and others.</span>

                    <span>I will have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this book finesses a bit on number theory and some of the other mathematical fundamentals of cryptography. I am not dissapointed by this, however. After all the title of the book is "Applied Cryptography."<P>Schneier gives the reader a lot for his/her money. The books is well written and an easy (considering the subject matter) and interesting read as well. "Applied Cryptography" covers a lot of territory - you get the basics of cryptographic theory, detailed treatment of many of the most commonly implemented cryptographic algorithms and protocols (including their potential weaknesses), and lots of source code.<P>If you want to know the sordid details about number theory or pseudo random numbers, there are plenty of books in print that go into great (and often laborious) detail on these subjects. The title says it all -- this is an excellent book on applied cryptography!</span>

                    <span>Over the long term, this is the applied math book that I come back to most often. <P>The first quarter of the book may come as a surprise. It's not about encryption, it's about secure protocols. This is great stuff. It includes secure key exchange, where you and I can agree on an encryption key in a public conversation, but none of the other listeners know what we agreed on. It includes zero-knowledge proofs, ways of establishing authorization without releasing your identity. It includes lots more, as well. The next brief section discusses different modes for using encryption algorithms, key management, and other logistics. <P>The third section is what you might have expected: detailed descriptions of many encryption schemes, taking up at least half the book. That includes public key schemes, private key codes, secure hashing algorithms, and all the other details needed for implementing the algorithms. One of the most useful subsections here is a set of pseudorandom number generators. It's not exhaustive, by any means - it omits the Mersenne Twister, for example. Still, it gives a fair set of algorithms, some of which are "cryptographically secure". That means the generator's output strongly resists attempts to find regularities, just the way a truly random sequence would.<P>The last two chapters give a brief summary of the practice, legalities, and even culture around cryptography.<P>This won't make you into a crypto professional. Despite its 600+ pages, it barely introduces the world of crypto and certainly doesn't release anything from the "closed" world of government agencies. It will, however, give you useful algorithms, a basic background, and an appreciation of just what real crypto is about. That last may be the most important part. Too many people think inventing a good code is like making love: anyone can do it, and they instinctively do it better than most people. Wrong! Real crypto is not for dabblers, and this book gives some sense of what is involved.<P>The first edition of "Applied Cryptography" was a landmark text, but the second edition is even better. It's so much better that, if you just have the first edition, you really should upgrade to the second, and I've never said that about any other book.</span>

                    <span>If you want to buy a book which is a wonderful introduction to cryptography, then you have just found it. <BR>Many books suffer from excessive bloat where the author tries to be everything to everybody. <BR>This book is not one of them.<BR>It's lean and clean and it'll turn you into a mean cryptographic machine. <P>Some reviewrs seem to berate the author for:<BR>a) losing his job<BR>b) trying to make a buck by writing books<BR>c) not writing a mathematical tome<P>Well, I have some news for you:<BR>a) Anyone can get laid off from any job at any time - period.<BR>b) All authors write books for money.<BR>c) The author clearly states at the beginning of the book under the heading, How to read this book - 'I wrote Applied Cryptography to be both a lively introduction to the field of cryptography and a comprehensive reference...This book is not intended to be a mathematical text.' <P>Need I say more.</span>
