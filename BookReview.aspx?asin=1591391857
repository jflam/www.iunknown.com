                <span id="Label1">A Framework for Predicting Industry Winners and Losers  <P>Every day, individuals take action based on how they believe innovation will change industries. Yet these beliefs are largely based on guesswork and incomplete data, and lead to costly errors in judgment.  <P>Now, internationally renowned innovation expert Clayton M. Christensen and his research partners Scott D. Anthony and Erik A. Roth present a groundbreaking framework for predicting outcomes in the evolution of any industry. Based on proven theories outlined in Christensen's landmark books <I>The Innovator's Dilemma</I> and <I>The Innovator's Solution</I>, <I>Seeing What's Next</I> offers a practical, three-part model that helps decision-makers spot the signals of industry change, determine the outcome of competitive battles, and assess whether a firm's actions will ensure or threaten future success. Through in-depth case studies of industries from aviation to health care, the authors illustrate the predictive power of innovation theory in action.  <P>A unique, "outside-in" perspective on industry change, <I>Seeing What's Next</I> will help executives, analysts, and investors develop invaluable intuition into the future that matters to them.</span>

                    <span>Theories of innovation and industry change all too often lie in back rooms and in schoolrooms: that's why Clay Christensen, Scott Anthony and Eric Roth's practical model is so important. Decision-makers will find Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change is directly applicable to business forecasting, from understanding the initial signals of industry change to determining the effects of competition and future success. Chapters will teach a range of readers, whether they be mutual fund managers, senior executives, or business owners. The in-depth industry case studies cement theory with fact.

                    <span>I found this book to be, at best, a cheap alternative to an expensive consulting firm.  The material the authors cover in Seeing What's Next is so basic that if managers don't already understand and use these "theories" then they're working for companies who don't care about their business or they've been fired.  This book is perfect for the business novice who will get giddy at reading all the academic hyperbole and bloated expressions like "conservation of integration".  It addresses issues that have been the concerns of companies since their inception and if companies are still here it's because they understand the authors' so-called brilliant theories, again, I emphasize how basic the concepts in this book are.  Also, if companies are too blind or arrogant to not follow the basic guidelines of survival in their chosen industry then who cares if they die.  Isn't that the point of business?  Not everyone can be a success story.

                    <span>This book is not only a logical extension of the Prof Christensen's previous two books, but is also a book that excels on its own. The first few chapters reinforce the theories on Innovation and quickly leads us to a framework for analysis in line with the title. Sensing Change, Competitive Battles, Non-market forces and Strategic Choices are the four dimensions of this framework that apply the principles of Disruptive Innovation. Using this framework it is not only interesting as to how the authors are able to explain the outcomes in the past but also enable us to forecast the future of competitive battles and technology trajectories with reasonable accuracy. The authors do mention at the end of the book that there will be exceptions that may not fit into this theoretical framework, but the aim of all theories is to improve our understanding of the phenomenon under study. If this is the definition and objective of a sound theory, this book meets this goal. 
<br />
<br />Is it possible to evolve a quantitative model that can be used as a tool for answering important questions on technology and competition based on this theory ? In my opinion it worth attempting one even if such a tool lacks perfection in the first attempt. This model by itself might be disruptive in nature and can quickly climb the path of improvement in accuracy.
<br />
<br />Five industries are analyzed in detail in this book - Education, Health Care, Aviation, Semi Conductors and Telecom in addition to a chapter on global competitiveness of companies and countries. These chapters and detailed, and explain the technological issues with simplicity for a non-technocrat to understand. At the end there is a quick summary of concepts used in this book , which can be termed as an executive summary of The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution in one chapter.
<br />
<br />One Industry that is conspicuous by its absence in the detailed analysis of this book is the Automobile Industry. In the earlier books there were references to disruptive technologies in this sector - the electric car for example. The recent abrupt rise in oil prices, international concerns on the politics and shortage of  this fuel, and the vast demand for meeting transportation needs in developing countries at low cost makes this industry a fertile ground for disruptive innovation. Has this industry overshot the needs of mass users ? What would be the structure of this industry in a scenario of imminent modularization ? Which companies are likely to adopt disruptive strategies in un-served markets ? What will be the technologies and how will incumbents respond ? What strategies would auto component suppliers adopt ? Is the under $ 2000 car a possibility ? Will there be free standing value networks for such products that will be ignored by incumbents in large developing markets ?. This book certainly provides us a good framework to answer such questions and is bound to generate such debates in many other industries not covered in the book.</span>

                    <span>A stunningly good book. If you were disappointed at The Innovator's Solution, Christensen and team certainly deliver in Seeing What's Next. This is an intensely theoretically book so it is not to all tastes, and it takes a long time to digest. The analytics and case studies used are rudimentary, but the conceptual frameworks will have true strategists buzzing. Departing from his usual formula, Christensen and co-authors Scott Anthony and Erik Roth, aim Seeing What's Next at those who watch industries from the outside and must make important decisions based on what they see. By contrast The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution were aimed at managers inside firms who wanted to defend against or attack with a disruption. 
<br />
<br />In this book, the authors proclaim that good theory provides a robust way to understand important developments, even when data is limited. And theory is even more helpful when there is so much data that it is tough to discern what information really matters. Theory helps to identify signals of change amongst a deluge of meaningless "noise". Three big theoretical frameworks are brought together in this work, as outlined in previous Christensen's books. 
<br />
<br />Firstly the Disruptive Innovation Theory - refers to how new entrants to an industry can use relatively simple, convenient, low-cost innovations to create growth and triumph over powerful incumbents. Disruptive innovation can be of two types: one) low end disruptions which deliver a low priced alternative to customers who are overshot by existing offerings or two) new-market disruptions, which create new growth by making it easier to for people to do something that historically required deep expertise or wealth. 
<br />
<br />Secondly the Resources, Processes and Values Theory - that helps to explain why existing companies have such difficultly in grappling with disruptive innovations. The theory holds that resources (what an organization has), processes (how work is done), and values (the criteria by which resources are allocated) collectively define the organization's strengths as well as its weaknesses and blind spots. 
<br />
<br />Thirdly the Value Chain Evolution Theory - this framework helps to assess whether an organization has made the organizational design choices to compete successfully. The golden rule underlying this theory is that companies ought to control any activity or combination of activities within the value chain that drive performance along the dimensions that matter most to customers. In other words, they should integrate to improve performance along dimensions that are "not good enough" for what customers need and outsource what is "more that good enough" (those features and improvements that customer don't need and won't pay more to use). 
<br />
<br />Combining these three models will achieve a process for "looking ahead, and working backwards", as ManyWorlds CEO Steve Flinn would say. Combine this approach with the StrategySpace model, to ensure that your organization is not trying to inhabit the same "strategyspace" as current or future players in your marketspace and you have an excellent recipe for success. Of course it all comes down to execution, and theories are impotent until they are used, but if you can see what's next, you are half way there.</span>
