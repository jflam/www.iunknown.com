                <span id="Label1">"Bein' a idiot is no box of chocolates," but "at least I ain't led no hum-drum life," says Forrest Gump, the lovable, surprisingly savvy hero of this wonderful comic tale.  When the University of Alabama's football team drafts Forrest and makes him a star, that's only the beginning!  He flunks out--and goes on to be a Vietnam war hero, a world-class Ping-Pong player, a wrestler, and a business tycoon.  He compares battle scars with Lyndon Johnson, discovers the truth about Richard Nixon, and suffers the ups and downs of true love.  Now, Forrest Gump's telling all--in a madcap, screwball romp through three decades of the American landscape.  It's Gump's amazing travels...and you've got to hear them to believe them.</span>

                    <span>To start off, I'm reviewing the movie, not the DVD, since I've only seen this movie through rentals. Anyway, let's begin. <P>I never really thought that this movie was going to be very good until I saw it. However, when I watched this movie on a bus trip, I thought it was one of the best that I've ever seen. <P>This movie stars Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, who is a little bit mentally retarded, just below normal. After having a youth that most people wish they had when they get older, Forrest Gump becomes a college football hero, a Medal of Honor recipient, a shrimp boat captain, a shrimp boat company owner, a famous runner, and eventually a Daddy. Throughout his life, Forrest has been obsessed with a long time friend called Jenny, who he eventually marries. Jenny, who is played by Robin Wright Penn, is a girl who was once sexualy abused and lived with a relative most of her life. Throughout her some what screwed up life, she becomes a hippi and hints at commiting suicide several times. Other actors are Gary Sinise as LT. Dan Taylor, Mykelti Williamson as Pfc Benjamin Buford "Bubba" Blue, and Sally Field as Mrs. Gump. Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, John Lennon, and Richard Nixon are just some of the many historical figures in this movie. <P>I was amazed at how well put together this movie was. The direction was very good, and all of the actors were well cut out for their roles. I haven't read the book yet, but if it produced such a great movie, than it's obviously very good. An obvious choice for Best Picture.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Forrest Gump is a brilliantly executed film. From the first frame following a fluttering feather to the Forrest family finale. Director Robert Zemeckis craftily uses music, visuals and attitudes to take the viewer on a tour of three turbulent decades. Along the way he displays a cool hand for comedy and technology. The stand-out scenes in the film involve idiot savant Forrest meeting several Presidents and other celebrities. This is done by computer morphing "Forrest footage" in with the original archive footage. This deluxe DVD includes 2 new encounters, one with Forrest meeting Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other with Forrest playing Ping Pong with George Bush (Sr.). The filmmakers use special effects quite often to relay a very human story to us, and although they appeared better on the big screen, they still remain ground-breaking. FORREST GUMP offers across the board wonderful performances. Standouts include Sally Field as Mama Gump, Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan Taylor and Tom Hanks in the title role. This DVD set joins those few excellent DVDs that offer a plethora of great material that if you were to watch the film, all the documentaries, all the commentaries and visit all the galleries, it would take several informative hours. Still, with all of these glowing remarks I can only give the film 4 stars. What brings it down is the extreme, episodic storyline. Forrest Gump is what screenwriters call a 'traveling angel.' A character who doesn't change drastically over the course of the film but instead, changes several people around. Forrest touches several people on-screen from the obvious Mama Gump and wartime freind Lieutenant Dan to the less obvious teeshirt vendor, "Bear" Bryant, and President Richard Nixon... But, most of the stories magical energies are drained by the relationship with childhood sweetheart Jenny, one filled with total negative reality. This is also apparent in the screenplays use of asassination and death to benchmark the film. Both good screenplay devices but, the social comments are in no way enlightening Still, FORREST GUMP is an exceptional film in and out. Zemeckis who also helmed the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy has found a great dramatic cross-over film here. Watch for Young Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, A.I.) auditioning for Young Forrest! And that's all I have to say about that.</span>

                    <span>Tom Hanks at his best. A very intelligent comedy and one of the best reviews of 20th century America in a very light hearted way. Fully deservant of the shower of Oscars it received. Must have!</span>

                    <span>The first time I saw this film, I was amazed beyond beleife. Tom Hanks is outstanding as Forest Gump, and every sapporting actor was perfect for the role. This movie has so many memorable lines in it, its almost insane. This movie is almost a modern day Rocky, in which it shows what one man could do with his life, and what we should do with our lives. Easily deserved every reward it got.</span>
