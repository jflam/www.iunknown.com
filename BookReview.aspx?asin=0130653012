                    <span>Please, if you have a choice of textbooks, do NOT buy this one. I have a feeling the author knows nothing of eCommerce, yet was given 80 references, told to mash them together as non-sensically as possible and fire the result off to the publisher.<br>I've worked in eCommerce for a number of years and this book is a total waste of time and money. Many "industry terms" used do not exist. The author contradicts himself on a number of occasions. Many of the charts and illustrations are good for a laugh. I truly feel sorry for people who have this book as their introduction to eCommerce. You're going to come away with a lot of mangled/antiquated theories, and a bunch of "facts" that are just plain wrong. I'm sorry to say I had to memorize all of this junk in order to get an A in my course. As soon as I handed that exam in, I made a concerted effort to forget everything I read in this text.</span>

                    <span>How on earth is it possible to make even the simplest of theories so complicated? The book is absolutely stuffed with useless words and figures. If the authors did not get paid per word, I am sure they could have written a splendid book with one third of the pages. The price is exorbitant, and what you get for more than a hundred dollars is close to nothing. Do NOT buy this book!</span>

                    <span>I am a full time student in a computing program which believe me, requires reading some boring books, but this one takes the cake. The way it was written simply does not flow. It was the only textbook I have read so far that literally put me to sleep. The content is very repetetive, and features graphs that are truley unintelligable. Skip this book unless you absolutely must purchase it for school.</span>
