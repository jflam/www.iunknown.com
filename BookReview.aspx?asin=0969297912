                    <span>As an admirer of native art and a novice carver, I have found new appreciation for this beautiful art form. This book (and it's companion, Learning by Designing) have provided a means for me to advance my skills as well as become more familiar with some of the features making northwest native art geographically unique. It provides ample and readily usable information. After only a short time, I am applying design concepts to my own work. The two books complement each other very well, and I eagerly await the next volume.<P> I would like to recommend this book to anyone working with native art themes as well as those who appreciate or collect it.<P> Thank You for the wonderful material!</span>

                    <span>While visiting the Northwest Coast of British Columbia we wanted to learn more about the art styles and methods of drawing NW Native Indian art. This book, along with Learning by Designing (from Raven Publishing) were our favourites. Because of its step by step methods and sample drawings we were able to easily re-create and paint our own authentic designs. We highly recommend these books.</span>

                    <span>This book is geared more toward an educational reference tool for elementary and high school teachers. However, it works just as well as a self-teaching guide for beginners. I look forward to trying some of the exercises myself.</span>
