                <span id="Label1">Experts have spent their careers investigating what makes people happy. While their methods are sound and their conclusions valuable, the results often remain hidden in obscure scholarly journals.&#11;&#11;At last, social scientist and psychologist David Niven, Ph. D., has cut through the scientific gobbledygook.&#11;&#11;After examining over a thousand of the most recent and important scholarly studies into the psychological traits of happy people and uncovering their most promising discoveries into the causes of happiness.&#11;&#11;Dr. Niven presents 100 easy-to-digest nuggets of advice: &#145;Enjoy what you have.&#146; &#145;Believe in Yourself.&#146; Grounded in science, his approach is fresh, useful, and inspiring.</span>

                    <span>Niven has created a highly readable abstract of the best lessons learned from scientific studies into happiness and life satisfaction. With so much research being done in these areas, it's delightful to see the science applied and presented in a engaging, useful manner.<P>Reading through the brief, concise lessons you'll discover some things you already knew... and a few things you may have wondered about. Plus, you'll get a quick example of how the lesson applies to daily life as well as the reference to the study/research behind each idea. <P>As a professional life coach, I recommend this book to all of my clients and encourage them to use it as a low-cost, year-long self-improvement course by having them read 2 lessons a week and focusing on applying those lessons in their daily lives. <P>This little book is a hidden gem in the field of personal development and self-help. Anyone looking for simple, common-sense, EFFECTIVE ideas to improve their lives will want to read this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for anyone aspiring to heighten his or her level of happiness. It's a book that challenges the spirit, and asks the question; are you ready to jump into a life of happiness, or do you just want to sit on the sidelines? Several times while reading I felt convicted that I wasn't trying my hardest to be happy, when I was finished I felt like I knew what I could to become happier. This compilation of shorts is like a 365-day calendar, everyday a new page to gain inspiration from.<BR>In my opinion it was an awesome anthology. The book was filled with short stories, research facts, and quotes to live by. It gave me an opportunity; happiness is in our lives we just have to reach out and grab it. I felt supported by a few of the stories I read throughout. There was a piece about religion and how you should never let your religious beliefs fade. There are always people out there trying to bring down someone's religious beliefs, this made me feel like I had someone else on my side.<BR> <BR>The book fit into my life. It had the same type of facts in the book as there are in my life. There was another story that talked about being aggressive with your family or friends. Like arguing or just not expressing your feelings how you really feel or want to. Some of my friends tend to be aggressive and I feel like it puts up a barrier between us. When I read this it gave me insight on how to deal with these situations.</span>

                    <span>I could not finish the book as I know there are better ones in the market and would rather spent time reading those. <P>Every chapter I read , did not make me feel that I learned something here and was wondering what really author is trying to convey here.. <BR>I wish i had checked this book at some bookstore before buying.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be an enjoyable read. With all the negativity we hear on the radio and TV, it's important to fill your mind up with some positive thinking stuff once in a while. Reading books like this do just that. Highly recommended. <P>Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated</span>
