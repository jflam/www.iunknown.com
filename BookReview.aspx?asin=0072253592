                    <span>I haven't finished the book yet - in fact, I'm just two chapters in, but the sloppy editing and information design has already irritated me enough to warn others off.  The frequent diagrams often don't match the text that explains them, and even when they do, they're garbled to the point of being too confusing to use.  The topic of data structures is a complex one, and I only partially fault the book's confusing language (things along the lines of "a pointer to a pointer is a variable that points to the contents of another pointer variable"), but the slapdash diagram design is inexcusable.  When I have to stop thinking about the example the diagram is meant to describe just to figure out what the diagram *should* look like, the diagram has failed.</span>

                    <span>This book uses C++ and Java examples. The C++ code is written with good detail, but the Java code lacks in some areas, most notably, linked lists. The authors use the LinkedList class in their example. This is analogous to a cookbook directing someone to buy a jar of Ragu or Prego when preparing a spaghetti dinner.</span>

                    <span>Target Audience<br>Developers who want or need a practical course on data structures in computer programming.<p>Contents<br>This is a practical guide on data structures and how they are used in a programming environment.<p>The book is divided into the following chapters: Memory, Abstract Data Types, and Addresses; The Point About Variables and Pointers; What Is an Array?; Stacks Using an Array; Queues Using an Array; What Is a Linked List?; Stacks Using Linked Lists; Queues Using Linked Lists; Stacks and Queues: Insert, Delete, Peek, Find; What Is a Tree?; What Is a Hashtable?; Final Exam; Answers to Quizzes and Final Exam; Index<p>Review<br>If you went the traditional college route to make it into programming, you no doubt had a course or two on data structures.  But if you're like me and more into the self-taught method, data structures are one of those things you hear about but never probably take the time to understand.  You may use them, but you don't really understand the theory behind what they are and when they should be used.  For you (and me), Data Structures Demystified helps get you up to speed in a practical, straightforward manner.<p>Each chapter follows a standard format.  The subject (such as linked lists) is likened to some real world situation.  The structure is then explained and illustrated in generic terms using C++ or Java code.  The methods necessary to manipulate the data structure are explained, followed by an implementation in both C++ and Java code.  Finally, there's a short quiz at the end to test your understanding of the concepts just discussed.<p>As a Java programmer, I found this book helpful in conceptually fleshing out some of the array constructs that you can use in the language.  While many reference books might tell you that you have a HashMap class along with certain properties and methods, not too many books actually go into any depth about what a hashmap is and how it should be used.  Having an understanding of these "whys" can make all the difference when you're trying to decide how best to structure your program.<p>And if you're tending to shy away from this title thinking it would be too simplistic, don't.  This is not an entertainment book that treats you like a newbie.  You'll have to think about what you're reading, and it will take some effort to understand the details.  But it's all presented clearly, so at least you have a chance if you're not Einstein to begin with.<p>Conclusion<br>This book is very good for C++ and Java programmers who have not taken formal courses in data structures, and need a better understanding of the subject.</span>

                    <span>If you are the beginner who wants to learn data structure,I recommend that you should read this book first. This book will explain and teach you in step by step of data structure with good and clear examples. Moreover at the end of each chapter, there are exams to help you to remember the main topic of each chapter. However if you have the basic knowledge in C/C++ and Java, you can read and understand this book faster because this book provides the example with C/C++ and Java.</span>
