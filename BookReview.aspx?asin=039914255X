                <span id="Label1">If you've ever wondered why the latest fad diet doesn't work for you... well, there are lots of reasons, mostly the fact that it's a fad diet. But it could also be that you're the wrong blood type for the kinds of foods the diet recommends. Peter D'Adamo makes a persuasive argument that your blood type is an evolutionary marker that tells you which foods you'll process best, and which will be useless calories. He covers the entire range for each of the four blood types, from entr&eacute;es to condiments and seasonings, and also makes type-specific exercise and lifestyle recommendations. </span>

                    <span>I bought this book when it first came out based on on-line advise that I read on a Zone diet message board. Having reached a dieting plateau, I was interested in discovering what else I could do in order to reach my goal of a healthy weight while still feeling good.<BR> More recently, I saw an alternative medicine physician who vehemently advocated a combination of the Zone portions and meal frequencies with the ER4YT philosophy. As a type A, I supposedly could easily and according to the book should, become a vegetarian. Red meat for me, is taboo as are wheat products and all manner of other supposedly healthy foods given thumbs up by other health guru standards. For instance, growing up on Long Island, I always enjoyed fresh flounder and clam chowder---well, forget it---these foods are to be avoided on ER4YT for blood type A. D'Adamo instructs type As to eat more tofu and soy--and this seems to correspond to current traditional medical and health trends. However, while some things make sense, other things do not; I find that overall I am puzzled as to why some foods aggitate the system and others do not.<BR> While D'Adamo's history of blood types is facinating, I wonder just how valid it all is in terms of his actual research premise. If his premise on lectins and agglutination is valid, why doesn't someone from traditional medicine research its claims and comment on it? Should I acquiesce to the usual conspiracy theory that warring schools of thought fight dirty and neither should be accepted as fonts of actual truth? <BR>Bottom line: for the virgin dabbling in current cult dietary best-sellers, this diet will be difficult to follow--there are just too many rules and regulations. For those who have already tried alternative grains and vegetable based proteins, the road will be a little easier, but still rocky until all the rules are commited to memory. D'Adamo doesn't really get into portions, if he does, forgive my relapse in memory. If you follow the guidelines regarding portion size and meal frequency as outlined by Barry Sears and the Zone, you should lose weight. If not, hormones and how they affect hunger, health and weight gain are not touched upon in this book and I believe should be. <BR><BR>I also question D'Adamo's premise regarding the different exercise that should be done by the varying blood types. What is this based upon? In his lifetime, how has D'Adamo proved that lighter exercise like yoga and tai chi is better for Type As? <BR><BR>On the positive side, a friend related a situation of an acquaintance who was tired and had digestive problems. She recommended D'Adamo's book---after eliminating the foods on the AVOID list for her blood type, this person made a complete 180 turnaround; she felt better and her digestive problems ended, astounding her medical doctors. <BR><BR>If it works---great---but I feel as if I need more information backing up D'Adamo's premise. If any experts have any, I'd love to hear it.</span>

                    <span>While working in a health food store in Wichita, Kansas about a year and a half ago, I was exposed to Dr.D'Adamo's book. It took me a while to decide to take small bited of his recommended diet for my blood type. Quit frankly it seemed to me that I would have to give up every food I liked, and that staying on this program was a jail sentence which I was most likely to abort in a few short days. The theory made a lot of sense, but after many years of "yo-yo" dieting, I must admit I thought this was just the latest diet fad. I felt that I needed to do something about the way I was feeling both physically, and emotionally. I decided to make some suggested changes a bit at a time, finding at one point that I was ready to make a full commitment to the doctors advice, as I had started to feel better, and wanted to see if what I was experiencing could possibly get even better. I went to my family doctor who agreed to support me in my efforts, after she agreed to read the book! She took base line blood work,checked my vital signs, including a physical. She found that my blood pressure was too high, my triglyceride level was unacceptable, cholesterol was elevated, and my energy level was extremely low. I had complaints of leg cramps, fatigue,irritable bowel syndrome,depression,and carbohydrate cravings. I had also put on over 50 pounds in the past 3 years. Being 50 years old I was also struggling with postmenopausal symptoms. After 20 weeks of following Dr. D'Adamo's suggestions many of my symptoms subsided, and much to my delight I have dropped 27 pounds. I am even more motivated to continue my eating life style changes due to the drastic changes I have obtained. I highly recommend for anyone to explore this wonderful perscription for staying healthy, and see what taking control of your life feels like. The rewards are well worth the personal commitment toward living longer and, having the quality of life that makes you want to face every new day.</span>

                    <span>I had been a vegetarian for a few years, and my energy level was low. I also was having digestion problems, specifically acid reflux. There were some other problems also. A friend told me about this book, and I bless her. I bought the book, and it was a revelation. I started eating according to the book for my "O" type. I feel a lot better. Half my maternal grandmother's stomach was removed because of bleeding ulcers. Now I don't have to deal with that, just eat right for my type. I am very happy and thankful Dr D'Adamo wrote the books.</span>

                    <span>I recently finished Eat Right for a second time to be sure that I was selecting the right foods for my blood type and to understand more about the D'Adamo research. Well, the verdict is in...I've tried the highly beneficial, the neutral and the avoid foods alone and found that I have exactly the types of reactions that were stated in the book. With the beneficial and neutral foods I can exercise longer without breathing problems. With the avoid foods I break out in hives, wow who knew!!! Highly beneficial information, great piece of work.</span>
