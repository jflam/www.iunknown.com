                <span id="Label1">Named one of the best books of the year by the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, Business Week, and GQ, THE CHIEF: THE LIFE OF WILLIAM RANDLOPH HEARST is "an absorbing and ingeniously organized biography . . . of the most powerful publisher America has ever known" (New York Times Book Review). Drawing on papers and interviews that were previously unavailable, as well as on newly released documentation of interactions with such figures as Hitler, Mussolini, Churchill, every president from Grover Cleveland to Franklin Roosevelt, and movie giants Louis B. Mayer, Jack Warner, and Irving Thalberg, David Nasaw completes the picture of this colossal American "engagingly, lucidly and fair-mindedly" (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.).      "Outstandingly researched, elegantly but not flamboyantly written, and fair in its conclusions about Hearst"s astonishing career" (Wall Street Journal), THE CHIEF "must be regarded as the definitive study . . . It"s hard to imagine a more complete rendering of Hearst"s life" (Business Week).</span>

                    <span>For most people who know Hearst only through "Citizen Kane," this will be an informative book. Thankfully, Nasaw keeps his discussion of "Kane" restricted to a somewhat brief chapter towards the end of the book. In the larger context of Hearst's life, the "Kane" episode is a minor chapter at best.<P>I suppose enough bad things have been written about Hearst that Nasaw did not feel the need to write about all of the warts. He seems more sympathetic than is necessary towards a man who, among other things, was not a particularly good father, held whatever political views were convenient for him at the time, and who was wastefully excessive to a stunning degree. When writing about Hearst's bankruptcy and subsequent re-organization of assets under a trustee, Nasaw almost seems to feel that Hearst is being treated unfairly at times.<P>The one thing missing from the book that I would have enjoyed is a more thorough discussion of the competition between Hearst and men such as the Pulitzers, McCormick, and Ochs. The source of the man's influence was his newspapers, after all. A more in-depth discussion of the newspaper industry would not have been out of place.<P>All in all, this is an informative book, as Hearst becomes more a part of history.</span>

                    <span>A couple of years ago, the American Film Institute called Citizen Kane the best movie ever created. If the revival of Citizen Kane (based on Hearst) never happened, it is unlikely that this book would have been published. Still, Nasaw writes a compelling work. It's intimidating at 800+ pages, but it is interesting enough to get through in a few weeks without prodigious effort. <P> Hearst lived an exciting life of wealth and travel since his birth, and this book doesn't leave out an ounce of his peripatetic existence. Although it is easy to tell Nasaw has an obliging respect for the man (why else would he write the book?) and enough new findings to make this worth a book, you get the sense that Hearst just wasn't very good at business. He seemed to succeed by way of his personal charm and off-the-cuff style. Even if you have little interest in business, there is enough in this book about Hearst's personality and his accumulation of property and objets d'art to satisfy you. Overall: Well-written and interesting, if a little bit too much of one man -- you often feel that this is a month-by-month account of his life.</span>

                    <span>WRH had interested me as a lesser (and later) addition to the robber baron lists. After reading Nawaw's work I have different picture - that of a man dominated by his mother yet domineering of others, at ease with maintaining a wife on the east coast and mistress on the west, obsessive with his material belongings yet neglectful of his children, never mindful of money yet never short of it, and a defender of personal privacy yet addicted to the spot light. A robber baron? Not so sure about that, but WRH was a baron (in the monarchial sense) no doubt. He lived like a medieval king - constantly pointing out flaws in others and ruling on those where he could, seemingly ignorant of his own contrary ways.<P>The book can be a battle - Mrs H senior was tiresome and WRH did take a long time to reach his stride, but it is never dull and at the end I realised I had finished the most amazing story, all the more so as it is true.</span>

                    <span>If you are at all interested in this man, this is the book to read. My interest started with Orson Wells and led me to "W.R." Mr. Nasaw has pin-pointed the essence of this man and what made him tick, without all the rhetoric of Thomas Ince or the battle over "Citizen Kane." Don't miss the chance to know William Randolph Hearst. A great read.</span>

                    <span>Nasaw's biography of William Randolph Hearst is an easy read. That alone is quite an accomplishment. Like many biographers, you get the sense that the author is in sympathy with his subject, too much so for great chunks of so large a book. We hear detailed accounts of Hearts' continuous aquisitions, from art to newspapers to newspapermen, but Nasaw rarely seems to question Hearsts' grander motives. Was this really a man with a mission, or simply a rather large, intelligent brat? At the root of Hearst lies this question - How could one of the richest men in America declare that he only ever acted in the people's interest. Nasaw appears to swallow Hearsts' own political claims without a problem, that he was free from political affiliations and therefore free of obligations. Yet Nasaw ignores his own evidence. Again and again, we are confronted with Hearst acting out against individuals, corporations and governments with nothing but his own interests at stake. This degree of hypocrisy and selfishness are fascinating aspects of Hearsts' character, but barely addressed by an author more concerned with staking a strong claim for his subject among the crowds of 20th century historical figures.</span>
