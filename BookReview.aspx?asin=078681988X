                    <span>Truly a masterpiece! After many readings, this story still makes me laugh out loud. With only a few simple lines and a minimal amount of dialouge, Mo Willems has created a memorable character in this coniving pigeon who will do anything to drive a bus.<P>The local librarian told me that this book was a big hit at story hour, with the children actively telling the pigeon "No! You can't drive the bus!" Maybe I still have the mind set of a preschooler, because I found it just as entertaining, so much so that my best friend gave it to me for my 43rd birthday. In my opinion, it's one of the best children's books of the year.<P>True story.</span>

                    <span>This is an absolutly funny book. It's as much to read it as it is to hear it being read. It's along the lines of Click, Clack, Moo - you're children will wonder why you're chuckling more than they are</span>

                    <span>The concept of this story is simple: The bus driver has left you the responsibility of watching his bus. Of course, there is a certain pigeon who would really love to take it for a spin and he will try every excuse in the book to get his way. This book is absolutely hilarious! When I read it to a group of children ages 4-11, they all loved it. Whenever the pigeon begged to drive the bus, they all responded with an enthusiastic, "No!" They laughed the entire time and not one child's attention was focused elsewhere. This book is simply a lot of fun!</span>

Anyone can appriciate the cleverness and funniness of Don't Let the Peigion Drive the Bus. Don't pass it up.</span>
