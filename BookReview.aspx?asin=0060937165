                    <span>I believe it was Charles Beard who first called the American Civil War "The Second American Revolution".  Although he was chiefly concerned with the shift in the balance of power from the Southern slaveholders to the Industrial North, modern historians who agree with him see emancipation and the rise of black rights as among the most revolutionary events in American History.
<br />
<br />Eric Foner's work is strictly within this tradition.  Beginning with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, Foner traces the evolution of Reconstruction politics, policies and philosophy.  For Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction was a war measure, an experimental, evolving policy designed to coerce and seduce the South into surrender, and to consolidate emancipation.  Only after Appomattox, in his final speech, did Lincoln publicly endorse limited Black suffrage.
<br />
<br />But for Radical Republicans, during and after the war, reconstruction was part of a grander scheme, consciously revolutionary.  The Radicals wanted to destroy the rebel Slaveholding South, and to build a new South, led by former slaves, freeborn blacks, and genuine Southern unionists.  Going as far as attempting to impeach President Andrew Johnson, whose 'Presidential Reconstruction' practically surrendered Southern states back to the rebels, Radicals undermined the Johnson based regimes, and made sweeping legislation that gave civil rights to the blacks.  The fifteenth Amendment, guaranteeing the right to votes to blacks, surrendered more ground to Nativist and anti-Feminist politics then to Anti-black sentiments (pp. 446-447).
<br />
<br />The only issue upon which Congress failed to enact Radical proposals was land redistribution. The failure to give blacks ownership of the land ensured that the slaveholding classes, although weakened, still dominated Southern life, and in time they were to reestablish control over the South.
<br />
<br />Eric Foner's 'Reconstruction' is, in effect, two books combined as one.  As a political history of America in the decade or so after the war, it is a masterful account, weaving together social, economic, cultural and political elements.  Although Foner is no master of prose, his writing is clear and his logic sound.  At the same time, the book is also a social history of the South during Reconstruction and Redemption.
<br />
<br />Maybe I just dislike social history, but there are several chapters which could have been significantly shortened with little loss to the narrative.  Like much social history I've read, Foner rarely attempts to quantify his conclusions, and the results are often a one line description, followed by a list of illustrations.  Entirely typical are sections such as this:
<br />
<br />'... Republican governors initially employed their influence to defeat civil rights bills... fearing that such measures threaten the attempt to establish their administration's legitimacy by wooing white support.  ... Governor Alcron [of Mississippi] vetoed a bill barring railroads charted by the state from discriminating against black.  In 1872, a measure imposing criminal penalties upon ... discrimination passed the legislature... but was mysteriously lost or stolen on its way to the executive mansion and thus failed to become law.  Florida Gov. Harrison Reed in 1868 vetoed a bill guaranteeing equal treatment on public conveyances, and Warmoth twice rejected civil rights measures passed by the Louisiana legislature.' (p. 370)
<br />
<br />As Southern blacks were battling for their economic and political rights, the Second American Revolution increasingly raised new issues that redrew Northern and national political alliances.  The public grew agitated over Corruption, Labour relations and the choice between fiat or metal currencies.  Initially, the support for Reconstruction was the one unifying plank of all Republicans, but as Southern opposition to Reconstruction did not dwindle, the Northern enthusiasm for supporting black's rights with the bayonet waned.
<br />
<br />In 1870 and 1871, the Grant administration's crack down on the Ku Klux Klan was both effective and popular among Republicans.  But as Republicans identified themselves with other issues (chiefly monetary conservatism), Federal support for Reconstruction governments and military intervention in the South became controversial and politically damaging in the North.  By the 1876 election, Republicans were no longer committed to Reconstruction, and Redemption (the return to the old order) triumphed in the South, with the reemergence of the Jim Crow regime and the Herrenvolk democracy.
<br />
<br />Although Reconstruction was not without lasting achievements, the Southern Counter-revolution undermined much of the political, economic and social advances that blacks won during the Reconstruction era.  Furthermore, the Redeemer platforms of small governments, fixed labor relations and white supremacy spelled economic stagnation for Southern whites as well as blacks (p. 597).
<br />
<br />Isolated circumstances not withstanding, the movement towards equal rights for blacks, commenced in the Reconstruction era, was not really resumed until the 1930s, and was only completed, if at all, by Civil Rights movement of 1950s and 1960s.  As Foner's subtitle indicated, Reconstruction was, and arguably still is, America's Unfinished Revolution

                    <span>Dozens of books have been written about the Civil War, but so few have been written about the period afterward, known as Reconstruction. One picture this book paints is of a 3-way feud among the rich whites (who had owned plantations & slaves before the war), the poor whites (who had been self-sufficient farmers) & the emancipated slaves. The war & Reconstruction changed the lives of all 3 groups forever, not necessarily for the better. For those who want to know more about this chapter of American history than they were taught in high-school & college history classes, this is the definitive book.</span>

                    <span>A major undertaking.  Eric Foner and Leon Litwack (Been in the Storm so Long) have rescued Reconstruction from the dustbin of history.  Each has offered a timely re-exploration into one of the most pivotal periods in American History.  For Foner, Reconstruction represents the often forgotten conclusion to the Civil War, an attempt to address the social injustices that resulted from over two centuries of slavery.  What is even more compelling about Foner's account is that he absorbs the early women's suffrage movement into this early battle for Civil Rights.<p>This remarkably well-researched book gives probably the most thorough examination of Reconstruction to date.  Foner begins in 1863 with the emancipation proclamation, and carries the era through to 1877, when a fateful compromise was reached by Republicans and Democrats which led to the notorious period of Redemption, in which most of the gains during this period of time were nullified.<p>Foner covers a tremendous amount of ground.  He has uncovered old court records and other valuable information, which demonstrate just how active a role Blacks had in Reconstruction.  He notes the seminal work of W.E.B. DuBois (Black Reconstruction in America), which went largely ignored by the "Dunning School," which interpreted Reconstruction as an unmitigated failure in social improvement.  Foner, like DuBois, notes how many beneficial social changes came as a result of Reconstruction such as public health, education and welfare. But the Redeemers could hardly stand to see Blacks in power, and fought tooth and nail to re-establish the old social order in the South, finally winning over the Grant administration, which pardoned the Southern states, and allowed them to regain the political ascendency, much to the chagrin of the Radical Republicans, who had been instrumental in shaping the Civil Rights legislation of this time.<p>This book presents so many revealing portraits.  It is as much a social as it is a political history of Reconstruction.  Of the many compelling stories was the attempt by Blacks to make a thriving concern of the former Jefferson Davis plantation.  Despite the fact that Jefferson Davis' brother had ceded the plantation to the former slaves, the Mississippi courts eventually gave title to Davis' heirs.  During this brief halcyon period, the freedmen had made a success of the plantation, never realized under the Davis administration. Foner offers this case, as well as many others, to demonstrate that the former slaves were fully committed to Reconstruction, and so this as the opportunity to gain the social and political ascendency they had long been denied.<p>One is left to wonder what it might have been like had callous Republicans like Rutherford B. Hayes not sold out Reconstruction, and allowed the process to continue through the late 19th century.  Instead, the Redeemers nullified much of what had been gained, leading to the notorious era of Jim Crow.</span>

                    <span>This is one of those histories that reminds you how wonderful it is to be safely out of school.<p>Guess who Professor Foner has decided to blame for the "failure" of Reconstruction?  The former slaveholders of the South whose descendants still argue that the "Civil War was not about slavery"?  The 1840s immigrants from Europe whose racism was so deep and bitter that it led to the worst riot in American history (the New York City draft riots of 1864)?<p>Of course not.  It was the Republican party - those awful people who brought us the 14th and 15th Amendments.<p>The unpolitically correct fact Professor Foner avoids is that the Union Army was the only effective force in favor of black equality after the Civil War.  State and local governments - both North and South - were indifferent or hostile to the exercise of liberty by blacks and native Americans.  The Freedman's Bureau was only able to do its job because those terrible people in the U.S. Army enforced what we now call civil rights.  <p>Foner is so eager to avoid giving the Army its due that he fails to mention that its leader - Ulysses Grant - was the only President before Eisenhower to believe in black equality as Constitutional right. Without Grant there would have been no Reconstruction.  When he left office (out of deference to the tradition that no President should serve more terms than the 1st one), Reconstruction was finished.<p>It is a measure of Grant's personal popularity that Americans respected his "naive" belief in fundamental equality of all Americans even if a majority of the electorate - North and South - did not share it. It is a measure of the unpopularity of civil rights among white Americans that it has taken more than a century for Grant's reputation to begin to recover from the presumption that only a drunk could think black people were equal.<p>Black people "failed" to gain political equality after the Civil War because the white Americans who had immigrated to the U.S. since 1840 and those who came after the Civil War joined with defeated Southerners to form a political alliance - the "modern" Democratic party - that overwhelmed the Republicans who had passed the 14th and 15th Amendments.<p>To accept the arguments of Foner and his admiring reviewers is to perpetuate the comfortable "radical" fantasy that but for those awful capitalists peace and harmony would be just around the corner.  <p>Readers who are interested in the actual, tragic history of Reconstruction would be well-advised to read Stetson Kennedy's After Appomatox:How the South Won the Civil War and Brooks Simpson's Let Us Have Peace: Ulysses S. Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction 1861-1868.</span>

                    <span>This is an extremely penetrating, yet low key, history of the reconstructed history of Reconstruction, rescued from the legacy of massive distortion in the century-old genre, beginning in the birth times of Jim Crow and the loss of the hopes of the 'second American Revolution'. All one can say is that it might have been worse, the Union might have sundered. The book details all the phases, good and bad, from the birth of the Klu Klux to the great depression of the seventies, and the loss of focus on the task to be completed.</span>
