                <span id="Label1"><p><i>Advanced Java Game Programming</i> teaches you how to create desktop and Internet computer games using the latest Java programming language techniques. Whereas other Java game programming books focus on introductory Java material, this book covers game programming for experienced Java developers.</p>  <p>David Wallace Croft, founder of the Game Developers Java Users Group (GameJUG), has assembled an open source reusable game library&#151;a Swing animation engine that allows developers to use these techniques and put out new games very rapidly.</p>  <p>The open source game library also includes a reusable game deployment framework and a multiplayer networking library with HTTP firewall tunneling capability for applets. All of the code is open source, including the example games. The animation has been scrupulously tested and optimized in the Swing environment, and Croft clearly explains how the code works in great detail. The graphics and audio libraries used in the examples are public domain  and may also be used royalty-free for creating new games.</p> <p></span>

                    <span>Mr Croft explains his game game framework in this book. This framework is capable of handling 2D games via network, especially for mobile games. The book looks old fashing with a cumbersome layout and code examples which take a lot of space. Also the explained code seems to be old fashing, the new features of jdk1.4 are only mentioned about images, while the java.nio package is missing. Only some advanced topics are touched. This book is a good basic to enter the field of game programming in java, but doesn't lead you to the advanced topics.</span>

                    <span>This is not by any rate a book on advanced Java programming! It just has some very ugly 2D swing-based applications (you really cannot call them games..). Avoid like plague. Java game programming is still in a very immature stage but if you' re really, really looking for  a decent book on Java game programming try "Developing games in Java" by David Brackeen.</span>

                    <span>With my existing passion for online game development, I was very anxious to see what Croft's book had to offer.  I have to say I was very impressed with both the ease of setup and the amount of useful material covered.  Many game development books require hours of initial setup and troubleshooting before ever tinkering with working examples--but thankfully, such is not the case with this book.  Croft did an excellent job developing a working toolkit with great examples.<p>This book goes well beyond simple graphics and sound examples for gaming; Croft explains many more fundamentals of online gaming, such as game architecture, artificial intelligence, and networking via HTTP Tunneling.  I found the Model-View-Controller (MVC) section of game architecture extremely interesting and very powerful.  Croft explains how MVC allows you to create a single environment with multiple views or controllers which all integrate with shared methods.  With such an architecture, you could easily port a 2D game into 3D simply by modifying the View module, for example.<p>The chapters on HTTP Tunneling go into great detail about the importance and ease of use of tunneling, and why it is so important when developing network games.  Using Croft's methods you will be able to avoid the headaches caused by firewalls and ultimately make things much easier for your gamers.<p>Advanced Java Game Programming has really inspired me to continue my development of online games.(...)<p>To sum things up, I highly recommend this book.  With basic knowledge and experience in Java, this book can bring your game development skills to a whole new level.</span>

                    <span>Chapter 1 starts with an overview of some surprising topics. As you would expect, system environment and installation of the game<br>demos used in the book is outlined step by step. <br>Then a brief tutorial on using Ant and the build file provided with the game demo examples used in the book.  If you download the source code for the book, you get a generous 150 classes.  Many of these are utility classes that you'll find conveniently reusable in all types of game development.<p>Then comes the surprising part.  The chapter discusses copyright<br>law and licensing.  If you are developing games for distribution,<br>you need to know these issues.  It was thoughtful of the author to share his knowledge.  The author then shares some sources for<br>obtaining graphics and audio files for use in your games. <p>The author's writing style is easy to read. He neither condescends to your level or talks over your head as in some books when they claim to be for the advanced programmer. The author isn't an ivory tower type that talks in the abstract <br>(a danger since he taught a University course on it). He gets down to the practical! I found his style so enjoyable and down-to-earth that I would always read further in the book than intended in one sitting.<p>Chapter 2 covers frameworks.  How do you want your game to run? The author gives you the flexibility of running as an applet, from Java Web Start, or an executable Jar -- all from one source code set. The chapter shows how to use the HTMLConverter tool to "magically" change your html applet code into plug-in code that gets a later version of Java if needed.  Since you will probably want Java 1.4 to run your games, this is important to do since most browsers don't yet support Java 1.4 and thus need the download.<p>Chapter 3 is the beginning of several chapters on animation. This is where the fun starts.  You'll learn techniques for faster screen repainting, smooth animation (versus jerky), and effective use of frame rates.  The game demo code lets you try out the effects of your performance enhancements.<p>Later chapters in the book cover game architecture, game algorithms, game data persistence, etc.<p>In summary, this book excellently covers what a game developer needs to know to get started developing games for distribution via the web or through jars. The book describes games that can be singly played on a desktop or multiply played via the web. This book is a must read for any serious game developer. Its content is right up to date as it is based on the latest Java 1.4 API. Applet developers who don't write games will also learn some good tips for deployment, animation, and http connections.</span>

                    <span>As the title indicates, this book is for advanced Java game programmers. If you are looking for a book to introduce you to the fundamentals of Java game programming, you probably want to start off with another book first. But if you are an experienced game programmer, with a few games already under your belt, this book is a must read.<p>The author deals with numerous topics that are at the heart of effective game programming. The sections I found most pertinent were those covering deployment options, swing animation, frame rate issues, and http network communication. In each section the author identifies the potential problems and pitfalls, discusses several options to deal with these issues, and then proceeds to show through his framework how he addresses these problems. The writing is clear and concise, and the code samples from the author's framework illustrate the concepts well.<p>One thing that I don't like about a lot of Java game programming books is that they spend a lot of time talking about how to develop your game ideas.  While this is important, many advanced game programmers are simply looking for sound advice to improve their underlining game design and performance.  The author does a great job of speaking to this audience in dealing with the issues and problems we all face.  Many of the issues discussed rang true to me as I remembered struggling to find solutions to the very same problems.  The author's framework serves as a good foundation upon which to build your own games.<p>The only thing I wish was covered was the use of 3D in Java games. This is a huge topic with a number of pitfalls and probably would require a book of its own. This really doesn't detract from my overall view of the book though, as what the book does cover is covered very well.<p>Overall this book is very well done and I would recommend it to all serious Java game programmers.</span>
