                <span id="Label1">Michael Byrne's <I>Setting Tile</I> is packed with more than enough information for those thinking of taking on a tile job in their home. It is so detailed and thorough that it serves as a Tile 101 introduction for those interested in entering the trade full-time or simply improving their skills and knowledge. Byrne opens this revised and updated version of his previous effort with a brief description of how tile was made 6,000 years ago. Granted, the history lesson may not help someone who's planning to tile a kitchen counter, but Byrne's passion and interest for the subject pay off for the reader in other ways. He advises his readers, for example, that even after they've found the right tile for the bathroom floor or kitchen counter--the one that is just the right color and that the manufacturer recommends--to take those tiles and put them through a few of their own tests. Rub it with your favorite frying pan to see how easily it's marked up and, in turn, cleaned off. Scuff it with junior's hiking boots to see how it endures a day in the life. "I tell my customers in the end that, no matter what grade of tile they select, they can be the best judge of a tile's suitability." Byrne devotes chapters to materials, tools and safety, troubleshooting and repairs, and surface preparation. And in his chapter stressing the importance of doing a proper layout long before setting that first tile, Byrne also gives the reader a few clever ways to check levels, straightedges, and carpenter's squares for accuracy. This is a highly detailed book loaded with technical information that relies equally on photos and illustrations. It's also more about materials and tile samples than completed jobs. Don't buy this book if you're looking for glossy color photos of pristine tile jobs; buy it if you want to learn how to correctly install such jobs. <I>--John Russell</I></span>

                    <span>Doing tile right takes a bit of time and a bit of money.  Most "do-it-yourself" books will give short shrift to tile laying, put in some pretty pictures and make it look easy.  And they your tile will pop up or crack five years later.  Tile should last decades.  And sometimes it can take a lot of work to prepare a surface, and some surfaces shouldn't even be tiled at all.  With that in mind, finding good information and digesting it is a must before taking any steps.
<br />
<br />Michael Byrne's book is very thurough and detailed.  It'll pretty much cover almost any tiling situation.  One reviewer complained that it doesn't offer enough specifics or details on certain applications.  I think the issue here is that there are so many possible substrates, tile types, adhesives, etc. etc. that unless you want an unreadable 1000 page book you'll have to use a little bit of common sense.  Bottom line, you'll get more specific details in this text than anywhere else.  For a specific nagging question there are always online forums.
<br />
<br />Do yourself a favor, get this book and John Bridge's "Tile Your World" before doing a thing.  A 15-minute Home Depot "how-to" seminar can be a dangerous thing - get real useful info instead.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I have never set tile before and I wanted to unlock some of the mysteries that I had concerning tile installations. The book is full of wonderful full color photographs and great advice.  If you are a do it yourself type of person, this book will take you start to finish. I like the thorough discussion of the proper way to do a layout so you never end up with tile slivers on the margin of your installation.  There is a thorough discussion of how to make your installs waterproof, long lasting, and pleasing to the eye.<br>After reading this book I came to realize that what you have under the tile is almost as important as the finished product.  There's a lot more that goes into that sandwich than you think.</span>

                    <span>This is best book of tile installing I've found. It's very complete. I used it's information to install over 600 sq ft of tile in my home. Although it is very detailed, which some people may not care for, it's sort of an "everything you need to know about installing tile, but didn't know you needed to know". The installation was our first and came out well. We were able to talk to tile people on their level and knew more than many people in stores. He points how how critical preparation is to a good installation. Even if you don't plan on installing tile yourself, you should go through this book to learn how it should be done right. I understand he also has a video out.</span>

                    <span>After flipping through all the tile books at the big bookstores and the big home improvement stores, I chose this one and was certainly not disappointed. More detailed and covers a wider range of issues than any other tile book, including the Bridge book, which I bought as well. I figured if I'm spending [a small fortune]on a tile job, what's another [few dollars] to get a few more ideas.<br>I especially liked the chapter where he takes you through a real job, with many of the real world problems one may encounter.</span>
