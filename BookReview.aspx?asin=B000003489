                <span id="Label1">Released in January 1960, John Coltrane's first album devoted entirely to his own compositions confirmed his towering command of tenor saxophone and his emerging power as a composer. Apprenticeships with Dizzy, Miles, and Monk had helped focus his furious, expansive solos, and his stamina and underlying sense of harmonic adventure brought Coltrane, at 33, to a new cusp--the polytonal "sheets of sound" that distinguished his marathon solos were offset by interludes of subtle, concise lyricism, embodied here in the tender "Naima." That classic ballad is a calm refuge from the ecstatic, high-speed runs that spark the set's up-tempo climaxes, which begin with the opening title song, itself a cornerstone of modern jazz composition. This exemplary reissue benefits from eight alternate takes of the original album's seven stellar tracks, excellent remastering of the original tapes, and an expanded annotation. <I>--Sam Sutherland</I></span>

                    <span>Both a high point and a turning point in his discography, Giant Steps was the culmination of John Coltrane's hard bop period as he moved off into modal fare.  5 alternate takes are added to the 7 tracks that made up Coltrane's 1960 Atlantic Records debut, with a very nice remaster that makes these tracks come alive.  The dizzyingly impressive array of bop experimentalism includes such Coltrane standards as the title cut, "Syeeda's Flute Song" and of course "Naima."
<br />
<br />The main players include Paul Chambers on bass, Tommy Flanagan on piano and Art Taylor on drums, with Wyn Kelly and Jimmy Cobb on "Naima."  Cedar Walton and Lex Humphries play on a couple of the alternate takes.  Everyone plays as if their lives depended on it and turn in terrific performances in keeping up with Coltrane's muscular, fervent attack.
<br />
<br />A textbook since the day it was released and a cornerstone of any collection.</span>

                    <span>I'd say this recording is within the top ten most essential, influential, brilliant, and groovin' albums recorded by John Coltrane from 1956-1967. 
<br />
<br />This was the first album with all Trane originals on it. Trane had a couple gems before this like, Coltrane, Soultrane, and Mating Call, but this was truely a masterpiece. The only other Trane album before it that I would compare would have to be Blue Train. This was only the start for Coltrane's musical exploration. The albums and the music only got better from here on out. 
<br />
<br />Coltrane hadn't really crossed into the avant garde scene yet; this album is fairly straight ahead. He was currently with Miles Davis, and recorded the influential, Kind Of Blue around the same time as this recording.
<br />
<br />He was truely at the top of his game. His horn playing only got better, and he let his ideas pure out of him, in excellent compositions, all demonstrated here.
<br />
<br />The title track, Giant Steps is fiercly played, with energy, by Trane, and Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. (other musicians who were at the session include, Cedar Walton, piano, Jimmy Cobb, drums, and Lex Humphries, on drums, also.) The tune got its name because the jumps from note to note were rather big, so naturally it became "Giant Steps." Some of the most brilliant improvising is shown in this tune.
<br />
<br />The bluesy Cousin Mary swings so violently. My personal favorite track here is Syeeda's Song Flute. Mr P.C. comes in at a close second. 
<br />
<br />The fireous, Countdown, with excellent drumming by Art Taylor is improvisational work at its best. It perhaps foreshadows some of Trane's later avant garde playing.
<br />
<br />The ballad here is Naima, written for his wife at the time. For this tune, Art Taylor sits out and Jimmy Cobb, (who also was working with Miles at this time) gets the throne. 
<br />
<br />There are a whole bunch of bonus tracks, which make this reissue clock in at over an hour. Drummer Lex Humphries, perhaps best known for being a part of the early Jazztet, gets the throne on all the bonus tracks. 
<br />
<br />This album is without a doubt, a masterpiece. 40 years later, it's still as fresh to this day, as it was in 1959. Coltrane and Giant Steps live on!</span>

                    <span>If you're a musician, you will understand that the tune "Giant Steps" is really challenging, the complex chords progression and how to play improvitation along with that chords progression.
<br />
<br />I remember when I read Guitar Magazine, Mahavishnu John McLaughlin said that if you want to hear something fast than you should hear John Coltrane's playing.
<br />
<br />You can hear the romantic side of John Coltrane on "Naima", he wrote this song for his wife.
<br />
<br />If you never heard John Coltrane before then this is the most recommended and most essential album from him.</span>
