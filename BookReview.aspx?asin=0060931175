                    <span>The field is another word for "God, Universal Intelligence and Zero Point Field". This book basically scientifically proves the existence of a Higher Intelligence. 
<br />
<br />This book covers everything from healing cancer to God to remote viewing to changing how a "random machine" operates with only ones thoughts.
<br />
<br />This book will really expand how you think and what you "believe" is possible.
<br />
<br />Another great book on something more physical, your body, The Creator's Manual for Your body. This book helps free you from the limitations and constraints shackled to you by your body. One of my other favorites.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the most complete and readable description of all the paranormal research that has taken place both in this country and abroad.  
<br />
<br />McTaggart describes research and documented evidence of the apparent telepathic and telekinetic powers of the brain as well as its ability to affect the health status both of the individual and of others.  She relates experiments that presumably prove that even chickens and rabbits have such powers.  She mentions some of the (mostly secret) experiments in remote viewing carried out by our government during the Cold War.  McTaggart describes experiments in homeopathic medicine, where the curing substance is diluted to such an extent that it is there only as a memory, and yet still remains potent. 
<br />
<br />Such information, of course, has appeared in other books.  McTaggart, however, goes on to point out that the classical idea that events are not influenced by the observer does not hold in quantum physics dealing with electrons and sub-particles.  She proceeds to describe at great length the Random Effects Generator, essentially a computerized random number generator, and how it is affected by conscious and unconscious wishes of nearby, and even remote, observers. A large amount of information that she describes is based on results obtained through such machines. 
<br />
<br />So far, the description deals with presumably real experimental observations.  Where the book takes a giant leap, however, is in its identification of what enables these effects: the Zero Point Energy Field.  The basic principle in Heisenberg's and Bohr's quantum theory is that sub-atomic particles don't exist until they are observed.  The entire Creation Theory of our modern physicists is based on the idea that sub-atomic particles can continuously jump into existence and then disappear, as long as both operations take place in less time that the Planck period (10exp-43 seconds) since we cannot observe anything within such a small time interval.  These continuous particle appearances and disappearances are described by a field which McTaggart postulates that we have the ability to affect.  This field presumably involves huge quantities of energy that could become accessible if only we only knew how.  (Interestingly, she does not question the source of such a huge amount of energy in our universe.)
<br />
<br />The final conclusion is that everything is interrelated, and everything consists of energy vibrations.  Everything is one, so it is little wonder that we can affect our environment with our conscious or unconscious thoughts.  Personally I agree with this final statement, but there is no proof that McTaggart's postulated Zero Point Energy Field is the real enabling mechanism.  Instead, it could easily be the recently postulated vibrating energy strings, as claimed by Lewis Tarter in his God Theory, or some other mechanism not yet identified.  In any case, however, the existence of such an effect can have tremendous theological implications.  I definitely recommend this book.

                    <span>This book is an amazing compilation of various scientific studies which have revealed some pretty fantastic things about our world.  The author does a superb job at condensing all the various studies regarding topics such as remote viewing and psi phenomena to quantum physics and mechanics.  The book encompasses so many areas and it really inspires the reader to look at the magic and "unknown" reality we really do live in.  The author does a good job at making the sometimes complicated world of experimental quantum physics understandable to the layperson.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the "unknown" and "unseen" workings of our world.</span>

                    <span>In short I really appreciate this book. It is a terrific mind-bender!
<br />
<br />Lynne McTaggart has done a great job in pulling together the work of so many "legitimate" researchers who are pushing their explorations into strange but fruitfull territories... not the Twilight Zone, but rather the profit zone as measured in intellectual coinage.
<br />
<br />What I most appreciate is the light it plays on so many things that I have read before; I can see now that their material  circled around some hidden assumption which remained an unstated "given" ... which turns out to be "The Field" 
<br />
<br />If you are a student of the human condition I would suggest you read it... but first temporarily suspend your dis-belief mode!  
<br />
<br />One reason for me in writing this letter is that an unkind reviewer mocked not only this work but a statement from another  reviewer. He used the term, "moronic" 
<br />
<br />That bothered me. Indeed, this critic is a very learned gentleman in Chemistry and Quantum mechanics, but I think he was  unfair in his dismisal of the field as being a mere virtual mathematical anomaly. However, the Field's effects can be measured ... and have been.  I thought he was "off" concerning his absolute skepticism and intellectual contempt regarding the posibility of validating Newton's unsubstantiated 2nd law, F=ma.
<br />  
<br /> from an online paper by the proponents of the Field.
<br />
<br />(snip)
<br />
<br />"In our formulation, the m in Newton's second law of motion, F=ma, becomes nothing more than a coupling constant between acceleration and an external electromagnetic force. Thus what we are proposing is that Newton's second law can be derived from the laws of electrodynamics, provided one assumes an underlying 
<br />zero-point field."
<br />
<br />(snip)
<br />
<br />Now from that description I don't readily see how the critic's objection -- as I understand it -- addresses what they are talking about.  I'm left wondering if he bothered to read the book.
<br /> 
<br />Hey, hang all ten! read It! 
<br />

                    <span>The title of the book aptly describes it "it's indeed a quest", the book is investigative, reads like a mystery, very comprehensive and well researched, no part of the book felt like speculation to me (of course some chapters/topics are more interesting than others), each chapter builds on the previous one, goes beyond mundane books about "Quantum Physics", I would highly recommend this book.</span>
