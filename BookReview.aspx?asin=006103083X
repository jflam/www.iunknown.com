                    <span>Excellent follow-up to the first book. This is one of the few programs that shows you how to improve your health while losing weight. I also loved 'The Power of Positive Habits' which shows you how to improve your health and lose weight automatically via the acquistion of new positive habits. I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoy my new beverage of choice. Made from 100% organic soy, taste just like coffee and no caffeine. Finally, I got rid of that wired up feeling all day and feeling great. Look for it on the net by googling "s o yfee".

                    <span>I read a ton of reviews of people who had been in &#34;the zone&#34; and it seemed like something I'd like to try (I'm trying to eat better :&#62;)
<br />I was very surpised when I wasn't hungry and the meals I would make would really get me through until I had to eat again. The food is a little bland for my liking (at least for breakfast) but there are defintely ways to spice it up and still be in the Zone. It's defintely worth trying-and even though I was trying it for a better approach to my eating habits, I'm already seeing some weight loss. 
<br /> 
<br />UPDATE 9/27/2004: I have lost 15 lbs and have never felt better! My energy levels are up and I really have never felt better! This book will not only help you lose weight, but give you a whole new outlook on food!</span>

                    <span>This book is great and easy to understand.  I lost 10lbs on this plan, that's pretty much all I wanted to lose, any more than this, I would look anorexic.  I've been following this plan for 3 months now and I noticed how good I feel.  I look at food in a different way.  This whole theory of balancing your blood sugar makes sense.  Hormone -- Insulin (from carbs) raises blood sugar, Hormone --Glucagon (from protien) keeps blood sugar levels from dropping, and when this is in balance it will help prevent the storage of fat into the cells.  In other words, they will be used to provide the body and brain what it needs quicker than storing the extra insulin for later use, which turns into fat if not used.   Dietary fat (which has no effect on insulin) in our diets help monitor these two hormones.  Dietary fat (eg: monosaturated -- olive oil, almonds, avocado) helps the body say "i'm full" and helps slow down the speed in which insulin (carbs) enters the bloodstream.  When eating dietary fat in the zone, we should be satisfied with our meals and not be hungry until 3 1/2 to 5 hours later.  The "Zone" takes you into a place where you feel less tired and more focused.  (A little to much protein than carbs may make you feel sleepy, or too many carbs and less protein can make you feel more hungry or possibly make your moods swing a bit.)  So being in the zone will help our bodies metabolize fat more efficiently and store less fat in our cells and that is when we are able to lose fat in our bodies.  How's that for information?  My example eating plan for a female is:
<br />
<br />2 egg substitues (2 Protein blocks)
<br />1 cup skim milk (1 protein block; 1 carb block)
<br />1 peach (1 carb block)
<br />1/2 apple (1 carb block)
<br />9 almonds (3 fat blocks)
<br />
<br />So a female needs 3 blocks of Protein, Carbs, and fat)
<br />
<br />Lunch:
<br />
<br />3 oz of tuna (3 protein blocks)
<br />2 slices low carb whole wheat bread (1.4 carb blocks)
<br />1 apple (2 carb blocks)
<br />1 tsp olive oil (3 fat blocks -- I mix with tuna)
<br />
<br />Dinner
<br />
<br />3-4 oz salom or chicken or port etc.(use palm size and thickness if unsure of ounces) (3 protein blocks)
<br />3 cups of cooked broccoli (1 carb block)-- (use size of two loose fists for veggies -- for others -- rice/pasta -- use one tight fist)
<br />1/2 cup of chick peas (2 carb blocks)
<br />1 tsp of olive oil (3 fat blocks)-- i use for my broccoli
<br />
<br />hope this helps.  This book has the block info at the end of the book which helps figure it out.  On snacks -- 2 per day -- we only use 1 block of each protien, carb and fat, which will hold you for about 2 hours if you have it before dinner.  Now how difficult is that.  Hope this helps.  The book has more info that I left out.  But it is worth the education for the health of our bodies.  Thank you Dr. Sears.  :)

                    <span>I hope the information dispensed by Dr. Kotz is better than what she expounds on the Atkins website. Her advice on that site suggest that you read the label of regular brewed beers for carbohydrate information. <p>"A 12-ounce can of beer contains about 12.5 grams, but you have to read the label since carbohydrate content varies from brand to brand," says the doctor.<p>Unfortunately, carbohydrate counts are NOT given on regular brewed beers. Makes you wonder if she's ever drank a beer in her life if that's the kind of "accurate" info she pens. Equally suspicious is the fact that she's contributed as an "expert" to Weight Watchers, The Zone, Slim-Fast, and Atkins. Suprised she hasn't jumped on the South Beach Diet bandwagon too.</span>

                    <span>This book is very easy to understand but I have one question I am hoping someone can help me. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner there is a 10 gram fat , 20 gram protein, and 30 gram carbohydrate. Is it possible to just use the information on carbohydrates and just eat a meal of 90 carbs a day. I'm very useless in the kitchen and there seems to be so many low carb products out in the market that seem to have the right amount of carbs but a slightly higher number of protein and I was wondering I could still stay in the zone even if the protein goes over 20 grams. ANY INFORMATION WOULD BE SO HELPFUL AND APPRECIATED.</span>
