                    <span>I remember watching some Notre Dame games that Digger Phelps coached. The games were always entertaining and top notch. You could tell Phelps was excellent at getting the most from his teams. This book is a continuation of that, he combines his knowledge and occasionally humor to write an excellent guide about the sport. In an early chapter, he points out that you can play the game almost anywhere and equipment costs are low. Who wouldn't enjoy it? In later chapters, he discusses rules, stats, shooting fundamentals and offense, defense and rebounding, specific plays run during games, the various levels of play (from pickup games up to the pros and international basketball), as well as chapters on coaching and getting into "playing shape." He even lists his choices for "Ten Greatest Games" and "Ten (well eleven) Greatest Players." The book even contains a glossary of terms and drills to use in practices.<P>Truly a complete "instructional guide" to basketball (if there ever was such a thing).</span>

                    <span>This is a flawed book in many ways. It claims to be written for people who know little about basketball, but there are too many diagrams of plays and tips for coaching. There also is too much information about statistics. Nowhere in this book do you find anything that conveys the sheer joy of watching two excellent teams battle it out for the conference championship. It also is a big mistake to put in so many Notre Dame references; couldn't Digger have asked some of his many coaching friends for anecdotes? (And what's with all the plugs for Bookstore Basketball?) The only Dummies here are the people who buy this book!</span>

                    <span>Based on the limited rule coverage and lack of text and diagrams covering the differences between the various levels, I was tempted to give no more than three stars. However, the tips on how to improve your basketball play were worth five stars, so I averaged the two. It is not quite up to the caliber of other "for Dummies" books, but it is worth a read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I bought this book hoping to get some insight into some technical issues that cause endless arguments between my buddies when we play (most often about whether a particular play involved a foul or not). If you have the same idea, forget about this book as it has next to no in-depth explanations for this kind of situations. For example, a defensive foul is defined as "a player engaging in illegal contact with an opponent". And this is it! There are no examples, no explanatory diagrams, nothing more. How's that for completely useless for you?<BR>Or take this very common situation where you're watching a game on TV, then something quick happens that you don't quite follow, and the referee signals something. What exactly does the signal mean? The book has ZERO information on signals.<BR>So what does the book contain? <BR>- Hundreds of anecdotes, some of which make a good read but very few improve your understanding of the game.<BR>- Very, very basic and shallow introduction to the game and the rules.<BR>- Descriptions of playing strategies - this comes right after the introduction, leaving a big logical gap in your knowledge. If you are indeed a dummy about basketball (as the title suggests) then this part is too advanced for jumping right into it.<BR>- Lots and lots of coaching suggestions and drills. Again, this would be a good idea but I'd assume that better knowledge of game rules would be a pre-requisite of successful coaching. And since the book is very sparse on the actual rules and jumps from very basic introduction straight to strategies and coaching, it leaves the latter parts hanging in the air. <BR>Also, it has next to no information for practicing on your own, almost all the drills assume that you do it with many people.<BR>- Lots of trivia on basketball history and players. Again, some of it is interesting but it doesn't improve your play or understanding of the game.<BR>So all in all, the book was a disappointment. It might be useful if you're mostly interested in trivia but it doesn't help with anything substantial.</span>

                    <span>Basketball for Dummies is more than a reference, it's a catalog of rhetorical greatness. Phelps does a great job at getting his point across while keeping it interesting. Players from all levels can benefit. Hours of fun.</span>
