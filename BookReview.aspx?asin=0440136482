                <span id="Label1">Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, and Richard Leigh, authors of <I>The Messianic Legacy</I>, spent over 10 years on their own kind of quest for the Holy Grail, into the secretive history of early France. What they found, researched with the tenacity and attention to detail that befits any great quest, is a tangled and intricate story of politics and faith that reads like a mystery novel. It is the story of the Knights Templar, and a behind-the-scenes society called the Prieure de Sion, and its involvement in reinstating descendants of the Merovingian bloodline into political power. Why? The authors of <I>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</I> assert that their explorations into early history ultimately reveal that Jesus may not have died on the cross, but lived to marry and father children whose bloodline continues today. The authors' point here is not to compromise or to demean Jesus, but to offer another, more complete perspective of Jesus as God's incarnation in man. The power of this secret, which has been carefully guarded for hundreds of years, has sparked much controversy. For all the sensationalism and hoopla surrounding <I>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</I> and the alternate history that it outlines, the authors are careful to keep their perspective and sense of skepticism alive in its pages, explaining carefully and clearly how they came to draw such combustible conclusions. <I>--Jodie Buller</I></span>

                    <span>I first read this book while I was in an airport waiting for the plane to take off when it first came out, and I've read the entire book atleast once every year since. A fabulous book, covering my most favorite subjects: the Templars, the Crusaders, heretics, medival England and France, the Merovians, and much more. Great reading, will cause one to ponder the meaning of all things in Christianity ( I'm still a Christian regardless of their conclusions)...</span>

                    <span>I read this book when it first came out, whenever that was.  Years ago. Back then I didn't know my elbow from a hole in the ground when it came to the Christian religion.  Disclaimer: I am not a Christian nor do I care to be.  On the other hand, I am deeply interested in Gnosticism.  So in the intervening years I studied everything I could about early Christianity, Judaism of two thousand years ago, the development of the Catholic Church, and so on and so on.  If I'd picked up Holy Blood, Holy Grail two years ago I might well have seen it for what it was...as someone else here quipped: a huge conspiracy theory with no more basis in fact than Bigfoot.  (I'd bet on finding Bigfoot before the bloodline of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ.) Of course, all power to Dan Brown and taking a terrific idea and writing a rather ordinary thriller around it.  He's certainly made his millions out of the idea. And he's tapped into a worldwide yearning for the Goddess, meaning Mary Magdalene.  Understandable.  In any case, I'm on a mission here.  I just read The Secret Magdalene by Ki Longfellow and if you really want a great read about the Magdalene and the man she called Yeshu, plus delving deep into what the heck they were all about in the first place, I'd buy that book if I were you.  The "secret" of this Magdalene is not something so easy as being the bride of Christ (ancient symbolism, all this) or having his children, or even being the Beloved Disciple (which she was)...no, the secret is the original teachings...long before the Church hid them from you knowing no Church that wished to hold great power could get far with Gnosis and finding the God within.  Longfellow's Magdalene is the most wonderfully realized companion-teacher-philosopher-beloved disciple-"woman" I've ever encountered.  She is unforgettable. Just like the Goddess who will not be silenced.</span>

                    <span>I found this book highly readable, and highly enjoyable. I learned so much from it! The history lessons alone are worth the price of the book. I also decided that, based on what I read here (along with some other research), Christianity is basically a giant hoax. It has so many of its "rules" and traditions based on old pagan beliefs that it's laughable, and so Christianity is really "nothing new under the sun."
<br />
<br /> The detailed history of the Knights Templar is fascinating. I did get a bit lost while slogging through the Merivingian bloodline, tho. The Priory of Sion remains a mystery, as do the Knights, overall. The authors seemed to take some rather giant leaps in thinking at times, seeming to reach conclusions out of the blue, so I can't say that I found this a definitive book on the Holy Grail (because it's still not clear what it is, or was). It has, however, piqued my interest in the South of France, medieval history, the Crusades, and further investigation into the whole era. 
<br />
<br />Overall, I could feel the scales falling from my eyes as pertains to "Christianity",and now I'm not an agnostic--I'm an out-and-out pagan. And boy do I feel better! :-)</span>

                    <span>I'm not a Christian, so has no stake on this issue. I'm giving it only one star as it is not an easy book to read and to follow. As a reader, I found the book to be very hard going. There's a lot of names and linkages made through almost a thousand years of history. It's all very dense and impenetratable, which made the argument for the final sensational conclusion ver difficult to grasp. As such I cannot say whether or not I am convinced by the book. If you are interested in this book because of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, I suggest that you stick to that book because this book will most likely not add or subtract from that story. </span>
