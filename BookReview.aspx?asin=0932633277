                <span id="Label1">People have expectations. Your clients, for example. Sometimes their expectations of you seem unreasonable. But sometimes your expectations of them seem just as unreasonable (in their eyes).  <P>The problem is that these mismatched expectations can lead to misunderstandings, frayed nerves, and ruffled feathers. More seriously, they often lead to flawed systems, failed projects, and a drain on resources.  <P>Yet how often do you openly acknowledge these differences in expectations and take steps to better manage them? And how often are you a victim of your own expectations of yourself?  <P>Expectations are difficult to control and impossible to turn off. Naomi Karten offers concrete ways to manage them, and in the process, to dramatically improve the effectiveness of your services.  <P>A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Expectations . . .  <P><br>Guard Against Conflicting Messages  <br>Use Jargon with Care  <br>Identify Communication Preferences  <br>Listen Persuasively  <br>Help Customers Describe Their Needs  <br>Become an Information-Gathering Skeptic  <br>Understand Your Customers' Context  <br>Try the Solution On for Size  <br>Clarify Perceptions  <br>Set Uncertainty-Managing Service Standards  <br>When Appropriate, Just Say Whoa  <br>Build Win-Win Relationships  <br>Formulate an Action Plan</span>

                    <span>The key message of this book is that you must listen carefully to your customers and co-workers, hearing every word, but also the broad message. Many of the primary problems in the business-customer relationship are due to different definitions of commonly understood words, such as "regular", "extended", "timely" and even "month."  Whole phrases are subject to different interpretations, and the author recites an instance from a trip to her physician. After examination, the physician pronounced her condition as "unremarkable."  At first she was angry, and yet having the sense to think before making a fist, she realized that was the doctor's way of saying she was fine. <br> Which also points out what is the most critical condition for success dealing with anyone, whether they are in the group described by the book title or not. As e-mail use has shown us, it is almost impossible to avoid saying something that can be taken in an offensive manner. Business is about getting things done, and you don't complete complex tasks by making small talk about the weather. You do things by communicating the current situation as it is, even if it is not what the receiver wants to hear and it is necessary to take people to task. Therefore, your best policy is to avoid getting angry quickly, developing a thick skin and concentrating on completing the tasks at hand. <br> Naomi Karten puts forward advice that is simply not heard often enough. Forget about all of the sensitivity nonsense and concentrate on forms of communication that can be used to explain frustrations, demands, concerns, and all of the other things that go wrong between people trying to work together. Understand that ambiguity is the natural state of affairs, so look for the real meanings rather than the individual words. Whenever you hear something, put your feelings aside for a short time until you clearly understand what the message really was. <br> The phrase "People who want more, better, faster, sooner, NOW!" is just a long way of describing "customers", so anyone in business must be prepared to deal with such people. In this book, you will learn how to approach customers with your feelings placed in the background and all of your information receivers on high-band. With business growing more competitive every day, this may be the only way to remain a viable economic entity.</span>
