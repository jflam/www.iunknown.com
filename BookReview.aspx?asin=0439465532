                    <span>I am a fifth grader from P.S. 42. Many people in our class have read Ripley's Believe It or Not Special Edition 2004. Some say this book is very cool and some say it is not. Well, I say its very interesting because of the pictures and the descriptions. Believe It or Not Special Edition 2004 tells the weird facts that all people are interested in reading. Someone fell 20-stories from Liberty Bank Building in Buffalo, New York and he survived! Most people would be flat from a 20-story fall but this guy didn't. Even people survived in extreme cold by burning their money! I think most boys in my class wanted to read it because of the pictures or because it's a new book. Is there somebody with a magnetic body? Or is there a reptile man? You'll know when you read "Ripley's Believe It or Not Special Edition 2004!" You'll be amazed by the stories they tell you!!<P>I really enjoyed this book for a few reasons. This book tells the truth. Most people always hide their ugly side. But in this book, a person with three legs tell other people he has three legs. Isn't he embarrassed? Well, maybe he is embarrassed. Probably not.<P>I think children below 6 shouldn't read this ( 7 and above could). When children under 6 read this book, they might get nightmares about the disgusting pictures in the book. If they really wanted to read this book, they could but if they read it and get nightmares, it's their fault.<P>In this book, there are too many facts so I'll just ask a few question: Did the man with a metal pole in his chest live after the pole went in? How about the dolphin who spoke? How did the camper know he had a snake in his body?<P>People in our class, mostly girls think that some of the pictures are disgusting. On page 29 of the book, there are skulls. Skulls are disgusting to look at. Also when you look at the skulls, it looks like its smiling at you. Anyway, I really liked this book and it should be for children who are disgusting. I have one of the Ripley's Believe It or Not books and their facts are really cool for boys. So go to a book store and see if you can get your hands on this fabulous book! But if you don't like this book, you could go to Amazon.com and tell them your opinion about the book.</span>

                    <span>Ripley's Believe It or Not is a great bok. It contains many interesting facts, which will leave you in shock and disbelief. I thought Ripley's Believe It or Not was awesome. I had a lot of fun reading the book and I learned many amazing facts. Based on the T.V hit show, Ripley's Believe It or Not is mind-boggeling. Many people think that it is the same as Guiness Book of Records, but it is not. Ripley's Believe It or Not tells you amazing facts and you decide whether it is true or not. None of the facts in Ripley's are in the Guiness Book of Records.</span>
