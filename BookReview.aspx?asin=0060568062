                    <span>Best non-fiction book I've seen in years. It's a $25 book for $15 (or $10 from Amazon), chock full of words and not silly black-and-white graphics. It covers almost EVERYTHING... art, music, science, literature, pop culture, philosophy, religion, economics, and more. No political junk, no cosmic overtones, just a bunch of fun, irreverent lists about things you should've learned at some point. I love reference books, and the only thing I love more than reference books are reference books that you can really pick up and READ as opposed to just skimming over. This is a perfect example of that.<P>I've subscribed to the magazine (mental_floss) for two years now, and it was a long wait for this book to come out. But it was well worth it. The book also offers a $5 discount on a subscription to the magazine (cheaper than the going rate) so it costs even less when you take that into consideration. While mental_floss is bimonthly, this'll help fill the time waiting for the next issue to come.<P>The last time I paid $15 for something as entertaining and educational as this was in Las Vegas in 1971. Shameful, I know.</span>

                    <span>mental_floss is one of those ideas we all wish we'd come up with. It just makes sense. We all want to learn a little of everything but are so darn busy and don't exactly have the time to read every textbook out there. Now, here's a way to learn a little biology, economics, philosophy, history, etc...and in a really witty format. The fact that you can learn science while reading something as fun as "4 Excuses to Get a Prescription for Chocolate" or "9 Laws of Physics that Don't Apply in Hollywood" is great! And I really wish my high school history class had been as fun as the history chapter in Condensed Knowledge. This book is hilarious, but really informative too.</span>

                    <span>I subscribe to "Mental Floss" and have since the first issue. I love it and couldn't wait to buy this book. Largely, I was very pleased with the book. I particularly like the way the book is broken down into major subjects like "Condensed Art History" and "Condensed Physics". I especially enjoyed the science sections and the "Condensed Pop Culture" chapter. I was particularly impressed with the analysis of the confusing lyrics in Steve Miller's "The Joker" (yes the line actually IS "Some people call me Maurice, 'cuz I speak of the pompatus of love.") The solving of this mystery alone is worth the price of the book. <P>I really sat on the fence on whether to give the book four or five stars. I would give it 4 1/2 if that were an option, but there were a few little thing about the book that bugged me enough to prevent a five star review (although I do give the magazine five stars.) The first (minor) error I noticed is in the chapter "Condensed General Science" under "Sexy Animal Facts", where the author states that "A goldfish has a memory span of only three seconds". I hold a degree in Biology, and can categorically say that is untrue. This is an urban legend and supposition, which has been disproved in several studies in animal behavior in which goldfish were taught to swim in elaborate mazes over the span of several days. If they only had a three second memory, they would be unable to complete the maze correctly with ever improving times day after day (which shows that learning occurs.) The television show 'Mythbusters' did a primitive version of one of these studies on one show, by the way. This isn't a big point, but is worth noting.<P>I object to the politically correct use of the terms of 'BC' and 'BCE' instead of 'BC' and 'AD'. Although the calendars are identical there is no valid reason to dispense with the terminology in place since about 525 AD just to be politically correct. It is annoying, reduces the comprehensibility of the dates in the book and in no way improves the calendar.<P>I find it a bit ironic in the chapter "Condensed History" that sometimes journalism professor Peter Haugen has a section called "Rotten to the Corps: Tyrants with Horrific Rap Sheets" in which obvious winners such as Stalin and Hitler make the grade, but so do three 'Pasas' from nineteenth century Turkey, due to forced relocations of peasants during wartime. They may well have been bad guys, but even historians disagree whether or not this was an unfortunate byproduct of war or genocide of a minority group. My point is that there is a lot of ambiguity here, and elevating them to the same plane as Hitler while leaving every single corrupt Middle Eastern despot off the list entirely is patently ridiculous. Bottom line: this list lacks historical objectivity.<P>In "Condensed Literature" the allegation is made that Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales" is still 'fresh and funny' after 600 years. Everybody can have their own opinion, but I have read "The Canterbury Tales", and can say from personal experience that absolutely nothing could make "The Canterbury Tales" in any way fresh or funny. <P>Finally, under "Condensed Religion" there appears a box which attempts to refute Christianity (or any other religion for that matter) titled "The Problem of Evil", the premise of which is that God can't be almighty if he allows evil in the world. The author entirely misses the significance of one of the bulwarks of Christianity: free will. Christians (at least the vast majority of Christians) believe that God allows individuals to make their own decisions in life, and in the end they will be judged on these decisions. In Christianity God never desires for a person to sin, in other words, but he does allow it so each person can be judged on their own merits.<P>Overall, this is a credible, interesting book, though I don't think it is quite up to the quality of "Mental Floss" magazine. I recommend the book, but, as always, read skeptically, and let the arguments make sense before you change long-held beliefs. Having said that, the book is fun and irreverent. Despite my critiques, I am glad I bought it.</span>

                    <span>What a treat... a whole book of mental_floss fun! I have been a fan of the floss crew from the beginning and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. The delightful "Campbell's Soup" look of the cover including Nutrition Facts, Directions and Ingredients is a true indication that the contents are "M'm M'm Good!" The organization of the subjects makes the book easily a "pick up for a few minutes and learn something new" kind of book. However you will have a hard time putting it down and definitely keep coming back for more. Condensed Knowledge and a subscription to mental_floss magazine are both a must if you have a taste for fun!</span>
