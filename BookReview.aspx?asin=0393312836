                    <span>this, perhaps, is the best voice in english literature.  its vernacular is truly astounding and wonderfully crafted.  never have i read a book with such pleasure.  the rhythm and pace mr. burgess developed is flawless.  the language simply glides and bounces and itties and tolchocks and...
<br />
<br />i have issues with it philosophically.  and there seem to be some contradicions in ole tony's notion of freewill.  and the last chapter included in this edition (it wasn't included in the original publication in the u.s.)  is atrocious.  it is completely unwarranted  and unjustified.  it's out of the blue, it's out of left field, it's, it's...  it almost ruined the book for me.  but, ah, his language, brothers, real horrorshow indeed, lays to rest any qualms i might have had with the infamous chapter 21.  our humble narrator is our finest and never has a story been better told.  read this book!

                    <span>Despite the nadsat language, I felt this novel flowed from beginning to end.  This tale of violence, tragedy, and atonement is a true right of passage novel.  Told through the eyes of a teenanger it is both humerous and gut-wrentchingly honest.  Very similar to catcher in the rye, you find the central character  endearing, despite his violent tendencies.  It is refreshing to read true literature again after some of the modern day garbage I have been exposed to recently.  I'll read this again and again.  I can't wait to see the movie.</span>

<br />Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange has become a sort of underground classic. It is read and loved by young men all over the world.
<br />
<br />The novel is written in a language all its own; a hybrid of English and Russian slang. Burgess called this language Nadsat. It can be, at first, difficult. However, once the reader acclimates themselves to the rhythms of the words Nadsat comes alive. The language of this novel is electric. Burgess was very interested in music, and was a composer. In this novel he uses words as Mozart would have used musical notes.
<br />
<br />A Clockwork Orange is the story of Alex, a young criminal. He and his "droogs" (friends) roam the streets robbing, beating, and raping the people they encounter. Alex is quite satisfied with his life, he has everything he needs.
<br />
<br />Things begin to turn bad for Alex after a midnight raid on a house in the country. He is captured by the police and his friends turn on him. Soon Alex finds himself in prison, where he is offered the "Ludovico treatment". This treatment will guarantee that he never breaks another law. 
<br />
<br />Alex agrees to the treatment in exchange for release from prison. This is the point in the story where Burgess' talent really begins to show. It is at this point that the reader fully realizes that Burgess is not simply telling a story; he is showing us a metaphor for the world we inhabit.
<br />
<br />The Ludovico treatment turns Alex into a clockwork orange: he appears to be a living creature, but is merely a machine. Alex, stripped of free will is unable to defend himself. And, because he cannot choose evil, any good he may do is meaningless.
<br />
<br />In this book Burgess first creates a loathsome character. Then draws us into his world, making us care a bit about what happens to him. He then tears down that characters world, to show how easily our world can be torn down.
<br />
<br />This is a startling, and brilliant book. It is not for the squeamish, nor the easily offended.
<br />
<br />By the way, if you purchase this book be sure to look for the European edition which is one chapter longer than the American version. It's great. But try it for yourself! Pick up a copy. Another book I need to recommend -- very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining, little novel I can't stop thinking about.

                    <span>A Clockwork Orange is a gruesome story of a teen living in a futuristic world in which the streets are ruled by chaos and violence.  The protagonist(using this term loosely) is named Alex and is the leader of a street gang who spend their time fighting, stealing, and raping.  This goes on until Alex is caught and put in a program designed to reform him.  A Clockwork Orange is an interesting, but disturbing look into violent criminal actions and a desire that is can only be motivated by an obvious lack of a moral compas.  If the reader can get past the excrutiatingly frustrating use of random slang dialogue and the graphic depictions of rape and other violent crimes, then A Clockwork Orange is a very interesting read that reallly forces one to take a look a the violence in our own society.  A Clockwork Orange was not an easy read, but it was still a very interesting one.  Therefore, I would give it a 7 out of 10.</span>

                    <span><underline>A Clockwork Orange</underline> is a book that is sure to draw interest and suck the reader in within the first chapter. The main character, Alex is a very intriguing character, he's a propper boy by day and a violent madman by night. It's perfect for readers who are looking for a little bit of a challenge, with most of the script in the Nadsat (teenage) language. This book will have you guessing what extreme thing will happen next, it's good to the very last page.</span>
