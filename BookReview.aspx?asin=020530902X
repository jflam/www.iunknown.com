                    <span>Some write short sentence, others long. This book is not mean to alter your style, it helps to remove redundancies, ambiguities and shows writer to get to the point in a concise manner.  It is around for many decades, and still the de facto in the subject. The book shows writer the building block of writing -- a sentence, and it does a great job. Many professional writers need to read this book to make their book thinner and more readable. It is a classics.
<br />
<br />If you need one book to clarify or organize thoughts into words, this is the one.</span>

                    <span>This is THE Essential Writer's Guide. I learned about this book way back in high school and I have used it extensively ever since.  
<br />
<br />It works for those of us who are writing papers for school, work, or even just for fun.  This book offers insight into many aspects of writing and shows the CORRECT way for everything.  No wonder it's the reference for just about every professional writer on the planet.
<br />

                    <span>Here is a manual of style that makes sense, is short, and to the point.  All business persons and college students should have a copy of Strunk & White.  ....and don't just use it as a reference; read it from front to back.  That would probably take about 1 hour.  You will gain more common sense grammatical knowledge from this book than a year of English classes.
<br />
<br />Bottom line:  Don't throw away Chicago, but Strunk and White is light, easy to read, and just plain makes sense!</span>

                    <span>There was a time when I hated The Elements of Style. It had been forced upon me by a series of crusty old English teachers and I recoiled and grumbled every time I saw it. In time, much to my surprise, I discovered how helpful this book could be and I found myself seeking its guidance more and more often.
<br />
<br />I have been out of school for years now but I still treasure my copy of The Elements of Style, keeping it within arms reach on my desk at home, along with my dictionary, thesaurus, and Chicago Manual of Style. I read it once a year. This slim book I once considered insufferable is now invaluable to me.
<br />
<br />Although it is not as comprehensive as the massive Chicago Manual of Style, The Elements of Style has far more soul, humor, and wisdom in a far shorter space. It covers all the basics -- punctuation and usage, composition, form, and frequently misused words and expressions. The final chapter offers stylistic counsel to anyone brave enough to tackle the challenge of writing well. These are deceptively simple platitudes such as "Do not overwrite," "Be clear," and "Write in a way that comes naturally." White calls these his "articles of faith" and his advice is practical and priceless.
<br />
<br />The Elements of Style is a classic whose value has been proven through time and through countless testimonials. And yes, I must admit, those crusty old English teachers were right after all.</span>
