                <span id="Label1">A wild, lyrical, and anguished autobiography, in which Charles Mingus pays short shrift to the facts but plunges to the very bottom of his psyche, coming up for air only when it pleases him. He takes the reader through his childhood in Watts, his musical education by the likes of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Charlie Parker, and his prodigious appetites--intellectual, culinary, and sexual. The book is a jumble, but a glorious one, by a certified American genius.</span>

<br />Mingus was, and always will be, in a world of his own. Be it with his bass playing, compositions, social life, or just his unique and obscure way interpreting life.
<br />
<br />This book has touched on many subjects , not just jazz, but with many other topics. The stories are often blown out of all proportion, the mark of a great storyteller? Mingus the ego is evident. If people don't dig that, then they shouldn't listen to him, or any other artist in their particular idiom, as ego is like tension, and creativity, and love and hate, and all the things you just can't contain within the skin and the 2D world. 
<br />
<br />The first few chapters are deceiving, as it comes over like Ming's Father is writing the book. The conversation with Bird and Diz and Lucky Thompson on stage. Chatting with 'Fat Girl,' and the discovery of the origin of 'Donna Lee,' all worth the price if you love these players. 
<br />
<br />There was a story once that went something along the lines of a critic chastizing Ming for his singing on the 'Blues and Root's' lp. Ming responded aptly with: 'If I sing, then it is myself whom I sing for, not you, or anyone else. I can only sing for myself. It's like, if I punch you in the mouth, I can't bleed for you, that's your job, right?'     
<br />
<br />I reckon that goes some way to describing the man and his fury.     </span>

                    <span>[...]I adore the charles mingus i know through his music - the one that can so profoundly intertwine feelings of anguish and ecstacy, anger and love, despair and triumph.
<br />
<br />I approached this book hoping for two things. First, a story that artfully captured such diverse emotions as in his music. Second, I wanted to achieve somewhat of an actual understanding of how this man came to be the way he was, what experiences shaped his brilliant art etc.
<br />
<br />My hopes rose even higher in the first couple chapters when i found that this was not going to be a conventional "autobiography" in that it looked to be more concerned with capturing his feelings and ideas about periods in his life, rather than trying to be historically accurate (in fact, most of it sounds to me to be a fabrication, or at least based on a very quirky interpretation of events). There are some moments when i felt a deep sympathy for Mingus, particularly with regard to his relationship with his father, and his feeling of isolation due to his diverse racial background.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, however, i found at least half (probably even more) to be a tedious exercise in narcissism, leaving me feeling disturbed by his shallowness and hypocrisy towards women, and a general failure on Mingus' behalf to try and understand others in his life. He repeatedly describes erotic encounters with numerous beautiful women (and only physically beautiful women, mind you), who, without failure, seem to fall hopelessly in love with him, despite the fact that he only ever seems stare at them or tell them how much he wants or loves them (based on his staring at them). As far as I can tell from this book, he didn't try particularly hard to ever get to know them as people, and is content to sleep around even when he proposes to love some particular one. What makes this unforgivable is that other themes in this book include that of seeing through physical differences, struggling to find acceptance with others despite mixed racial backgrounds, as well as frequent spiritual undertones. Further, on occasions he seems to hint that similar behaviour is wrong for a female, which is especially seen in his 2 page hypocrital berating of his step-mother for allegedly cheating on his father, who "only beat her up once!" (which is apparently okay, especially since she asked for it by not being quiet). It's sad that someone who saw through racial prejudice could not see through sexual prejudices.
<br />
<br />So, I have to admit that I was quite disappointed with Mingus' character - flawed, i think, by more than just a bad temper. I think this is a valid criticism of even a quasi-autobiography, because it implicitly promotes such ideas.
<br />
<br />Even so, I would have been willing to finish this book if i felt that it was expressed in a clever or artful way. The noveltly of his playful simulataneous 3rd and 1st person story telling is enjoyable, and sometimes very humorous, but it quickly lost it's appeal when I couldn't help but notice the underlying arrogance and the pathetic apologia he attempts in certain parts.
<br />
<br />As I said earlier, there are some good parts in this book which will give the reader some insight into a strange man, who happens also to be the greatest jazz composer of the 20th century. So, as a story of a strange man this gets 2 1/2 stars because there's at least as much crap as the good stuff. As a supplement to the music of Mingus, this doesn't hold much value, indeed you may even find yourself disappointed, as i did. The music has far more to say than this book</span>

                    <span>this guy was amazing. His observations and they way he expresses himself are amazing both via his music and his writing. This book IS very feeling-oriented , I agree with the other reviewers, but that's how an autobio should be. It's an AUTObio, so that person will want to recount their life and any story is subjective.  if you're looking to get a dry chronicle of Mingus' life, then don't get this book. But if you want to read an amazing mind put in words, go for it.  I think it's brilliant.</span>

                    <span>I didn't really know what to expect when I opened this book. It was the first time that I've opened a musician's autobiography, and I thought it might have an examination of how he developed his style, how did he decide to play the instrument, etc. This book was a good surprise. Mingus is hardly focusing the music, though it is always there, and choosing to tell us about everything that's around it. It seems as if he knows that the reader is probably familiar with his music, and is trying to make us understand WHY his music is as it is, and it's a smart move. The autobiography sort of completes the music, adding a missing half to it, making me understand Mingus the man, and through it understand better Mingus the artist.<p>The book is written wonderfully, Mingus' writing is brilliant, and the story sweeps you with him and you thank God for it being such a small book or you might've missing a month from reading it rather than a day. Some things are not totally clear, and some things are not explained, but yet, it is a great book, deals with love, crime, blacks and whites, jazz, madness, and the conclusion, which is expressed in the title, that love, for friends, women or for music is the only thing that's really important, and if you dig it, you could find happiness.</span>
