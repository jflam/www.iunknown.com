                    <span>Who would have thought it?  This is a book about getting on top of your piles of papers and stacks of stuff, at home and at work - and I had a hard time putting it down unfinished!  But I had to find my stuff and get out the door to go to work...so I finished reading it the first chance I got.  And then I started over again at page 1.  It's that good!
<br />
<br />Lately I've read several books about getting organized, clearing clutter and filing documents.  Many of them are probably just fine - for someone else, or maybe for everyone else in the world except me.  But my eyes get glazed when I start reading somebody's "aha!" mandate of the Seven Steps To Ultimate Life Organization, or Fifteen and a Half Essential Things to Do Before Breakfast, or some other very specific number of very specific tasks that are supposed to lead you to the promised land of uncluttered serene organization for life.    
<br />
<br />And I still shudder to think of that awful complicated [big name brand] planning system I got handed when a former boss ordered me to attend a "time management" workshop - which turned out to be a product of the company that sells these things. It was just another dang thing I had to waste time and effort maintaining addition to getting my WORK done.  Until I just quit using it.
<br />
<br />Judith Kolberg's approach to "being organized" cuts to the heart of the matter, which is how an individual human being operates in his/her immediate world.  Wow.  Her solutions to organizing problems are as fun and creative as the people she writes about.  These are folks who found themselves in messy muddles at home or the office and needed help in sorting out their environment and making it work for them, not against them.  
<br />
<br />There are some great ideas here, and I can see how a few of them will help me out!  And no matter how much stuff I get rid of as I clear out my own clutter, I can't see giving up my copy of this book anytime in the foreseeable future.

                    <span>With low expectations, I checked this book out from my library. I have read extensively on organization. This book is very worthwhile. I ended up buying it.<br>It had suggestions for organization that no other book has ever touched on. <br>The most useful suggestion was to decide how much of "one thing" it is reasonable to keep. For example, is half the garage full of empty boxes--- too many? For most people, yes. Then you go to what is the best amount to keep--- for you. Also if you assess your space, you might revise how much is reasonable and so on. Smart.</span>

                    <span>I've been chronically disorganized for my whole life. Clutter just seems to perpetuate like a cloud of dust everywhere I go. I've tried filing systems, organizational tools, but nothing worked. Until now. <p>After reading this book, which describes several case studies of chronically disorganized people, I discovered how to live with my chronic disorganization. I implemented a couple of novel ideas, and already crystals of organization are forming in my life, for the first time.<p>Particularly helpful to me was the section on time management: Datebooks never worked for me. I now use the "Panel System" described in this book, which is so far, so good. I also liked the 'Paper Police', how manage out-of-control collections of things, alternate filing systems, and how to attack severely disorganized areas in different ways. <p>The chronic aspect to this book is comforting as it describes me so well. So often organization efforts dwindle and die. Since filing daily is impossible for me, I now have several cubbies on the wall into which I throw papers and receipts (my version of the 'vertical filing' discussed in the book).<p>If you just cannot keep your home or office organized, much to the frustration of yourself and others, this book may have insight that will help you. It sure helped me!</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a wonderful book.  Unfortunately, you really need a coach to get with the program - my copy is now mired in the mess of my bookcase and papers.<p>If you really need this book, then do yourself a favor and hire a professional organizer for a couple of sessions to get you going.</span>
