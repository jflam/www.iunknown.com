But it's much more than that... you can re-read this book (or at least select chapters) and keep learning more. There are so many tips, ideas, strategies, and just plain solid advice, that one reading cannot absorb it all. Even after years in the business, I make a point of browsing this book every 4-5 months.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book on how to run the "business" aspect of a photography studio that I have seen. It's obvious that the author is very experienced in the profession and the book is loaded with tips and personal experiences that will save you time, stress, and money. I thought I could just open up a photography business and be successful, but after reading this book I found out that there was a lot I didn't know. I'm still going to pursue a career in photography, only now I'll be much smarter about it. READ THIS BOOK if you are thinking about making a living in photography!</span>

                    <span>This book is full of helpful info. Covers all aspects of starting a photography business. It was my #1 guide in getting my photography studio up-and-running. I'm afraid it is becoming alittle dated, however. That is my only reason for giving it 4 stars instad of 5. I would be wonderful if Lilley would write an updated - into-the-21st Century-Version!!</span>
