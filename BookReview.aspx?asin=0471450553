                    <span>I've read a few other lighting books over the years but found that Whitehead's approach is superior for creating moods in rooms.  My wife and I prototype interiors in our home and the results from "A Practical Guide" have been outstanding.  We move and change the lighting with temporary luminaires and various wattages to explore the various possibilities before using them in real designs for clients.
<br />
<br />Beware - after buying into his concepts you will be frustrated by the lighting almost everywhere you go.

                    <span>As a Design Instructor and Lighting Professional, I can attest that Randy Whitehead's book is an invaluable asset to both the beginning design professional or the savvy client.  Photos, diagrams, intelligent definitions-high light the the text.  The good humor and obvious talent that Randy Whitehead exhibits makes this book an enjoyable and easily accessible resource. <p>As a design instructor, I have found earlier examples of this author's books to be a dynamic addition to lecture presentations.<p>It would be a great addition to any library.</span>

                    <span>As a homeowner who has been through two major remodels in the past five years, and who has had the good fortune to work with Randall Whitehead on the lighting design and installation for both projects, I read Mr. Whitehead's most recent book from at least two key perspectives:<p>  *  an extremely satisfied client of and collaborator with Randall Whitehead on two major projects; and<p>  *  a homeowner who has learned the value of outstanding lighting design and what that brings to the totality of the home  <br> <br>One of the key elements that distinguishes Randall Whitehead from other lighting designers with whom I am familiar is his ability to quickly put himself inside the mind of the client in a way that immediately allows the entire design project to be collaborative rather than dictatorial, for lack of a better word.  From start to finish on both projects, I had the feeling that my personal goals and tastes were understood, appreciated and treated as more important by far than the need of the designer to employ a certain new technique or some flashy new fixture.  Mr. Whitehead's ability to assimilate a great deal of information and then to explain his ideas in language understandable to the homeowner is refreshing and extremely comforting in a major remodel, and he creates an atmosphere of calm in a process that nearly always stormy at best.  Anyone who has been through a major remodel knows that calm, patience and dependability aren't traits that immediately come to mind when thinking of those integral to the process.  <p>Similarly, in his latest book, Mr. Whitehead walks the reader through major elements of lighting design, using examples to comprehensively cover technical and non-technical areas, making this book accessible, informative and instructional to the layman as well as the professional.<p>My strong preference would be for anyone contemplating a major design or remodel project to have the good fortune to work with Mr. Whitehead on that project.  Failing that, or perhaps prior to a collaborative effort, I recommend this book without hesitation as a way to rapidly enter the magical world of his lighting genius.</span>

                    <span>As a partner in a residential architectural firm in San Francisco I've become intimately aware of the impact good lighting design has on a project.  Through the years I've been through many books, lectures, and showrooms to gain knowledge.<p>One of my favorite sources is Randall Whitehead.  If you've ever seen Randall speak about lighting, you already know his passion for the lighting design industry.  If you missed his speaking engagements, fear not, because he has produced a new book that is as entertaining and as informative as his speaking engagements.  HIs current book "Residential Lighting, A Practical Guide"  is my favorite to date.<p>In one book, he has combined the technical aspects of the myriad lighting products available on the market, with solid design principals (in text and illustrated form) along with photographs of successful and unsuccessful installations.  All this, broken down into exterior and interior applications room by room, makes up one great resource!  Now, I can grab one book to determine the best lighting solution for a given situation.  What a timesaver!<p>This book is a must for anyone faced with deciding how best to light a space.  And, when it comes to our homes, everyone of us is a designer, whether we like to admit it or not!  The formidable decisions existent within the lighting aspect of residential design has just been made a lot easier, thanks to Randall Whitehead.</span>

                    <span>I own five of Mr. Whitehead's books and I use them all frequently.  All are incredible sources of lighting inspiration and I share them with my clients to SEE why I am so passionate about good lighting.   <p>What makes this book particularly exceptional is the combination of the practical necessities of lighting with helpful high-quality photographs.  Like a great cookbook, I find that the graphics really drive his points home and provide the "ah-hah" that text alone cannot provide.  <br>  <p>As an Interior Designer, I know that good lighting design is not only rare to find, but tougher than most people realize.  It looks easy when it's finished, but only when faced with the "blank canvas" of a living space do most clients realize how difficult lighting design truly is.  The Practical Guide presents the fundamentals necessary to analyze and solve most residential lighting situations and helps designers show why going the extra step to implement a lighting plan is essential for a successful interior design.<br>  <br>I have had the opportunity to attend a couple of Mr. Whitehead's professional seminars.  It's usually not long before he has the room in stitches with his lighthearted, to-the-point style.  Mr.Whitehead writes in a similarly engaging manner.  He is not afraid to express (and defend) his opinions, even at the risk of stepping on a few well-shoed toes.</span>
