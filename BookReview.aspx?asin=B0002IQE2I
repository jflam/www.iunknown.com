                    <span>Two strong and convincing leads don't make up for the cheesy stage-play feeling and meandering dialog from two characters who I never really cared much about. Neither seems too redeemable or likeable. 
<br />
<br />This film is preachy without being very entertaining.  There is a message here, and it's a good one, but it's delivered in a melodramatic (and unnecessarily violent) fashion that's overdone and lacking hope or redeemability.  As is the set.
<br />
<br />Interesting to see, but pretty sad, scary, and not very fun.

                    <span>I'm not saying anything about the plot... I'm only saying watch this film because it's the best film I've seen this year. Wonderful story and wonderful acting. Speeman is really good and Marsden... well... Marsden is anbelievable, great... a performance to remember.</span>

                    <span>I had the opportunity to see the movie and thought that they were trying to cover a important issue in such little time.  But I must say, it is worth renting.  Its not about sexual acts, but about the consequences you must accept when doing it.  The acting was okay and would like to have seen a ending other than what was noted.  Something with a finality to it.</span>

                    <span>The 24th day is essentially a play produced for the screen. That, to me, is a good thing. It makes certain that the playwright's dialogue is maintained and that the focus stays on that dialogue. This was used effectively with "The Boys in the Band," "Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean," and several others.
<br />As a community, homosexuals have had their fair share of plays and films that have ranted and raved against the government inaction on AIDS (The Normal Heart; And the Band Played On), awareness raising of self-imposed discrimination against those with AIDS (Jeffrey; Longtme Companion) and general "aint we got it bad" plays (Love, Valour, Compassion; Parting Glances). Not all of these have been great, but they have been intriguing and thought provoking - just what was necessary. Unfortunately, as we've grown accustomed to the reality of AIDS in our lives, we've also become desensitized to the reality of it. There is an entire generation out there that has never known a world without AIDS and safe sex as a mantra. There is a contingent present that chooses to ignore the realities of the disease and its indescriminate behavior. They are the men (and women) that The 24th Day addresses. True it only speaks directly about gay men and "straight" men who stray, but it is the first real play/film to take this attitude to task.
<br />Dan (James Marsden) is a hot film producer out for an evening of fun with his best "girl" friend at (what ostensibly appears to be) a straight bar. However, he manages to get picked up by (or pick up) Tom (Scott Speedman). They retire to Tom's apartment. There Dan discovers that Tom has been stalking him because he believes that Dan gave him AIDS five years previous on his once and only time sleeping with a man. 
<br />Since this much is told on the DVD cover, I've not given anything away. In fact, more could be said without giving away the whole plot, simply because this is less a film about action and plot than it is a character study about sexual responsiblity.
<br />The acting is very good and the set is effective (it is basically a single set for the entire film - remember it is a play to film). If I had any gripes it would be that the play and the film tend to get redundant in the dialogue about halfway through. There seems to be more antagonistic behavior and less actual character development (especially of Dan) than I would like to see. That said, it is important to remember that I think the playwrite was intending that this play be about "everyman" and thus didn't want to bog the play down with heavy details about individuals and take the emphasis off the intended audience. I think this is bold, but ultimately speaks a bit down to the audience, assuming that they wouldn't be able to glean the information from the essence of the material - which is strong.
<br />The DVD is very light on extras, but then this isn't a film you watch for the extras.
<br />
<br />I think you'll enjoy this film.</span>

                    <span>24th Day, a gay psychological suspense thriller, has some moments of slick, polished thrills, but the movie is ultimately flawed by its stagy, histrionic pretensions. Looking more like a second rate off Broadway play, than a fully-fledged motion picture, the movie suffers from a repetitive and rather tedious storyline, which gets old relatively quickly. While the performances of Scott Speedman and James Marsden are strong, the premise suffers from a lack of credibility: I didn't once believe that these two men were gay or remotely attracted to other men - you never see them kissing each other, or other men, even in the flashbacks. They come across as two straight actors playing quasi-gay roles, who were probably just too frightened to kiss each other in case it negatively impacted their careers.  
<br />
<br />The story centers on Tom (Speedman), an easygoing short order cook who allows himself to be picked up by Dan (Marsden), an attractive aspiring filmmaker. Tom takes Dan back to his run-down apartment where they have an affable discussion about movies and continue drinking. Tom soon becomes un-relaxed and starts inappropriately questioning Dan about his sexual history. Tom confesses that he's very inexperienced and that he's only slept with a man once before, five years ago. The man gave him HIV, and he suspects that this man may be Dan. 
<br />
<br />There are a couple of tense scenes as Dan tries to escape, and then tries to get the upper hand by faking sympathy for Tom. But the endless scenes of Tom, yet again, taping Dan's mouth shut to prevent him from talking become a bit repetitive. But the film does work as a pretty astute exercise in denial: Dan is a slick, smooth operator, who is convinced to the point of defiance that he's always been safe, even when Tom tries to convince him otherwise. The viewer never really knows whether Dan is lying or whether he sincerely believes that he always wore condoms even when he was too drunk to remember. Tom, on the other hand, with his cute blond locks, is the diffident guy with loads of charm, but he manipulates the situation, blocking Dan's advances and seducing him at the same time, then erupting in a mountain of anger and bitterness.  
<br />
<br />The atmosphere is suitably claustrophobic as nearly all the action is confined to Tom's apartment. And both Speedman and Marsden, through their strained conversation, beautifully convey the anxiety and tension of the characters. The movie does do a relatively good job of showing the psychological warfare that takes place between the two characters. There are also some interesting questions raised about who should be taking responsibility for practicing safe sex along with the sometimes-indistinct motivations of men who don't necessarily identify as gay, but who have sex with men. These relevant and timely messages, however, can't make up or the predictable and conventional conclusion that most viewers will see coming a mile off. Mike Leonard December 04.
