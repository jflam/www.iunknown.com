                    <span>Out of all the books in my collection on pediatric cardiac conditions I will have to say that this is the best one out there so far.  It has more defects in it and describes them in simple terms then the others books I have seen.  This is the first book a new parent should purchase when they find out that their child has a cardiac condition.</span>

                    <span>My husband and I found this very useful when our child was first diagnosed, I was always referring to the list of terms and the pictures.<p>My only regret is that of another review in that the  statistical information is out of date.</span>

                    <span>As parents of two children with congenital heart defects, we found this book to be a wonderful resource.  It is a must buy for parents who find themselves faced with the prospect of raising a child with a heart  condition.  This book does a wonderful job of describing the types of heart  defects in terms the average person can understand.</span>

                    <span>This book was very informative, but we have found that the newer publication released in 1998 was more up to date. "Heart Defects in Children - What Every Parent Should Know" was written by a nurse, and  has easier to understand explainations of the defects.  It also has a draw  in heart section where you can more easily visualize your child's defect.   Check it out.</span>

                    <span>I learned a lot from reading this book when my daughter was in the hospital having her first heart surgery.  But the mortality statistics are outdated.  The outcomes for children having heart surgery and children with HLHS and Truncus are much more hopeful than they were in 1992.</span>
