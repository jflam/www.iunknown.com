                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Practical Visual C++ takes a straight forward, no-nonsense approach to teaching C++. You start by learning the basics of Developer Studio with the use of the Wizards, editors, and debuggers. Then move on to the core language, including program flow, data types, functions, classes, object-oriented programming, and more. You then progress into the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), the libraries of pre-build classes that Microsoft provides to make Visual C++ programming much easier. By understanding how to use the classes within MFC, you will be able to create nearly any type of program. Specific coverage includes working with dialogs, objects, controls, document-views, file manipulation, and printing.</HTML></span>

                    <span>I found this book easy to follow. Not only do you get an understanding of MS VC++ but you also get a great tutorial on the MSVC IDE. I've read a lot of VC++ books that have left me more confused than educated. In most of the books, by the time you get to the discussion of controls you're already bored out of your wits. This book starts out with dialog boxes and controls, including ActiveX (great from a Visual Basic perspective), and then gets into SDI's, MDI's,Device Contexts, et al. Buy this book for a good general discussion and tutorial of VC++ and then buy a more advanced book which discusses your subject of interest in more detail (e.g., Jeff Prosise's Programming Windows with MFC). The exercises are great so do yourself a favor and key them in. Also, you don't have to be a C++ wiz to understand what's going on.</span>

                    <span>I'm a senior application developer for a computer company, but we're doing mostly in Unix environment, no GUI. I just wanted to learn Windows programming (for fun). So after searching for the right book, comparing different books, I've concluded to buy this one. <P>The reasons why I bought this book:<P>1. It is NOT about C++. <BR>It's about WINDOWS programming, using Visual C++ IDE. Many other books explain about C++ 50% of it! But I know C++, and I have other C++ books. I want to know Windows programming!<P>2. Just right font type and size. <BR>Does this really matter? Yes! I checked other books and the text are all cramped and printed in small size font, which gives me a headache and I know I will put the book away pretty soon.<P>3. This is a VC++ beginner's book.<BR>But it contains enough information to build simple applications.<P>4. Easy reading, no BS.<BR>Unlike other thick books with 50% on C++, this book doesn't go over the history of C++ and Windows platform, and other BS, and it is really easy reading.<P>I gave this book 4 stars, because 1. no book is perfect, 2. it doesn't cover internet applicaiton programming, like socket -- well, this book is about Windows GUI programming and little bit about OS specific programming, like OLE, COM, ActiveX., 3. it does not have CD-ROM and you can't download the sample code from any web sites. This is actually good and bad. I have tons of other computer books with CDs, but I never really look at them. If do, I just "look" at the source code and just run it, and that's it. No real learning. With this book, you MUST follow the steps, go to chapter to chapter in sequence. It's very detailed steps, and gradually, the book stops telling you all the detailed steps, but assumes you learned the steps. Which I think it's a great self-teaching approach. However, sometimes I get lost although I thought I learnt all the previous lessons, then I want to get the source code to see how it's done, but no CD/download is avail.<P>If you know C++, and want to learn Windows Visual C++ programming using MFC, then it is for you. (It only explains about API for one chapter.) The book is not a reference book, well, once you go over the book it could be, but you can't expect to jump into the middle of the book and it shows you how to do things. <P>And remember, you must be committed to go every chapters to learn. Otherwise, this book (or any books) is useless. Hmmm, I'm still in the middle of the book, and it's quite fun.</span>

                    <span>I spent about one month on this book and its easy to follow the instructions. getting basics down in msvc++ is very important for vc++ programmer. I agree with someone's review about no basic socket programming. I have to get another book for that. <BR>I even contacted author and he replied to me about where to get source codes for examples in the book. keep up good work :D</span>

                    <span>It is absolute a great book for beginer and intermediate Visual C++ programmers involved with MFC. The examples are well illustrated and easy to follow/understand! It covers most of the Visual C++ 6 Child Controls. Of course, this book is for programmers with subtantial knowledge of C++. Great book to buy!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I am an undergraduate CS student with intermediate C/C++ skills, but had no prior experience in Windows programming before I bought this book. Since it assumed no prior experience with C++, I thought it could be right for me, as I didn't want a 1200-page book that tried to teach me about pointers and structs. <P>Unfortunately, I was probably more disappointed with this book than with any programming book I bought before. It tries very hard to make things look very easy, in effect obscuring what you are actually doing. Learning to operate a set of wizards will surely not make anyone a Windows programmer.<P>Beginners in Windows programming should instead get Petzold's "Programming Windows": it is very well structured, and spends a lot of time to give you a solid bottom-up understanding of the Windows system. To that, it is a joy to read.</span>
