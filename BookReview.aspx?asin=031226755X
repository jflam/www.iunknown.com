                <span id="Label1"><div>The legendary Paul "Bear" Bryant is recognized nationwide as one of the greatest coaches ever. So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team &#8211; and the beginning of the legend.<br><br><i>The Junction Boys</i> tells the story of Coach Paul "Bear" Bryant's legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined. Only a handful of players survived the entire 10 days, but they braved the intense heat of the Texas sun and the burning passion of their coach, and turned a floundering team into one of the nation's best. <i>The Junction Boys</i> is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. <br><br>In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of <i>Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers,</i> and <i>The Last Picture Show</i>, these young men and their driven coach come to life.<i> The Junction Boys </i>contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America's love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I heard about this book on sports radio in NY. Mike Francessa claimed it was one of the best books he had read and I second that remark. I am not a avid reader of books but finished this one in 2 days. If you are a sports enthusiast don't miss this epic story of the legendary Paul "Bear" Bryant. How one man created a championship program by running his new team into the ground, seeing who wished to remain standing with him on the sidelines of Texas A&M. The book shows how the strength of a coach and the courage of just a few players can overcome all odds. Jim Dent takes you to Junction, Texas and to the campus of A&M with these brave players. This book will not disappoint and it will open your eyes to what the true meaning of competition and rivalries are all about. There are so many inspiring stories that it will leave you with a lasting impression on what hard work can do for not only a team, but individuals who give their all for that team! From now on I'm rooting for the Aggies!</span>

                    <span>The grueling 10 days in Junction, Texas, give another meaning to football's warrior mystique. Because of the vastly higher financial stakes in college football today, there will never again be a hellish camp like the one Jim Dent so richly portrays in this book about Texas A&M in the late summer of 1954.<P>The obvious question is, of course, why would anyone subject himself to flat out torture for the sake of 60 minutes of glory on Saturday afternoons? As Dent shows, the reader must first understand the players' desperations to remain in college or face a lifetime at a harsh dead end.<P>In essence, it's a predicament those who never face will never understand. Many of the Junction Boys had two options with seemingly the same end: either die right there on the field trying or return home and agonize the rest of their lives regretting every second.<P>Of the many who quit, most went on with their self-respect in tact yet always held a grudge towards Bear Bryant for setting them up to fail.<P>Whatever your opinion is on Bryant's tactics, there is no question that he is a true original in every sense. No one will ever be able to get away with what he did at Junction, risking his kids' lives for a lesson in desire. College football is too much of a business to have investments playing with broken hips and jaws, although to an extent plaeyrs still play with emmense pain.<P>Football may never be called America's pasttime, but it is definitely the nation's passion -- for better or for worse.<P>To understand why, read about what drove the Junction Boys.</span>

                    <span>The Junction Boys is the story of Coach Paul Brayant, and his first years at Texas A&M, and the ten hard days at Camp Junction that he put his new team through. The coach drove most of the players to quick doing camp, less than half that made the trip to Junction remained. I read the book to learn more about Coach Brayant, the only thing I really knew about him was that at one time he had the most wins of any college football coach. My thing is that I don't really like autobiographies written in the novel form, so I'll have to read another book on the coach to learn more about him, I think I would like the movie version of this book better, but it was ok.</span>
