                    <span>William Trevor guides us through streets and dank parlors and weakly lighted public places where his characters guard or choose to unravel those darker aspects of living he understands so well. In A BIT ON THE SIDE Trevor has written twelve short stories that could have been written by no one else.  His prodigious gifts as a writer make him privy to the musings we all hold in private, knowing that voicing them would doubtless find misunderstanding glances in parting eyes of the people in retreat from our confessions.
<br />
<br />Where does Trevor find these thoughts, much less these subtly drawn characters?  In lonely corner tables in pubs, in the shy fears of wives of husbands departed in body or in spirit, in expectations of young Irish girls dreaming of better lives in America, or of poor pregnant mothers willing to offer their incipient child for adoption to spare their husband's jobless humiliation? 
<br />
<br />While William Trevor is a demanding author, one who graces his stories with subtle time lapses or changes that require the reader to be on the alert for the assured nuances of his craft, he is never less than amazing in his ability to paint portraits of people so odd in their ordinariness that ending a short story does not allow us to leave them alone.  This is writing of the highest order - challenging, enriching, plangently longing, unforgettable.  These are twelve treasures.  Highly recommended.

                    <span>I have read many great short-story collections, but this one is the best I have read in a very long time. A Bit on the Side showcases several of the darkest, bleakest, most thought provoking and haunting short stories out there.  William Trevor has delved into human emotion in a way that most short-story writers aren't able to convey in a few pages.  Some of the stories touched me, others disturbed me.  And that is what I love about this collection.  Trevor made me FEEL for the characters.  A book is definitely a keeper when the language is so palpable it almost jumps out of the pages.  My favorite stories are "Sitting with the Dead," "Justina's Priest," "Traditions," and "A Bit on the Side."  I haven't read Trevor's previous efforts, but I will definitely give them a whirl.  I cannot recommend A Bit on the Side: Stories enough.</span>

                    <span>Finding an author who labors for subtlety, one who more than appreciates it but rather writes for and of the reason of subtlety, for it alone, is awfully, awfully rare.  Most authors don't seem to fully understand the magic of quiet intelligence, which allows a reader to slip inside a story and synthesize the events and details.  As I have learned in school, it is subtlety that allows a reader to disengage from his or her life and suspend disbelief.  I have never read any of William Trevor's work before, but I understand now why he is considered a master storyteller.  A BIT ON THE SIDE is a remarkable collection indeed.
<br />
<br />I recommend Paddock's A SECRET WORD, a brilliant novel-in-stories, for the same reasons.</span>

                    <span>I find this collection to be equal to Trevor's two immediately previous short story collections "After Rain" and "The Hill Bachelors" both of which I have also read along with 3 of his novels. If you are unfamiliar with contemporary British writing, this author's short stories or novels might be a good introduction. It's helpful to have a compact Oxford English Dictionary since occasionally a phrase comes up which is more British than American.   He deals in both English and Irish themes, both urban and rural, religious and secular.  Many of his stories deal with contemporary themes such as the clash between more modern values, often including adultery or divorce , and more traditional religious values. "Justina's Priest" is about this conflict. Many might be considered nostalgic for the past. He also sometimes writes from a child's or an adolescent's viewpoint.  He often seems to  put  conservative values in a positive light, though he also deals with urban themes, such as modern dating services, and also with crime.  You would have to say that one appeal of stories like "Sitting With The Dead," "Sacred Statues", "Big Bucks" and "Traditions" is nostalgic since they examine aspects of traditional Irish culture or religion and look more to the past than the future. "Solitude" is another powerful story,really a horror story, about a crime committed by a child and its consequences for her & her family; and "On The Streets" is also about the crime of stalking.  His stories about adultery, "A Bit On The Side" and "Graillus' Legacy" are nevertheless highly romantic, as lovers fondly recall memories of former or soon-to-be-broken relationships.

                    <span>It's so pleasing to see Trevor's prolific talent back in action,  and so soon after his celebrated last collection The Hill Bachelors. How many living short story writers now on either side of the Atlantic are Trevor's equal? Perhaps a few as good - Alan Sillitoe, Alice Munro, and Richard Bausch - but few better. 
<br />
<br />A claim most reviewers of short fiction are helpless to resist is that their favourite stories in the collection are the 'best:  perhaos solely on the grounds that they prefer them. I don't know which are the 'best' stories in A Bit on the Side, but I know which are my favourites. They are 'Justina's Priest', 'An Evening Out' and the title story, which, along with certain other stories in this collection appeared first in the New Yorker. 
<br />
<br />As an aside, I am also heartened to see non-US authors (who publish in US magazines) like Trevor are now eligible for entry in the O. Henry awards; his recent win is most welcome. Not least because he set the standard in short-story writing decades before many of its contemporary practitioners were even born.
<br />
<br />The loneliness, pain and stoicisim of the ordinary men, women and children who people Trevor's fiction are as thoroughly realised as ever. Trevor is as unjudgemental as Chekhov. An atheist friend of mine told me how much he was moved by the plight of Father Clohessy in 'Justina's Priest', who is made to realise: 'What priests and Bishops had been - their strength and their parish people's salvation - was mocked in television farces, deplored, presented as absurdity. That other priests in other towns, in cities, in country parishes, were isolated by their celibacy, by the mourning black of their dress, had been a consolation once, but that source of comfort had long ago dried up.' 
<br />
<br />Not that the collection is depressing. While these stories, like Ford's A Multitude of Sins,  are typically variations on the theme of adultery, they also powerfully stand up for the redemptive, affiriming power of love in Ireland and Anglo-Ireland. It seems only fair to conclude with these words, taken from the title story of the collection:
<br />
<br />'Nothing of love had been destroyed today: they took that with them as they drew apart and walked away from one another, unaware that the future was less bleak than now it seemed, that in it there would still be the delicacy of their reticence, and they themselves, as love had made them for a while.'
