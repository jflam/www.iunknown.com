                    <span>Master Ni, Hua Ching is the diffinative authority on Taoist Integral science. With the Esoteric Tao Te Ching, he presents the core of Taoist philosophy for modern people to consider. This elucitation of the ancient  way is clear and precise. It is a fundamental tool for achieveing what the  Ancient Chinese called 'Wu Wei' or non-doing. This book takes phenomenal  bounds by presenting Lao Tzu's idea of self-government and a eutopiean  society. It reveals the way and how to reach it. Having read many  translations of the Tao Te Ching, I find this one to be top shelf material.</span>

                    <span>This doesn't read like most translations of the Tao Teh Ching (and I have translations of both the traditional text and the text discovered in the Xian tombs). However, I like what he has to say, and when I check his  "translations" against a more traditional, literal translation,  the two together make a lot of sense (he shed a lot of light on an  otherwise incomprehensible literal translation in another book). I think  what he is doing is therefore more of a paraphrase than a direct  translation, a paraphrase that is an extremely concise commentary. So I  think his approach is valid. You don't need to have another version of the  Tao Te Ching to follow along, by the way. In reviews of other books by Ni,  he is accused of being new age or self taught. I don't know about the new  age part, but somewhere in this book he inasmuch acknowledges he is  "self taught" and that is not a problem for me. Maybe Lao Tse was  self taught, too. I find this book very helpful.</span>
