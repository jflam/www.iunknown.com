                    <span>This is undoubtly Robert Allens best book to date. So much information, so many diverse ways to make money. The naysayers are probably college graduates who would prefer to sit behind a desk for 40 years and say; "Yes master" ENT!For the entrepeneurs and business leaders, this book is a must read. You can start with network marketing, create income and enjoy the same tax benefits that bg busineeses enjoy.You can use Bob Allens Real Estate strategies and still make money in the real estate market. People who say it's over, better read this book. You can also safely invest in the stock market with Index Funds and/or covered calls with the Cooper Method. Or you can enjoy 100% risk reduced returns in the options market.Bob Allen has written a excellent book, probably his best. Don't knock it, try it.I also recommend Wall Street Money Machine for even more covered calls and option strategies and Wealth 101.</span>

                    <span>Despite the ever present 1 star reviewer (s), this is one great book by Robert Allen. I don't understand why this guy continues to bash Robert Allen and other successful authors. It does tell us how this person spends his time though doesn't it?<P>In Multiple Streams of Income, Robert Allen reveals strategies and ideas that are right for the times. People who have been downsized, unemployed or even worse, underemployed and/or tired of the rat race, corporate lemmings etc. will find new hope with strategies that really work.<P>I can't help but notice the continual attacks on network marketing. All this tells me is that this basher has probably tried and failed in network marketing and therefore chooses to attack it. Or is incredibly ignorant. Just look at the earnings reports of any of the publicly traded companies or read any of the network marketing trade publications to see just how this great inductry is doing.<P>I have found a company that is only a year and ahalf old and is already doing $40 Million in sales with projections of hitting $1 Billion by 2007. Network marketing is alive and well. There is also a website that can bring you up to speed on the current state of network marketing http://www.myxongo.com/platinumteam<P>But if you don't like network marketing, that's okay. Allen offers 7 other dynamic income streams that don't involve network marketing, can be started with little or no money and offer high return with very little if any risk.<P>Besides network marketing, I have been enjoying a nice income with the Copper Cover Calls technique and 3 other strategies. This is great book and America owes Mr. Allen a debt of gratitude for sharing this powerful information for the rest of us. <P>Thank you Robert!</span>

                    <span>While I admire the success of people like the reviewer who precedes mine, network marketing never really appealed to me. I tried it once back in the 70's, had a lousy sponsor who didn't teach me beans and the company I was in loaded me and other distributors with soaps, shampoo's and so on.<P>That said, what I like about Robert Allen's book is that he recommends network marketing as a choice but also recommends other ways to create residual income, that are low risk and low cost.<P>I highly recommend this book by Mr. Allen. It's great.</span>

                    <span>Robert Allen has written an excellent book here. For people opposed to network marketing (I'm very bullish on network marketing), that's o kay, Allen offer many other strategies to create wealth. In fact, to create Multiple Streams of Income.<P>For me, the best and safest way to create multiple streams of income is via network marketing. With network marketing, you can use the same power of leverage that Allen uses and suggests in his real estate books. It is the same principle that Donald Trump used to become a billionaire. In fact, speaking of Donald Trump, several years ago The Donald was on a tv talk show and when asked if he had to start over again, what would he do differently. Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and go to work!<P>Personally, I feel that everyone should set up a network marketing business. It's low cost, can be started part, part time and you can create a high income rapidly if you are with the right company and put forth the right effort.<P>Enough of network marketing. It's a winning stategy and I am glad that Robert Allen understands it and is recommending it.<P>Allen also discusses real estate. He explains how to buy real estate with no money down and using the power of leverage. He also discusses tax liens and discounted mortgages. Both powerful ways to create passive income and again, Allen shows you ways to invest in these power packed strategies with no money down.<P>Allen also discusses how to be an intropreneur (not my choice) and how to use the internet.<P>All in all, Multiple Streams of Income is a powerful book that can add many streams of income to your income portfolio. Much better strategy than relying on just 1 income streams---a job.<P>AND the good news is that anybody can start any of these strategies right now while you are working at your job. They can all be started part, part time with little or no investment and create cash flow immediately.<P>Great book Mr. Allen. I recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I thumbed through this one at the Sam's warehouse store. Thank goodness! It is large type and full of ads and worthless advice. I don't know the guy who wrote this book. I see from some of the other reviews here that he must have a habit of writing this type of book. I am glad that I wasn't taken in by the title. The book reads like the ads you used to see on matchbook covers "EARN EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR stuffing envelopes from home!"<P>Maybe the real "Income Stream" is to write a book like this and then have people write "positive" reviews to keep the rating high. Do you think that would work?<P>What has me wondering is that people are posting positive comments that aren't actually useful reviews. Why would someone waste a paragraph in a review talking about his vacation instead of the book? <P>There is something fishy about these positive, so-called "reviews." There is also something fishy about the book. It stinks. <P>But hey... Why should I complain? I SAVED REAL MONEY... by not buying this book.</span>
