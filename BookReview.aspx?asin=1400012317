                    <span>This is an excellent guide for those wanting to visit places associated with the events of the American Revolution.  It is divided into sections by state with a brief overview of the state.  Each state is divided into sub-sections by city/town/village (depending on the size of the site).  Under each sub-section is an overview of the area's history and the role it played in the revolution, plus a comprehensive listing of colonial era houses, museums, monuments, battle fields, etc.  Each listing includes a description and some history (for the most important ones), plus contact information, hours of operation, etc.  Most of the town/city sections have a listing of historic eateries and lodgings.<br>   We have used this book throughout this summer, and we have had one of the best vacations ever!  We were thrilled to find many Revolutionary War sites throughout our state which we did not know about.  We even visited some Dutch Colonial houses in the heart of New York City!  We had no idea that such things could survive in New York.  It was truly amazing to see these houses, and that alone would have made it worthwile to purchase this book.  We recommend that anyone wanting to visit any of the sites listed, calls ahead to confirm the hours, etc.  We run into several places that were being restored and were closed to the public.  Not a fun thing to find out, after traveling any length of time to get there.  Also, as some of these sites are quite small and run by very small staff, their hours of operation can be by appointment, again good reason to call ahead.</span>
