                    <span>I heard Bob Burg at a convention and later bought his book.
<br />I was. at that time, just starting my business as a business coach. Today I am considered an expert in networking and in fact, I am writing a 90 Day guide for people who join networking organizations. 
<br />None of this would have happened, had it not been for Bob Burg's book. I am grateful that he is one of my trustworthy friends.

                    <span>Bob Burg's style is positive, upbeat and entertaining. I refer to "Endless Referrals" frequently. The ten questions in the second chapter, along with chapters eight and nine have contributed tremendously to my success in various endeavors. These parts alone are worth more than the price of the book. With that said, however, ALL the material is outstanding; the ideas for achieving success in all areas of life are pragmatic and energizing. Bob Burg's work stands out in that way certainly, but also couples the road to success with making the world a nicer place by promoting respectful interaction. This book is not to be missed!</span>
