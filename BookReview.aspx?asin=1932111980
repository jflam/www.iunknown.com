                    <span>There's basically only four kinds of things that can go wrong with your PC: lost or stolen, hardware failures, software failures, stolen data. Each of these, however, can really mess up your day. 
<br />
<br />Each of these however can be not solved but made much better with just a bit of advance planning. Losing your computer and/or crashing the disk drive is easy to fix if you have a backup, or if like Beethoven you remember everything in the manuscript you lost on the train. 
<br />
<br />Most of this book, however, turns out to be software oriented. It's here that the bad guys can attack your system from afar with virtually no chance of getting caught. Perhaps they just want to screw up your life with a virus they created just for fun. Perhaps they want to send you a never ending stream of advertising, even customized based on keeping a record of what web sites you've visited. But perhaps they also want to capture your credit card number so that they can use it to buy a new computer (to be shipped somewhere in Africa). 
<br />
<br />The first thing I look for on books like this is CoolWebSearch. If they talk about it, they know whereof they speak. And sure enough CoolWebSearch is discussed on page 231. The book says: "Removing ... can be an extremely complicated process. He'd absolutely right. When one of my companies machines gets one of these, sometimes all I can do is go back to the last system restore file, or even start over with a new version of the operating system. 
<br />
<br />Invaluable help if you do just a little bit of work in advance.</span>

                    <span>Looking at the litany of mishaps that could befall your PC, as described by the book, one might wonder if you would buy it in the first place, had you known of these. Realistically, many of us live by, if not through, our PCs. So you still need one.
<br />
<br />The authors cover hardware and software problems. Many. Like your disk getting flaky and crashing. Perhaps just a function of time.
<br />
<br />But in some ways, the software issues are the ones that have grown, as compared to a book of this ilk written ten years ago. Now, the authors devote a chapter each to the areas of Internet fraud, spam and junkware. A sad sign of our times. The discussion on Internet fraud talks briefly about phishing, amongst other topics.  While the advice on avoiding it is good, the chapter perhaps does not give enough space to this hugely growing blight. In the two years to the end of 2004, it rose some 7000%. It has emerged as a danger to many, especially those new to the Internet. Far more dangerous than being spammed by rebates, which is another topic in this chapter, to which a similar amount of space is allocated.
<br />
<br />There is also an amusing chapter on various other Internet hazards. In part, it declaims about the possible perils of meeting people online. You know, online dating and all that. And, like, gee, shall I meet him/her in person? In a dark alley, perhaps? Another chapter that speaks to our times.</span>

                    <span>This book is potentially the most important book for beginner and intermediate computer users to purchase.  As I read the horror stories I felt like the authors had peered into my life and the lives of many of my closest friends.  It taught me so many things without making me feel like a complete idiot.  It also settled my mind to know that I am not the only person making some stupid mistakes with all this technology.  Thank you Jesse Torres and Peter Sideris for writing this book!</span>
