                <span id="Label1">In the tradition of nineteenth-century novelists who turned to the essay, Marilynne Robinson offers a beautiful and authoritative approach to refining the ideas our culture has handed down to us. Whether considering how the McGuffey readers were inspired by midwestern abolitionists; how creationism, "long owned by the Religious Right," has spurred on contemporary Darwinism; or how John Calvin, who was a Frenchman in Geneva, points to America's continental origins, Robinson writes with great conviction. Her essays are filled with the excitement of discovery. "Who can imagine how the things we call ideas live in the world," she writes, "or how they change, or how they perish, or how they can be renewed." In these ten essays, Marilynne Robinson brilliantly addresses subjects that have become the territory of specialists - religion, history, the state of society. The writing is "contrarian in method and spirit," as she states in her introduction, but "Who can imagine how the things we call ideas live in the world, or how they change, or how they perish, or how they can be renewed?"

                    <span>Full disclosure: I made it halfway through the book before I couldn't take any more (this after a very well-written and encouraging Introduction).<P>Robinson has an axe to grind, and she conjures up a straw man idea called "Darwinists". These unnamed Darwinists are claimed to believe certain things, mostly outrageous, and without a footnote or even bibliographical reference to be seen. This Darwinist she conjures is in fact based on leftist and behaviorist mythology.<P>To take one quote - "Characteristically, however, Darwinists, like primitive economists [another straw man -SC] assume that what is humane [in short, altruism - SC] is unnatural, and therefore wrong".<P>Unfortunately Robinson is the only one falling into the naturalistic fallacy trap (which she uses to slander her imagined foes) - that what is natural must be good. Please present me one respected biologist or economist who thinks this way. They categorically do not exist.<P>In fact if you pick up any Dawkins, EO Wilson, Robert Wright, Pinker, etc etc - all are very careful (due to straw men like Robinson's, no doubt), to spell out that one should not draw the conclusion that what is natural is good. I.e. don't confuse "is" with "ought". And don't draw the conclusion that just because something is made statisically more likely by genetic influence, that it's 100% inevitable, or that it in any way justifies or removes responsibility from actual behavior.<P>Evolved tendency to rape is a good example - yes this is likely to be part of the genome, however actually carrying out the act in the face of strong cultural rules and the brain's built-in prudence mechanism in no way removes individual responsibility for the act. Appreciating the facts and likelihoods, whether positive or negative, can shed insight into human behavior, social problems, and public policy. I don't see what's so bad about that.<P>Robinson continues her argument. She almost exclusively uses Darwin's Origin of Species (which I suspect is all she's read, though again we really don't know due to the absence of bibliography). Her arguments against the theory are embarrasingly wrong and uninformed. For instance she says the theory can't account for social behavior among animals - a common mistake of novices (see kin selection, reciprocal altrusim).<P>She repeatedly tries to discredit the theory using guilt by association. Associated with social darwinism, eugenics, Hitler. No doubt this is the motivation for her diatribe in the first place.<P>Robinson apparently doesn't like the idea of darwinian selection, and its parallels in economic competition. She sees it as celebrating the selfish - selfish genes are a fact, but no scientist or economist to my knowledge has interpreted this to be therefore a moral virtue (in fact the opposite is true - many of them view it as something close to evil).<P>But given all that, what does she expect scientists to do? Because they unearth evidence that selection didn't always favor that which is virtuous, they ought to pretend like the science is wrong?<P>Ulimately, rhetorical, citation-free attack on science isn't worth much, and it's probably my fault for even indulging her a for a few chapters. If you have any comments, please email me at sgcjr at yahoo dot com. I just hope no one who's genuinely open-minded draws any conclusions about the state of biology based on this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a difficult review to write. I think very highly of Marilynne Robinson's work, and I would hate it if my wooden pedantries scared away even one prospective reader. As described here, the topics discussed in this book may seem dry, or irrelevant to your concerns, or unworthy of further discussion. In fact, "The Death of Adam" is not dry, but exhilarating; not irrelevant, but essential; and it represents a tradition of intelligent, fair-minded discourse that has not been an ideal, let alone a standard, in the 20th century. <P>It's informative, certainly--not as a collection of facts to be memorized, but as a sort of web of active information, the strands of which you can follow as far as you like. The writing is dazzling, with all the power of a language fully employed by a fully attending author. Her humor is devastating; better still, she uses it therapeutically, as a surgeon uses a scalpel. At its best, "The Death of Adam" makes one aspire to be as curious, thoughtful, compassionate, and honest as its author. <P>Chief among her concerns is that we treat the past as little more than a scapegoat for our era's problems. Important subjects on which people once failed, honestly, to reach agreement, we now fail even to recognize as important; and ideas of the past are contemptible except where they anticipate ideas of the present. It takes a bit of mental effort to remember that this attitude is not common to all times and places; it takes even more effort to realize what we're in danger of becoming by refusing to question its necessity. One of Ms. Robinson's most radical correctives is "to read major writers, and establish within rough limits what they did and did not say." A reasonable request, and yet...<P>Here I must bring up an earlier reviewer's remarks. Certainly, everyone should be able to differentiate between fair-minded criticism, and snarls of half-bright belligerence; still, I can't let the remarks of "a reader"--undeserved honorific!--from Washington DC go unchallenged. We have here essays on subjects ranging from neo-Darwinism to Puritanism to market economics. Two fascinating pieces trace the influence of Marguerite de Navarre on John Calvin, another demonstrates the anti-slavery subtext of the McGuffey readers, and yet another discusses the life and writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a Lutheran theologian who was executed by the Nazis. You'll notice, I hope, that "a reader" has nothing to say about Ms. Robinson's treatment of these subjects, offers no refutation of any of her statements, and suggests no other writer from whom the interested reader might seek better information. Instead, in his or her own inimitable style, "a reader" slaps her wrist for writing "poor prose." Personally, I tremble at daring even to praise so exquisite a prose writer as Ms. Robinson; one has to do it with words, after all!<P>I am not an academic, thank God, but I didn't find a single word she uses to be obscure. (And had I run into a word I didn't know, I would've appreciated the opportunity to look it up and find out what it meant. I don't think I'm alone in feeling that learning new things is an agreeable fringe benefit of reading books.) If her prose is poor, it's certainly no worse than that of Emerson, Chesterton, Sir Thomas Browne, Dickens, or Tolstoy, which is more than good enough for me.<P>Ms. Robinson obviously has no desire to baffle anybody; the entire point of this book is to affirm what we owe to ourselves and each other as civilized beings--foremost, perhaps, being the willingness to communicate honestly and in good faith.<P>But we are to put all this and more aside, so that we may consign Ms. Robinson to an arguably mythical class of environmentalist fanatics. This is a computer-like simulacrum of thought--if "expression of concern," then "diagnosis of hysteria." It's no wonder that so many people believe computers can be programmed to think. The chapter on "Wilderness" comprises barely ten pages out of 254; its historical claims are matters of public record, all perfectly verifiable. If any of its predictions are wrong, I would love to see the evidence (as, I'm sure, would Ms. Robinson). Far from focusing on "the plight of the koala," she mentions the animal once, as an example of how we concentrate on "environmental issues that photograph well."<P>Marilynne Robinson is also the author of the harrowing (and highly recommended) "Mother Country," the information in which could jaundice the sunniest of souls. And yet, despite having an unexcelled understanding of human cruelty and the drab postulates it thrives on, she's still engaged with the world--still passionate about the human capacity for feeling, knowing, and communicating things of transcendent value. If that's hysteria, I hope it's contagious!<P>To those who are already familiar with "Death of Adam," I heartily recommend a somewhat kindred book, also available from Amazon: Alan Garner's "The Voice That Thunders."</span>
