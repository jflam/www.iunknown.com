                    <span>I have loved reading this book. I was stuck home for while and found an old battered copy of the first 'Please Understand me" - I was hooked. It is filled with nuggets of insight and has changed how I perceive the behavior of others. It has been great to be able to rethink people's behavior that bothered/upset/hurt me as operating with a different set of priorities and tendencies. It has also helped me manage how I relate to different people, minimizing some tensions (at least on my part).   <p>I am encouraging everyone to buy the book.</span>

                    <span>I've read a number of personality and temperment studies, and this is quite simply the best one I've seen to date (01/16/2005). It is extremely easy to read without the use of complicated language. The knowledge is practical and fairly easy to remember, as long as you're trying. Get it, read it, study it, and give it as a gift! I don't give many 5's.
<br />
<br />This author expounds his earlier work of the same title to include devoted chapters to the major areas of most peoples' lives; that of marriage/dating (amusingly labeled "Mating"), parenting, and leadership (i.e work). Each one of these chapters is worth the price of this book in themselves. This book is a lesson in tolerance, understanding, and harmonious relationships.
<br />
<br />Of course, there's a temperment sorter for the reader to take and in-depth descriptions of each of the sixteen personality types using the Meyers-Briggs classifications (i.e. I or E, N or S, N or T, and J or P). I think this author's definitions are more intuitive than Meyers and Briggs. With the use of easy to understand figures, anyone can figure out the temperments of those people around us with a high degree of accuracy with very little practice.
<br />
<br />I simply love the way that Keirsey breaks down the various temperments into four basic types (Artisians, Rationals, Guardians, and Idealists) and discusses each types' strengths and areas in need of development (of which none of us are immune). The simplistic use of diplomat, strategist, tactician, and logistics makes this book easy for anyone to understand.</span>

                    <span>I really liked this book a lot. It gave wonderful background information about the Myers-Briggs personality typing theory, the temperment descriptions were great (and very detailed), and the type descriptions were detailed and easy to understand. The only complaints that I have about the book are: there could have been more information on parent/child type interactions and type interactions in relationships (i.e. more information on _specific_ type interactions).</span>
