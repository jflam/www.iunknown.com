                    <span>The Last Tsar is the epitome of what a great detective story should be. Radzinsky goes into the lives of the most famous family in Russian history and gives an account of their aristocratic lives and their tragic fall as prisoners under Communist Russia. Quite possibly the greatest book written on the lives of the Romanovs second to only Nicholas and Alexandra.</span>

                    <span>Because of the author's access to the newly-opened archives, this book is a treasure-trove of information on the reign of Russia's last tsar. His use of Nicholas's diaries made the man come alive, so the reader could see him as a man basically in the wrong place at the wrong time, a man who meant well, but who was a product of the 19th century and just couldn't adjust to a radically changing world. After reading this book, I felt as if I understood Nicholas, and the full scope of the tragedy visited upon him. But I didn't find the book to be especially well-written (or perhaps this is a function of poor translation). The use of half-sentences and the excessive moralizing put me off, as did his beating the reader over the head with the coincidences of dates (e.g., the 17th). He seemed to be utterly captivated by the fact that so much happened on the 17th of various months, as if this was supposed to mean something. An index of the Grand Dukes and Duchesses would have bee! n helpful, as there were so many of them that it was impossible to follow. Some were Nicholas' aunts and uncles, some his sisters and brothers, and some his daughters. It was a nightmare trying to figure this out. More seriously, I found myself wanting more context. He made it appear as if the Russian Revolution was a function of the disastrous war with Japan, WWI and the arrival of Rasputin. While these were undoubtedly factors, and huge ones, I wanted to know more about the conditions under which the Russian people were living in 1914. Why did communism appeal to them? Why were they so hostile to the tsar? (As he himself says, Peter, Catherine and Nicholas's own father were much more brutal than he was, and they were called "Great." Nicholas on the other hand was "Bloody.") I was also thoroughly confused on the events of 1917 - what was the Kerensky Government and how did the exiled revolutionaries suddenly get so powerful as to overthrow it? Who were the! Whites? I wanted more on the civil war so that I could und! erstand what was happening at Ekaterinburg. In his effort to portray everything that happened as it was happening, the author tended to lose sight of the forest for the trees.</span>

                    <span>A very interesting look into the fading dynasty of the Romanovs. "The Last Tsar" brings the incompetent rule of Nicholas II to light and the eccentric exploits of his wife and family and their eventual imprisonment and execution. At times the text drags on a bit, but over all I would recommend this book to any interested in the Romanovs and the fall of Imperial Russia.</span>

                    <span>This novel displayed great detective work by Radzinskii. It gives as much detail as possible about Tsar Nicholas II, his family and their last days. He searched archives that were previously closed to non-government personnel and he corresponded with those who were either witnesses or heard accounts (via second hand) from witnesses such as parents or grandparents. Tsar Nicholas II is shown as a Tsar not for power, but out of obligation. He is shown as a loving husband and caring father. The execution of this family is tragic.</span>

                    <span>Radzisky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II" was a fine written book. Radzinsky writes this book as if he were a detective himself. The most compelling and moving segments of the book are his clear explanations and emphasis on the events that took place after the murders in Ekaterinburg. <P>Although Radzinsky shines in this later portion of the book, it seems to me that the previous portions were somewhat flawed. I did not approve of the way Radzinsky made accusations, such as the one regarding a love affair between Anna Vyrobova and Nicholas, without showing any hard evidence. Unfortunately, I felt as if most of his book disproved many of his own theories, such as those of the affairs. <P>One can clearly see that this book was written by a native Russian. And in this Radzinsky probably shined the most. He had many resources available that many western authors did not. Hence, Radzinsky was able to clearly put most of the pieces in place. <P>Perhaps one of the most creative aspects of his book was the way information was often displayed. It was not only his own writings. He often had a number of people tell the same story from their own perspective. Unfortunately, this often led to questions as to "who really killed the tsar?" But on the other hand, one is able to draw their own conclusions. <P>Radzinsky brilliantly analyzed everything following the execution of the former Tsar and his family. The information is very detailed; so much that one can picture the exact atrocities that were committed, which of course are very unsettling. <P>This book was written during and after the fall of the Soviet Union. I believe Radzinsky is one of the first to have truly depicted the most complete analysis of the Tsar's murder, which remained mostly secret until the fall of the Soviet Union. <P>Even though one may not necessarily approve of things said, or necessarily like every aspect of the book, it is a must read for any Romanov or Nicholas II aficionado.</span>
