                    <span>I was expect high standards from this book given that is was from Sams Publishing, but it looks like no one proof read this book. There are missing or incorrect images throughout this book. When pointing this out to Sams Publishing, they fobbed me off telling me that they would get in touch with the author to get him to send the missing or incorrect pictures. I am still waiting 2 months later. I would say ignore this book, unless it is second edition. I just find it would be a good book, if someone had check it out first. Nevermind, try again. :(</span>

                    <span>C# and Managed DX9 are arguably the easiest way to write understandable 3-D code.  You don't have to mess with all of the convoluted C++ jargon and strange uses of variables that are initialized after passing them to methods.
<br />
<br />I cannot stress enough how useful this book has been in the current game I am working on (a 3-D RTS).  The chapters on User Interface and how to write a custom GUI have been particularly useful with where i'm at now.
<br />
<br />This book would have also saved me tons of time earlier in the development process as he goes over such simple things as handling device lost states (such as when the user minimizes your game) and how to display an accurate framerate (I wasted tons of time on that last year!).
<br />
<br />Tom also shows you how to write networking code to make a multiplayer game as well as how to do things such as have a nice skybox, multiple levels, loading screens, player selection screens, font output, and even the use of Shaders (to make objects shiny).  He also shows how to do mesh animation using mesh hierarchies - which is very important if you want your model to be able to have different moving parts that animate (such as for walking).
<br />
<br />This book covers a wide breadth of topics that any new programmer to game design will find useful.  If you pair it up with his Managed DX9 Kickstart book (which you should read first probably), it will take you to the point where you can write your own framework for just about any game you want to write.  It does not cover really advanced topics such as pathfinding algorithms and fancy AI code, but it will give you a broad overview and allow you to write several fun games (I'm especially fond of Blockers).</span>

                    <span>Tom Miller has succeeded once again with writing an excellent book that assists those of us who are using Managed DirectX and C# instead of the more typical C++ with Un-managed interfaces.
<br />
<br />This book is fairly easy for the beginner, but does cover other topics such as using DX9's custom interfaces to make GUIs for your games.  This has been very helpful with my project that I started after reading Tom Miller's first book (Managed DX9 KickStart), which is also an excellent book for beginning 3-D Game programmers.
<br />
<br />The source code included is well written and the author is responsive to questions on his blog at: http://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/</span>
