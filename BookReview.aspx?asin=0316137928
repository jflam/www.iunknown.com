                    <span>James and Deloris met in high school after attending a basketball game. They married on Feb. 17, 1963. Michael one of four children was born. The youngest son of the Jordan household, baseball was Michaels favorite sport. One day his father put up two wooden backboards and baskets and gave the boys a basketball. They called it the Rack. Michael practiced often to try to keep up with his brothers. When in high school it was recommended he attend a basketball camp known as a Five <BR>Star Camp. Education was always important to his parents, they knew that unless he was a good student all of his athletic talent would go to waste. In the fall of 1981 Michael enrolled in the University of North Carolina. After playing for three years there was little left for Michael to accomplish. He decided to turn pro and on June 19, 1984 he was picked by the Chicago Bulls. He made history and won championships for the Bulls and won consecutive MVP awards.<P>I liked this book very much. It is very hard to shorten in length the information this book has given me about the life of this great basketball star.<P>The saddest part of the book was when they talked about his father dying. From what the police could piece together James had apparantley pulled of the highway to take a nap and was attacked by two eighteen year old boys. They were later arrested and charged for the murder of James Jordan. Michael retired to spend more time with his family.</span>

                    <span>The number one sports writer for kids, Matt Christopher, writes about basketball superstar Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player ever. He covers his childhood, college career, his spectacular debut year in the NBA, his Championship years, and his current proffesional standing. Matt Christopher's easy-to-read style of writing makes this even better.</span>

                    <span>In this book you learn about Michael's life and his struggles and his sucsess. When he was young he always played basketball with his dad,James. As he got older he grew very close to his dad. His dad was his best friend. In 1992 his dad got murded and Michael was in shock. He quit basketball to be with his family. He joined baseball for awhile, but then he quit. He then went back to play basketball for his dad. I loved this book. It tells you to go for your dreams and never give up even if something bad happens in your life.</span>
