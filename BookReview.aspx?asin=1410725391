                    <span>Parents' Guide to Swimming is a much needed tool for parents of competitive swimmers. In it I found information on every topic an involved parent would need, especially a parent lacking a swimming background. Arata's perspective on the role of parents and coaches is especially helpful. He provides suggestions as to how parents can help their children succeed in competitive swimming while leaving the coaching to the coach. A very worthy read packed full of good information on topics ranging from nutrition to flexibility to how to find a suitable program for your swimmer. A must have!</span>

                    <span>This is a terrific book! How I wish I'd had it when my own swimming daughter was feeling "burned out". Dr. Arata has great ideas on how to motivate kids past that stage so they have a chance to fulfill their potential. A wonderful resource on training, diet--everything! Super A+!</span>

                    <span>As a past competitive swimmer and current USS swimming coach, I cannot express enough gratitude to Dr. Arata for the invaluable asset he offers to parents, swimmers and coaches alike. This book is the answer to the question parents often ask: "We don't know anything about swimming; is there anything to read?"<BR>THIS is it! The information in this book will provide the security, comfort and knowledge for any new parent whose child is entering swimming. Moreover, it enables them to understand, support and encourage their child in this wonderful lifelong sport. <BR>I am buying and distributing copies to my team.<BR>Thank you, Dr. Arata, for putting into the written word what ordinarily takes years to otherwise get across.</span>
