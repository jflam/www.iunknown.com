                    <span>For an experienced developer new to SQL Server, this was a great book. Clearly written, good examples, good coverage (see how many others explain JOINS as clearly, or describe functions like COALESCE). Got me up and running quickly with a new SQL project. This alone saved many times the cost of the book. Would like to see it updated from version 7 to 2000.</span>

                    <span>Amo's Transact-SQL can certainly be faulted for the amount of time that it spends trying to describe how to perform somewhat mundane tasks in Enterprise manager and other SQL 7 tools -- great if you have never used SQL Server before, but not particularly useful for programmer or DBA turned programmer trying to learn Transact-SQL.  The books redeeming strength, however, comes from the clarity with which the author is able to deal with more advanced concepts such as cursors.  His explanation makes the concept very accessible to a beginner.  The books excellent index allows it to serve well as a reference book.  All things considered, this is not the book to buy if a large portion of you work is with a database; but for a developer or DBA needing to write a little Transact-SQL and not wanting to spend three-weeks reading a book like Vieira's SQL Server Programming it could serve as a good intro book and/or quick reference.</span>

                    <span>This book is supposed to cover Transact-SQL, an advanced topic. But it uses a database which you must type in! Although it includes a CD-ROM, the database is not on it. If I want a typing exercise, I'd buy Mavis Beacon's. Most of the first portion of the book covers basic SQL tools. A complete waste of time in an advanced text. Also, much of the text and many of the illustrations are based on a beta version of SQL 7, so they don't even apply to the version you'll see (for example, see pg. 40, which tells how to create a Database Diagram, and is COMPLETELY WRONG). The writing style is also unclear and difficult to follow. The only benefit I got from the book is the author's name - I've used it to start a list of authors I'll avoid at all cost in the future.</span>

                    <span>If you need a book about T-SQL, go on to the next one.  T-SQL is the SQLServer backend workhorse language, but this book spends almost half the pages describing how to perform tasks using the SQLServer 7.0 GUI tools  instead of T-SQL.  I can't understand that in a book titled  "TRANSACT-SQL".  Beyond that, if you want any sort of detailed  understanding of the topics covered, you won't get it from this book.   I  would highly suggest the "Transact-SQL Programming" book from  O'Reiley Press.  That book gives you a complete discussion of T-SQL.</span>
