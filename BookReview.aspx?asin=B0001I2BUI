                <span id="Label1">Tony Kushner's prize-winning play <I>Angels in America</I> became the  defining theatrical event of the 1990s, an astonishing mix of philosophy,  politics, and vibrant gay soap opera that summed up the Reagan era for an  entire generation of theater-goers. Post-9/11 would  seem to be too late for a film version--philosophy and politics don't  always age well--but this 2003 HBO adaptation, ably directed by Mike Nichols  (<I>The Graduate</I>), provides a time capsule of the '80s and reveals the  deep emotional subcurrents that will give the play lasting power. <p>  The story centers around Prior Walter  (Justin Kirk) and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), a gay couple that falls  apart when Prior grows ill as a result of AIDS. But cancer is not the only  thing invading Prior's life: He begins to have religious visions of an  angel (Emma Thompson, <I>Sense and Sensibility</I>) announcing that he is  a prophet. Louis, who doesn't cope well with disease and suggestions of  mortality, leaves and starts a relationship with Joe Pitt (Patrick  Wilson), a closeted Mormon who works for Roy Cohn (Al Pacino, <I>Dog Day  Afternoon</I>)--the real-life right-wing lawyer, notorious for his  ruthless behind-the-scenes machinations. Add in Joe's depressed and  hallucinating wife Harper (Mary Louise Parker, <I>Fried Green  Tomatoes</I>), his determined but open-minded mother Hannah (Meryl Streep,  <I>Adaptation</I>), a fierce drag queen/nurse named Belize (Jeffrey  Wright, <I>Basquiat</I>, reprising his celebrated performance from the  Broadway production), and you've still only begun to discover the wealth  of characters and storylines in Kushner's ambitious work. <p>  The  powerhouse cast (also featuring James Cromwell, Michael Gambon, and Simon  Callow) is uniformly superb. The script has its weaknesses--some of the  fantastic elements, including Prior's journey to Heaven towards the end,  fall flat--but even what doesn't work is bristling with ideas and a  ferocious desire to capture human existence in this time and place.  <I>--Bret Fetzer</I></span>

                    <span>This is a phenomenal production of a gorgeous play that provokes so much in me it is very difficult to put it in words. I purchased the  DVD and invited 4 of my closest friends to watch the entire film with me in one sitting. We were entirely transfixed for six hours. At the end, we could do nothing more than sit in silence for 20 minutes. The film is filled with ideas and points-of-view. It requires the person watching to concentrate, to listen, to pay attention. It is entirely unlike anything we've seen on film in a long time because it demands something from the viewer. But the investment of time and concentration pays off with an overwhelming and profound feeling of being a little closer to understanding ourselves. In the end, the film forgives. You will never forget it. </span>

                    <span>Completely lacking any sense of restraint, reason, coherent story-telling, or respect for the viewer, this pretentious and self-righteous film lurches on and on, spinning more and more out of control in an admirably-envisioned but poorly executed film version of what certainly played better on a stage.
<br />
<br />Filled to overflowing with wonderful acting talent, the various A-list actors and actresses can barely keep a straight face while delivering their (dare I say "overblown" again?) over wrought lines that never seem to quite make sense or even matter.  I didn't relate to or empathize with the characters well enough to even generate much interest in their welfare.
<br />
<br />I was particularly distrubed by Emma Thompson's ridiculous acting, character, and her depiction of a defamatory and ridiculous angel.  I guess the makers of this lurching beast thought themselves too wise even to show respect (or at least refrain from showing disrespect for) angels.  
<br />
<br />Certainly this piece has some strong points:  music, acting (some of it) and a decent story, but the film as a whole is unmoving because of its ridiculous and overdone screenplay which is very hard to get past.  Recommended only for those easily led.

                    <span>I had high expectations for this film. Mostly, they were met on the first disc (Chapters 1-3). The second disc, however, turned the project into a collage of the boring, the pandering, the maudlin, and the insulting.
<br />
<br />Mary-Louise Parker, Meryl Streep, Jeffery Wright, and Justin Kirk as Prior Walter were all magnificent. I was truly blown away on Disc One. The developing and unraveling  storylines that bind these characters were believeable, intriguing, and heart-felt. Ben Shenkman also performed well, but was overshadowed by the despicably weak character of Louis. After the first three chapters, I was raving about "Angels in America".
<br />
<br />On sitting down with Disc Two, however, things started to fall apart. Chapter Four started things off fairly in tune with the previous three chapters, but Five ("Beyond Nelly") and Six ("Heaven, I'm In Heaven") pulled the carpet out from an otherwise outstanding project.
<br />
<br />I'm not one for too much a deviation from reality when it comes to entertainment. I can appreciate a good dream sequence (or twelve), I can handle a hallucination, a metaphor, even a vision here and there, but the final hour or so of "Angels In America" was more akin to Greek mythology or Homer's Odyssey than it was to it's own foundation. That's a betrayal I just can't get into.
<br />
<br />Overall just not worthy of the hype. The cutting room floor of this film must have been immaculately clean . . . </span>

                    <span>After the first 90 minutes, I was about to stop watching and save this six hour HBO miniseries for another rainy day. When Meryl Streep arrives in New York City from her Mormon homeland, to visit her son and question his strange behavior, the film improves considerably. She brings a much needed point of view to what has already been established as an ensemble of unlikeable characters threatened by the AIDS virus during the epidemic's early stages of development.  Not that Streep's character doesn't tow her own worldly baggage, but her ordinary yet not unquestioning life contrasts well with the troubled complications of the other characters. She's like a sigh of relief when all else is bated breath. Somewhere deeply involved in the second half, I had to ask myself if I'm enjoying the film because of the creativity involved or is this merely a good soap opera? And were the surreal scenes of a frustrated wife stepping into La-La Land, angels crashing through hospital ceilings, and the ghost of U.S. assasinated convicted spy Ethel Rosenberg walking around and offering advice, effective or merely indulgent? There's also a strange morality working here; a perceived as evil AIDS patient succumbs to the illness, while a good-hearted one survives; out and proud homosexuals are made heroic while a troubled one, guilted by his religious upbringing, is left out in the cold. An enthralling film with powerhouse characterizations, it finally doesn't all add up but it marches by proudly like lesser and greater parts of a passing parade. I couldn't help but be impressed with the overall spectacle. </span>
