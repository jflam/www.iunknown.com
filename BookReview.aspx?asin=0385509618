                    <span>The husband-and-wife time of Kevin and Jackie Freiberg offer up a book filled with leadership advice built around stories of successful companies ranging from SAS to Whole Foods, Southwest Airlines to Synovus.
<br />
<br />In general, I'm skeptical of business books which profile large companies written by people who have never run a large company. First, there's the "do as I say, not as I do (or have done)" credibility gap. And second, this genre tends to attribute too much of a company's overall success or failure to a single personality.
<br />
<br />Having said that, I think the Freibergs have done a decent job of wrapping their high-level advice (e.g., create a sense of ownership, lead with love, make business heroic) around stories and interviews that are engaging, well-written, and carefully selected to make their point.  And it's always intriguing to learn how a name-brand organization got its start. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, be prepared for some dramatic (over-?)simplification of complex realities.  The company case studies are less case studies and more one-dimensional illustrations the authors carefully package to make the point they want to make.  Sometimes it feels just a little glib, as in "let me tell you this cute story that just so happens to illustrate the general leadership principle I'm pushing in this chapter."
<br /> 
<br />My favorite chapter was about how gutsy leaders lead with love. As a person of faith, I find the idea of servant leadership (popularized by authors such as Robert Greenleaf and Peter Vail) powerful and resonant with my own religious beliefs.  I also enjoyed the chapter on how effective leaders tie their organization's mission to a heroic cause.  To illustrate this point, the authors tell the story of how one teacher's (Sandra McBrayer) heroic vision to teach homeless kids galvanized the San Diego community to build an entire school for disdvantaged kids called Monarch High School (complete with its own restaurant created with the help of Ralph Rubio, cofounder and CEO of Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill). 
<br />
<br />The book is visually attractive -- not quite as arresting as Tom Peter's new book called "Re-imagine!", but the layout, color, pull quotes, and photos call attention to the main points well.
<br />
<br />Overall, it's worth a quick read for some interesting stories and a few ideas to consider as you think about how to improve your own organization's culture.</span>

                    <span>Why bother to read a book when a review alone clearly indicates that the author didn't do their homework.  For example, according to other reviews, this book describes SAS as one of the most spectacular companies.  However, that is just the company's excellent PR at work.  Obviously there was nothing resembling investigative journalism.  To include SAS in this book when there is a wealth of unethical behavior, payoffs, etc. going on there is just lazy work by the authors and questions the entire book's credibility.</span>

                    <span>Sam Brannan, author of Look To The Rock<p>Kevin and Jackie have done it again!  Guts! is even better than Nuts!, which is hard to believe if you read their first remarkable book!  The difference between the Freiberg's approach to writing about business management and so many other writers' (ncluding myself), is their excellent ability to capture the pure essence of the most successful leaders of our times.  Their crisp, simple approach to business-as-not-so-usual is exactly what we in corporate America need to embrace.  Look forward to Freiberg's Book III!</span>

                    <span>Kevin and Jackie Freiberg have done it again. In "Nuts!" they told the story of the growth of a fledgling airline that has grown to lead the industry today. In their new book "Guts!" they have once again placed their fingers on the pulse of business success and share with us stories of triumph. <p>What is apparent after reading this book is that to create a successful business you must create a customer base that sings your companies praises loud and strong to anyone who will listen. But, to do that effectively you must first create a working environment that causes your employees to sing your companies praises louder and stronger! <p>This is exactly what the business leaders in "Guts!" have done. Kevin and Jackie not only tell the story of business leaders that have vision, they tell the stories of business leaders capable of turning their vision into action.<p>Being a visionary is not all there is to being a leader. Being a leader that can transfer that vision into action is what Champions are made of. "Guts!" gives us dynamic examples of Champions who care enough to give the whole 9 yards. <p>This book is a "Must Read" for anyone responsible for the well being of people.</span>
