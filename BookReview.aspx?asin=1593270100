                    <span>[A review of the 2nd EDITION.]
<br />
<br />Apple has always garnered curiosity, as one of the most creative high tech companies in the world. This book tries to assuage that interest, updated to 2004. It covers in detail many aspects of the company's tumultuous history.
<br />
<br />Some tidbits are mentioned that other books on Apple often omit. Like how along with Jobs and Wozniak, there was another co-founder, Wayne. But he sold his interest for around $2k, before Apple went public. Linzmayer estimates that had Wayne held his stock, it would have been worth $500 million in 2000. Ah, the what-ifs. He says that Wayne seemed genuinely unmiffed by this. But the reader must surely wonder otherwise. Like the story of the fifth Beatle. The divergent fates of Wayne, Jobs and Wozniak might be seen as a parable of Silicon Valley.
<br />
<br />The book describes events up to 2003-2004. Just in time to include a discussion of the smash hit that is the iPod, and of ancillary packages like iTunes. While perhaps these are too recent to be easily evaluated, Linzmayer doesn't shirk from offering a timely analysis.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book covers the entire history of Apple in amazing detail, as you would expect. There are chapters covering Wozniak and Jobs that are detailed and up to date. And there are timelines that make it easy to follow the progression of a number of aspects of Apple. This is particularly handy when following the hectic early nineties where Apple was releasing a different set of Macintoshes every couple of months.
<br />
<br />However, unlike Cult of Mac, this book is far more dry in style than the company it documents. The point size of the content is almost unreadably small. And the layout is interesting, but not inspired. In particular the timelines which are in almost every chapter are drab.
<br />
<br />Downsides aside, if you are a Mac enthusiast and you want to understand the history of the company there is no better source than this.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book. It is exceptionally well researched, well written and easy to read. While the concept of detailing the history of a corporation may seem mundane or boring, Linzmayer and Apple both make this a different story.
<br /> 
<br />Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs helped to spark the home computer revolution when they invented the Apple I computer in a garage in Los Altos, California. Their computers have created a fanatic, cult-like following and some appear more like contemporary art or sculptures than actual computers. 
<br />
<br />Linzmayer provides detailed timelines illustrating the evolution of Apple and thorough inside information about the inner-workings of Apple, the comings and goings of its executive leadership, the evolution and creation of Apple's innovative product lines and more.

                    <span>Half way through the book, I realized why and how I felt very intrigued by the writing style. It was written by the exact same type of person I am (or at least used to be before becoming a father :-). This book is written as if by a rock band fan who has thoroughly followed the history of the band, its different reincarnations (guitar player 1 replaced by guitar player 2 on album 3 and then back for a studio recording on album 7 and so on). What is unique about the book is that it follows not simple chronology but the different aspects of Apple, the company and the marketing and technological phenomenon. I have used a Mac only during an internship 9 or so years ago, so I am not a Mac zealot, however I've always been intrigued by Apple Computers and I can now honestly say that having read "Apple Confidential 2.0" I've had all my Apple cravings satisfied! I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of one of the most innovative computer companies!</span>
