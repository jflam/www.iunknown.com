                    <span>Usually, i really like the training books of MSPress for Windows Server 2003 - But this one is an exeption.
<br />
<br />The Problem with this book was, after i read a chapter, i knew exactly as much as before. This is not because i am a security-guru (really i'm not) , it is because of the bad writing style. Sometimes it isn't really clear what the writer wants to say with the lessons and if he takes the reader serious.
<br />
<br />Another Problem with this book, it is full of so called "considerations" and "guidelines" instead of a serious, stong security training (most of them are really useless because they are so obvious that you know those even without the book).
<br />
<br />I strongly recommend to do not use this Book for 70-298 Training, even if you are a fan of the MSPress series. It's not worth the money.</span>

                    <span>The MS Training Kit books seem to get a bad rap beacause they don't substitute hands-on experience with spoon fed answers for the exams. Most of them however are useful long after the exam is over and this one is no execption. This book takes a dry subject like security and makes it easy to sit through a study session with it's relavent and readable content. I will recommend this book to other :Security candidates in the future.</span>

                    <span>Unlike some of the other opinions that have been written regarding this book, I found it highly useful and would certainly recommend it to anyone who does not just want bare memorization material for an exam, but truly desires to learn about Micosoft security.  <p>I have three MCSE's, and I have just obtained my MCSE: Security on Server 2003; and, I will keep this book for continued professional reference.</span>

                    <span>Book itself did not help passing the Exam 70-298.  It is limited to just a theory.  Exam requires a practical knowledge, not a theory.  This book gives a concept of Security which is quite useless for the Exam and an actual configuration.</span>

                    <span>This book does an atrocious job of preparing you for the 70-298 exam.  There are entire topics missing and tons of wordy fluff that seem intended to merely fill pages and make this book heavy.  It's practicaly worthless as an exam prep tool.  Besides that, it's absolutely boring.  I guarantee you won't make it past the first two chapters without snoozing.  You're much better off merely browsing Microsoft TechNet for free.</span>
