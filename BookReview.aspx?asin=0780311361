                <span id="Label1">Careers/Higher Education Tomorrow's Professor Preparing For Academic Careers in Science and Engineering "This (book) should be a major hit. There is no competition, there is a crying need, the book is interesting, well written, and comprehensive." Michael Lightner, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, University of Colorado at Boulder "This book is a 'must read' for anyone considering or 'smack in the middle' of an academic career. In particular, the incorporation of advice from those in the field makes it unique and invaluable." Kim Needy, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh "Simply the best book on the market for scientists; comprehensive, analytical and broad in focus." Anne J. MacLachlan, Center for Studies in Higher Education, University of California, Berkeley Tomorrow's Professor is designed to help you prepare for, find, and succeed at academic careers in science and engineering. It looks at the full range of North American four-year academic institutions while featuring 30 vignettes and more than 50 individual stories that bring to life the principles and strategies outlined in the book. Tailored for today's graduate students, postdocs, and beginning professors, Tomorrow's Professor:<br>    * Presents a no-holds-barred look at the academic enterprise<br>    * Describes a powerful preparation strategy to make you competitive for academic positions while maintaining your options for worthwhile careers in government and industry<br>    * Explains how to get the offer you want and start-up package you need to help ensure success in your first critical years on the job<br>    * Provides essential insights from experienced faculty on how to develop a rewarding academic career and a quality of life that is both balanced and fulfilling<br>    At a time when anxiety about academic career opportunities for Ph.D.s in these field is at an all-time high, Tomorrow's Professor provides a much-needed practical approach to career development.</span>

                    <span>The book is designed as a guide for graduate students, post-docs, and non-tenured faculty looking for careers in academic science and engineering. <p>The book has four parts: the first gives an exposition of the world of academia, the second discusses preparation for academic careers for graduate students and post-docs, the third discusses strategies for looking for and applying to academic positions, and the fourth discusses life as junior faculty and the tenure application process. <p>While the book is well-written and well-organized, it does not provide any helpful information or insight. All information in the book should be well-known to any graduate student or post-doc who is even slightly serious about a career in academic science and engineering. <p>For example, every graduate student and post-doc should know full well that teaching experience and grant-writing skills are indispensable when applying for an academic position. Every non-tenured faculty should know what tenure is all about and what is necessary in order to achieve it. The book discusses these issues as if these are helpful pointers for success in academia. <p>The book provides advice on how to write teaching portfolios, how to handle campus tours, how to negotiate salaries, etc.  However, there are many excellent books and websites discussing these issues in greater detail. This book is thus superfluous and unnecessary.</span>

                    <span>I put this book on my wish list and received it as a gift, but ended up being sorely disappointed with it.  As I read through the book I started to become disillusioned when I realized how poorly written the whole thing was -- the chapters are all structured in the "here's what I'm going to tell you, here I'm telling you, here's what I just told you" way that is implimented so as to remind me of an 8th grade essay.  Why should I take any paper-writing advice from a guy that can't get me interested and excited about my own career?<p>If you're really interested in an interesting and valuble book for aspiring scientists read Peter J. Feibelman's _A_PhD_is_not_Enough_ instead.</span>
