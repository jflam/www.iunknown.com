<br />Breakast of Champions was a book that Kurt Vonnegut wrote for hlmself as a 50 year old birthday present. Having reached half a century of this life, he had decided that it was time to let all of his 'repeat' characters - characters that showed up in several different novels of his - finally go. It's also the story of Dwayne Hoover and how the chemicals in his brain made him believe he was the only living human on the planet, a test by God, and that everyone else was a robot, a machine. And it talks a lot about beavers and penis size. 
<br />
<br />If you have never read this novel before, I can honestly say this is something you have never seen the likes of. Vonnegut's novel comes replete with drawings, absurd non-sequirors, and a good dose of both laughter and heartbreak. His often simplified language reveals myraids of information - when it comes to less meaning more, Vonnegut is a true artist. He can fit more emotion (both good and bad) into one sentence than most modern novelists can manage in an entire chapter. 
<br />
<br />The story itself tells the tale of two men, destined to meet, and change each other's lives forever. Why? Because the author wanted them to. How do I know this? He himself appears in the penultimate scene in which they meet; he realizes they are both just staring at him, and then rememebers that's because they're waiting for him to give them something to do or say. The two men, Dwayne Hoover (the man with the bad chemicals in his brain that make him slowly go crazy) and Kilgore Trout (the most frequently used character in Vonnegut's previous ouevre) meet at The Festival of the Arts in Midland City, where the incredibly wealthy Dwayne Hoover lives and runs a car dealership. (There is also a Wayne Hoobler in the story, but that's not important right now.) Trout is the author of the book Now It Can Be Told! that, upon reading, makes Dwayne Hoover crazy. Trout's book takes the form of a letter from the Creator of the Universe addressed to the reader, assuring him that he/she is the only real human on the planet, and that everyone else is a machine designed to test him. Their are loving machines and hating machines and sports machines and war machines and lying machines, etc. The reader is the only one with true freedom and choice and feeling. To many readers of such a book, they would think it clever and perhaps even funny. For Dwayne Hoover it becomes the Gospel truth. 
<br />
<br />The book is about many other things as well, and to give too much away would be criminal. But I can tell you that, no matter how hard you try not to, you will laugh at some point at this book, and you will feel incredible sadness at others. And you won't know exactly how or why Vonnegut is able to achieve this. Therein lies his magic. Read it and see for yourself! Another quick Amazon pick I'd like to recommend is 'The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition' by Richard Perez -- another exceptional, unconventional and FUNNY book, truly wonderful.

                    <span>After reading Cat's Cradle, I was very excited to read another Vonnegut title.  After reading the many rave reviews of Breakfast of Champions I decided this would be an interesting choice.  I was very disappointed.  The only reason I even finished it was because it was an easy, short read plus I wanted to be able to write a review taking the whole book into consideration.  First, it is not funny.  I am befuddled as to how so many people found it funny. It just isn't.  Sure, there are a couple of somewhat funny comments but these are very few and far between.  Basically all he does is criticize our American society which I do not find offensive but he does it in such a direct, in-your-face style that it doesn't resonate with any humor.  It is like he just put down on paper some random thoughts and complaints about our society without putting any effort toward creating a cohesive theme.  The storyline itself is so fragmented and superficial and pock-marked with useless anecdotes and comments that after the first 50 pages I really lost all interest. 
<br />     Now for the pictures.  He decided to draw pictures of everyday things that we all are familiar with such as a cow and a hamburger.  Now at first these were a bit humerous but after the first dozen or so they were very tedious and useless.  I found myself thinking "Yes Kurt, I know what a cow looks like".  I understand that he is pretending to be writing this commentary on our society to someone who is not familiar with our world in order to highlight it's contradictions, ironies and hypocrosies which are often times right under our noses but the pictures just got to be too much.  I finally concluded he used them just for filler for his very thin story. 
<br />     There was also a lot of derogatory comments about African-Americans which obviously offended some readers but he also has other vulgar comments as well and these, I believe, were all included to do just that: be offensive and vulgar for no other real purpose because it sure didn't add anything to the story such as it is.
<br />     I have not given up on Vonnegut however.  I plan on reading a few more of his novels but if they are anything like this one then I'm through with him.  Cat's Cradle was so much more funny, smart, well-conceived and subtle yet strong in it's message that I can't believe the same person wrote both but hey, I guess you can't hit a homerun every time and with Breakfast of Champions he certainly strikes out as far as I am concerned.  Of note, the author himself states in the book that it is a bad book so there you have it.</span>

                    <span>Purely and simply the funniest book I have ever read, however be prepared for some pretty extreme racism. But don't worry there are plenty of little treats in this one for everybody. I promise you will "laugh out load" at least five times.  At least. It was the softer side to this story that I was not expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless and turned the book into a true masterpiece.  What caught my eye is when Vonnegut places himself into the story and talks about his suicidal mother, and his farewell to Kilgore Trout at the end which is surprisingly emotional, but wickedly fun.  Here is a sneak preview of a passage I want to share with you that grabbed me when I read it.(which is thrown in very unexpectedly I might add) 
<br />
<br /> "This is a very bad book you're writing," I said to myself behind my leaks.(glasses) "I know," I said.  "You're afraid you'll kill yourself the way your mother did," I said.  "I know," I said.  
<br />
<br />This is Vonnegut letting loose some pretty dark demons in his life at the time. He wrote this book as a gift to himself for his 50th birthday. And for all the great fiction he has written over the years that we have grown to love, that passage was his heart and soul, not fiction. I guess he needed to get that off his chest. 
<br />
<br />I'm glad he did.
<br />
<br />And so on.
<br />
<br />Anyway, this is without a doubt a great book on many different levels (if you can get by the racism) from beginning to end. I loved it.  Oh, I almost forgot, the pictures are great too.  
<br />
<br />Enjoy. </span>

                    <span>Breakfast of Champions reads as a fresh work, considering today's political climate.  It is a very anti-American novel and, depending how you voted in the last election, you will either love it or hate it.  The plot concerns a science fiction author, Kilgore Trout (a pun on real-life author Theodore Sturgeon), and a car dealer named Dwayne Hoover.  Hoover is going out of his mind and - after reading one of Trout's books - comes to believe that he is the only person in the world who isn't a robot.
<br />
<br />This is an experimental novel.  Vonnegut writes himself into the book and fills it with crude illustrations.  It is funny, biased, and thought-provoking look on American society.  It doesn't have a traditional "beginning, middle, and end."  Vonnegut expressly states that he disdains traditional fiction writing because it makes people believe that they should act like characters in books.  It is difficult to imagine agreeing with Breakfast of Champions one-hundred-percent, but it will give you plenty to think about.

                    <span>This is the third Vonnegut I have read and I still can't figure out if I like the guy or not.  
<br />
<br />It is a story(or is it?) about two insane lunatics who eventually cross paths.  One of these men is a science fiction writer named Kilgore Trout who can only get his work published as filler for pornography magazines.  The other is a wealthy widower who goes on a rampage because of Trout at the end of the story.  I'm not giving anything away by telling you this because Vonnegut tells you himself at the begining of the book.
<br />
<br />The book is quick and simple to read, vulgar and laugh-out-loud funny.  It features crude drawings by Vonnegut and introduces many of its male characters by revealing the length and width of their penises.  It certainly is entertaining in a Farlly brothers kind of way but is it literature as many regard it?  I guess it could be a judgement on our culture but I certainly don't think he deserves the same respect as Thomas Hardy or Mark Twain.  His books really don't stay with me like Hardy's or Twain's do.  The only time I really recall them is when I see them sitting on my book shelf and think, </span>
