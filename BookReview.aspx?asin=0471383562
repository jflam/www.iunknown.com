                    <span>I have several yrs of programming experience and somehow I felt that I have lost the touch I once used to have and was feeling shaky. Got this book, so far its amazing. Ok I have not completed this book yet but so far whatever questions I have seen I was asked  in some interviews and thats amazing. The only issue with the examples (thats y 4 stars) is examples are in C, cud have been in C++. But still its not a big deal and looks like it is done for more audience coverage. In an interview if u can find 50% of the questions from this book then u r almost done and sure to land the job.</span>

                    <span>Programming Interviews Exposed gives a good refresher on data structure problems (and similar programming interview questions) in C with a concise discussion on the choices and trade-offs made in reaching the solution.  
<br />
<br />Programming Interviews Exposed was true to the book's description.  It emphasizes programming problems that are typically asked in interviews (and to a lesser extent touches on logic puzzles and knowledge-based questions).  My friends/colleagues and I have actually been asked several of these exact questions.  If you want a book emphasizing logic puzzles this is not the book for you.  
<br />
<br />Programming Interviews Exposed doesn't quite give you "Everything you need to know to succeed in the programming interview", but it emphatically does give a very solid, general base you must demonstrate in order to give the other portions of your interview credibility.  
<br />
<br />The book emphasizes solutions in C, giving a couple solutions in Perl, and Java.  The C language is appropriate as C++ and Java have syntax very similar to C and in the programming interview questions you are typically prohibited from using built-in and/or standard library features that would make the questions trivial.  The point of the questions, after all, are to see how well you understand and can puzzle out the details involved in implementing data structures and similar.  </span>

                    <span>This book is indeed helpful when I prepare for my interviews.  In fact, I found some hiring managers use this book to test the interviewers. :) I highly recommend this book to people who are interviewing with software programming jobs.</span>

                    <span>Basically, most people in industries will not give question like that particularly those need you to provide solutions.  If a interviewer were to give those kind of questions to you, it means you meet a HR person or the person who just graduated from school.  Your will be managers might not know all terms throughly, but they know what kind of people they need.<p>If you are looking for a programming job, please do some research to find what technology might be useful to them.</span>

                    <span>I got exact questions asked from this book in an interview !!Could not believe myself but aced them nonetheless. Looks like interviewers pick questions from this book as well. It is a good warm up practice book to make you more confident and cover basics. It has some good problems which you should practice. You will be asked similar coding questions to be solved on the board in an interview...</span>
