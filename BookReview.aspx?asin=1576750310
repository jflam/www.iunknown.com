                    <span>Joseph Jaworski was a practicing litigator when he learned about the concept of the "servant leader." Inspired, he left his legal practice and created the American Leadership Forum (ALF), which trains corporate leaders in using the servant-leader model. Synchronicty, which recounts Jaworski's journey, aspires to novelistic drama, and in fact, Jaworski describes the tale in terms of the traditional literary hero's quest. While not exactly the labors of Hercules, anecdotes in which Jaworski talks his way out of a mugging and meets his wife by passing her in an airport are entertaining, but less informative than the author might hope. The book contains a lot of New-Age jargon and collective-consciousness sermonizing. Nevertheless, for managers who want to be something more - leaders - we [...] recommend Synchronicity not as a useful how-to, but rather as a business leader's inspirational biography.<br></span>

                    <span>Many books on leadership are written for managers or those
unique individuals who will save the world. This book, 
"Synchronicity," sheds some light on that community. More 
 important to me, it shed a light into some of the far, dusty
 corners of my personal life. 
 <P>
 I'm newly 48 years old with 
 many different jobs in the past and new challenges staring
 me in my face. Mr. Jaworski's scenarios and suggestions did
 a good job with two areas: (1) it rattled me into reviewing
 the path that I have been working on and (2) it bolstered me
 up in realizing that following "gut feelings" is not just 
 magic, it's hard work. So? Well, it's my path, my life but
 now I have a different way to look positively at the past. 
 At the same time Mr. Jaworski has given me new ways of 
 looking ahead, sharpened my survival senses. 
 <P>
 Thanks to "Synchronicity," I may not change the world you 
 know but, I am changing the world immediately around me...
 for the better.

                    <span>My colleagues and I have been designing and facilitating leadership development programs for about 20 years. I've also served as a VP of three Fortune 500 companies. I recommend this book to everyone who is a leader or who wants to be one. Not only does it contain THE secret to true leadership, Mr. Jaworski has written his account so that it reads like a good mystery novel. You wonder what will happen next. And he has written this book from his heart. I hope our paths cross one day soon.</span>

                    <span>I read the book on the recommendation of a coworker. For me, it opened up my eyes to finding my type of leadership-in my case servant-leadership. His journey of personal reinvention is a joy to read especially as he learns what is truly important in life.</span>
