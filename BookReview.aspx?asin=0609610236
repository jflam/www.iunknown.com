                    <span>Unlike James McPherson's major studies on the Civil War,HALLOWED GROUND(similar to General Joshua Chamberlain's "Through BLOOD & FIRE at Gettysburg")is a very personal,meditative reflection on the epic battle as the event where the United States...in its supreme moment of crisis...survived to remain "this nation under God(in)a new birth of freedom". 
<br />Only a year earlier Professor McPherson had seemingly named the bloody day(September 17,1862)at Antietam as PIVOTAL battle of the Civil War (because it thwarted Southern momentum and allowed President Lincoln the "graced moment" to issue the Emancipation Proclamation).In this brief study...scarcely more than a pamphlet...the battle field;key plays and players;and events of THE THREE DAYS are commented upon. Much commentary is incisive but not a little approaches(trivially)anecdotal. And never has James McPherson's "Northern bias"(which I concur with)been more pronounced nor clearly manifested. In particular,his discussion of Confederate-pride-of place in the advance(of the utterly repulsed and disastrous)Pickett's charge...which he notes is now referred to as the PICKETT-PETTIGREW assault in deferrence to PM mythology/Political Correctness)often descends to the level of scorn(pp. 122-124). 
<br />
<br />Yet overall tone--and purpose--of the essay is reverence. GETTSYBURG is sacred...it's hallowed ground. A nation that has allowed its "public" culture to devolve into Yuppie materialism;  will not defend the"sacred";that kills its children(46,000,000 abortions since Roe v. Wade:the POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR!)or allows their minds to be polluted by cin/electronic dreck almost from birth;has forgotten why 56,000 Americans died or suffered wounds of combat trauma so that government of;for;and by The People might not"perish from the earth." McPherson's "Hallowed Ground" is essentially a SERMON. Some of it is subtle;some blunt.His truly epic,FOR CAUSE and COMRADES(1997:Oxford University Press)characterizes(in letters written by Union and Confederate civilian-soldiers)men willing to die for freedom of their country UNDER GOD as they so conceived this nation and its Judaeo-Christian Godhead.The PM intellectual dilettantes;Deconstructionist Pols;secularists;and Surfer Girl atheists need to READ some history of this terrible war of(in Lincoln's own assessment)TRIBULATION.HALLOWED GROUND is worthy place to begin...remembering Hallowed means BLESSED...and only God Almighty can confer blessing(with the salvation it awards); or "poena damni",the pain of ultimate loss and oblivion. Take and Read...

                    <span>What a beautiful little book about a very sacred place.  It covers all the major elements of the battle, and goes through some interesting anecdotes on the battle and the area.  Like the story of Generals Barlow and Gordon, Sallie the dog, John Burns, the oldest combatant at Gettysburg, Amos Humiston, etc..  
<br />I like the pages on General Longstreet and his new monument erected in 1998.  This is one of the high points of the book.  
<br />Of course, there are also many pages on Colonel Chamberlain and 20th Maine.  But, then, other important regiments are covered like the 1st Minnesota (that lost 82% of the their ranks in a doomed charge to save the day) or the 140 New York, and Paddy O'Rorke, who came to save the day on the other side of Little Round Top from the 20th Maine. Paddy O'Rorke was killed in this action.
<br />Then there is the beautiful scene of the Irish Brigade and the Father Colby who gave them absolution before the battle.  The Irish Brigade played a key role in stopping the Confederates in the Wheatfield.
<br />These stories are very readable tied to a trip around the battlefield and connected to markers.
<br />This is the best tour guide book that I've ever read on what is the most sacred ground on our soil.
<br />I highly recommend it. </span>

                    <span>If you are planning a trip to Gettysburg (by far the best Civil War Park), you should pick this book up first.  Read the book before you leave, then bring it along and follow the directions to make the most of your visit.  McPherson is one of the best Civil War historians and has spent quite a bit of time studying the battle and visiting the park.  The book walks you through the park, pointing out what was happening at each point along the way.  I wish I had had the book with me when I toured the park.</span>

                    <span>Once again, a so-called "Great Historian" has ripped us off with another book with Gettysburg in the title.  McPherson writes in his introduction that if he was dropped from a plane in the night on the battlefield he would know where he was in a minute.  After reading the book, it is doubtful that McPherson even knows that Gettysburg was fought in Pennsylvania!!!  His inaccuracies are appalling.  What about "Sally, the War Dog", Professor McPherson???  Try doing a little more research before you but something in print.  This book is a disgrace to Civil War Scholarship.  It is about time that the public realized that these "so-called" experts are doing nothing but ripping us off.  With a name and Gettysburg in the title - and also being published for the anniversary - all these guys are doing putting money in their pockets.  If anybody cared to check, they would find this book filled with inaccuracies, mis-statements and downright ignorance.  Again, a disgrace to Civil War Literature.</span>

                    <span>In the abstract, the notion of a book replacing an actual tour of the Gettysburg battlefield would seem a little far fetched...until one considers that this assignment is performed by the estimable Civil War author James McPherson. Under his pen, we get an amazingly new and unique perspective on this seminal battle that all Civil War readers should treasure as I certainly did.
<br />
<br />Taking a walking tour of the battlefield and having the many anecdotes and stories that McPherson has developed over time and developing it into a small book (about 175 pages), the reader is treated to an intimate session with the master Civil War historian and undoubtedly learns many new and unique things previously lost to time and history. A study devoted to the battlefield as opposed to the battle, McPherson lets us in on things that never made the campaign studies of Coddington, Trudeau, Phanz or Sears...like the fact that many acres of the battlefield are being judiciously reformed back into the state it took in 1863...from clearing land that has since grown over, to re-growing woodland that has been cleared since the battle, or even, amazingly, culling wooded areas to make them resemble the partially wooded areas in 1863, thus giving the touring historian a feal for what that particular area was like back then. An explanation of the many monuments that dot the fields and the many stories associated with their placement will surely entice Civil War buffs with many new stories that add to the Gettysburg legend. All this is interspersed with a summary level discussion of the battle and the main players...all told in McPherson's unique way that combines both the military and the political climates of the times.
<br />
<br />A marvelous gem of a book and one that features many new views associated with a battle and time in history that has been covered in many different ways, James McPherson has performed a marvelous service, again, to history and to the general reader. If you're like me, this work will be a vital part of my Gettysburg visit and, frankly, should be a focal point that the National Park Service stresses as a literary companion. A great book!! </span>
