                    <span>There'd be alot less hell for animals out there. Until now, I'd read other horror stories about the treatment of livestock from the workers, and was disgusted thinking there are actually people out there with attitudes like that, but this book opened my eyes to how the workers are being mistreated and, unfortunately, take out their frustration on the farm animals. Another testament to how people use and abuse animals and there's hardly anyone noticing, Gail Eisnitz's "Slaughterhouse" is disturbing, but also educating and stimulating to make a move and take action to change laws and regulations in the U.S. meat industry. This book is an absolute MUST READ to anyone who eats meat or cares about animals or their own well-being from the meat they consume. A striking look into human greed, concience and ignorance towards anything other than us, I recommend "Slaughterhouse" to all.</span>

                    <span>Superb! Eisnitz is a great investigative reporter. Her book is both meticulously researched and a gripping read. She presents a damning indictment of the US meat industry. The industry's practices include truly shocking treatment of the animals, abuse of workers, and disregard for basic hygiene. (Fecal matter, pus, and insect larvae routinely contaminate the meat, thanks to the industry's obsession with cost-cutting. Hence the recent outbreaks of meat-related food poisoning.) She also explains why the USDA, which is supposed to enforce the Humane Slaughter Act AND protect us from contaminated meat, has done so poorly over the last two decades.</span>

                    <span>Gail A. Eisnitz is one of the bravest, brighest lights on this planet. I recently had the privilige of meeting and interviewing her and was immensely impressed and inspired by her unflinching dedication to tell the truth about what's taking place in America's slaughterhouses. For an update on Gail's work, please visit www.hfa.org, the website of the Humane Farming Organization. <P>I am a yoga teacher and I wish that all yoga teachers and their students would read this book. The great yoga masters through the ages urge us to consider all aspects of our lives and to revere all living things. Yoga addresses the ethical life through a whole range of practices that encourage us to live in harmony with nature, which includes how we treat animals. <P>The practice of yoga is rooted in the principle of "ahimsa" (non-violence). The great yoga masters teach that "The yogi believes that every creature has as much right to live as he has. He believes he is born to help others and he looks upon creation with the eyes of love." The yogi knows that his life is linked inextricably with other living things. A complete, holistic yoga practice encompasses a way of life that addresses the harm we inflict on animals. <P>If you love animals and want to do your share to ease their suffering, please read SLAUGHTERHOUSE and purchase extra copies for your friends. To me, Gail A. Eisnitz is a modern day heroine who embodies the qualities of a compassionate yogini. I applaud and support her work with all my heart and soul and cannot recommend her book too highly.<P>Suza Francina R.Y.T., author, The New Yoga for People Over 50 and Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause. <BR>Former mayor, Ojai, California.</span>

                    <span>In 1989, Gail Eisnitz recieved a letter from Timothy Walker, a well known whistleblower. His letter stated that he has first hand knowledge that a slaughterhouse (Kaplan Industries) was skinning live cattle. At first, she didn't know what to believe so she called the USDA. A USDA inspector called her back with the findings: no cattle were being skinned alive at Kaplan.<BR>She decides to contact Walker by phone. When asked how he knew that Kaplan was skinning live cows, he stated that he was a USDA employee. He begins to tell Eisnitz a few more details.<BR>In the US alone, over one hundred and one million pigs are slaughtered each year. Thirty seven million cattle and calves, more than four million horses, goats and sheep and over eight BILLION chickens and turkeys are killed.<P>Millions of chickens leaking yellow pus, stained green feces, contaminated by harmful bacteria and tumors are shipped for sale to customers.<P>At a Perdue plant, there is so much fecal contamination on the floor from chickens that it leaked into a workers boots and burned his feet so badly that his toenails had to be amputated. The company won't even allow workers to leave the line to go to the bathroom so they relieve themselves on the floor. Sometimes the chickens that are hung, fall to the floor that is covered with roaches, feces and blood. The chickens that fall aren't even washed off before being hung back up on the line. One worked said that he "saw flies on the chicken as it went down the line and maggots in boxes which contained bags that the chickens would be wrapped in." Occasionally, maggots were ground up with everything else and remained in the final product.<P>This is disturbing, and it should be. I hope that those who read this book will do something. Write to your senator or member of parliament, stop eating meat or even distribute this book among friends. Just do something. These are animals. They feel pain just like you do. Would you allow this to happen to a dog or cat? They why allow it to happen to farm animals. <BR>This is a book that everyone needs to read. A lot of people believe or like to believe that their dinner arrived on their plate humanely. People need to know about wrongdoings like this. It's inhumane and it's wrong, plain and simple.</span>

                    <span>Ms.Eisnitz has convinved me that the principals that drive successful businesses are at work in our food supply to nefarious ends. While driving down costs and improving productivity may be laudable in the production of wigets, in the killing and "cleaning" of our meats, these ends are set to produce an epidemic of deadly pathogens and diseased foods. The recent mad cow scare has hopefully produced the publicity this book and others of its ilk have long sought. The USDA has proven to be impotent and having cattlemen assoc. leaders overseeing production is insanity.A very insightful read.</span>
