                    <span>At last! At last! I have waited 20 years to own this movie! I saw it the last time it was on TV (and on crackly home recording since). The unofficial sequel to Born Free, Slowly is the story of Bill Travers' and Virginia McKenna's return to Kenya after falling in love with the country when filming Joy Adamson's story about Elsa the lion cub. Whilst house-sitting for a friend, they find themselves the neighbours of three unruly elephants who, according to the local gamekeeper, have "adopted" them. It is very funny, very silly, the scenery/wildlife is breath-taking and the music is amazing. Watch out for the stars feeding the baby black rhinos lollipops - gorgeous! I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humour and a heart.</span>

                    <span>My 2 year old daughter loves this movie! It is great for teaching her the names of all the animals and talking about the wonderful scenery. Nothing bad happens and there is no profanity, etc. I highly recommend this movie as something to watch *with* your child to talk to them and experience it with them. It is really too simple for an adult to watch, but fabulous to train your child learning about the world.</span>

                    <span>Married couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna ("Born Free," "Ring of Bright Water") return in the first sequel to "Born Free." In the first movie, "Born Free," Travers and McKenna played the role of the Adamson's, the real life African animal preservations who raised lions in captivity and re-released them into the wild. In "An Elephant Named Slowly" and "The Lion at World's End (aka "Christian the Lion")" they play themselves returning to Africa and Adamason's compound. This would be followed by "Living Free," and "To Walk with Lions (2000)." "An Elephant Named Slowly" plays it mostly for laughs with Bill and Ginny coping with a beat up jeep that only starts when a special password is spoken into it's motor, being held at bay by a family of frisky elephants, and a gag about beans, beans, and more beans. Inspired more by Dean Jones comedies than anything else, this film will delight children and fans of the series. A jazzy score and cartoon title sequence add to the fun.</span>
