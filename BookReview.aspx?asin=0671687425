                <span id="Label1">The first book of a formidable two-volume social history, <i>Parting the Waters</i> is more than just a biography of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during the decade preceding his emergence as a national figure. Branch's 880-page effort, which won the 1988 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction, profiles the key players and events that helped shape the American social landscape following World War II but before the civil-rights movement of the 1960s reached its climax. The author then goes a step further, endeavoring to explain how the struggles evolved as they did by probing the influences of the main actors while discussing the manner in which events conspired to create fertile ground for change. </span>

                    <span>What a great book!  Taylor Branch has done an outstanding job with the history of the early years of the Civil Rights Movement in America.  He does a great job with a mini biography of Dr. King that digs into his education and thinking which really illuminates the subject.  The background on all of the other main players in this important chapter in our nation's history are equally well done.  A fine book that was difficult to put down.</span>

                    <span>This is an epic. <p>It discusses the early years of the Civil Rights Movement from the perspective of Martin Luther King Jr. and those around him. The cast of characters ranges from the cantankerous Vernon Johns - a hobo preacher with a doctorate - to the truly bizarre and paranoid J. Edgar Hoover, seeking to destroy king and those around him based on what can only be described as bogus and hyped intelligence of communist infiltration, to the young idealistic members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Comittee, to a President and Attourney General (JFK and RFK) who don't know what to think and really just wish the whole problem would just go away. <p>It is a long haul (921 pages) and very emotionally draining so be prepared but it is worth every page and very much due the Pulitzer prize that it earned.</span>

                    <span>The first few years of the civil rights movement and the years leading up to them are covered in this volume of Taylor Branch's trilogy. After reading this, one really gets a sense of why this movement was truely epic in scope and importance. The narrative does a great job of describing a mass movement with all of it's advances, setbacks, complexities, and contradictions. One gets a vivid impression of the pace of these events and the real change of consciousness that occured among an entire people. Don't be intimidated by the size of this book, it's exciting to read.</span>

                    <span>Taylor Branch has written a magnificent history of the early civil rights movement, using the life and career of Martin Luther King, Jr. as a framework.  Although there is a great deal of information about King's life both public and private, other key players in this great drama also receive extensive treatment.  Some, such as John & Robert Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover, are well-known.  Others have received far less recognition: Vernon Johns, the powerful itinerant country preacher who was a kind of grandfather to the movement; Bayard Rustin, whose unconventional lifestyle clashed with political reality in a way that caused much pain to King; Stanley Levison, one of King's closest confidante's and advisors, from whom King was pressured to distance himself because of alleged communist ties; Bob Moses, a tireless, courageous worker who toiled for years in the Deep South to register Negroes for the vote.<p>Branch also narrates events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Freedom Rides with the you-are-there immediacy of an eyewitness reporter and the eye for detail of a novelist.  This book is a very satisfying and informative read.</span>
