                    <span>The Glenstal Abbey in County Limerick, Ireland, is a wonderful place to behold.  They are a Benedictine monastery, operating a school, a ministry of hospitality, and providing an expression of Benedictine spirituality in the modern world.  The pattern of their liturgical and prayer life is a modified form of the ancient Benedictine structure; this book reflects what that is.
<br />
<br />The first section of the book is on daily prayer, prayer cycles that adhere to the spirit of Benedict's instructions.  The section is divided into prayers for each day of the week, prayers for the 'stops' (mid-morning, noon, afternoon, and compline), and prayers for the seasons (Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter, and Ordinary time).  These give the full text of prayers, canticles, Bible readings, psalms, invocations and blessings for use at each event.  
<br />
<br />The second section highlights common prayers and recitations in the Christian tradition.  These include the Lord's Prayer, the Hail Mary prayer, the Apostle's Creed, St. Patrick's Breastplate, the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, and more.  Among these one gets both the Celtic and the more universal Christian sense of things.  
<br />
<br />The third section looks at ritual prayers and liturgical pieces.  These include devotional prayers during activities (prayers before beginning work, prayers before and after meals), as well as prayers of vocation, guidance, and peace.  This includes a section on blessings, blessings that can be given to homes, to families, to the sick, to the dead, and more.  
<br />
<br />The final section includes additional psalms and a short selection of readings from the actual Rule of St. Benedict.  
<br />
<br />The book itself is in a small format, about as wide as an average hand, which means it fits into the palm perfectly, as if it were made for being carried and used on a regular basis.  The printing and paper stocks used are superb - as much as I am generally loathe to describe books in such terms, the basic construction of this book is worthy of note, as it adds 'flesh' to the prayers being given out of this text.  It is a joy to read from the sensory perspective as well as the spiritual perspective.  
<br />
<br />The Glenstal Abbey taps into an ancient history, but is itself a relatively new establishment, having been founded in 1927 as the first Benedictine monastery in Ireland since the Reformation (King Henry VIII dissolved monasteries as part of his Reformations in the British Isles).  This book is a great reflection of part of their community.

                    <span>My husband is from Ireland and his best friend gave me this wonderful book.  We have a large family and the time for a decent prayer life can be limited.  It is an easy and beautiful way to bring prayer structure and guidance into a busy person's life.  It is a well worn book in my home.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a good prayer book that my wife and I could use to integrate the Liturgy of the Hours into our lives.  This prayer book has proved to be perfect for us.  The book itself is made of high quality materials throughout including the binding and the paper on which the pages are printed.  One of the features we really like is the calendar of saints in the back.  The calendar identifies at least one saint for each day of the year.  The daily roster of saints emphasizes for us our connection and fellowship with the long line of believers who have preceded us in the faith down through the centuries.</span>

                    <span>"The Glenstal Book of Prayer" represents the worship of the Benedictine Rule Glenstal Abbey in County Limerick, Ireland.  Prayers are provided for morning, noon, evening, and night throughout the week, along with Psalm selections.  The book is concluded with a nice selection of favorite prayers, printed in both English and Gaelic.  A detailed Calendar of the Saints is also included.<p>What cost the book the coveted "5th Star" has to do with the sad fact that modern Benedictinism -- including Glenstal -- is such a far cry from how such an Abbey would have operated even 50 years ago.  Gone are the Matins nocturns.  Gone are the inspirational homilies from the saints, etc.<p>This being said, "The Glenstal Book of Prayer" is a worthy edition to any liturgical or devotional library, and I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for some ideas on how to present the Liturgy of the Hours to high school teens in our parish Confirmation Program. It is fantastic! I has a simple format that appeals to teens. I like the feature that gives you the option to insert seasonal prayers into the morning and evening prayer format. We will be offering a class for teens that will simply be the morning and evening prayers each day for one week straight, exactly as it is laid out in the book.</span>
