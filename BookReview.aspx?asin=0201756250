                <span id="Label1">As with each entry in the Classroom in a Book series, this one is used as part of Adobe's official training and certification program. <I>Adobe PageMaker 7.0 Classroom in a Book (With CD-ROM)</I> offers practical, step-by-step, timed lessons covering all of Pagemaker's features and tools and ensures that readers master the application. In addition, it provides clear explanations on how and why things work the way they do and supplies elegantly professional artwork on which to practice.<p>  Each lesson is well organized, from the opening rundown of what will be covered to the final chapter review, complete with quiz questions (and answers). Projects are the sort of practical challenges that most desktop publishers face today: flyer, letterhead, project proposal, CD jewel-case booklet, brochure, print and Web-based newsletters, color catalog, and more. You learn how to work with master pages, styles, and inline graphics and how to format a sidebar and use the story editor.<p>  Each project also addresses real-world practicalities like spot colors, trapping, registration, bleeds, and other prepress issues. Understanding how each of these affects your print piece will be invaluable when it's time to talk with your printer. In addition, readers learn how to format and generate an index and a table of contents and how to use the version 7.0-enhanced Export PDF command.<p>  One of the more compact books in this series, <I>Adobe PageMaker 7.0 Classroom in a Book</I> won't leave readers buried under excessively detailed projects. There's no wasted space and the trim, to-the-point text makes it enjoyable to work through the exercises while learning the software. Whether you use Pagemaker casually or as a daily part of your workload, you'll definitely want to pick this one up. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>Adobe Illustrator 7, Classroom in a book is a well organized, comprehensive guide to the program. It's great if you are new to the program. However, it doesn't tell you much more than the tutorial that came free with earlier iterations of the program.

                    <span>If you're the sort who likes to buy software and then use it without consulting the manual you probably own a Mac. That's fine, because that is precisely what the folks at Apple wanted to produce, a computer that needs no manual!<P>Still, the software that goes on that Mac or on that manual-required-before-you-start Windows=driven PC can get downright ornery. And the accompanying manual is as confusing as some passages in the Bible!<P>If you're one of the rest of us and have bought an Adobe product, I advise you to get the Classroom In A Book tutorial. The book and accompanying cd are terrific for any new pagemaker user.<P>If you work for on on a newspaper, newsletter or magazine you also should get Publication Production Using Pagemaker. The two go great together.</span>

                    <span>I downloaded the e-book version of this title recently, and was very impressed with how easy it was to get started. However, I had to visit the publisher's website to download the Classroom files (you need them in order to do the exercises), and was only able to get the first three lessons. Very frustrating! I emailed and called the publisher to see if the files could be emailed to me (you can submit a form to receive the files on CD, but who knows how long that would take). To date, I have not received a response. Again, I like the book. It is very thorough, it is easy to read and follow, and after completing just the first 3 lessons, I already feel more confident using the program. But be prepared for a headache if you order the e-book!</span>

                    <span>I really like this book. I think that the best way to start to learn a complex piece of software, like Pagemaker, is too get your feet wet using 'real world' exercises. And that is exactly what this book offers you. <BR>It may be true that you do not always know exactly what you are doing when you step through the nice lessons in the book, because not every step is explained in detail, but that is not so important. When you have finished all the lessons, you know very well what Pagemaker has to offer, and you are ready to make your own brochures, letters, booklets, during which you will learn all the details of every Pagemaker feature using the help or a reference book. This book is not (and not meant to be) a reference book, use the Complete Reference or the Visual Quick Start guide instead, but it gets you started in a very good and pleasant way. <BR>It may also be true that some fonts may not be present on the CD-Rom, but everyone who has used a computer once in a while must be able to locate them elsewhere (in Pagemaker's directory for instance!!!). <BR>Last, but absolutely not least, this book shows you some very nice examples of well designed DTP publications, they will inspire you!<BR>If you want to learn Pagemaker, do not hesitate, buy this book, it does what it promises.</span>
