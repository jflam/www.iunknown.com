                    <span>This book is a waste of time and money.  I was turned off because the author actually advises you to lie and misrepresent yourself in many situations.  While reading the book I spent a lot of time trying to figure out if the advice was a joke, like during the section, "Practice you mingle on a nerd."  The advice is clumsy and probably won't help.  If someone comes up to you at a party and says, "how's life treating you?" they probably read this book.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book in hopes of picking up a few simple tips on how to mingle among a new crowd.  As I read through the first chapter I was, to say the least, very disappointed with the first advice... "picture everybody naked."  How many times have we heard that one?  And, why am I paying money to hear it again?  <br>A little discouraged, I continuted to read on.  Throughout the whole book it seems that all the author is teaching us is how to lie for the sake of conversation.  I would hate to see what our society would become if we all side-stepped reality and only discussed 'safe' topics.  <br>To those of you that want some good advice on how to mingle, don't buy this book.</span>

                    <span>My thoughts after reading through this book was "It has to be a joke". At first it seems as though the author is only trying to use humor to break the ice and get the "minglephobic" out of their old ways of thinking.  Unfortunately, as the chapters progress it becomes readily apparent that the author is not merely joking, and that the silly hints and lines suggested are the author's actual advice!  <p>For example, the ADVANCED mingling techniques in the book suggest physically bumping into people, purposely mistaking them for someone else, using foreign accents, and wearing conversation pieces (such as a feather hat). The author also instructs one for offensive escape maneuvers to preform the following: spill something on that person; step on the person's foot, or otherwise hurt him.  Unless these techniques sound realistic to you (and are really possible in your world of mingling), you would be better served looking elsewhere for a more serious effort on the topic. <p>In a perhaps strange twist, the text blatantly provokes the reader to lie in most situations.  If I may quote directly from the book: "Being willing and able to tell a fib is the cornerstone of the art of mingling, the basis from which all techniques in this book are taught." Finally, the book is badly dated, with a whole chapter dedicated solely to mingling in the nineties.  <p>Sadly, the author's joke here is entirely on the reader.</span>

                    <span>This book makes the art of mingling simple & fun! It really breaks down mingling into simple, easy, & proven techniques. I highly recommend this book along with 2 others: Fate & Reil's How to Have Sex with Hot Girls (without even dating them!) & Louis & Copeland's How to Succeed with Women.</span>

                    <span>This book is just marginally helpful. Part of the reason for this is that the book is 10 yrs old. (something I was unaware of when purchasing it). It either needs to be brought up to date or taken out of print.</span>
