                    <span>I love protocol analysis. It's slightly arcane, just difficult enough to be interesting and incredibly useful for troubleshooting, planning, security and just plain learning more about networks. The great barrier has been cost - few shops have the inclination, much less the financing to afford this most essential of network professional tools. Enter open source software and Ethereal - a serious, cross platform protocol analyzer with enough features to get the job done. Of course, the trouble is knowledge - how do you use the darn thing? High-priced protocol analyzers have extensive support from the vendor and series of classes to learn both analysis in general as well as the specifics of that product. As an open source product, Ethereal presupposed at least some knowledge of protocol analysis to use effectively. This book, written with the Ethereal development team is worth solid gold to any network pro.
<br />
<br />Let me start out by saying that any protocol analyzer manual will have slow spots, even for geeks that love looking up obscure flags in hex. For the sadly normals out there, please, please, please feel free to skip around chapters 1-4 where important concepts are introduced. While the writing is quite good the material in places is dry by nature. Don't waste your attention span on things like the complete list of protocols supported on page 45. Skip over those parts, flag them for reference when needed, and concentrate on the more immediately useful parts that are interleaved throughout. Just be sure to pour through chapter 5, which is the all-important filtering chapter. Then skip to Chapter 8, which introduces some real-world packet captures. Don't worry, you get to play with real captures, included on the disk. These files have already been slimmed to just the conversations in question so you don't have to figure out how to pick out 20 packets from 10,000. These are of real interest, and include vulnerability scanning, Trojans and several worms like Code Red. If these don't hit your hot button you're in the wrong field, baby!
<br />
<br />I do have a half-nit to pick about the book, and while it's small it does need to be said. The authors clearly wished to be very complete, writing what appears to be the definitive (and only!) book on Ethereal as well as providing adequate instruction on use. Multiple purposes unless handled very carefully lead to uneven, disjointed writing and that is clearly a flaw shared by this book. It would be hard to write as a cohesive unit containing both reference material and tutorials, theory, practice and a short course on general analysis. Worse it absolutely must cover over a half-dozen operating systems and at least mention related software - reading and writing capture files for other analyzers is essential, and fortunately covered well. That the book doesn't fall completely apart is a testament to the writers and editor but another approach might have resulted in a better read. Still, this is THE definitive work on Ethereal and unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon. Like Ethereal itself this book is well worth the price and effort to master.</span>

                    <span>Ethereal is fairly commonly accepted as one of the best, if not the best packet sniffer available. If its not the best, it certainly is hard to get more bang for the buck because Ethereal is freely available as an open source application. 
<br />
<br />The opening chapter provides a very good overview of network analysis for those who are new to the whole concept. It answers questions like "What Is Network Analysis and Sniffing?" and "How Does It Work?". 
<br />
<br />One of the nice things about this book is that it is completely dedicated to this one product. So, rather than hitting the highlights of various applications and glossing over features and functionality this book provides entire chapters devoted to installing and using Ethereal's basic functionality and then goes on to cover advanced concepts in great detail. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 7 explains how to integrate Ethereal with other products and using Ethereal to analyze data from applications such as Snort, Snoop, Microsoft Network Monitor and more. Because Ethereal is open source anyone with an idea and some extra time is welcome to contribute to the project by developing Ethereal further. Chpater 9 is dedicated to illustrating what you need to know as a developer to help improve Ethereal. 
<br />
<br />The book comes with a CD which contains Ethereal among other things, but CD's are quickly outdated and you are better off downloading the current Ethereal from the site. Regardless, this book is a must have for anyone running Ethereal and is well worth the money.

                    <span>In Chapter 1 the book tells you to get a copy of Ethereal at www.Ethereal.com. This is correct. But be sure you spell it right, if you go to etheral you get to a rather strange looking sight with links to a lot of places that look like you just might want to be sure your virus protection is up to date. 
<br />
<br />When you get to the Ethereal web site, you'll be offered a link to their documentation. You'll want to download it of course. Then the obvious question is why spend money for this book if the documentation is available free over the net. The answer is organization, layout, convenience and the fact that just having a different person explain things using a slightly different set of words and sentences sometimes makes things more clear. Look at it this way. If you're working on a network problem and reading both the on-line documentation and this book save you an hour of frustration you've more than paid the cost of the book. 
<br />
<br />In addition, this book contains a great deal more information of the general or background type. For instance, I found the three pages describing the FBI's Carnivore (now DCS100) network analyzer to be quite interesting. This additional information also includes more help in understanding what the data Ethereal collects really means. 
<br />
<br />If you're into the packet sniffing business, this is a book that belongs on your bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>the documentation that comes with Ethereal is ok.
<br />
<br />this books makes a fairly easy sniffer, much easier to use.
<br />
<br />It has something for everyone.

                    <span>I've used the tool for years, and I've read the docs a bit, so I felt comfortable with the tool. Still, I wanted to learn something new with it, and I wanted to see if this book could offer what I was hoping for. The book delivers, and does a pretty good job. One of the big tests for me about any book that covers an Open Source project is "Does this book offer more than the existing documentation?" If it fails to, the book isn't worth the money, I'll stick with free docs. <p>A bit of the book I didn't like was the choice of screenshots: quite a number of the screenshots were full screen dumps when only one or two elements of the page really mattered. Either trimmed or annotated screenshots would have been more welcome. A lot of information gets dumped in Ethereal, helping people navigate the UI with a static, black-and-white image would have been welcome.<p>Now, on to the real strengths of the book. The book offers more coverage than the existing, free docs on Ethereal provide, or at least in a more manageable form. Obviously, with the source code in front of me I could dissect the tool and learn everything about it, but that's hardly efficient. Simply put, the book introduces network sniffing and troubleshooting well. How can you place a sniffer to get coverage, what can a sniffer tell you during troubleshooting (and what can it not?), and of course how to get and install Ethereal (on UN*X and Windows).<p>The next chapter covers exactly what you would expect it to, how to use Ethereal. Ethereal's main use is as a GUI protocol analyzer, so you have menus, panes and windows to navigate. This chapter tells you what they are and how they present and format the data you're looking at. The next chapter deals with four tools that come with Ethereal: Tethereal (very similar to tcpdump), Editcap, Mergecap, and Text2pcap (all useful for managing pcap files).<p>Chapter 7 is one of those handy things to read. Ethereal is typically used to read pcap files, but it can also read snoop files, Microsoft Network Monitor files, EtherPeek files, NAI's Sniffer files, and HPUX's nettl files, all of which you'll find around. It's handy that you can see how to integrate Ethereal with these other products.<p>Chapter 8 brings it all together with real world packet captures, many of which are also on the included CD. These files include scans, Trojan uses, and even worm traffic. All of these are useful for learning how to use Ethereal and highlight the power of the tool. You can go from novice to a pretty decent network protocol junkie if you dilligently study the resources in this chapter and on the CD.<p>Chapter 9 will be useful to a small subset of people, but quite useful. This chapter gives you a tour of how to develop for and extend Ethereal. Ethereal's main strength is a huge number of decode routines, such as sFlow and MPLS (in addition to the standard ones like DNS, DHCP, and the like). Using this information you can extend Ethereal for your own needs and maybe even contribute back to the project.<p>Either the developer's angle or the detailed discussions and examples of the filter syntax are my favorite parts of the book. They contribute significant value for everyday use, and I found them useful in a recent task at work.<p>The book is going to run the risk of becoming quickly out of date, given the development pace of Ethereal. However, it relies more on underlying core concepts and principles inherent in Ethereal, so it should stay useful for longer than you may think. Also, Syngress has a book update feature that some people may find useful.</span>
