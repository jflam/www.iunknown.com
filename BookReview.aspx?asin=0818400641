                    <span>"Playing Blackjack As a Business" was an important book, in its day.  Now it is sadly out of date.  The information on the mathematics is still fundamentally sound, but the environmental factors have changed enormously in the nearly thirty years that this book has been on the market.  
<br />
<br />The attitudes of the casinos and the way they approach the entire subject of card counting has evolved since this book was written.  The ways that card counters have had to respond to those changes makes it an entirely different world than this book represents.  The newer books, those published in the last year or two, can give you a better feel for what you should expect.
<br />
<br />"How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken", for example - just in its presentation - can give you a better idea of the cat and mouse tactics involved in card counting in today's casinos.  Nowadays, pit bosses aren't above letting neophyte card counters play until they get behind, which is about as likely as getting ahead given the variance of the game, and then barring them before they can win their money back.
<br />
<br />Still, "Playing Blackjack As a Business" is important in the history of card counting.  It all depends on where your interests lie.</span>

                    <span>Not being "of age," and therefore not playing in a casino, I cannot say how much money one could make with these strategies.  His Basic Strategy does seem to work though (in home games, etc.), it gets about a 49% win rate.  This man is a sexist egomaniac who truly believes that everyone but him is a moron, and he is the ONLY man alive that should be listened to when trying to learn Blackjack.  It's kind of amusing when he implies several times that most women are too stupid to learn his strategies, that they are unable to concentrate or devote any time to it, but that if a woman were to learn one of them she could make millions based on the fact that she is a woman and pit bosses won't be watching her.  Pretty funny stuff.  However, his "Revere Plus-Minus Strategy" is stolen from Beat the Dealer, it's a basic hi-lo, nothing more.  Also, he devotes a chapter to the Revere Ten Count, only to say much later that all ten count systems are worthless.  So what can I say, I think that reading it will improve your game, but not nearly as much as this man seems to think it will.</span>

                    <span>I was introduced to this book in 1972 whilst applying for a casino job in Tehran, of all places, and a few years later when I began playing serious BJ myself, I would have given it 4 stars but with some reluctance because, aside from the good parts, it also contains a lot of gamblers superstition and questionable advice.  <p>Revere's book was a breakthrough in that it was written for the player who wanted a clear and concise book on "how to win" rather than Thorpe ("Beat the Dealer")desire to demonstate how terribly clever he was.  Unlike say Allan Wilsons "Casino Gamblers Guide" (see my review) the text is poorly written but, most importantly and memorably it did have excellent colour-coded strategy charts - it was this feature more than anything else which I believe made the book such a success.  <p>On the debit side I would agree with the 2-star reviewer below that LR's agenda was to sell his much-touted "superior strategies", the mastery of which according to him, would double or triple your win-rate.    I fell for this sales pitch and sent him another $200 (a lot of money at the time) - plus an extra $50 for the "no-hole card strategy", which consisted of a scrap of typed paper containing half a dozen numbers and no explanatory notes.   His so-called "advanced point-count" was highly over-rated and his promised "after-sales service" non-existent.  Besides, I soon discovered that going from a simple one-level count to an "advanced" multi-level count produces marginal gain at best, esp in multi-deck games.   After expressing my dissatisfaction by letter, LR wrote a curt one-line reply on a businesscard..!  Such was his brusque manner.<p>Most of LR's strategies and experience refer to the now rare single-deck game - sure you can still find them but if you bet more than a quarter and appear to know what you are doing you will certainly get "heat" and probably have the deck broken on you.   He appeared to have very little if any experience of even 4-deck games let alone the now much more common 6 or more decks.  His very conservative bet-spread was also based on a single deck game and would have been useless applied to 4 or more decks, but this fact was glossed over. <p>In Revere's day (the 60's and early `70's), the game was far easier to beat  - more and better decision options, much deeper penetration, and much less scrutiny ("heat") for counters than is the case today.   In this respect the 5-star review below by the "Las Vegas pit boss of 25 years" is inexplicable and totally unrealistic.   LR also virtually ignored the fact (as do most other BJ books written for the US market) that in most of the world the dealer doesn't take a hole card - this apparently "minor" rule change makes a big difference to the basic strategy when playing against a dealers 10 or Ace. <p>I don't doubt that Revere was quite successful at the tables, but nowhere near as much as he makes out.  In his day single-deck BJ was (relatively-speaking) easy to beat, there were very few counters, and dealers and pit-bosses weren't as paranoid about counters as they were to become, largely as a result of this book.   I would wager that LR made much more money selling his books and strategies than he ever did from playing. <p>I don't know whether Revere's heirs (he died in the late `70's) are still selling their expensive "advanced strategies" but if they are - send me your money instead - I'll give you far better value and advice.     Unless newer editions of his book have corrected these deficiencies, then this book is all but useless for the modern "tough" multi-deck casino environment.</span>

                    <span>Prior to this book I was winning with beginners luck. Now I am actually winning by knowing what I am doing when and why. Although the house is still up, I am a better player from reading this book. This book explains the game and the strategies in a very simple language. The book has charts that explain what you should be doing in all situations. These cheat charts were created from computer simulated odds. I have not been able to read the more advance strategies (counting cards) although the basic strategies has started to sink in an have helped me increase my odds against the house.<br>Enjoy the game and do not lose too much money.</span>
