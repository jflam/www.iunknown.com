                <span id="Label1">If you are driving, pull over.  If you are at work, close your door-unless you don't mind your colleagues seeing you doubled over, in tears, on your office floor.  With this CD, taped before a delirious sold out audience at Carnegie Hall, you are there as David Sedaris performs new stories from his upcoming book.  A parrot who mimics an ice maker, lovers quarreling over a rubber hand, and a Santa Claus who moonlights from his job as bishop of Turkey-the cast of characters in these stories is like no other.  This new work will appeal to David's loyal fans as well as admirers of the classic comedy albums of George Carlin, Bill Cosby and Steve Martin.</span>

                    <span>Forget workout videos. My abdominal muscles took a few days to recover from laughing so hard, but I am noticing a more toned look in my belly. That's because I listened to this CD over and over again. I didn't know I could laugh in great, gulping guffaws like that. I hope my neighbors didn't hear me, but I'm fairly certain that's why they have been giving me funny looks lately. David Sedaris is just that funny. Reading his stories will make you laugh out loud, but actually listening to him read his stories demands a soft place to roll around on the floor and at least 1 half hour in which you might be able to quiet your breath back to a normal rhythm. If you listen with a friend (I listnened with my boyfriend), expect to dissolve into giggles many weeks later when you catch that friend's eye over something that reminds you of a story. This is a 10-STAR cd.</span>

                    <span>I love this cd. So much so that I've kept it in my car cd player since I received it, listening to it over and over while driving to and from work, or doing weekend errands. I'm at the point now where I don't want to listen to droning talk radio or FM stations anymore. All I want to do is listen to David Sedaris relate his stories in the unique way that he does. To hear the stories related by David, in the tone and delivery they were meant to be, is a true pleasure, one that stays with the listener long after the CD has ended. I wish the CD was longer, but I've already ordered the box set. I've read all the stories in the box set, but want to hear them straight from David himself. If there were 100 hours of David reading, I'd be a happy woman.</span>

                    <span>The only thing better than reading a David Sedaris book, such as Me Talk Pretty, Naked, or Barrel Fever, is listening to him. This is one funny guy, with dry wit and humor that makes its point without the overuse of profanity. True, some of his "situation" and escapades are racy, but there's an underlying sweetness to the work. Also some underlying sadness. Don't pass this one by.</span>

                    <span>So there it was, out of the blue, a GIFT for donating to NPR....<P>I LOVE this disc. Like many, I am very familiar with David Sedaris from his writings. Hearing him read it takes it to a whole new level.<P>I did want to mention one track which hasn't yet gained comment...the "Jewish Conspiracy" that is NPR. What could they have been thinking asking someone with David's sense of whimsy to write an introduction. I've no idea of the final version, but surely think they should have stuck with this! (I love Terry Gross, but she could use some lightening up).<P>Anyway, do get it. You assuredly won't regret it.</span>

                    <span>Just hilarious! David pulls you right into the story with his delivery. He is an astute observer and flavors his writing with keen perceptions. They are so dead on that when brought slowly up to the surface, everyone can find something to relate to. I know that now I feel remorse for the time I told my brother no one would notice him wearing girl's pants. <BR>Thanks David! Thanks for all the laughs, they continue on long after listening.</span>
