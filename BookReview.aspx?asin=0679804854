                    <span>"Gordon is big. Gordon is blue. Thomas the Tank Engine is blue too. `I am fast. And you are slow. I will race you. Go, go, go!"' -From the book
<br />
<br />Catch Me, Catch Me! Is a Pictureback Reader book that uses only 50 different words. There are also cut-out learning cards inside, so parents, caregivers, and teachers can reinforce words from the story. However, the "cards" are really small rectangles that would likely take quite a while to cut out! (They're not perforated). 
<br />
<br />There are 6 suggested games at the back of the book for using the cut-out word cards, including games for concentration, word recognition, making matches, building sentences, and recognizing rhymes. It appears that the story is geared towards preschoolers and Kindergartners.
<br />
<br />Some parents may take issue with this book because it encourages competition and gloating, with the last page saying "But I am first, and you are last", as if being first makes one better or superior (reflecting pervasive Western values and attitudes).

                    <span>My son loves this book.  Although, to be truthful, he loves pretty much anything with a train in it.  I don't mind the book, which is about all I ask for out of his train stories.  This one is short and cute and not too annoying to read six times in a row.
<br />
<br />However...  It seems to me that Thomas wins this race because he cheats.  Maybe that's unfair of me.  Maybe he just wins by using all of his advantages, ie a tunnel that is marked "Unsuitable for large engines."   But I don't really see the difference between what Thomas does and a runner who cuts across the race track and declares that he won his race even though he didn't actually run the whole thing...   Thomas comes across to me as a complete brat and every time I finish the story, I find myself pointing out to my son that I really don't think the "victory" counts.</span>

                    <span>There are some good things and some bad things about this Thomas the Tank Engine story book.  The illustrations are action-filled and colorful, the text is simple, and the book includes tiny flash cards for helping your beginning reader; however, the text is also confusing.  In order to stick to 50 words the author has sacrificed clarity and readability.  It's not always clear who is speaking, and rhymes are often strained and awkward.  Also the lesson is not that slow and steady wins the race, as others have stated, but that Thomas is losing but then finds a shortcut through a tunnel.  All-in-all, not the best of this educational and entertaining series.</span>
