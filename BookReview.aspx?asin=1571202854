                    <span>I really like making these boxes.  The book is very poorly organized.  You have to jump between so many pages to find your instructions, but once you know how the book is, it helps.  All the instructions are there but confusing to find.  It sure could of been better organized.  I want instructions for each project with each project.  But in spite of this, I like making these boxes to give away...people really enjoy them!</span>

                    <span>As a sewer with 30 years of experience I was able to figure out the instructions in spite of those in the book. A beginner would have great difficulty. Side bars thruought state "EASY", "FAST", "FUN"... none of which I experienced. The chinese take-out box I made is very nice, but having to zig-zag stitch around the edge of the box 2 or 3 times proved VERY tedious. After you've made one, they are relatively easy, but not FAST and certainly not FUN.</span>

                    <span>I waited weeks for this book to be available and was very energized to make fabric boxes--thought this would be my Christmas present for everyone.  But perhaps one needs the experience of making fabric bowls first because I was not successful.  
<br />
<br />One has to navigate through a lot of narrative to establish a shopping list. I had many false starts because the book is not clear enough on the specific products one MUST use.  In many cases the photos do not match the adjacent narrative and at times photos show processes that are not described at all. Oh, I wish I had the same experience as the the positive reviewer. Unfortunately, after investing 6 hours, plus hours of shopping time, I still do not have a completed quality product. I am not a beginner sewer or crafter and yet, find this book does not stand alone to instruct someone new to this type of project.</span>

                    <span>I have made several of these boxes - you can use them in your home to store things or give them as a gift box. Each box can be made in a night and they all go together really well. The author's instructions are clear and easy to read and follow. My best tip is to use a zipper foot when sewing up the sides of the box to make sure of a snug fit. Get the book and use up some of your stash to make some of these fun boxes. </span>
