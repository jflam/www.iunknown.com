                    <span>Tim Fitzharris Guide to Nature Photography is a complement to John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide, which has been widely (& correctly) accepted as a "textbook" in this subject, up to this time.<P>That's why the first part of this book tends to be a bit boring. Much of the discussion about the equipment is overlap and has been explain thoroughly in Shaw's book. I think Shaw gives us the basics and fundamentals in nature photography (the know-how theory of exposure and metering unusual situations, the best equipment to chose and use, etc). However, you will be amazed by how much you don't know about nature photography in the next parts and chapters of the National Audubon Guide to Nature Photography.<P>Tim Fitzharris furnish you with many advance and creative techniques to create more appealing, artistic and creative photos. For examples, he explains clearly and beautifully how to use motion effects (including wind) to photograph many nature objects, the right angle to maximize perspective, modifying natural light (including advance technique of using neutral density filters), impressionism nature photography, etc. What makes this book more helpful is Tim Fitzharris also caters into details in important points of his explanations. He explains (more comprehensively than John Shaw does) about the techniques to get close to wildlife and the power of using blinds, how to photograph birds in flight and even as far as the shutter speed for action-stopping (freeze hummingbird with wings, or body only, great blue heron in flight, snow goose in flight, etc!). He also provides reader with picturegraphs (of animal portrait, how to exactly position the neutral density filter in various situations, etc). These proven techniques and detail information is unquestionably very helpful in boosting our learning curve.<P>To help us to be more productive, Tim Fitzharris gives hints to the characteristics of the photogenic sites and also the nature photography calendar (North America).<P>The photos always correspond with the topic discussed and they are breathtakingly beautiful and artistic. It made me wondering, what kind of photos will be presented in the next page. Moreover, they also serve as a good example. Even I learn so much about composition by looking at those stunning photos. <P>However, I find one part of this book has been published in Fitzharris column in Popular Photography. Be aware for you who regularly read his monthly column (I don't).<P>Another weakness, this book seems not presented in methodical or lack of systematical method in teaching you about nature photography. Perhaps the author and publisher want to avoid the textbook impression; they want it to be more artistic (in fact it is the way I feel about this book). Where should I find the action-stopping speed? I can't find it in the chapter about wildlife... neither I can find a thorough explanation about using neutral density filter in The Right Equipment Part. It is scattered in the book, depending on the usage and the technique intended to launch. There's no index and difficult to refer something!<P>So the emphasize of this book is on the technique. My advice is you should grasp the basics and fundamentals before reading this book. And it is the John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide. Buy that book if you want to buy only one book.<P>But, if you want to go to the next level, this book is well worth your hard-earned money. It will undoubtedly furnish your skill and give you more edge.</span>
