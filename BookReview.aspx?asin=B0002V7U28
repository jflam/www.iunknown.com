                    <span>C'mon, turn it up, turn it up!  Power to the People, y'all!  Pass stolen, Magic up the middle, Coop and Worth-y! fill the lanes; no look pass for the Coop-a-loop!!!  This disc-set is a wonderful way to see more Lakers games, although a few games do not have the Lakers.  The Lakers always look fleet, sharp, and conditioned.  Next to the Celtics, they appear more so!  (If you use your slow mo, you can see that a couple 80's Celtic players have scars on their necks, from where they took the bolts out).  Celtics provide a wonderful contrast to the Lakers:  East vs. West, slow vs. fast, awkward vs. smooth, beer swilling Vinnies vs. good looking fans, don't ask vs. the Laker Girls.  If you want to see the Lakers at their best, and the Celtics near the top, there are some great games here!  I especially like the '84 series, when the Lakers' Twinkle Toes Jackson (white 6'3 off-guard from Niagara - master of the finger roll) took his finger roll attack right at the Celts!  He did a 180 roll on Bird, "the tootsie roll" on Parish, and "rolling thunder" on McHale!!  Then on a fast-break, he took off from the free-throw line for a finger roll!!!  (You may have seen the poster).  Awesome!!
<br />
<br />Etc.  See if you agree -- The older the games, the better the network commentary:  The games from the 1970's have periods of silence (!); The 80's have matter-of-fact masters Musberger, Stockton, and Heinson (the best!)....  And by the nineties commentary was shrill non-stop yacking mixed with fault finding (Costas, Collins, Walton)....  Will we ever return to low-key *cool* commentary?  For me, the game is hype enough in itself!  We don't need shrill factoid geeks ranting non-stop!  Hasta I'm a Laker!        </span>

                    <span>I was very impressed with this compliation of Celtics history.  I have been a fan since Bird's rookie year.  The best part is the complete classic game footage.  I can still hear the play by play voice of Dick Stockton calling those classic Celtic/Laker battles.  I have been looking for these games for years and now am glad I have them.  This is a must have for any basketball fan.  If you want to see real basketball, unlike todays players, watch this collection of Celtic great games.</span>

                    <span>I have been waiting for this DVD set with baited breath, and it was well worth the wait.
<br />To be able to pop in a DVD of some of the greatest basketball ever played is a refreshing treat from watching the boring, slow, selfish basketball of today. Watching these games again, it just blows me away how little today's awful, me-me-me players learned from legends like Bird, Magic, McHale, Worthy, etc. This is basketball as its finest. 
<br />Celtics-Lakers '84 probably was the best Finals series ever played, and I say that not just because the C's won. It was high intensity, brilliantly played basketball on both sides (Worthy's stolen pass by Henderson notwithstanding). Watching the '81 Celtics-Sixers Game 7 again literally brings chills to me. I was a 16 year old kid at the time, and was literally too nervous to watch the final few minutes. The Sixers led the whole game, and I was getting too discouraged to keep watching. I went into a barn next to our house, which had a converted hoop inside it, and started shooting baskets in nervous energy, imagining every shot to be a comeback by the C's. When I quickly turned the game on the radio, I heard the cigarette-stained voice of Johnny Most gloriously saying the Celtics had just scored nine of the game's last 10 points and had pulled it out, 91-90. Incredible. My gambit worked. I was on Cloud Nine.
<br />Speaking of Most - the most objective, truth-telling play-by-play man of all time ("The gutless way they do things here" - circa Detroit, late '80s), I attended the Johnny Most Basketball Camp in 1977, in Nashua, New Hampshire. 
<br />Some of the unforgettable memories include:
<br />-Johnny yelling at his son, Les, to "pick 'em up and lay 'em down" on the court during the many scrimmages of camp.
<br />- Johnny telling us wide-eyed kids of the time "Havlicek Stole the Ball."
<br />-Us asking Johnny what he'd do if we took away all of his cigarettes (he smoked at least two packs of Kool cigarettes per day)? He said he'd "go right back out to my trunk and get another carton."
<br />-Johnny sitting, alone, in the camp's kitchen, watching an episode of "Hawaii 5-O" on a small black and white TV, telling us he couldn't join us yet until he watched the conclusion.
<br />It's all great stuff. I know fans around the country roll their eyes a lot at Boston sports fans, how much they live in the past and think everything of their childhood was the real "glory days", but you simply have no idea unless you were there how special it was to grow up watching this team. In my case, it started with the early '70s era, with Cowens, White, Havlicek, etc., and continued on through the wonderful Bird era. The basketball was incredible, and it will live on forever on this fine DVD.
<br />I would have liked more, of course, including more on the teams that won the '74 and '76 titles - especially the '74 team. That series against Milwaukee for the title, against Kareem, Robertson, etc., was one of the more overlooked Finals ever, in terms of how great it was. Ironically, the best C's team of the '70s was one that didn't win it all. The 1973 Celtics won 68 games, and might have been the best fast-breaking C's team in history. They were a joy to watch, with their passing and teamwork. But Havlicek broke his arm in the playoffs, and the Knicks took advantage with a series win.
<br />Anyway, Celtics fans need to run, not walk, to get this fine set of memories.</span>

                    <span>The Boston Celtics have won 16 NBA championships but none since 1986. They have had 3 distinct classic periods- the Russell Dynasty of 1956-69, the scrappy 71-77 teams of Cowens and Havilcek, and the Bird Era of 79-88. Since then they have had diminishing returns, with the occasional playoff run. The Boston Garden is gone, replaced by the sterile, anonymous Fleet Center. Years of consecutive sell-outs have been replaced by indifferent fans and empty stands. The players people cared about are long gone, replaced by selfish, anonymous wannabes. While the players can't really be blamed for simply being a part of the general vibe of the NBA of the early 21st century, it has to be admitted that Celtics Pride is as dead as the dodo. So what we have left are the memories, and this box encapsulates some of those great moments in Celtics history.
<br />
<br />Discs 1 and 2 contain 10 different historical documentaries. There are two disappointments here. One is the barely 4 minute piece on the Celtics from 1988 to the present. It's not as if there is nothing to talk about. The fact remains that there have been some highlights since Bird injured his foot but they are glossed over here. The team was actually pretty fun to watch from 1989-93 and 2001-2003. 
<br />
<br />Also, there is zero info on the pre-Auerbach days of 46-50. Sure they were not champions, but to simply ignore the story of the team's very creation seems strange considering this is a "complete history".
<br />
<br />Two other major events that are glossed over are the tragic deaths of rookie Lenny Bias (cocaine OD) and star Reggie Lewis (either heart irregularity or cocaine OD, the truth may never be known). I don't feel any Celtic history is complete without a more detailed analysis of these events, because they greatly affected the team's future. Sure it is bad news, and the idea here is to keep things upbeat and stress the championships won. But a "complete history" should live up to its name. Just look at the Red Sox and Pats for example.
<br />
<br />Lenny Bias was to be the shot in the arm of youth the aging '86 champs would need to defend their title. Add the "what-ifs" of a healthy Walton and Wedman and the `87 Celtics may very well have won 70 games. Instead, they won 59 and went to 6 games with the Lakers in the Finals, and were within one baby hook of changing the series around. The documentary included in this box about that season is inspiring- the starting five had numerous injuries but trudged on. But it was also a marker of things to come.
<br />
<br />What is sadly apparent was the number of stiffs the Celtics had on their benches in 87 and 88, the last two Bird years the team was in true title contention. The fact is the team had no cards to play with- all the money had been put on the Bias pick. KC Jones had to run his starting five of Ainge, DJ, Chief, Bird and McHale into the ground because there was no one else to go to reliably. In retrospect you wonder why they never got one more key player somewhere to help out. Bird for example may very well have been able to play longer. 
<br />
<br />The sad fact is that Red Auerbach and the Celtics have lost their touch and luck of the leprechaun for getting incredible talent. The parade of losers- both coaches and players- since 1988 is both sad and tragic.
<br />
<br />It should also be noted that muscle conditioning was not encouraged in these days- compare the leaner 80s players to the buff players of today and you can see the obvious difference in muscle tone. One can wonder how players would have been helped with better muscle support on their frames.
<br />
<br />Discs 3 to 5 contain the 6 games (and one quarter of Game 7 of the 69 finals against LA). The footage is amazing but there are numerous glitches in the video. If these are the only tapes available, then someone should have taken better care of  them. The clothes worn by the commentators of the 76 Game 5 game against the Suns is a riot- Rick Barry looks like he is off to the disco after the game. And Dick Stockton's play-by-play of the 81 Philly game (he does it like radio, no pauses, mentioning every player move that we can plainly see, with various mistakes along the way, in a loud shouting tone)is just irritating.
<br />
<br />I had the pleasure of attending the `84 Finals Game 5 (the 97 degree game, a classic), `85 Finals Game 6 (Celts lose the title at home-- Bird had injured hand in bar fight and was missing lay-ups), `86 Finals Game 6 (Sampson is a sissy and Celts regain title) and the `87 Semis Game 5 against Detroit (Bird steals it). The Garden was a hot, cramped, stuffy, smoky place, but it was perfect for Bird ball. I also attended basketball camps run by Red and Larry in `81 and `82, held at the same time as the rookie camps. Watching and listening to clinics run by Red, ML Carr, McHale, Larry, Ainge, etc, are cherished memories for life. Bird used to announce bedtime for the campers over the PA a la Bill Murray in Meatballs with "This is the Ayatollah Bird. Time for lights out, go to sleep". He had a very understated but hilarious dry ironic humor. I remember literally dozens of amazing basketball moments growing up during the Bird Era, both regular season and playoffs. Late nights as a young teenager were spent sitting in front of the TV with sweaty palms watching games against the West elite teams like San Antonio, LA and Denver when I knew I had to get up early for school the next day. 
<br />
<br />The six games included are all classics, but there are more out there. The Larry Legend DVD is also a must have, because it contains 3 other great games of the Bird Era. 
<br />More of the `81 Philly series would be nice..Or the `82 Washington series...or regular season games like the epic battle in LA in `86 with Walton blocking Kareem's sky hook, or Parish's last second shot in a 145-144 '82 shoot-out at the Garden against Denver ....Great stuff. The list is long. Even series lost had their moments- Game 4 of the `85 Finals in LA where DJ sinks the game winner at the buzzer for example.
<br />
<br />Those days are gone forever but we have this box set to hold us over until the next Celtics team to win the title, whenever that may be. Or until the next Celtics DVD set, which I will gladly purchase!

                    <span>Every Celtics fan I've ever met lives hopelessly in the past.  To them, the clock stopped when Larry Bird retired.  Their hoops knowledge from 1956 to 1992 is impeccable.  After that, they don't know squat.  Ergo, the notion that this DVD set is the "complete history" of the Boston Celtics is a total fallacy.  
<br />
<br />The C's had an unbelievable run (16 titles in 30 years, including 8 straight from 1959 to 1966), but that run is LONG since over.  Boston was once the New York Yankees of basketball, now they're lucky just to make it to the playoffs in the depleted Eastern Conference.  
<br />
<br />I once saw a C's game at the FleetCenter during the last days of the Rick Pitino era.  The arena was half-empty (the city of Boston had long since abandoned the team) and I could barely hear myself think over the sound of 138-year-old Red Auerbach's knocking on death's door.  It's sad how the mighty have fallen!
<br />
<br />Further illustrating how things have changed in Boston, I attended a Lakers-Celtics game at the FleetCenter in the spring of 2001 (the Shaq-Kobe era) and discovered--to my surprise--that one-third of those in attendance were wearing Laker gear.
<br />
<br />So, it's understandable that C's fans would rather focus on Bird & McHale (even if Bill Russell was the greatest-ever Celtic) rather than Paul Pierce's selfish ballhogging and declining basketball skills.  There really are some terrific games to be watched on this DVD set; games that are justifiably famous.  
<br />
<br />So, Celtics fan, keep living in the past if you so desire.  The Boston Garden--and the Celtic mystique--are dead.  Long live the FleetCenter!...or Bank of America Arena or whatever it's called.</span>
