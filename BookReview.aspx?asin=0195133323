                <span id="Label1">The year 2000 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of The Great War and Modern Memory, winner of the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and recently named by the Modern Library one of the twentieth century's 100 Best Non-Fiction Books. Fussell's landmark study of WWI remains as original and gripping today as ever before: a literate, literary, and illuminating account of the Great War, the one that changed a generation, ushered in the modern era, and revolutionized how we see the world. Exploring the work of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, Edmund Blunden, David Jones, Isaac Rosenberg, and Wilfred Owen, Fussell supplies contexts, both actual and literary, for those writers who most effectively memorialized WWI as an historical experience with conspicuous imaginative and artistic meaning. For this special edition, the author has prepared a new introduction and afterword.</span>

                    <span>In 1916 on the Western Front, in a single hour, a well-placed single machine gun could slaughter a thousand men rising up out of the trenches, as they did in wave after wave. Hundreds of books have been written about the Great War, and in recent years, there has been renewed, intense interest in what (in my opinion) remains the most significant event of the 20th century. None of these works is better, and few equal Paul Fussell's 1975 WAR AND MODERN MEMORY. This extraordinary, moving book focuses primarily on the letters, diaries, reports, memoirs and fiction of Englishmen who were in the trenches. Residing in the dusty archives of the Imperial War Museum, much of Fussell's source material had not been seen in more than half a century, and most of it had never been seen by historians. There is little in Fussell's book about the causes of World War I (pick any explanation that appeals to you: you may be right), its battles or its politics. Rather it's mostly about what the people involved, from soldier to office worker, thought and felt about the war - then and later. It's about how these thoughts and feelings were reflected in contemporary poetry and literature, and how they continue to resonate across the decades. And, the book also about irony - the irony of trying to "win" a war which could not be won and resulted only slaughter. The irony of honorable, tradition-enslaved generals who mindlessly continued the slaughter in full knowledge (albeit, rarely first hand) of what was occurring. The irony of officers living among rats and decomposing corpses in the trenches, yet able to arrange for the regular delivery of hampers of delicacies from Fortnum & Mason. The inexplicable irony that although wholly and self-evidently pointless, their was simply no way to stop the killing.</span>

                    <span>Paul Fussell, critic, memoirist, and sometime gadfly, produced in this book something rare: a work of contemporary literary criticism that's not only readable and comprehensible, but significant. <P>Fussell's thesis: The First World War -- the Great War, the War to End All Wars -- forever altered European and American consciousness, bringing major change to language, literature, other aspects of cultural memory. The massive, horrifying conflict laid waste to 19th-century innocence and incubated the irony and cynicism that has pervaded 20th-century letters, politics, and popular opinion.<P>Before the war, men could and did believe in gallantry, in battle as sport, and in idealized patriotism. After the British lost 400,000 dead in only four months at the Somme (known to the common soldier, Fussell notes, as "The Great Fuckup") irony became the dominant literary mode.<P>You cannot understand this book if you do not understand "irony" in its earlier sense, before it was rendered all but meaningless by overuse and misuse as a synonym for "coincidence." This is irony in the sense of the grave disjunction between expectations and reality.<P>Fussell read widely and with acute attentiveness for this book. His sources are not only the poems and memoirs of writers like Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sasson and Robert Fitzgerald, but newspapers, advertisements, military forms, and battlefield rumors and myths. For evidence of the decimation of the British army, he cites the lowering of the height standard for recruits in 1916; the army no longer had the luxury of accepting only tall volunteers.<P>Throughout, Fussell's prose is cogent and well argued. And he writes, thank God, in plain English, without the tiresome jargon and woozy thinking of postmodern academic critics.</span>

                    <span>Another excellent book on the top 100 list. I think that I have figured out that some of the merit to a book being included on the list is whether it provides a portal to other literature worth reading. This book certainly does that and I now have several more books on my to-be-read list. As others have said, this book details the effect the infantry of the Great War had on our literature, world viewpoint, and psyche. The two criticisms I have are that he over-uses the label "irony" and his classification of "homoerotic". I have come to the conclusion that any contrast is 'ironic' to Fussel; thus, black would be ironic to white. I do not believe that is the case, or if it is, then 'irony' is so broad a category, it is has become meaningless and we should use more particular terms to communicate. Also, while I have no doubt that 'homoeroticism' and 'homosexuality' exist, Fussel quotes so many passages that merely show sentimentality of a man to another man that, I think it unfair to say it is 'homoerotic'. Certainly, men can be friends and have developed a depth of feeling for each other through a common traumatic experience that it does not need to be classified as 'homoerotic'. Or, if it does, like 'irony' the term has become so broad to emcompass such a large spectrum of emotions and feelings that it too has become meaningless.</span>

                    <span>A book relevant to the current situation of the War on Terrorism.<P>Fussell's focus is the literary context of the British trench experience of WW1. Contending, as he well illustrates, that for the British WW1 was an extremely literary war. In the trenches young men were reading books, writing poetry, sending letters home, subscribing to magazines, and for those who were not slaughtered, beginning careers as writers... such as with Robert Graves.<P>Fussell starts out with Thomas Hardy and ends off with Thomas Pynchon, Norman Mailer, and even connects Alan Ginsberg's Howl to the Great War literary tradition. Along the way he explores a panoply of authors whereby the terribly horrid war was imagined within a context of the British literary tradition (Chaucer, Shakespeare, King Arthur etc.), and it becomes evident that the war may have been prolonged, and not sooner negotiated to a close, as a result of the elaboration of heroic story.<P>The summer of 1972 Fussell spent in the British War Museum in a secluded room going through boxes of troop correspondence. There is an interesting emphasis on the "language" of war, the words used to describe bodies blown about into indistinguishable lumps of flesh sort of thing.<P>War is not an imaginable event, and yet we as conscious humans need to give war a face that we can live with... and in some cases be willing to die for. I find the book relevent to now in respect of considering how the War on Terrorism is envisioned within the American literary tradition (Bush knows his Huck Finn). The metaphors, the words, the use of past examples to describe war derive from our literary and historical context.</span>

                    <span>Keegan does a better job of explaining the "what" of war and his volume on WW I is superb. But ever since I first heard of Pickett's charge, I always wondered what why the soldiers would so willingly march to their deaths. This volume explores that issue through the literature of the period. It is a densely constructed book filled with literary criticism and quotations of long forgotten poetry and fiction. Unless you are familiar with the language of literary criticism written for an academic audience -- you WILL be consulting a dictionary quite often just to grasp the meaning of a paragraph. <P>In fact, the text is more of a literary criticism of the writings from the period than a social or military history. That's not so bad as the literature reviewed owes its all to the war and the nuances of the literature are important. When the book was written, the author was a professor of English and was making his name as a scholar in the field - not a social historian. Nevertheless, it is a superb mid-point in a study of WW-I.</span>
