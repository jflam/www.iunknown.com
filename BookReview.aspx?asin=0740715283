                <span id="Label1">Sometimes it's hard to find the right words to tell Mom just how you feel.  How can you adequately thank her for all her selfless acts of love and tireless devotion?  Bradley Trevor Greive's new book, Dear Mom, will help children of all ages (especially those who call themselves grown-ups) express those special thoughts and feelings in tenderly honest words and pictures.  A poignant tribute to mothers everywhere, Dear Mom artfully combines touching animal photographs with gentle humor and heartfelt words of thanks.  This sweet volume will let moms know just how much all their efforts are appreciated and how much they are truly loved.</span>

                    <span>By all means, "Dear Mom" is a great Mother's Day gift. Sons and daughters would do a fine thing to purchase this book. But beyond one day of the year, mothers, mamas, mas, mommies all need to know they are more than diaper cleaners and house cleaners. She knows this, but wants to hear it from you.<P>The mother-child relationship presented here is a mix of wonder and delight, acknowledging the life and love moms everywhere have given their children. The graphics and photos are warm--you'll smile as you turn the pages.<P>Buy this book, and be sure to write your mom a letter to accompany it. Tell her why the book is true.<P>I fully recommend "Dear Mom" by Bradley Trevor Greive.<P>Anthony Trendl</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for my mom. She doesn't speak English, so I translated it for her. She liked it so much, that she keeps it on her night table, easy to reach. When she first read it, she had a continuous smile on her face. The book has over 50 beautiful photos and the text that goes with them is short but full of impact, funny and very well assorted with the pictures. The humor comes from the contrast that words create between the text and the pictures carefully chosen with taste and talent by its author. Reading this book is not only entertaining, but also relaxing and touching. It's a perfect gift for Mother's Day and for your mom's birthday, since it talks about the (always) special relationship between mother and child. Not a long time ago we had a visit from a friend of mine, also a mom, and she saw the book. She spent 15 minutes reading and reviewing it with the same smile on her face that my mom had. Now I am ordering this book for her. You've done a good job, Mr. Bradley Trevor Greive!</span>

                    <span>This book brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it. The thoughts are so sweet and touching - and the photos bring a humorous and warm depth to this lovely little book. Not only for Mother's Day, but any day of the year you just want to tell your mom how much she means to you. It will be something she will treasure!</span>

                    <span>I was very disappointed. To my surprise, the author has particularized many of the pictures, such that they make no sense to anyone but himself and his mother. For example, here's one caption: "You also taught me that even the worst day seems okay with a big mouthful of milk and cookies. Mom, you'd be amazed how often your calming philosophy of milk and cookies has carried me through the hard times." Now this makes sense to him and his mom, no doubt, and I'm sure she was touched. Here's another "And even though I'm gradually coming to terms with eating broccoli ... and taking that terrible pink cough syrup."<P>Hmmm. Mom and I loved eating broccoli together. <P>How about this one "I'm not sure I'll ever get over your making me kiss your great aunt smack on the mustache!" Hmmmm. Maybe that is a funny memory for him, and his mom. <P>Or how's this..."I'm so sorry...for sulking when you made me go to school or wouldn't let me get a Mickey Mouse tattoo or get my tongue pierced." <P>These particular references to the authors unique experience undermine what I had thought would be the essence of this book, as suggested by the title, "Dear Mom, thank you for everything." An expression of gratitude for the devotion and love that every(any) loving mother had given their daughter or son. I anticipated that the words would be crafted in such a way that they could read as if written from any daughter or any son to any loving mother. But apparently the author was unable to relinquish the opportunity to make a particularly grand expression of gratitude to his mom alone, by including several specific references to their unique experience, which completely undermine and interrupt those moments when he achieves the goal implied by the title of the book and the pictures.</span>

                    <span>This little book touched me when I read it, and brought tears to my mother's eyes when I gave it to her. She is not usually affected by a sentimental book or card, nor am I. The writing in this book is admittedly simple, but I believe that the most truthful and meaningful things can be expressed simply. And this book is filled a with heartfelt, tender, and yet humorous love for a mother and appreciation for what mothers go through to raise a child. <P>In response to the individuals who feel that the "dignity of all animals was insulted", with the abuse of animals and other horrible things that happen to some every minute of every day - the wise animal knows that by comparison, nothing in this book could possibly insult the dignity of animals. If you don't like the book, just say so, but to use this excuse demonstrates a lack of understanding of animal issues. The animals photographed weren't harmed, and the expressions caught really captured what the writer was trying to express.<P>If you are someone who has a mother or a mother figure in your life, and if you would like to express your appreciation to her but just can't find the words yourself, then I cannot recommend this book more highly.</span>
