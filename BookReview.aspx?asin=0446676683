                    <span>This is one of those helpful books that make us better both at work and at home. Although focused primarily on (professional) public speaking abilities it may also help us communicate more confidently and therefore more efficiently with our business partners and colleagues, guests on private parties, museum visitors, and tourist group members. The book is well structured, excellently written, easy readable - even for non-native English speakers! - and brimming with interesting observations, suggestions and instructions. You won't need, of course, 10 days to read the book. Quite the contrary: you'll read it within one day only, because it's short and interesting. Its best part, however, relates to its 'Day 5': 'Body Language and Voice' section is given in a very instructive way, so you can get its points immediately and implement the read directly. 
<br />
<br />I would say that '10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking' by Lenny Laskowski when combined with an another title - 'Persuasion: The Art of Influencing People' by James Borg - can be all professional literature you would really need in order to make yourself a better speaker, presenter and communicator. 
<br />
<br />The only reason that I didn't give the fifth star is a pretty poor quality of its paper. Any book is a physical product as well, isn't it? </span>

                    <span>Lenny's book is probably one of the bext books written on this topic.   Lenny's clear writing style is like being in one of Lenny's seminars.  When you read this book, it is like Lenny is speaking to you during one of his seminars.  He makes it very easy to understand.   What a wonderful book.<p>I can only imagine what Lenny's seminars and workshops are like.  They must be outstanding!<p>This book is a MUST for everyone's library!</span>
