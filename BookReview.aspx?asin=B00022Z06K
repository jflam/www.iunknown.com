                    <span>THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC -- ANYONE INTERESTED IN AMERICAN,COLONIAL, MILITARY, OR BRITISH HISTORY OR IF YOU LOVE A GOOD STORY WELL TOLD--THIS IS A FILM YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIEW ABOUT BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT AND THE BEGINNING OF BOTH THE FRENCH & INDIAN WAR AND THE CAREER OF YOUNG GEORGE WASHINGTON. (HE WAS JUST 24 YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FORCE WAS DEFEATED AT FORT NECESSITY). I SAW THE VHS VERSION AND NOW THE DVD. I MUST SAY THIS SPECIAL EDITION IS A COLLECTORS ITEM--THE NEW ACTION SCENES, THE DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE AND THE EDUCATION TIPS REALLY m,AKE THIS GREAT FILM EVEN BETTER. I ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS FILM EVEN THOUGH, I SAW THE VHS RELEASE 6 TIMES. THIS IS HISTORY AND FILM MAKING AT IT'S VERY BEST.<p>I ONLY WISH THAT THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A SEQUEL TO THE FIRST TWO FILMS--THE BATTLE OF QUEBEC WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO THIS GREAT SET.</span>

                    <span>A thrilling, vivid history feast--the dark forest, pleas of the wounded, shrieks of the Shawnees, the roar of muskets--"You Are There" as a very young George Washington surrenders at Fort Necessity and Braddock's Army marches to disastrous defeat, when victory seemed at hand.<p>This gripping, taut drama of the frontier clash of English, French, native Americans, and provincials, is told by a masterful blend of the words of eyewitnesses, military reenactments, modern historians, colonial music, paintings, artifacts, and onsite filming.<p>The DVD includes several extras, especially detailed comments by historian Paul Kopperman.     <p>Huzzahs to Robert and Mary Matzen, Tom Wilson, their staff, and all participants.<p>Tom O'Connor, Bowie, MD</span>

                    <span>I thought that this was an excellent documentary.It was clear that the director knew what he was doing.I think that this should be shown in all of the schools because the French & Indian War led to the American Revolution.At least there is a movie for school kids to see.PBS has been talking for a long time about doing an F&I movie but no action so far.I didn't know that Daniel Boone was at Braddock's Defeat.Check this one out.</span>
