                    <span>A practical common sense approach to motorcycle maintenance. Mr. Zimmerman has covered all important areas and added more than a few esoteric comments that make for a fast and informative read. If I had only one book in my two wheel referance library it would be this very essential maintenance guide.  </span>

                    <span>I must say that I was disappointed at the misleading title of this book.  I thought that it was more about maintenance issues, but instead it tries to cover the basics of "how a motorcycle works".  I can think of MUCH better books on this topic, such as Kevin Cameron's "Sportbike Performance Handbook", which despite its title, really is more about motorcycle technology.  Another great book on the topic would be Gaetano Cocco's "Motorcycle Design and Technology".
<br />
<br />The maintenance sections in this book suffer from being squeezed into the margins, with fairly small photographs, so that it is sometimes difficult to see what the author is really talking about.  Of course, one cannot really fault this book alone, since most books on mechanics appear to suffer this fault.
<br />
<br />Bottom line:  It's mostly about "how a bike works", and there are much better books out there on that subject.  Too bad it doesn't cover maintenance in greater detail.</span>

                    <span>This book is absolutely awesome! Zimmerman has a nice, easy to read style of writing. His explanations are clear and concise, with great diagrams. Best of all, he doesn't take himself to seriously. He goes to great lengths to make it all seem so easy. I'd recommend this book to anyone that wants to understand how every aspect of a motorcycle works,want's to perform their own manitenance, or at very least wants to understand why the dealer is charging them so much for the repairs. In my opinion this one is top shelf.</span>

                    <span>This book tells it all. From the first chapter on the basics of the internal combustion engine all the way through the details of brake systems and suspensions. Mr. Zimmerman's knowledge of his field is apparent in the way he presents the infornmation on each topic. Illustrations and diagrams are very inforative and easily understood.<br>I'm also giving the book to my 14 year old son so he can get a good base of knowledge to work on his own bikes.<br>Great job!</span>
