                    <span>This book is extremely well-written and, above all, USEFUL! Dr. Mertz approaches the problem of handling text from a fresh perspective. With illustrative examples in different styles (from procedural, functional and object-oriented programming perspectives; and occasionally even metaphysical!), this book actually causes you to think about the types of problems you encounter and provides criteria for deciding the best approach. The examples are short but by no means simple. Aside from a slight stylistic quibble I have with the second chapter, I heartily recommentd this book for those who wish to expand their knowledge of Python and enhance their repertoire of techniques. Try it - it's fun and enlightening!</span>

                    <span>David takes a fresh take on programming and esp. programming with python. He combines OO and functional styles to create programs that are shorter and easier to understand. In addition to providing documentation and examples of python modules related to text processing, David says just as much about good programming style. He shows how OO programming is more than just about smart data, i.e. it is more about what services objects provide, that your coding style should test for services the object provides rather than trying to find out what it is. David also addresses issues specific to Perl/Python like Schwartzian sort, which should greatly help if sorting is the bottleneck in your code. I must confess I have not read the state machine stuff yet as I am thoroughly enjoying all the other stuff little by little. If you are a professional Python programmer you should definitely get this book.</span>

                    <span>I felt the review from "A reader from Germany" below rather missed the point of my book. Don't buy it if the book is not right for you, most certainly. But I wonder how that reader got such an entirely inaccurate set of expectations about the book.<P>For example, s/he wrote:<P>> This book is not for people that are new to programming. <P>However, if you buy the book from Amazon (here), the very first thing you see in the Editorial Reviews section is:<P>> Written for experienced programmers...<P>So it seems odd for the above reader to be negatively surprised by the target audience. If s/he bought it at a brick-and-morter store, the back cover pretty much says the same thing.<P>Moreover, the reader mentioned also seems not to understand the meaning of the title:<P>> The title of the book is very much missleading too. <BR>> If you think that the book has anything to do with <BR>> text processing in the sense of linguistics, you are <BR>> mistaken.<P>I'm not sure how anyone would think that the phrase "text processing" is supposed to mean "computational linguistics." There are a couple overlaps between the fields. And you probably need a bit of text processing to extract useful corpora for computational linguistics. But the ordinary meaning of the words makes it clear that these are quite different areas of specialty. Actually, I just wrote an IBM developerWorks article introducting the Natural Language Toolkit (for Python). Anyone who is interested in computational linguistics and Python should take a look at that library (and my article, once it comes out).<P>I wonder if the "from Germany" description of the reader indicates the s/he translated the English title slightly wrongly. I can kinda imagine that across languages the field distinction could get lost.<P>And finally:<P>> ...really mad to find out that the book is available online too.<P>This one rather upsets me. I provide a service for readers--both those who pay for the printed copy and those who read it online for free (or make a voluntary donation online). The reader is *mad* that I give away something for free that I was under no obligation to (and even wrestled slightly with my publisher to make sure I could do so)!? If s/he doesn't want the free copy, I don't see how s/he's forced to download it!</span>

                    <span>This book covers many of the details of processing text files to extract and/or generate more textual information from them. The author covers quite a number of advanced techniques, starting with an introduction to functional programming paradigms in the first few pages.<P>Nothing in this book is truly new, but the author finds many ways of applying the things advanced Pythonistas already know to domains that they might otherwise not consider.<P>This book is very dense, so don't expect to read it and get it in a weekend. And certainly, don't pick this up as a first programming in Python book. If you're just learning to program, consider "Learning Python" by Lutz or "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" (free web book -- search Google for it). If you already know programming, but need to learn Python, consider the Quick Python Book (old, but great) or "Dive into Python" (another free web book) for learning those.<P>When the time comes that you want to write a small language of your own for your users (or when you need to support an existing small language), this book will be invaluable for telling you how to do this using Python.<P>If you don't understand functional programming, but think you might like to learn it, use this book to teach you that.<P>If you want to understand the regular expression library, use this book for that as well. However, the RE library examples do wrap the output in a special macro that's only likely to be useful for the purposes of the book. Understand that you're not likely to use the macro, and you'll be fine.<P>The tremendous breadth and depth of this book makes me recommend it highly. But even if you're advanced, don't expect it to be light reading.<P>Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>This book is not for people that are new to programming. It is also not for people new to Python. I have difficulties figuring out whom it was intended for. If you are an experienced programmer and want to learn something about Python, read the tutorial that comes with Python or any other online tutorial that is out there.<BR>The title of the book is very much missleading too. If you think that the book has anything to do with text processing in the sense of linguistics, you are mistaken. It just means that it deals with "few" questions related to doing things with text files: hence text processing. Only 17 pages are dedicated to XML, which is too short and another big shortcoming of the book.<BR>It is over priced in my opinion for the small amount of information that it transfers. And it made me really mad to find out that the book is available online too. Don't get me wrong. It is OK to buy books if they are available in print. But they have to offer something. This book is absolutely worth it, maybe if you can scan over some pages once in a while. But you are throwing out your money if you pay for it.</span>
