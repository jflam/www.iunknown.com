Using easy to read, non-technical descriptions, illustrations and photographs. Douglas Mochrie, a Class "A" teaching golf pro has endorsed the book: saying "Hit your...ball farther. Enjoy golf more!...Learn how yoga can improve your game. The pictures clearly illustrate examples of the body positions and motions that correlate well with swings, chips, and putts."</span>

                    <span>The Missing Peace, Improve Your Golf with Yoga Techniques by Ashok Wahi Reviewed by Terry Tolbert, Fort Bliss, TX Let me start by saying that I am a golfer, not a writer or a reviewer. My handicap is "15"; I play in a lot of tournaments but am not a professional. So when I picked up this new, little book I thought,"Well, maybe I can learn a little more about the mental game of golf as well as get a few pointers on physical exercises." It has turned out to be a real revelation for me! I re-learned what I knew all along, that mental and physical discipline are inter-related and very important to improving my golf game. What I learned that was new was that the discipline of Yoga can be specifically applied to certain aspects of golf. There is a special breathing technique which helps you concentrate while developing breath control and lung capacity. There is also a series of posture control poses which helped me improve my swing and follow-through. This is a very practical little book that I highly recommend for the golfer at any level of play.</span>

                    <span>If golf is the most mental of sports, and yoga the most mental of exercise, it makes a lot of sense to fuse the two. I have tried it and took 6 strokes off my game the first time after doing the exercises. And the beauty is, you can do the exercises at home, and some can be done in the car on the way to the course, such as the deep breathing, relaxation techniques. And on the course many yoga exercises can be snuck in while others just wouldn't be appropriate outside a gym. Before I hit the links tomorrow, I'm going to hit "The Missing Peace" and do those loosening warm-ups. The book is well-organized, well-illustrated, easy to use, but most of all it satisfies a need in many golfers that often has gone unmet--unless they've read the book or practice yoga.</span>
