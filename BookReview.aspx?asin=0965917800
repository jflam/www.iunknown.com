                    <span>A very important piece of your Death Valley information package. It has everything you need to know or want to learn.However - PLEASE - have more than just this one source! This guide may instruct you to go to "the foot of the conical shaped mountain". Then the canyon mouth is "to the left". BELIVE ME - when you get to these places, ALL mountains are 'conical' shaped. The canyon mouth forks and there is a right side with 2 canyons and a left side with one. An hour and a half up the left side will finally tell you that you wanted the right side canyon and the left opening on that side! Just be sure you are in the right place. Get help from a ranger or another camper. Don't expect the guide to be the end all and be all. The book is great. It will give you all kinds of interesting information and history.It will tell you everything you want to about the area you are in. Just be sure you are in the RIGHT area FIRST. There's lots of interpretation here. You don't want to be guessing about a two hour struggle up a long, winding canyon when you want to be on the next grand wash over in the next valley!!</span>

                    <span>This is a superb book that provides a large amount of exceptionally useful information about Death Valley. Having visited the park multiple times over the last 2 years, I had become familiar with most of the general areas and some of the less-known gems. <p>This book takes it to the next level for me. It is excellently laid out, totally comprehensive regarding the hikes it discusses and has well-chosen photos, genuinely useful maps and lots of interesting illustrations. I particularly liked the sections on the Last Chance Range and the Panamints. <p>Most importantly the author exactly captures the appeal of the place - the space, the astonishing world of rock, the light and the solitude - and does a nice job of emphasizing the need for us desert users to practice the "minimum impact" approach  without ramming it down our throats. <p>Finally, he has wisely left out a few "secrets" - it'd be tough to explore if *everything* was already in a book!</span>

                    <span>For anyone who has heard of Zabriskie Point, but was afraid to ask. Though written by a hiker for hikers, this book is an indispensable resource of history, geology, archaeology, flora and fauna for this unique region. It  will take you far beyond the trails.</span>

                    <span>This book is a staggering achievement, the crystallization of one person's adventuring on foot in one of the harshest terrains in the USA.  The breadth of the book is amazing; the author travelled many routes that have  been little-explored and some that appear nowhere else but here.  I remain  in awe of his knowledge and perseverence.  The writing is clear, witty, and  most importantly for foot travellers he doesn't give away all the secrets  of the places he highlights.  Containing detailed maps, the variety of one  day and multi-day excursions allow for all experience levels from novice to  superjock.  His advice on hiking in hot conditions is the best anywhere.  A  must-have book for any desert rat.</span>
