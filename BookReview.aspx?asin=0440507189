                    <span>I'm a little surprised at some of the lower reviews. Sher is smart and compassionate. I'm twenty-four (yup, not 40+), and I felt nothing but wonder, appreciation, and inspiration while reading this book. The clarity of thinking, comprehensiveness and attention to detail are wonderful. Of course, you need to have some experience and introspection for certain things to "ring true" (or not). This is a book to grow with and critically analyze, in an ongoing way, at any age.</span>

                    <span>The only thing that I felt like "starting" after reading "It's Only Too Late If You Don't Start Now" was a suicide note.  Being of sound mind and body I decided to kick this one to the curb.<p>Barbara Sher's alleged guide to the second half of life was truly the most depressing inspirational book that I have ever read.  Hoping to find practical tips on how to set about jump-starting my career and pursuing a life-long dream, I found this book (particularly the first half) to be some twisted perspective on evolutionary theory.  Sher's major premise seems to be that we are freed up in the second half of our lives to pursue the things we really love because we are no longer viable as attractive, sexually desirable human beings.  Once we accept that prounouncement and stop trying to compete with 20-somethings, we can move on to create a fabulous life for our homely, undesirable selves.  She goes so far as to criticize those who dye their hair or try to stay physically fit by going to the gym.  <p>I would agree that our culture more than any other in the world is obsessed with youth and that aging gracefully by focusing on expanding one's mind and heart is most definately a worthwhile goal.  However, there are far better, more positive ways to communicate that idea.  Sher's book reads like very sour grapes from someone who didn't get asked to the prom and who is actually still angry about it. <p>As a 42-year-old woman who still turns heads and loves her 37 year old fiance both romantically and spiritually. I think one's time and money are much better spent elsewhere.  I highly recommend (a solid five stars) Martha Beck's "Finding Your Own North Star Claiming the Life You Were Meant To Live".</span>

                    <span>I've read all of the reviews here, and felt compelled to add my own two cents' worth. While the author might overly-emphasize the "beauty vs. wisdom" theory, and does dwell too much on her own view that dwindling libido = greater creative opportunities, I'd still recommend this book to anyone at a midlife crossroads. Why? Because it's a solidly helpful book in most respects.<p>When this book was released in 1998, I ordered a copy. I've been a big fan of Sher's for many years. At the time, my career had very unexpectedly stalled. Financial conditions were such that we (my family) had to downsize our home and lifestyle. In addition to those challenges, I had a breast cancer scare with lumpectomy. A few months later, my Dad died. This book was enormously helpful to me at a time when it seemed everything had tilted on axis in my world. Sher truly did help me find answers to the question, "Where do I go from here?"<p>Chapter 3, "Time Limits", was particulalry encouraging. Slapped hard in the face with the concepts of mortality, I began falling into crisis mode. What if my time is cut short? What if I've already run out of time? Those were haunting questions. Burying a parent in the midst of that crisis only served as fuel to the fear. Chapter 3 was enormously valuable in helping me to take some deep breaths, calm down and really explore what finite time had meant **and could mean** to me.<p>Chapter 8, "Escape to Freedom", was another wonderful section that had a profound impact in my life. It's a chapter that I feel would be useful to anyone at any age. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book, and I still review chapters 10 and 11 periodically. Those last chapters brough about significant change in my life. They could for you, too.<p>I only wish Ms. Sher had focussed more on the above-mentioned aspects of her message earlier in the book, because I believe age is something to celebrate, and beauty can glow from the face of a 90 year old. I also believe that most of us hope to enjoy a healthy, active libido right up 'till the day we're planted in the ground.<p>To summarize? If you, like me, can dismiss Sher's personal opinions about (physically) aging, then I believe you'll gain much from the other, more encouraging, insightful & proactive elements of this book.</span>

                    <span>I respect Sher and therefore hesitate to impugn her good intentions, but there is one huge, fundamental flaw in the book, that, were it written by someone else, I would not hesitate to ascribe to disingenousness. But first, the good part: even though the overall idea here is egregiously faulty, there's a lot of helpful advice sprinkled throughout. If the book's main idea were: do not give up because of your age alone, I'd give it five stars. Indeed people frequently act based on some preconcieved notions, some received, societal "wisdom", rather than being guided by respect for themselves and their real life situation. Iow, they don't, so to say, give it all they have, being hamstrung psychologically by widespread, but in fact, baseless -- or, better put, not necessarily well-founded --  prejudices. To give such people a friendly motivational kick in the pants is a laudable deed. Inasmuch as this book does this, it is good. <p>Now, onto the bad: Sher proposes -- and endlessly belabours -- a preposterous idea of youth, beauty, vigour, and "the nature's hold on you to make babies" as being somehow bad for you, something actually holding you down and preventing your self-actualization. When, the author tells us, you become truly old and ugly, when this accursed gift of satan -- libido -- mercifully subsides, *then* your life actually starts, *then* you are in the best position to flourish. Well, it surely is what a lot of us want to hear, I'm sure. Life's passing by, we become hoary and wrinkled, we're out of breath, our hair mulishly relocates from its correct position on our heads to other body parts where it serves no purpose, etc., etc. Of course being told that it's all OK, and moreover, the best, is such a welcome news! whew, feels wonderful -- unless... Unless, that is, we fear self-deception more than we're anxious about our age: unless we value truth over agreeable and temporarily pacifying cant.<p>The simple truth is that not only the drive "to make babies" (us being "enslaved by nature"), but the whole shebang is driven by our libido. For better or worse, this *is* the source of human creativity, that fountainhead of energy that enables everything else; when our libido is gone, *all* is gone, not only this immature, mindless, and clearly harmful desire to enter into sexual relations with attractive specimens of the opposite sex, but every other desire we have. I'm sure everyone, sort of, knows that himself, but if personal experience is insufficient, there's a huge body of confirming evidence from rather respectable sources, from highly creative people who certainly knew what they were talking about, people like Einstein, for example, who said that if you haven't achieved greatness by the time you're 30, it's unlikely that you'll do so at a later age. And he hadn't. Not enough? Take Newton -- all he's known for he did when young; in his later life he was more of a honorary functionary, a technocrat. Not enough? Take Goethe -- now, here's a different twist: he certainly was creative *all* his *long* life, but at the same time he was known to propose (marriage) to 18 year-olds when he was in his 70s: so, whatever it was that enabled his creativity, it was not the disappearance of libido. Not enough? Steiner in his "Philosophy of Freedom" puts it very persuasively: when our drives disappear, there ensues something of a catatonic condition -- in a sense, we can't "outlast" ourselves in that respect, let alone begin to flourish. Therefore I have to say that I found this aspect of the book egregiously, impossibly wrong. No, being driven to "make babies" is not something that impedes creativity; not only that, but exactly the opposite is the case. One can't help suspecting that what Sher proposes here is no more than an attempt to achieve commercial viability by way of giving a more or less typical career guide "a twist" in order to make it attractive to the er... senior-citizen audience. Maybe it's not that, of course... Anyway, be it what it may, the attempt has failed. And by the way, I wouldn't carp on this so much, if this obviously wrong point of view was not feverishly pushed as a main intellectual basis of the argument in this book. It's really huge in there, and yet, it is obviously wrong.<p>Therefore, my Very Strict Evaluation(tm) goes thusly: if you're able to use your own head and read critically, this is a somewhat helpful book -- there's a lot of, as they say, helpful hints all over. But if you have a habit of taking anything printed on paper as the unquestionable truth, then stay away: the fundamental principle of this book is wholly specious; it will be harmful if taken literally. In fact, doubly harmful -- because it's comforting, because you'll want to believe it.</span>
