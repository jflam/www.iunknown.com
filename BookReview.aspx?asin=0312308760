                <span id="Label1"><div>Ever wonder what gives French women that<i> je ne sais quoi?</i><br><br>At first you might think it&#8217;s the elegant figure, matchless style, and mysterious allure.  Then you realize those qualities don&#8217;t come from just anywhere.  They come from generations of women raised to cultivate an extraordinary sense of self.  French women know who they are, like who they are, and excel at presenting who they are.<br><br>The rest of us are often susceptible to the next fad, the new thing, the ultimate diet.  We&#8217;re always seeking, instead of realizing that what we already are may be just right. Rarely does an American woman feel as comfortable in her own skin as her French counterpart.  And rarely does an American woman have that essentially French ability to say no---to refuse anything that doesn&#8217;t suit her, whether that thing is a job, a man, or the season&#8217;s latest styles.<br><br>Provocative and practical, lively and intelligent, <i>Entre Nous</i> unlocks the mystery of the French girl and the secrets of her self-possession. Why do French women always look inimitably stylish? How do they manage to sit in a caf&eacute; for a three-course lunch and a glass of wine...by themselves?  How do they decide when they&#8217;re ready to let someone become a part of their very private lives?<br><br>Laced with practical tips, engaging sidebars, and essential observations about French women and their ways, <i>Entre Nous</i> is a delightful book that will help you take the best of all pages from the French girl&#8217;s book---the page that reveals how to really enjoy life.<br></div></span>

                    <span>At first, I wondered if this would be another lightweight book praising the mythical French Woman and how she can tie a scarf. Mais non. It is one of the best self-help books, for American women in general, that I have ever read. Getting below the surface of cosmetics and clothes (though these ARE important), the author highlights the intellect of the French woman, and how this sets her apart from the American woman.<P>There is SO much more to the French Paradox. We Americans are FAR more addicted to appearances and the surface of things; we do not take time to get as deep as our European sisters. We think that if we look good and are "physically fit and thin" we have done our work.<P>This book shows us that French "style" begins in the mind and not on the body. Merci!!</span>

                    <span>This book is charming and smart and though-provoking. It didn't play into the stereotypes of French women, rather it pulled back the diaphanous curtain that has long obscured real and valuable insights about them. I'm no Francophile--I'm as American as they come. But this book made me think about lots of little corners of my life in a different light. Do I need all this stuff? Is this stuff the truest expression of who I am? Does this stuff make my life better or does it just get in the way of my real life experience? <P>I loved the author's observations about the real qualities that distinguish the French girl: Not her stylish clothes but her self-containment and sensuality and discretion. Not her mysterious allure but her deeply ingrained sense of time and quality and authenticity. And I loved the wonderful snips of stories about the author's French girlfriends and the very human ways they express these qualities. <P>This book isn't self help, it's self exploration of a uniquely pleasurable kind.</span>

                    <span>I finished this book last night and could easily keep it on hand as a reference for wonderful, conscious, elegant, sophisticated living. (Unfortunately, I borrowed it from the library and have to take it back. :( ) While this book doesn't cover many things I would have liked to known, you read the last page with an indirect knowledge of how a French girl would act in most situations. The best thing I got from this book (I took notes as I read) was a wealth of names of French people to look up (Pauline de Rothschild), French movie recommendations (Milou en Mai), French books to read, including wonderful cookbooks to peruse (Mastering the Art of French Cooking), and entertaining tips. Read this book and savor all the wonderful things that can be learned from it. For anyone interested in a fresh take on life!</span>

                    <span>This book was so fun! I read it very leisurely during a span of 3 or 4 days. Is it a realistic portrayal of the French Girl? Probably not, but it reminded me to slow down and savour each sensory moment, regardless of what people think.</span>

                    <span>Olivier is an enthusiastic and adoring commentator on culture of upper class France with good insight on this refined and ancient society. And her description of the concrete support the French government gives to families (maternal leave, affordable child care) puts the self-righteous lip service of our government to shame. I think this would be an excellent book to read before visiting France, if only to assure that you don't add to the myth of the "Ugly American Abroad".<BR>However, if you are an American girl who, amazingly, manages to live with style, discretion and good food despite the lack of exposure to France, prepare to feel a little incredulous at the white-hot adoration with which Olivier describes her French girl while asserting her (and the French's) fondness for her description of the overly enthusiastic puppy-sish, sweats-clad, Velveeta-munching American girl. (Velveeta? I've never bought Velveeta in my life!)<BR>As a native of California who has found much style, grace, and rituals of good food in my home region as did my sister Californians, M.F.K. Fischer and Julia Child, I am pleased that Olivier has found such joy in her culture by marriage. However, I hope I do not sound too jingoistic when I say that in her very acceptance and appreciation of the French culture (a very American/Californian trait) Olivier tends to treat her native culture with thinly veiled condescension ....a very French trait.</span>
