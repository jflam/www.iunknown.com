                    <span>This book came out when I was working in South Africa. It explores in an uncompromising way two rival phenomena: the hopes of 'white liberalism' and some harsh realities of South Africa's 'African-ness' which many urban liberals at that point seemed to pretend either were not there or were somehow only a function of apartheid. 
<br />
<br />The passages on Creina Alcock, a 'white' South African who stepped far away from her background to live as a Zulu are are especially poignant, even stunning. I visited Creina in her remote hut on the strength of this book and was astonished by her courage and wisdom. Rian captures this extraordinary story in a moving if (for the average reader?) pessimistic way
<br />
<br />This book has universalist insights for anyone interested in whether Civilisations really do Clash. Rian Malan was on to something very profound in this book. It is vivid and appalling in places, and not always easy reading. So what? These issues are as difficult as anything we face. Read it, lots of times.</span>

                    <span>This book is an investigation into the attitudes of a liberal who was raised in South Africa.  In the book, Malan tells us that his original charge was to write the history of his racist ancestors, who were among the first Boer settlers in the region.  But when Malan began his project, he found he needed to first explore and develop his own perspective on race in South Africa before he could begin.  And once he began doing this, he never really got around to the history project.  <p>The book is divided into 3 sections. In the first, Malan describes his own childhood and adolescence, leading up to his forced flight from South Africa, with a major focus on his youthful love for Blacks (especially in the abstract).  The second part of the book details a number of violent murders that Malan investigated upon his return to South Africa in 1986 to write this book.  In this section, Malan describes the intense violence that was occurring in South Africa at the time, and how all Whites, even doctors providing humanitarian services in the townships, became targets for Black rage.  He also explores violence between rival Black political groups.  In the closing section, Malan visits a White woman named Creina Alcock, who lived on the border of Msanga, a tribal homeland, where she and her husband had struggled to build a sustainable rural development project with the local Blacks.  The woman was widowed after her husband was killed while trying to negotiate peace talks during a tribal disturbance in Msanga. <p>The book doesn't have a strong narrative thread- -instead it seems that Malan was trying to communicate some of his own confusion and ambivalence about racial questions by presenting so many stories and sides of the picture, and flipping rapidly from one to the next.  The loose organization is effective to some degree; the reader slowly comes to understand the enormity and complexity of South Africa's problems.  Yes, many Whites provoked anger from Blacks by their abominable behavior and laws.  Blacks in turn responded with violence that was so overwhelming that even those Whites who tried as hard as they could to do the right thing were in mortal danger.  And the worst and most senseless violence seemed to occur in Black communities that had no White involvement at all.  The entire society was so focused on violence that as one White living on a farm in a rural area told Malan "The guy with the bigger stick wins."  In closing with Creina Alcock's story, Malan tries to leave us with a little hope.  He argues that Alcock's and her late husband's love for their community has made a marginal difference in the social structure, despite the ongoing attacks on them and thefts of their property by children they had adopted and raised as their own, and even the murder of Alcock's husband.  With the infinitesimally small improvements that the Alcocks managed to make in their community by giving their entire lives over to the project, how many millions more Alcocks would it take to turn such a country around, and where might they come from?</span>

                    <span>The previous review to the contrary, this book will always be relevant as long as human beings judge other humans based on race. I just  finished reading it and, as an American living in the Middle East, I faced innumerable home truths about myself and my own racist biases during the two days I was glued to it. <p>It is a painful read, in terms of the atrocities it depicts and the questions it asks.  However, it is an essential read, though  I wonder if anyone who has not lived long-term outside their own culture can truly appreciate it.  It's easy to be a  white liberal at home, wrapped in one's own smug assurance and safe within the majority. (And I'm speaking of myself here).  Surrounded by  20 million Arabs, Malan's own journeys into Soweto strike far too close to one's heart.<p>On only the most superficial level is this a book about South African Apartheid.  It is also about  Israelis and Palestinians,  Hindus and Muslims,  Northern Irish and the English,  the US and its every victim.</span>

                    <span>It seems that everyone has an opinion about Africa and all those opinions exist somewhere on a single sliding scale.  At one end is the idea that all of that continent's problems are the result of some kind of post-colonial hangover and that if it hadn't been for the Europeans, Africa would be a wealthy, progressive Utopia.  On the other extreme, is the opinion that the African culture has evolved in such a way as to virtually preclude `successful' statehood.  Critics of this book tend to dislike it based on their position on that scale relative to the author's (somewhere in the middle, by the way.)  Also, they sometimes use dubious facts and theories to back up their positions (e.g. Malan does indeed discuss the Afrikaner disinformation campaign designed to turn tribes/political movements against each other, and trying to determine what ethnic groups have `first settler' rights to a given piece of dirt is virtually impossible.)<p>But all this is completely irrelevant.  As is clearly stated in the extended title, this is the story of one man's journey though his own past and conscience.  On this level, it is a triumph.  It is the only book I have ever read that doesn't seem to include a single divisive word.  Whether you agree with Malan's observations or not, I think it is clear that he agonized over and believed deeply in every one.  Additionally, the book is beautifully written on almost every level: smooth, engaging prose, balanced structure, and unfailing pace.  It is almost impossible for the reader not be affected in one way or another.<p>It has been asked whether this book is still relevant in light of the fall of Apartheid and the progression of S.A. in the years since its publication.  Certainly, as a wonderfully crafted look into one individual's soul and his struggle to find his place in the world, it is.  <p>But has it become outdated politically, as has been suggested?  I wonder.  At the writing of this review, Zimbabwe is trying hard to destroy itself in a misguided effort to deal with its colonial past.  Unfortunately, My Traitor's Heart may have some life in it yet...</span>

                    <span>A refreshing account of history as told by a man examining his own fears and passions.  The use of story-telling, factual events, and mythical accounts gives the reader the opportunity to think critically about the atrocities of South Africa and learn from the experience of a man you have never met but who so courageously invites us into his most private thoughts.  This book reads as though this descendant of the father of apartheid is talking to you and inviting you to share your thoughts with him as well.  <p>As a reporter and "white African" Malan is trying to resolve for himself and his fellow countrymen the issue of race.  Malan talks about a war that has been going on since the earliest Dutch settlers claimed parts of Africa as their own and helps us to understand the atrocity through accounts of murders and a detailed history of the events surrounding them.  Through his journey Malan begins to form an understanding he did not expect and find hereos in unexpected places.<br>  <p>This is an excellent read for those who are looking for a good background of the history of South Africa and a general understanding of the society today.</span>
