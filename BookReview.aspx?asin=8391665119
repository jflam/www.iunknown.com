                    <span>First - I like the book and I think anyone wishing to get a better grasp on OpenBSD administration should have it, and should have Absolute OpenBSD and Secure Architectures with OpenBSD as well.<BR>The portions directly about building firewalls and about configuring pf are great, but the book suffers from its attempt to be all things to all people. Chapter 2 is a truncated version of something from "Building Internet Firewalls" by Zwicky, et. al. Chapter 3 and most of Chapter 4 could have been left to a more general administration guide. The rest is dynamite. There is in-depth coverage of NAT, CBQ and bandwidth shaping, and authpf. If you are building a firewall of any complexity, this book is a must have.</span>

                    <span>Indispensable book for building invisible firewalls (bridges), packet filtering, NAT and routing devices. Rock solid guide! Includes the basics for beginners such as hardening the OS, (though with OpenBSD it's a short list) and avoiding gateway IP configuration mistakes. Saved me DAYS scouring the manual pages or web. Covers advanced topics such as firewall/network designs, packet filtering, allowing FTP, patching, secure levels, creating maintenance users, anti-spoofing, automated firewalls, bandwidth shaping and load balancing, logging and analysis, authpf, firewall testing and management AND did I mention using spamd to filter spam? Obviously this book has not had any bench time in my office. Simply the best way to get up and running on OpenBSD networking. Note, you can support OpenBSD and still purchase from Amazon by going through the link: http://www.openbsd.org/books.html</span>

                    <span>this is a great book for anyone interested in a free, functional firewall. PF is an awesome firewall, OpenBSD a rock solid platform. If you want to make the most of pf on obsd, you are going to want this book. A brief introduction to installation of obsd, then onward to configuring packet forwarding & filtering. Alot of shortcuts exist that can save you time. Queueing is discussed and working examples of pf.conf files are in the back of the book. A DEFINTE 'must have'.</span>

                    <span>Well - I teach firewalling for the Social European Fund courses, and I decided that, for a lot of reason, PF was the ultimate firewall to teach.<P>This book is the one i chose to suggest to my students: the subject is analized in depth, clearly and with practical examples that help the reader.<P>It's a must have, as long as you want to use PF for firewalling.</span>

                    <span>Jacek Artymiak is well known in the community for his series of excellent online articles about pf and OpenBSD security in general.<P>This book is, simply, the best and most comprehensive source of information about pf. Whether you are just considering using pf or are already an experienced user, this book is a great introduction, tutorial and reference. I enjoyed reading it very much.<P>The second edition covers all the new features introduced with OpenBSD 3.4.</span>
