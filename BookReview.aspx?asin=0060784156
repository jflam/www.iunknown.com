                    <span>1) The beginning of this book is so boring I wanted to scratch my eyes out
<br />
<br />2) It gets better though.  Dick presents the good things that Clinton did so well that I actually came away with a more positive impression of Clinton that I had going in.
<br />
<br />3) Dick presents the negatives, and they are not few in number.  However, they are equally funny and tragic.  Funny because I am not a Clinton fan.  Tragic because of the missed opportunities and wasted time for both him and our country.
<br />
<br />4) Even though I don't like what Clinton stood for, I came away with more sympathy for the man.  I also feel like such a charismatic man could have done more with his time in office.</span>

                    <span>The author's own history shows he does not have the most stellar character. But he is undoubtedly an articulate, intelligent person with a gift for clarity and insight. One of the strengths of the book is Morris' explaining clearly some things that were inherently confusing, or that were made confusing by the Clintons' own smokescreens. Morris concisely explaining what WhiteWatergate was all about is a big plus. I  don't agree with everything in the book. To call Clinton's ability to read others' emotions "empathy" is very much mis-labeling. As has been pointed by Christopher Hitchens--among others--Clinton is possibly a sociopath. Sociopaths can READ peoples' emotions but they can't FEEL them. Empathy requires feeling others' emotions. Sociopaths coldly READ others emotions, and use that ability to manipulate others. Which is exactly what Clinton did. So Morris mis-labeling Clinton as "empathetic" is a glaring flaw in this book (because he does so over many pages). But the rest of the book is very insightful and interesting, and taught me a lot.</span>

                    <span>The book is a good description of the saga of Bill Clinton.  It describes the manner in which Clinton views the world, from his own narcisisstic perspective.  If I had any remaining reservations in my personal perspective of Bill Clinton, they are gone.  Dick Morris confirmed my thoughts.</span>

                    <span>I hate to start a book and not finish it, no matter how bad it is.  After taking a quick glance at this book, I was expecting a, dare I say it, fair and balanced analysis of the Clinton administration and an intelligent discussion of its many facets (both good and bad) and the events that took placed during its eight year reign from someone who was clearly in the know.
<br />Unfortunately, what I found was a shameless piece of self-promotion and unmistakeable Monday morning quarterbacking.
<br />From the very beginning, this book screams of the writer's supreme sense of self-importance.  His hindsight analysis of the entire tenure of the Clinton administration is unbelievably convenient and self-serving.
<br />Don't waste your time or money.  It isn't even interesting.  It's just bad. </span>
