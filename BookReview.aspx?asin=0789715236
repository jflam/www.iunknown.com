                    <span>This book is intended for the intermediate/advanced database user. If you are a begineer with database concepts, pass this one up. I have about 1 year of Access programming and this book is exactly what I need to get up to speed with SQL 7. What I like about this book is that it spends a lot of time with the Transact-SQL admin commands, as opposed to just listing the "point and click" method.</span>

                    <span>Like all other books from this series ("Special Edition. Using...") which I have seen, this book covers a wide range of material on the subject but is a bit shallow. Nevertheless it is useful for both database administrators and developers. The explanation is quite clear and comprehensive, though I think sometimes more examples would be helpful.<P>The author obviously assumes that readers already have some experience with databases, most probably with previous versions of MS SQL server. If you don't have any database experience at all (not necessarily with MS SQL) you may have problems because the author doesn't explain in details the general principles of relational databases but just shows how they are implemented in MS SQL 7.0.<P>In my opinion if you are not scared by what I said above you will find this book useful.</span>

                    <span>To the person who gave this book one star: This book does what it is supposed to do and does it well. It is a well written 700 page book that builds a foundation. If you want a 2000-3000 page book that answers every detail of every question use Books-on-line. I've passed a number of tests from Microsoft. I am using this book to give me an easy to understand 700 page overview then I will use a test study guide to reenforce what I have learned. Everyone says you need three sources to pass this test. A book like this, a study guide, and extensive use of Books-on-line. Experience also helps. It is supposed to be one of Microsofts hardest tests.</span>

                    <span>I have to agree with the previous reviewer and state that this is, in fact, the best SQL Server 7.0 book currently on the market. Unfortunately, this is mostly due to the even poorer quality of its competitors. While the discussion of features that already existed in 6.5 is quite exhaustive, the coverage of 7.0 improvements and innovations (believe me, there are many) is superficial and leaves you with too many unanswered questions.<P>If you are completely new to SQL Server, this book may be the most adequate choice, but its claim to be for intermediate to advanced users is overstated.<P>MCSE/MCDBA candidates: I know you are desperately waiting for study materials to pass the 7.0 exams, but this isn't it, either.</span>

                    <span>I had to start studying for the SQL Server 7.0 exam and needed some reference material while waiting for MS's training kits to come out. I bought this with a little trepidation - but once i got it home i'm glad i did!! Excellent book - very concise and thorough. And the fact it includes the software makes it even better (if that's possible)...don't hesitate like i did!! Go for it!!</span>
