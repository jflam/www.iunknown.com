Here she offers an adventure-soaked tale of her own, complete with danger, humor, and characters so colorful they seem to have been ripped from the pages of Moby Dick.  <P>  "A beautiful book...a story of triumph, of a woman not only making it but succeeding at the highest level in one of the most male-dominated and most dangerous professions." -- Douglas Whynott, <P>The New York Times Book Review <P> "An authentic, insightful account of the intensity of captaining a crew of strong men in an ocean which does what it wants." -- Daniel Hays, co-author of My Old Man and the Sea <P> "A crystal-clear account of fishing the Grand Banks in a modern swordfish boat. Greenlaw is an excellent captainand an excellent writer." -- John Casey, author of Spartina <P></span>

                    <span>First and foremost, I enjoyed reading this book and read it very quickly. But, it should be said, this is NOT a sequel to the Perfect Storm (as marketing hype might lead you to believe). Simply put, the scope and pace of Perfect Storm is far broader and more riveting. Also, only a fraction of Hungry Ocean deals with descriptions of cataclysmic seas, so if that is soley what you're after, you're better off sticking to Perfect Storm or Serpent's Coil. Linda Greenlaw mentions the Perfect Storm from time to time, but occasionally these references seem a little forced, as if her editors were compelling here to talk more about that tragedy.<P>Nevertheless, Hungry Ocean is enjoyable because it painstakingly reveals the daily workings and concerns of a swordfishing expedition. In this respect, Hungry Ocean serves as a valuable (and more credible) companion to the Perfect Storm. I found the author had a good knack for describing the intracies of swordfishing, and her narrative skills are praiseworthy.<P>Hungry Ocean is very much like a documentary, while Perfect Storm is really an epic tale. Nevertheless, if you enjoy fishing, Hungry Ocean is a must read. If you've ever wondered how that swordfish steak ends up at fishmarket or restaurant, this book is very illuminating. I wish there were more books like it.</span>

                    <span>There are few stories better than this.<P>"In my experience, very few men are willing to pull their own teeth," Greenlaw writes near the end of the book. She's not bragging or complaining, simply stating a fact that by then is very obvious and logical. Deep sea fishing isn't easy, it's one of the toughest and most hazardous jobs available; but she has a love for it, and this book is her tribute to a way of life that is beyond the experience of most 9 to 5 wage slaves.<P>Read this book, and you'll understand why there's nothing smart women can't accomplish. It's not a whine and moan session about women's rights or affirmative action; it's simply a superb account about how a talented and dedicated person can find success in anything they set out to do, based on talent, energy and dedication. <P>"Alden once told me that his father, also a fisherman, told him that anyone who chooses to make fishing his occupation solely for the money is in the wrong business. If no thrill is experienced in catching fish, no satisfaction in going to sea and returning to shore, no pride in exclaiming 'I am a fisherman,' then a life on the water will be unfulfilling, perhaps even unbearable," Greenlaw writes. Her book is a wonderful story of why this is true.<P>It's true for any job. If you don't like your work, then half or more of your life is misery. Greenlaw vividly explains why long-line fishermen will work 20-hour days for two or more weeks, spending a month at sea for every two days in port. It's insanity, pure and simple and wonderful; by the end of this book, every reader will wish they shared some of the same madness.<P>She's a superb writer. This isn't simply about catching some fish; she writes about fishing with the same articulate skill as Patrick O'Brian does in his masterful stories of life under sail in the Napoleonic era. Greenlaw writes with humor, heartbreak and heroics; she even manages, in describing a month at sea when many other boats were catching few fish, to instill a palpable sense of suspense as to whether or not she and her crew will have a "slammer" of a trip or come home with nothing to show for a month's risk, work, pain and hardship. <P>She's tough. As she admits, "Making unpopular decisions is part of being the captain." It's a habit modern managers should learn, instead of indulging their childish desires to be pals instead of professional. Greenlaw could handle any executive position in business, because she places more importance on integrity which generates personal and professional respect instead of feel-good excuses, slipshod results and indifferent quality. <P>She's also kind and considerate, with a wonderful sense of humour. It's a superb book, some of the best writing I've read in years. Every reader will share the delight of people who love their work, and are good at it, plus an author who presents a fascinating accountg of what is otherwise an almost invisible career.<P>Buy it. Read it. Perhaps, if there is any sense of quality left in Hollywood, someone will realize it has the content, quality and story line to make a superb film. After all, one of O'Brian's books is due out as a movie in late 2003, and the film of 'The Perfect Storm' about the loss of the Andrea Gail was released some time ago. <P>Greenlaw weathered the same storm as the Andrea Gail, some 400 miles distant, then helped search for survivors. Her story is more impressive because she is real, she succeeds and she understands the pride that leads men to face such risks.<P>Buy it. This is one of the most impressive books you'll ever read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book isn't life-changing or even inspirational--in a good way. I was hesitant initially because I thought the book might work a 'girl-power' angle as Greenlaw is one of, if not the only, female swordfish captains in the world. Instead, it does a fantastic job of describing a world most of us will never know--the inner workings of a fisherman's (woman's) life: the politics involved in pleasing a demanding boat owner and restless crew, the tedious waiting game where instincts and electronics seek the elusive fish many days away from shore, and the excitment of the non-stop work when the fishing is good. It even gives an account of the finances involved including a breakdown of the market price of fish and how it affects everyone's pay. I had no idea of the immense costs each fishing trip takes in equipment, food, and gas. It is a great look at the day-to-day life. Where it falls short is addressing some grander issues such as the environment and the history and future of fishing. Greenlaw does have a few sentences sprinkled throughout and it's clear that from her viewpoint that the environment hoopla about overfishing is overblown and while these statements do make the reader long for more knowledge on the topic, I guess the authenticity of the book is that we get the raw one-sided opinion of a true fisherman (woman) and not some policy wonk. A very good read.</span>

                    <span>Longline fishing remains a controversial subject. The author touches on slightly the issue of over fishing but simply states that the USA has the best managed fishing regulations in the world and it's all those pesky foreigners that cause the problems. The issue of longline fishing itself and the havoc it causes to sea life not associated with the catch is not addressed in the book. Ms Greenlaw, however gives a very well written and detailed and fascinating exposition of the organisation, equipment, and techniques that go into a single voyage which she peppers with individual anecdotes of incidents at sea. But, it is also an exemplary study of leadership and those who fly our planes, drive our buses and trucks, steer our ferries, or manage work sites of any kind might read this book and see how they measure up. As my idea of a sea adventure is to catch the Manly Ferry from Manly to Circular Quay, across Sydney Harbour Australia, THE HUNGRY OCEAN also gives a real feel of the beauty and power of that beast.</span>
