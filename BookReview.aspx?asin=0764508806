                    <span>Since long time ago I was interested in making a fist approach to Oracle DB. The first information I collected through the internet was confusing and difficult. Thanks to Carol's excellent book I got finally on my way. It covers all what you need to know, starting from the very basic. All was carefully explained in easy language that everybody can understand. I do really recommend this book for anybody whishing to get a hands-on guide to Oracle 9i. It takes the myth out of Oracle DB and makes you feel that it is possible to understand and use the main futures of this software.  The only thing I should add is a step by step chapter on how to correctly install the oracle software and the most common mistakes to avoid during this process. Very often people who read this book are also installing for the first time the software. As a nice plus, Carol does answer emails that are directed to her. </span>

                    <span>I am new to Oracle. This book really helped me understand everything that I needed to know to get started using Oracle 9i quicker and easier than on-line instruction that I had tried or other books. Don't think that this book will help with the Oracle SQL certification since the coverage on SQL is very brief, but it will help you get get started actually using 9i very quickly.</span>

                    <span>If you are new to Oracle, or are making a transition to Oracle, then this is the book you want to have.  Its simple and yet at the same time touches on a whole lot of Oracle concepts that one actually needs to know to start of with.  You will actually be doing a whole lot of Oracle after going thru this book, which I consider an excellent enterance into the world of Oracle.  <p>A must buy for all who wish to get into Oracle.</span>

                    <span>I am a big fan of Dummies guides because I feel that most technical books start you at the middle and take you to the end rather than starting you at the beginning. This book was a little disappointing compared to other Dummies books. My major complaint is that the author consistently points out what tools are available and where they are located but rarely has information on how or why you would use them. For a Dummies guide it is a little advanced in some areas and spends a lot of paper on topics that a person interested in upgrading to Oracle would already know. For instance there is a whole lot of material on SQL and the relational model but not much on how to administer a database for multiple users. Presumably if you are starting to use Oracle you already know a fair amount about SQL and constraints but need information on how to administer the database. In its defense however, it does give a broad overview of what tools and services are available in 9i and is not a bad place to start.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for a book on the Oracle data base management system that covers a broad enough scope, has enough details to be useful, and does not get bogged down in too much detail, then this book is an excellent choice.  The author approachs Oracle 9i as though you had just installed the desktop version on your PC.  Therefore, you are BOTH administrator AND user, and you need to make this thing work for you. From that starting point, the book details (with a nice sense of humor) what you need to know, and also exactly DO, to put Oracle 9i to work, including use of the Object-Oriented extensions.  Topics range from startup to shutdown, with backup and performance tuning in between.  Also coming along for free, so to speak, are introductions to Java and XML, that you can probably save for the future when you may need to know more about them.  In summary, this book will get you up-to-speed on using Oracle with minimum hassle.  And the price is much better here than in Paris, where I saw it displayed for...</span>
