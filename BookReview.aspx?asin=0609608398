                <span id="Label1">Ram Charan learned about business from his family's shoe shop in India before attending Harvard Business School and going on to advise senior executives in companies large and small. His experiences taught him that universal laws apply "whether you sell fruit from a stand or are running a Fortune 500 company," and that the business acumen that comes from understanding these basics can be applied throughout any operation. <I>What the CEO Wants You to Know</I> is Charan's primer on this point, which he illustrates with explanations filtered through the eyes of street venders and other small shopkeepers. One, for example, involves a woman in Managua, Nicaragua, who sells clothing from a small cart and beats the oppressive interest rates on her loans and the puny profit margins on her goods with a skillfully selected inventory that is quickly and repeatedly turned over. Whether it's a corner merchant or a giant manufacturing concern, Charan notes, "the faster the velocity, the higher the return." Relating such thinking to cash generation, customer satisfaction, and other essentials, he describes the universal principles that help all companies make money. "What your CEO wants you to know is how these fundamentals of business work in your company," he writes before embarking on a very lucid explanation that can be quickly absorbed and put into practice. --<I>Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>It was my curiosity (about the author) that took me to reading this book. The book was an easy read, especially because of Ram's writing style.
<br />
<br />Professionally I saw myself and my career when I went through the pages. How much we know about the 'total business' of the company when one grow vertical.
<br />
<br />The best I liked is Chapter III, getting things done. How and what a CEO. Perhaps I would find them handy one day!</span>

                    <span>I read this book in one sitting, which most of you who read this book will. Being a MBA graduate who has drudged through several business courses and books, I was glad to see something that puts it all in a really simple perspective.
<br />
<br />The top things I took from this book are:
<br />1. Cash Flow, ROA = M*V, Growth are fundamental to every business
<br />2. Business vs. People - you need others to get the job done, even if you are a street vendor
<br />3. The letters from the CEO to the VPs were very educational - the best part of my education from this book. I am looking for other published "letters from the CEO" - and I am talking not to all employees (like the ones by Dick Brown, I was one of the employees who felt no extra connection from his emails!), but pointed letters saying what needs to be done like the ones from the book.

                    <span>It is humbling. After B-School and hundreds of business books, it took these 150 or so pages of text lay explain why I spent time learning finance and accounting, marketing, communications and leadership: To build my business acumen. And Mr. Charan makes it clear that business acumen drives all businesses, be they apple carts or multi-nationals.  
<br />
<br />How simple is Charan's exposition on building business acumen?
<br />-Finance and operations management are boiled down to one equation (R=M*V). As basic as it gets. 
<br />-And marketing gets covered just as simply: "Do they like my fruit? If customers cleared me out of bananas but I have apples left, should I abandon apples and specialize in bananas?" 
<br />- Leadership is getting people to focus on the important drivers of wealth generation: cash, velocity, and margins. The best leaders cut through the complexity of their businesses, and get their employees entirely focused on these fundamentals. 
<br />
<br />But do not be fooled by the brevity. This book is actually quite rigorous. Of course, you will still need spreadsheets and inventory management software and SAS to mine data in this increasingly complex world. Charan does not deny this, but cuts through the complexity so you can see how it all fits together. And that is business acumen, the knowledge and understanding of which will enrich any job you do.

                    <span>This book is a great little introduction to REAL economics- not the useless junk most often taught in schools- but the real economics that makes the world go-round.  This book briefly tries to explain why it is important that everyone in a company understand this, but falls a little short.  For more detail on this aspect, I strongly recommend the classic "Open-Book Management" By John Case.<p>This book will also help you understand financial statements, particularly income statements.  This comes in handy when looking at your company's public competitors or for analyzing investments.</span>
