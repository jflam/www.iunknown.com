                <span id="Label1">For anyone who programs in Python, David M. Beazley's <I>Python Essential Reference, Second Edition</I> will serve as a capable and exceptionally competent guide to current Python syntax and library modules. Concise, yet authoritative, this book sets a high standard as a one-volume reference to this powerful object-oriented programming language.<p>   Although the author claims that this title is not really a tutorial, the first 100 pages actually provide an excellent guide to the basics of Python as a language. Geared especially to the experienced programmer seeking to see what's different (and potentially better) about Python, sections on the language itself will let you ramp up on the basic and advanced topics. Short sections with code excerpts that show off essential language features will help you learn or enhance your knowledge of Python quickly. Standout sections here include excellent coverage of object-oriented features, like "special methods" that will let you add custom classes to Python that are just as flexible as built-in classes.<p>   The heart of this book is the 250-page reference section. The author concentrates on all current Python modules (eschewing deprecated or obsolete APIs). Starting with basic modules for Python services and operating system functions, and including handling strings and math functions, the author explains and illustrates each module with short sample code, along with a full listing of APIs. Sections on Python's impressive support for virtually all networking protocols (including sockets, HTTP, FTP, and e-mail) are a standout and will arguably justify the cost of this title for many Python developers. Later modules look at undocumented functions, plus there's an in-depth guide to integrating Python and C code. (This material can even help you build custom Python modules.) <p>   With a remarkably clear presentation style, this well-organized reference offers a compact and worthy guide to today's Python that's sure to meet the needs of many working programmers. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>   <B>Topics covered:</B>  <ul> <li>Reference (and expert-level tutorial) for Python 2.1  <li>Quick overview of Python essentials (including basic syntax, reserved words, and operators)  <li>Types and objects (including built-in types, modules, classes, and special methods)  <li>Operators and expressions (operations on numbers, sequences and dictionaries, type conversion, conditionals and loops)  <li>Control flow  <li>Functions and functional programming idioms  <li>Classes and object-oriented programming tips  <li>Modules and packages  <li>Input and output (including files and persistence)  <li>The Python execution environment  <li>Python library reference  <li>Python services (including garbage collection and "pickling")  <li>Mathematical functions  <li>Strings  <li>Data management and object persistence APIs  <li>Operating system services (including Mac OS and Windows-specific functions)  <li>Python threads  <li>Network programming (including HTTP, FTP, NNTP, and other Web protocols, socket programming, retrieving URLs)  <li>Internet data handling and encoding (including mail attachment and MIME support)  <li>Restricted execution and security modules  <li>Undocumented modules  <li>Extending and embedding Python and C  <li>Summary of changes between Python 1.6, 2.0, and 2.1  </ul></span>

                    <span>This is an excellant book for the person who is acquainted with Python but needs to look up details or, especially, for someone with a good background in programming languages who wants to learn Python. Expertise in a single programming language isn't necessarily enough background - familiarity with different types of programming language and in particular with object-oriented programming is necessary.
<br />
<br />This book packs a great deal of information into a compact format. It contains numerous tables and charts, attractively laid out and well organized. The author's explanations are lucid. It contains sufficient detail to be useful as a reference manual, but also provides an introduction to and overview of each topic. If you already know Python well and just need to look up details, and you always have access to the on-line reference manuals, you don't need this book. For anyone else, it is extremely useful.
<br />
<br />As an experienced programmer, I found the O'Reilly introductory book "Learning Python" rather slow going. This book was just right for learning Python and continues to be useful as a reference. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I always have it within easy reach whenever I work with Python. It is not a tutorial like "The Python Visual QuickStart Guide", and not a book about solving specific problems in Python, like "The Python Cookbook".  The value of the book derives from the fact that it is a relatively small book that nevertheless manages to be a comprehensive guide to Python.  Some of my co-workers prefer to use the voluminous "Python: The Complete Reference", as their Python manual, but I just don't have time to read such a big book.</span>

                    <span>David has done a great job condensing the need-to-known Python language material down into the first hundred pages of the book. The code examples are great, there are no graphics, and there are plenty of well-formatted tables for operators, methods, and the rest.<p>The second half of the book is Appendix A, which covers the Python's standard library. I think it's odd that an entire section of 200+ pages is considered an appendix, but that is only a minor flaw.<p>The reason that I give the book only four stars and not five is that Appendix A could use some more of the clever formatting applied to the first part of the book to make it more accessible. The information is all there, but it could be formatted a little better. O'Reilly does a great job with that sort of thing.<p>Overall, this is a great handy reference for Python. Far better than the online documentation. If you are an occasional Python programmer, like me, you will find this book a great resource because you can get a quick refresher whenever you need it.</span>

                    <span>This is not a book for learning python, but once you know enough to write useful scripts, it's an excellent reference to keep near your hand as you write code.  Deserves the five stars!<p>There is a tutorial introduction plus an intermediate-level description of core language features, about 100 pages long, which is useful to read for an alternate perspective into the structure of the language.  The library reference section (bulk of the book, Appendix A) is well-organized and very usable.<p>Unfortunately for the utility of this book, the online documentation at the python webpage happens to be of excellent quality.  Also, there is at least one other book (Python in a Nutshell, by Alex Martelli) that covers similar ground (tutorial + reference).  This makes the "Essential Reference" not quite essential: it can be replaced by browser windows pointing to the python webpage, or by other books.<p>I have a bit of non-conventional advice: it seems to me that the casual programmer can make do with an earlier (cheaper :-) edition of the book.  Most of the features of the language have been around since python 1.5.2, covered in the first edition.  If you actually need to use features added later (e.g., list comprehensions, borrowed from Haskell), you can easily learn them from online sources.  In any case, as far as advanced features are concerned, the latest edition is likely also to be soon outdated.</span>

                    <span>This is by no means a good book to do anything with. The book provides incomplete examples in the 70-something pages and then provides the rest of the book as appendices. The explanations aren't great, either... I was really disappointed with this book. Buy a better one.</span>
