                    <span>In "Iron Horse", Ray Robinson gives the reader an introduction to the Lou Gehrig persona.  More than a list of records and triumphs of the baseball star, we meet the human being behind the records.  I always had the impression that Gehrig was a good man, whereas Babe Ruth was only a good baseball player.  This book confirms that impression.
<br />
<br />Growing up the son of German immigrants, Gehrig had the disadvantage of being something of an outsider in his own world.  Baseball was just one avenue he traveled in his efforts to advance himself.  Various jobs and Columbia University were other options pursued by Lou.  His parents discouraged him from playing a game which they did not understand.  When Lou had to choose between Columbia University and baseball, his parents urged the University, while a professor recommended baseball.  Going to work every day was not extraordinary for Lou.  That was how his parents raised him.
<br />
<br />In his chosen trade, Lou achieved excellence and attention wherever he played.  Lou lived the thrill of playing baseball, and as a Yankee to boot!  Lou always considered himself the luckiest man alive, even as he lived in the shadow of two giants, Babe Ruth at the start of his career, and Joe DiMaggio toward the end.  Through it all, Lou considered himself a lucky man.
<br />
<br />Robinson leads the reader through a character study of his boyhood hero.  We see Lou's relationships with his loving parents who could never understand the stage on which he strode.  His wife, who gave him joy while suffering his mother's resentment, would be his solace in his illness.  His relationships with his team mates, particularly Babe Ruth, get much attention.  In this book we see Gehrig as a man not only driven by passions and wants, but guided by a sense of right and wrong.  He was the moral compass of the Yankees.  This trait prevented him from ever being the close friend of Ruth with whom he is so commonly associated in the public mind.
<br />
<br />Driven, perhaps, by contemporary interests, Lou's earnings are frequently reported.  We are brought to understand that even a star of Gehrig's luminance earned a large salary, but still needed to work when he retired.  Lou found post baseball employment in a department of the city in which he grew up, achieved stardom and gradually deteriorated and died.
<br />
<br />The illness of the only patient to give his name to a disease forms much of the latter sections of the book.  Robinson tries to give an accurate report of how the disease affected Lou without over exaggerating its effects.  We travel with Lou throughout his slump, ending of the streak and his gradual deterioration.  At the end we have seen all 37 years of his remarkable and admirable life.
<br />
<br />Although the reader is introduced to the persona of Lou Gehrig, there is plenty of baseball too.  This is an excellent book for any baseball fan with a desire to into the soul of one of baseball's most noble knights.</span>

                    <span>"Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig in His Time" by Ray Robinson is a true gem, and a masterfully written book that should be forever recognized in the annals on baseball research. This book is a tribute and biography of one of baseball's greatest, and least talked about star - Lou Gehrig. While a Yankee, Gehrig was over-shawdowed by the flamboyant Babe Ruth for the most part, and any accomplishment Gehrig took part in, Babe Ruth was still more recognized. <br>   Gehrig was a quiet, peaceful man who truly cared about fans. He was very interested in the game and loved playing baseball and really examined the mechanics of it. Hopefully Gehrig will be more memorialized not only in the Hall of Fame, but in the hearts of baseball fans everywhere. His courage triumphed his disease.</span>

                    <span>Iron Horse is beautiful tribute to one of the best loved Yankees.  Robinson tells the story of Lou Gehrig a simple man who due to circumstances that are beyond his control has an incurable disease.<p>He covers Gehrig's early years from the time he was born.  We see his greatness as if we are there ourselves.  And we learn the painful truth that sometimes life is cruel to even the young people around us.  Lou set examples in leadership and of course in courage and anyone who reads this I hope will feel the same.</span>

                    <span>Like most of his other titles, Robinson's biography of Lou Gehrig is a book best not judged by its cover.  At first blush and on a brief perusal, it looks like a handsome, serious, thoughtful biography.  But upon reading it is mostly hackneyed filler and exhibits no true scholarship.  Instead of really telling you anything of importance about Gehrig, you get colorless run-downs of his seasons and a hodge-podge of information primarily culled from other books.  That's not entirely bad and not without some merit, for the definitive Gehrig book has yet to be written and this will have to do for now, but it does his subject a disservice.  There is also virtually no discussion of the surrounding historical and social context indicated by the title. Gehrig deserved better.  Kids may enjoy this, but if you are looking for something substantial, pass.</span>

                    <span>Even though I am a Cubs fan, my favorite baseball player is Lou Gehrig. This book has a lot of baseball information that My Luke and I did not have.  <p>If you want to read about Gehrigs baseball career this is a great  book to read.  I suggest if you really want to read about Gehrig get a copy  of My Luke and I By Elenor Gehrig even if it is out of print.</span>
