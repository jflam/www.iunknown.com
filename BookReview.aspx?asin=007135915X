                    <span>It seems safe to say that the goal of any responsible person in a position of authority, whether that person is a parent, teacher, therapist, or business manager, is to see others be successful, productive, and satisfied with whatever they do. For most people, however, there is a big question mark as to just how we can accomplish these goals. 
<br />
<br />Other People's Habits provides some of the clearest examples describing how the principles of behavior analysis can be used to achieve these goals for the benefit of everyone. Daniels does a wonderful job differentiating between recognition, reward, and reinforcement, and how each process is likely to affect the actions of another. His Do's and Don'ts for implementing positive reinforcement successfully are extremely clear and helpful (along with having a great deal of empirical support in the research literature, unlike the majority of procedures described in many pop psychology books). Daniels also describes in detail how most individuals who claim to be using behavior analytic principles are, in fact, often misusing these principles with disastrous results. Rather than turning people into disgruntled non-productive individuals, as author Alfie Kohn likes to suggest in his book Punished By Rewards, positive reinforcement is a very effective process to help each person achieve a productive and meaningful life, when used properly. 
<br />
<br />Readers who are parents may also wish to look at another book, The Power of Positive Parenting by Latham, for the successful application of behavior analytic principles with children. Scholars who are interested in the intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation debate and how it has played out in the research literature may also wish to pick up a copy of Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: Resolving the Controversy by Cameron and Pierce.

                    <span>This is an exceptionally well-organized and clear book. Superficially, it might seem like "only" a suggestion to compliment others more often. However, what distinguishes it from self-help books that emphasize willpower and attitude is the reliance on the teachings of B.F.Skinner's radical behaviorism. <p>This is one of the best and few books on applying behaviorism to everyday living that I've aware of. You can read Skinner (e.g. "Science and Human Behavior" or his 3-part autobiography) to understand the scientific foundation of his approach and to get a few ideas how you can manage yourself better, but I have found it difficult to work out just how to apply the lessons of behaviorism in daily life. Advancements have been made in applications to such areas as autism and to education, but these require highly trained behavior analysts.<p>What Daniels has done is work out and carefully explain a straight-forward way in which anyone can apply behaviorism. His advice seems entirely consistent with Skinner, including the avoidance of punishment. Key basics of behaviorism are made simple by Daniels, who has the clearest explanation of the key behaviorist term "contingency" that I've found.   <p>If he didn't so carefully explain how he arrives at this advice, it might seem simplistic. Just compliment? But significantly more than that, for he identifies a number of rules that must hold to effectively positive reinforce others. And because it doesn't require too many rules, it seems quite manageable. I haven't tried it much yet, but I mean to start doing so soon. I hope to succeed because I'll have the scientific power of behaviorism, the laws of nature and the apparent wisdom of Daniels supporting me and keeping it simple.</span>

                    <span>I don't see why anyone should settle for second best.  I read anything and everything on how to be my best and bring out the best in others.  I really like the author's perspective of confronting  habits.  So much of our activity is automatic, based on old coping mechanisms. <p>This author recognizes that we do have the power to help others be their best and that self-limiting habits need to be conquered.  The reader is given a series of steps to take to overcome these habits.  Try them!</span>

                    <span>What a refreshing book! It's not pop psychology, but a book that actually tells you the steps in how to change your behavior and other people's behavior for the better. This scientifically based book is written in layman's terms. Applying the principles of this book DO produce results. There are no secrets, no mystries, but proven scientific information simple for anyone to understand. Our behaviors happen because of consequences, not the other way around. These concepts are taught at University level courses and can be proven. Try something that is proven rather than pop psychology! This book is well worth it!</span>
