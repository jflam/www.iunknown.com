                <span id="Label1"><I>A Love Supreme</I> is a suite about redemption, a work of pure spirit and song, that encapsulates all the struggles and aspirations of the 1960s. Following hard on the heels of the lyrical, swinging <I>Crescent</I>, <I>A Love Supreme</I> heralded Coltrane's search for spiritual and musical freedom, as expressed through polyrhythms, modalities, and purely vertical forms that seemed strange to some jazz purists, but which captivated more adventurous listeners (and rock fellow travelers such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream, and the Byrds), while initiating a series of volatile, unruly prayer offerings, including <I>Kulu Su Mama</I>, <I>Ascension</I>, <I>Om</I>, <I>Meditations</I>, <I>Expression</I>, <I>Interstellar Space</I>. From the urgent speech-like timbre of his tenor, to the serpentine textures and earthy groove of Elvin Jones's drumming, Coltrane's suite proceeds with escalating intensity, conveying a hard-fought wisdom and a beckoning serenity in the prayer-like drones of "Psalm," where Jones rolls and rumbles like thunder as Garrison and Tyner toll away suggestively--all the while Coltrane searches for that one climactic note worthy of the love he wants to share.  <i>--Chip Stern</i></span>

                    <span>Not only does this set have wonderful remastered sound and the inclusion of the French performance to its name, as many reviewers have noted, but also studio takes of various movements played by an expanded ensemble, which are interesting bonuses. 
<br />
<br />Regarding the sound quality, let's begin with that of the main course, the original 1964 studio take of A Love Supreme. Balance is improved a little, and all the instruments sound fuller and truer. They've really polished a gem here, considering the original sound (as with any Impulse! recording) was good to begin with. Of course one couldn't expect any less with Blue Note's engineering maestro Rudy van Gelder at the helm. And as far as the sound of the live performance goes, the bass and piano sometimes get a little too far back for comfort, but even then they are still audible, so there is no real complaint about the recording quality of the live recording.
<br />
<br />As for the live performance's playing - some of this stuff is off the hook. Listen to Elvin Jones crash into a fury in the opening of Pursuance, and Jimmy Garrison's bass solo in the middle of the same movement. That bass solo in particular will rip the hair off your head. Garrison plays the lumbering instrument like a flamenco guitar: something I've never heard quite matched. And of course Coltrane and Tyner reach for the heights themselves, as always, though it is the achievements of Elvin and Garrison that are important here, as they were seldom if ever given this much solo time in the studio. 
<br />
<br />As I've said, there's nothing wrong with the studio bonus takes. Shepp and Co. handle the material well, and their contributions are an interesting view on a long-beloved masterwork.
<br />
<br />In short, if you are even remotely familiar with A Love Supreme and haven't clawed for a copy of this deluxe edition yet, your life is a shame.</span>

                    <span>Overstated my title? No, I don't think so. For me this album is up there with the Rite of Spring by Stravinski and Axis: Bold as Love by Hendrix to name just two disparate yet amazing musically defining masterpieces.  When I first heard A Love Supreme in the early '80s, I wasn't a jazz fan, this album turned me around. Coltrane's tonal explorations and melodic sense was unlike anything I'd ever heard before and sounded truly modern and unconventional. I was hooked. The sense of exploration and innovation were not limited to Coltrane alone. The classic quartet of McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones had been playing together for about 4 years by then and it shows. Their interplay is telepathic. That I'm a drummer also helped me appreciate to a great degree Elvin Jones mighty contributions to this album. He's a polyrhythmic master who never played better than when he was backing Coltrane. Pianist McCoy Tyner, whose style is instantly recognizable, is still playing today and a master in his own right. Jimmy Garrison isn't the flashiest bass player but he's rhythmically nimble and fit perfectly and subtly within the quartet. 
<br />
<br />Virtuosity aside, what truly hits me about this album is the emotion of the playing. This is one of the most emotionally moving albums I've ever heard, especially the first two compositions: Acknowledgement and Resolution. Tears come to my eyes; few albums affect me the way this one does. A Love Supreme perfectly illustrates Coltrane's then burgeoning spiritualiy.  The first three compositions are like an ecstatic religious experience put to music.  The album ends with the floating yet powerful Psalm that brings the listener gently back to earth.  A desert island disk for sure and a must have for any music lover. It's simply a defining moment in jazz, in music period. 
<br />
<br />This is the album that made me truly listen to and explore the musical world of jazz.  Without having listened to this album I might never have found out about the music of Charles Mingus, Ornette Colman, Duke Ellington, Art Pepper, Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis ect... Thanks John.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking to add a copy of "A Love Supreme" to your collection, buy this 2 CD Deluxe Edition. It features the original album, sourced from an original master tape from EMI's London vaults, in its entirety on disc 1. The sonic quality of the recording is as good as it is going to get, although there is a little bit of hiss that is discernable during the quieter bass parts (it must be that way on the original tape?). <p>The real treat, though, is disc 2. Luckily, the only live version of "A Love Supreme" was documented in Antibes in 1965. It would have been an unspeakable tragedy if that music had just disappeared into the air. The live version is presented here in its best sound ever, as it is an excellent analog transfer from the original mono tape made by French national radio. Coltrane and the rest of the group stretch out extensively in the live rendition, without losing the shape and contour of the suite as originally recorded. <p>There are even some outtakes of "Resolution" and "Acknowledgment" that miraculously have been preserved. Particularly noteworthy is the December 10 session that features Archie Shepp in the group. Coltrane recorded over some of the original tape, but the fascinating version of "Acknowledgment" with Shepp has been extracted and luckily is available for mankind to study and enjoy, even though there are a few dropouts. This is an amazing, historical moment that has been preserved. The outtakes are the jazz equivalent of the Dead Sea Scrolls. That in itself is a good reason to buy the 2 CD edition.</span>

                    <span>This is the BEST version EVER offered on cd to date. The original tape they used for other offerings was flawed not when recorded but in the transfer process. They found a near perfect copy in a vault in London and used it to make this awesome version of the Coltrane masterpiece. This is a definitive album for those just getting into jazz or for fans of Coltrane in general. It has it ALL slower jazz parts and fast and furious sax interludes etc. A MUST have for new and old fans.</span>
