                    <span>I used this text book in an Introduction to Management course in College.  I felt that the text did a great job explaining the different concepts and functions of management.  The examples made it easy to understand.  I also felt that the exhibits were very helpful and easy to understand.  The tables and diagrams were all easy to interrupt.  I also found the end of the chapter summaries very useful.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who has an interest in understanding the basic fundamentals of management.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very informative and helpful as an introductory management text. The order of the book was clear and precise with smooth transistions between concepts. I appreciated the use of relevent stories to follow the concepts and also the Ethical Dilemmas in Management. They forced me to apply the concepts being introduced so that I would really learn them. This is an excellent book to use and follow and will help any student who is taking an introductory management course to successfully learn the material.</span>

                    <span>I used this book in my Fundamentals of Management course at Harlaxton College. Of the two textbooks used for this class, I thought this one was much more useful. My favorite aspects were the definitions in the margins, the quizzes at the end of each chapter and the various exhibits throughout the chapters. I felt these learning tools made taking notes easier, let me see what exactly I did and did not know about the material and helped me better understand some of the more difficult concepts being taught. I also enjoyed the short "real world" managerial examples at the beginning of each chapter. I felt these stories helped me ease into the material I was about to read and give it a little more meaning in an outside the classroom situation. Overall, I found this textbook as helpful and informative.</span>

                    <span>I am currently enrolled in my first managment class at Harlaxton College.  In this class, we use the textbook Fundamentals of Management by Stephen Robbins and David Decenzo.  I have found this book to be very helpful for the first time management student.  This book is easy to read and has many helpful diagrams to illustrate the points that are being made.  I enjoy the real life stories at the beginning of the chapters and this helps me to relate what I learn in the classroom to what I will be experiencing in the real-world.  I also appreciate the definitions that are provided in the margins of the pages.  They help me to better understand the business jargon that is used throughout the book and this also allows me to retain more of the material.  When it comes time to study for the test, I turn to the end of the chapters where there are helpful summaries and comprehension questions.  I have learned alot from this book and I recommend it to anyone that is planning on going into a career in management.</span>
