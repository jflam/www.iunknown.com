                    <span>Do movie stars get into more trouble than mere mortals, or is there just something in the Hollywood air that sparks scandal? James Robert Parish offers gripping evidence of both in "The Hollywood Book of Scandals," which is his most involving and formidable book in years. Chronicling the sins of the glamorous (Lana Turner, Liz 'n' Dick, Winona Ryder, Rob Lowe) as well as those of the creepy (O.J. Simpson, Heidi Fleiss, Roman Polanski, Bob Crane), Parish selects 32 cases that are, as he writes, "representative, intriguing episodes of different types of scandals from among the many that have dotted Hollywood's long history." His choices offer a spicy smorgasbord. Parish -- who had background in both law and entertainment long before the two fields merged -- writes with authority and panache. Although he covers some familiar territory in the public agonies of Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Robert Blake and other supermarket checkout mainstays, he more importantly delves into such dark corners as the Hollywood influence of organized crime, the Rabid Right, sexual politics of all persuasions, and other sidebars to fame that seldom make their way into books intended for general readership. For years the bellwether for salacious writing about Tinseltown was Kenneth Anger's "Hollywood Babylon." James Robert Parish's extremely well-researched, highly readable "The Hollywood Book of Scandals" offers a splendid, more reputable, update to Anger's glorious bitch-fest. Parish not only shows how the mighty have fallen, but how some of the fallen are still mighty. <BR>(Nat Segaloff is the author of "The Everything Tall Tales, Legends and Outrageous Lies Book" and has produced "Biography" episodes for A&E.</span>

                    <span>Jim Parish is one of the most prolific writers about Hollywood on the scene. There's a reason for that: he has a wealth of information. He leaves no stone unturned in his search to bring his readers absolutely the most honest version of Hollywood's most infamous events...events which shaped our culture. In this book, Parish has done it again, bringing new information where you would have thought the well was dry years ago. The guy is incredible.</span>

                    <span>This well-researched book of Hollywood scandals is a real page-turner. Entertaining, wittily-written, and informative, it provides all of the juicy details of scandals covering the whole history of Hollywood, from the silent days to the present. Touches on many well-known scandals, but the reader will also be surprised by some previously unknown (at least to me) stories of Hollywood misbehavior. The book deals not just with scandal, but also with numerous tragedies (Judy Garland, for example). Some of the stories are funny, others sad -- and I found myself at the end of the book wishing for more. This is a terrific Hollywood book!</span>
