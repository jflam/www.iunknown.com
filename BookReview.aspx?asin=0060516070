                    <span>This is a superbly written guide for executives regarding how to become more effective. After reading this book, I adopted several suggestions that Drucker made and I must say that the results have been quite dramatic. For instance, I was able to cut down unproductive meetings considerably by eliminating things like "no meetings without a clear agenda." Common sense but rarely followed in the corporate world.

                    <span>As An Executive Coach, Management Team Builder and Leadership Development Trainer I have known about and read Drucker for years. The Effective Executive is a book I give to clients as an illustration of where I want to take them. Originally published in 1964 this re-issue is more than welcome and I use it as a companion to "First Break All The Rules" (The Gallup Organization's Markus Buckingham and Curt Coffman) which discovered the same principles 35 years later!</span>

                    <span>If you are ever consigned to that mythical desert island, and can only have one management book, make this the book. 
<br />
<br />I got my first copy of Peter Drucker's Effective Executive right after I started my first management job after getting out of the Marines in 1968.  I read and re-read my hardbound copy, dipping into it again and again for more than three decades until that copy finally fell apart two years ago, and I had to buy another copy.  Even though I've read it - cover to cover - several times and dipped into it, literally, hundreds of times, I always find something valuable. 
<br />
<br />Drucker is one of the most lucid and insightful writers there is.  In the Effective Executive, he applies those skills to analyzing the job of anyone who has to do knowledge work.  In other words, this isn't for the "executive" in the classic sense.  If thinking is a large part of what you do, this is a good book for you.  The main points are staggeringly simple.  Know thy time.  What can I contribute?  Making strength productive.  First things first.  Making effective decisions.  
<br />
<br />For each key point, Drucker gives you, in his usual straightforward way, both examples and ideas.  This 
<br />is the book that first taught me to schedule my work in ninety-minute blocks.  It's the one that taught me not only about the importance of setting priorities, but how to do it.  It's a book that taught me the basics 
<br />of decision making, but also that the most important thing about decision making is to have a method for it.  
<br />
<br />I recommend this to all my students in supervision, management, and leadership classes.  I recommend it to you, even if you are not bound for a desert island.</span>

                    <span>I always learn a lot from Drucker.  Every single book he has written has become a classic in its own right, with basic prescriptions for many problems one often comes across in business and in life.  Although his book Innovation and Entrepreneurship is my all-time favorite, The Effective Executive, at least for me, is a very close second.
<br />
<br />Drucker starts by defining who and what the executive is, and places him (and increasingly her) in the most appropriate context.  He is very careful to distinguish the executive from the more typical laborer.  Essentially, Drucker tells us that the executive is someone who is paid for what he or she knows, and not what he or she does.  The executive is supposed to know, for any situation, the following: what is the right thing to do, how to do it, and how to do it effectively.  Once this is identified, the executive has to make certain that those who do the right thing can do it well.  That is essentially the difference between management and labor.  
<br />
<br />Some executives do manage and supervise, as these terms are traditionally used, but an executive has to do more than this.  He or she has to identify problems and opportunities, and in the case of problems, solve them, while in the case of opportunities, marshal all available resources to pursue them.  While decision-making is part of the executive's domain, it is what goes into the decision-making that is critical.  The real task of the executive is to think, make judgements, take focused action and ultimately bear the consequences of his or her actions.  In too many institutions, whether they are universities, coporations or government agencies, this action chain often breaks down, typically at the first step.  More often than not, however, actions are de-coupled from (bearing) the consequences.  As a result, Drucker spends a lot of time going over what it means to be an Effective Executive, as opposed to one of the many hangers-on who merely treads water and tries to curry favor through flattery, subterfuge or other devious and unsavory methods.
<br />
<br />Drucker, I believe, is very likely the first to make the important distinction between effort and results.  Lots of people work hard, put in long hours on the job, yet have nothing to show for their effort.  Many will advance in rank and pay, but not based on merit, for they will get their promotions and pay raises based on time served.  Results are the end-product of effort- be it large or small, but effort,no matter how great or how dedicated, does not necessarily lead to results, issues of what constitutes 'results' (or even 'effort') aside.  This is why Drucker admonishes one to occupy himself or herself with results, and not efforts.  That said, Drucker emphasizes that every executive looking to be a better executive should spend a little time thinking about where his or her most important resource- time, goes.
<br />
<br />Speaking of resources, Drucker also states that the two most important resources in any organization are knowledge and time.  Painful experience forces me to agree with his assertion.  The two once combined can equal favorable and positive results, if combined properly.  However, both of these resources have to be put to work through an organization, and with the assistance of other (hopefully like-minded) people.  The danger here is not that knowledge and time will be mis-applied, but that first, knowledge within an organization will go unutilized and second that some knowledge, such as that internal to the organization, will take precedence over the information and knowledge coming from the outside.  Too many institutions have grown stale simply because they have consciously chosen to emphasize what is going on inside the organization than what is occuring on the outside, and acting upon it.  Once again, painful experience forces me to agree with this brilliant insight.
<br />
<br />However, Drucker also points out that information and knowledge exist pretty much outside of the organization, and for this he gets my undying respect.  People are the source of all knowledge, and in the global economy, people are mobile, so all knowledge, to some extent, will also be mobile.  An institution's success or failure then hinges on what comes through and walks out of the door every day.  This valuable insight ties into Drucker's last admonishment- focus on contribution.  Every executive should ask: 'What can I contribute of value?'; however, this question should be considered well within the context of the organization.  Yet again, painful experience forces me to admit that many institutions have specifically organized themselves so as not to have its personnel contribute something of value, no matter what their mission statements profess.  In such situations, it is best for the effective executive or those wishing to become effective executives to part ways with such an institution.
<br />
<br />But fear not, while the book is a thinly veiled extended lecture on the importance of competence and good judgment in business relations, these things can be learned.  The path to becomig an effective executive demands some tribute upon the Altar of Bad Experience, but as for the rest, you can acquire it through careful study of history, anecdotal experience and the exercise of a few simple habits to be found in the book.  As Will Rogers once said, "Good judgment comes from experience.  And a lot of experience comes from bad judgment."

                    <span>I had bought this book about 15 years ago after graduation. Over the period of time, I have come to appreciate it more and more.<p>The book addresses the issue of how to be effective and hence successful at work.<p>It concludes that effective person (executive) knows exactly where they are spending their time, focus on contribution (rather than efforts), build on their own and others strengths (rather than weaknesses), concentrate on few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results and finally make effective decisions.<p>All the above practices or habits have been explained in details and with examples.<p>The one thing I regret is that there is no coaching forms or other aids. A fieldbook would be a great follow-up for this book!!<p>Any Drucker book needs to be re-read over a period of time for maximum impact.</span>
