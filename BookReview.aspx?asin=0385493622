                <span id="Label1">When Andrew Wiles of Princeton University announced a solution of Fermat's last theorem in 1993, it electrified the world of mathematics. After a flaw was discovered in the proof, Wiles had to work for another year--he had already labored in solitude for seven years--to establish that he had solved the 350-year-old problem. Simon Singh's book is a lively, comprehensible explanation of Wiles's work and of the star-, trauma-, and wacko-studded history of Fermat's last theorem. <I>Fermat's Enigma</I> contains some problems that offer a taste of the math, but it also includes limericks to give a feeling for the goofy side of mathematicians.</span>

                    <span>This required reading for my History of Mathematics class was anything but a chore. Singh keeps the reader wanting more at the end of each chapter. The descriptions and examples of the mathematical concepts were written so that a person without a mathematics education could learn and understand them. The powerful story behind the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is told along with many sub-stories: the tragic Tanijama-Shimura story, the brilliant youngster Galois, Euler's story, and many others. Without realizing it the reader gains much knowledge of history and mathematics history.<P>It is a true love story of the passion Andrew Wiles possessed in his desire to solve the greatest math problem ever. For 350 years some of the greatest mathematicians had tried to solve the problem and they all failed. This book tells their stories along with the drama that surrounded them.</span>

                    <span>This is a remarkable and engrossing human story about the search for the proof to the age old Fermat's last theorem. A story which tells the tale of one man's unflinching determination and single minded devotion to the cause of this proof. The events which unfold and the riveting account of Andrew Wiles journey to glory are told in this gripping tale by Simon Singh. Singh's master storytelling abilities are very well exemplified and will be appreciated by one and all. Those not inclined mathematically will also gain insights and concepts of mathematics and also get a peek at the lives of the mathematicians who are featured in this book.<P>Andrew Wiles read about this theorem when he was barely ten year old in a library while flipping through one of E.T. Bell's book. The rest as we know is history because this particular moment became a turning point in young Wiles life. This would force him to take a career in mathematics and lead a rigorous life in mathematics. Later he would be shutting and isolating himself from the outside world so that he could devote his complete attention to the task at hand - to solve this 17th century conjecture devised by the great Pierre Fermat. History saw this theorem remaining unsolved for 350 years, which eluded mathematicians like Euler, Sophie Germain, Lame, Kummer, Cauchy et al. but who nevertheless had their own bit of contribution to the proof in particular and mathematics in general.<P>Andrew Wiles mathematical proof of the century was not without its share of pitfalls. After announcing the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in June 1993 with much fanfare and publicity, Wiles didn't have the wildest idea about what was in store for him... something which will almost make him accept defeat...<P>Though Prof. Wiles succeeded in his endeavor, his proof was based on post-Fermat mathematical ideas like the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, Galois group theory, Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin-Flach method. Fermat on the other hand had claimed that he possessed the proof for the theorem which obviously was based on mathematics of his time...<P>A great read. Recommended for one and all.</span>

                    <span>Awe-inspiring book from Dr. Simon Singh. This book narrates the mathematician Andrew Wiles' effort to solve Fermat's Last Theorem. The theorem proposed by mathematician Pierre de Fermat has remained without any mathematical proof for centuries in spite of various attempts until Andrew Wiles provided the proof for the theorem.<BR>The author traces the history of mathematics from Pythagoras, Euler, Fermat to the modern day Andrew Wiles. The author has narrated the story in simple and beautiful English. Recommended for anyone who wants to get inspiration and motivation from the efforts of mathematicians and apply it. Wonderful book!!</span>

                    <span>I heard about this story in a documentary and was intrigued, even though I am mathematically challenged. I bought it on a whim, though I expected it may end up on the shelf of books that I'll never get to but make me look smarter for owning them.<P>One day I decided to give it a try for a few minutes. Several hours later I was deep into it and giving up sleep to read "one more chapter". <P>Singh does an excellent job of explaining complex mathematical problems so even I could understand them. Even so, I doubt that math geeks will find these sections condescending or oversimplified. For those like me who have negative physical reactions at the mere mention of math, the math sections are actually interesting to follow, and they add to the story so you can really understand what is going on. <P>Mostly, this book is an interesting history of the mathematical problem the title implies. The story is well paced, organized chronologically, and has an excellent mix of literary devices to keep you flipping pages well past bedtime.<P>This book has now ended up on the shelf of books I intend to re-read periodically.</span>

You'll read it in a day and pass it on to a friend. But that's not a bad thing.</span>
