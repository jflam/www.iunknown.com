                <span id="Label1">Of all the 19th-century pioneer stories, none exerts such a powerful hold on the American imagination as the tale of the Donner Party in the high Sierra Nevadas in the winter of 1846. The excursion became a terrifying tale of misery, death, madness, and cannibalism. Through family journals, newspaper accounts, and interviews with historians and descendants of the party, the program re-creates the Donner Party's now legendary journey.</span>

                    <span>Very moving and award winning. You actually feel like you are traveling with the doomed party. I love the aerial views of the terrain they fought thru to get to California. I had to watch this as a AP History student in high school. You learn a whole ton about manifest destiny as well. To think, these people literally walked across the United States. </span>

                    <span>This was an excellent documentary, period.  Even if you are not "into" history, you will be hooked on this story.  It is a tragic tale of the perils of westward expansion.  Sure it is just an ink drop on the pages of history, but the story will live on.  </span>

                    <span>I first saw this incredible documentary as a child & for several nights afterwords I had terrible nightmares! This is one of the finest PBS documentaries I've ever seen, & it's also one of the most grusome tales in American history. While dozens of books have been written about the Donner Party, I believe this is the only documentary that's been made about it so far. The story is told through eyewitness accounts that make you feel like a member of the doomed wagon train. What's even more interesting is how the weary survivors rebuilt their lives after returning to "civilization". If you want compelling, horrifying, & unforgettable entertainment, this is the documentary to get!</span>

                    <span>The American Dream's worst case scenario; Manifest Destiny's darkest heart-people with everything they need moving West because the next best thing, the finally fulfilling thing, the Big Rock Candy Mountain, is over the horizon.  But along the way, snow and hunger and the darkness of the human heart pouring out and spreading with the blizzards.  Perhaps the most telling line in this documentary is written by one of the 12 year old girls who survives the six month ordeal and by summer time is writing to her cousin.  "Come West," she writes, "and come quickly. Just don't take no short cuts."  The power of the Manifest Destiny, and the pull of California, the ending point not only of America's Manifest Destiny, but an itchy-footed journey taken over centuries by west bound peoples leaving Greece, leaving Italy, bound always for something better, for something more.

                    <span>I too remember seeing this documentary on England's Channel 4 and was immediately impressed by the understated tone that let the central characters speak for themselves and the horror that slowly unravels as the snow continues to fall. <br>It's rare to find a product that receives so many five stars and be so justified.</span>
