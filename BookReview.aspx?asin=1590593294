                    <span>My Plone adventure started a couple of months ago when I decided that it's time to migrate our internal techie website powered by Movable Type, to some more powerful, CMS kind of platform. Looked into several open-source CMS products, among all of them the official Plone site alone impressed me enough to stop the quest. I liked clean user interface, features, an excellent Windows installer and nevertheless the fact that it's built on top of the Zope which means I can use Python, my preferred programming language, to extend out of the box Plone functionality in the future. 
<br />
<br />I started with Julie C. Meloni book "Plone Content Management Essentials" which is a great introduction type of the text, however it doesn't cover technical details or explain well what is really going on under the hood. Andy McKay's book is exactly what I needed to fill the gap in my understanding of Plone. I admit that I had some difficulties putting together all the technical pieces, mostly because Plone (Zope) is so different from web related packages that I dealt with them so far. Thanks to this book I learned a lot more than I really expected (maybe even wanted?)  at the beginning. Plone is definitely much more powerful and sophisticated package than I thought. If you're interested into some serious development or customization of your Plone powered site, you'll definitely need this book at hand in addition to official Zope Book. It covers all important topics that I can think off,  from simple to advance customizations, templating, scripting, workflow, security, administration...honestly I felt "lost" sometimes while trying to grasp the more advanced concepts, but this is more of the consequence of ignorance from my part on the subject than the author fault. 
<br />
<br />Therefore, if you're a hobbyist, ignorant or simply not interested about technical details of the Plone, then Julie's book is probably all you'll need, otherwise I'm sure you'll find this book indispensable resource.  Thanks for reading this review!</span>

                    <span>Plone is a very powerful content manager- but it can be very difficult to understand. There are multiple layers, with Plone built on top of Zope and running (typically) under Apache. Finding the right level to install or modify a particular feature can be puzzling. 
<br />
<br />McKay's book is still the definitive guide to the guts of Plone- what happens at what level, where to make changes, how to add functionality and so forth. For that, it's indespensible. 
<br />
<br />What it is not, however, is an introduction to PLone, or a guide to creating and managing Plone content. The prospective reader of this book should have a good familiarity with the basics of Plone and creating and managing content. It wouldn't hurt to be familiar with object-oriented methodology, and at least one object-oriented language, be it C++, java, or whatever. 
<br />
<br />For the experienced web developer, though, McKay's book is the ideal guide to the complexities of Plone.</span>

                    <span>If you're a beginner to CMSs and have decided to use Plone, I recommend Julie C. Meloni's book instead of this one.
<br />Andy McKay obviously knows a lot about his subject, and he takes pains to give a good background and context to the things he does, but to be honest, I chose Plone because I didn't want to know the background. I just wanted to get my site up and running.
<br />I'm finding this book very heavy going, although I have no doubt it will be useful in the long term.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Though not without it's flaws this book is a very well organized and written walkthrough on using Plone from installation, to development and through to installation. It's clear the author knows a great deal about Plone and he knows how to convey it in a clear and concise manner.
<br />
<br />I find fault in the structure of a book for covering the how of a topic almost exclusively with no time given to talking about why we should be doing something. But few tech readers hold authors to that standard, so i really can't mark the book down for that. On a specific note I would have preferred if some of the graphics had been scaled down and overall normalized across the entire book, it's not something that detracts from the value of the book as a resource. So I can't mark it down for that.
<br />
<br />All of the core concepts are covered, page design, session management, security, customizations, even writing your own products. 
<br />
<br />A singular resource for anyone developing on, or deploying Plone. Highly recommended.</span>
