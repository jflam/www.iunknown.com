                    <span>This will serve most anyone well who wants to begin remodoling, building, addition, etc.<p>Why I say this is that it accomplishes two important things well: aids in letting you find a style, and second, aids in choosing a contractor or choose yourself.<p>Beautiful photos of many rooms and homes are included, just what an ID or architect/builder will ask first: show me some things you like.<p>From color to lighting to flooring to window treatments, it's here.  When one wants to go deeper in these areas, there are other recommended helps.</span>

                    <span>This book shows only photos of architecturally beautiful custom homes. So it might work for you if your home is already pretty "great" or if you are planning to rip out walls and do some major structural remodeling. It is NOT about interior decorating for the middle class tract-home owner on a budget. One of my personal gripes: What is with all the bath tubs, showers and master bedrooms facing huge, uncovered windows? Trying to scare the neighbors?</span>

                    <span>This is definitely the book to get if you're planning to remodel, redecorate or even build a new home. There are lots of color photos featuring beautiful & unique ideas. This book makes decorating easy  & enjoyable.<p>The book starts out by introducing design principles  & styles. Then you get an in-depth look at windows, window treatments,  wall coverings, & flooring. I love the many facts & tips sections  that explain the pros & cons of materials.<p>The book also takes you  through planning all the rooms in your house with questionnaires, layout  ideas & lighting considerations. The tips on ideal shelving dimensions  & ergonomics were very helpful. <p>Throughout the book there are also  over 20 great ideas sections for various areas. Some include sunrooms,  storage, & finishing touches. Budgeting, drawing plans, & hiring a  professional are covered at the end.</span>
