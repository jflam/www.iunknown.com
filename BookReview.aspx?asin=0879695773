                <span id="Label1">The first two editions of this manual have been mainstays of molecular biology for nearly twenty years, with an unrivalled reputation for reliability, accuracy, and clarity.  <P>In this new edition, authors Joe Sambrook and David Russell have completely updated the book, revising every protocol and adding a mass of new material, to broaden its scope and maintain its unbeatable value for studies in genetics, molecular cell biology, developmental biology, microbiology, neuroscience, and immunology.  <P>Handsomely redesigned and presented in new bindings of proven durability, this three-volume work is essential for everyone using today&#146;s biomolecular techniques.  <P>The opening chapters describe essential techniques, some well-established, some new, that are used every day in the best laboratories for isolating, analyzing and cloning DNA molecules, both large and small.  <P>These are followed by chapters on cDNA cloning and exon trapping, amplification of DNA, generation and use of nucleic acid probes, mutagenesis, and DNA sequencing.  <P>The concluding chapters deal with methods to screen expression libraries, express cloned genes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells, analyze transcripts and proteins, and detect protein-protein interactions.  <P>The Appendix is a compendium of reagents, vectors, media, technical suppliers, kits, electronic resources and other essential information.  <P>As in earlier editions, this is the only manual that explains how to achieve success in cloning and provides a wealth of information about why techniques work, how they were first developed, and how they have evolved.</span>

                    <span>When Bobs first recieved this set as a gift I thought it would make a lovely doorstop. My last pregnancy, however, was a triple birth that Bobs and our live-in next-door neighbor, Chompson, cooked up in a petrie dish down in the basement. I thought that this cloning business was all a bunch of hogwash, but as the years pass I've come to realize that two of the babies are exact clones of Chompson! (the third appears to be a clone of Bobs' favorite TV goddess, Farrah Fawcett-Majors) While I think that Bobs was remiss in his choice of subjects, you have to respect the science that makes miracles like this possible.</span>

                    <span>In this 3 volume set of books the authors summarize the most important laboratory protocols for DNA analysis and cloning. As someone involved in computational biology and mathematical gene sequence analysis, I was needing such a summary to get an idea of just how genetic engineering is actually practiced in the laboratory. The book is definitely written for those readers that are very experienced in these "wet" techniques, but it still could be perused profitably by anyone who is curious about genetic engineering. There is also an excellent website that owners of the books can go to and search for protocols and obtain updates and additions to the protocols. <p>At the beginning of each chapter, the authors give an introduction to the protocols and this is of an enormous help to those readers with only rudimentary acquaintance with the laboratory procedures. Typically, this introduction contains an historical summary of the procedures as they were developed or discovered. One can only marvel at the ingenuity of the discoverers of these techniques. These introductions are fairly straightforward to read, even for those that are not experts in biochemistry.<p>At the end of each chapter, the authors include an "information panel" that gives a more in-depth view of the biochemistry or genetics behind the procedures. These are summaries and are highly specialized, and are again meant for experienced readers. A very lengthy list of references is also included at the end of each chapter. <p>Becuase of the size of this collection, space here does not permit a detailed review, so I will list some of the areas that I thought were particularly interesting or well-written (these coming from the introduction or the information panels only): 1. The DNA synthesis at the colE1 replicon and the interaction between RNAI and RNAII. 2. The discussion of electroporation and the physics behind this technique to introduce DNA into eukaryotic cells. 3. The discussion on the discovery of bacteriophage lambda. 4. The discussion (with diagram), of the assembly pathway of bacteriophage lambda. 5. The summary of the early analysis of DNA using electrophoresis and the different pulsed-field configurations used. 6. The anecdote on the discovery of the polymerase chain reaction. 7. The short discussion on computer-assisted design of oligonucleotide primers. 8. The discussion of oligonucleotide synthesis. 9. The flowchart detailing the preparing and screening of a cDNA library. 10. The history of the development of the methods to synthesize and clone cDNAs. 11. The detailed discussion of the molecular cloning of double-stranded cDNA. 12. The discussion on the methods to validate clones of cDNA. 13. The discussion on magnetic beads for affinity purification. 14. The discussion on the history of DNA sequencing and the different techniques to accomplish it, particularly the information panel on automated DNA sequencing. 15. The discussion of the different types of mutagenesis and the different methods for accomplishing it. 18. The fascinating discussion of how to introduce cloned genes into mammalian cells. 19. The discussion on the steps involved in DNA footprinting. 20 The discussion on green flourescent protein and its use as a fusion tag. 21. The discussion on the use of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.</span>
