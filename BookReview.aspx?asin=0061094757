                    <span>If the reader is open to Dyer's message YOUR SACRED SELF is another amazing addition to his inspirational writings.  Primarily this book deals with discovering and tapping into your true self - that knowing part of you which is eternal, has perspective, is serene, and sees only situations - not problems or conflict.  However, the ego (our consciousness of ourselves as separate from this underlying essence) is a barrier -- and is in direct conflict to experiencing this sacredness we all share.  What Dyer offers is a plan to remove our ego and all the strivings, judgements, internal voices, addictions, and negativity in order to discover the spiritual essence inside us all. Interesting Dyer maintains that by overcoming the drive, needs, and divisiveness of the ego that every hunger we have is sated or becomes no longer important.  Meditation and the ensuing awareness is the key to discovery.  This is a perfect continuation of Dyer's themes and fans of the man will not be disappointed.      </span>

                    <span>This book was different that most other books I have read. <br>It takes a broad brush approach to spirituality. I like his emphasis on seeking spiritual solutions to problems instead of material solutions to problems.  It's not what we have on this earth that matters most, but the wealth of spiritual growth we generate during our lifetimes. He is also right on the mark when he talks of the connectiveness of all life, and for us to recognize this brings on a totally new awareness. As human beings we are all brothers and sisters, and the sooner we realize this, the sooner we will avoid the destruction that war will bring. <p>The only negative thing, some of his ideas seem to be presented in a non-scientific way. I would like him to blend spiritual and scientific thinking a little bit more.  <p>Jeffrey McAndrew<br>author of "Our Brown-Eyed Boy"</span>

                    <span>Dr. Wayne Dyer is a God send!  With his 'Your Erroneous Zones', I was able to overcome my negative thinking, anxiety and all of the wrong ways of thinking that I had been brought up with.  'Sacred Self' is a continuation of his wonderful work!  Truly books that everyone should have in their collection.  I have every one of Dr. Dyer's books and tapes.  His wisdom could never send you in the wrong direction.</span>

                    <span>Before the day I bought this book I really thought,I've had enough with self-development books - because as we all know it most if not all of them are the same just like Romance books!I proved wrong, because <br>honestly this book changed my thoughts,and philosophies of life. It differs from other self-help books<br>like the day does from night.I liked this book so much that I am actually afraid to read other books, because I want the informations I have absorbed from it get stuck in my mind and applied in daily basis, for as long as I live.<p>Well done,Wayne - with this book you've given other writers a clue how a book should really be like.<p>One more thing regarding this book - Do not give up on the first 50 pages even though you may get confused a bit - remember that gold always lies underneath mud, so keep digging and get as much of it as long as you can because the term "it's never too late" sometimes is "no time left".<p>Enjoy the life you never knew - once you finish reading and <br>understanding the meaning of this beautiful book.</span>

                    <span>I was surprised to find that within the first 100 pages interspersed among some very practical advice about the focus of your life and your approach to living was complete nonsense about astral projecting, aura perception, dream walking and other new age babble..... However, I pressed on, thinking "fine, I will just ignore this new age magic twaddle and look for the good points".... much to my disappointment, it continued throughout the book.  I'm not sure if Dyer as always believed in this claptrap or if he has just recently gone off the deep end, but either way, it's sad.</span>
