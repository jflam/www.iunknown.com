                <span id="Label1">An in-depth technical guide on the security technology driving Internet e-commerce expansion.<br>   <br>   "Planning for PKI" examines the number-one Internet security technology that will be widely adopted in the next two years. Written by two of the architects of the Internet PKI standards, this book provides authoritative technical guidance for network engineers, architects, and managers who need to implement the right PKI architecture for their organization. The authors discuss results and lessons learned from early PKI pilots, helping readers evaluate PKI deployment impact on current network architecture while avoiding the pitfalls of early technical mistakes. Four technical case studies detail the do's and don'ts of PKI implementation, illustrating both successes and failures of different deployments. Readers will also learn how to leverage future PKI-related technologies for additional benefits.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for those of us who are NOT PKI development engineers. I learned a lot from this book; the authors, Russ Housley and Tim Polk, were able to present technical material in a way that was completely understandable to non-technical people who are interested in Internet and computer security issues. The Appendix on ASN.1, for example, clarified structures for me. As a policy person, I particularly enjoyed the Chapter on PKI Policy, thought it well written, succinct, and right on target. Since I read this book, I have referenced it in presentations and papers on the subject. Great work!</span>

                    <span>Planning for PKI is without doubt the Class of all books related to PKI. The authors have done a marvelous job of creating a book that walks the fine line of being interesting to senior management as well as Engineers.<P>For the CIO, it provides wonderful examples of how PKI can benefit your organization.<P>For engineers and techies that it provides the nuts and bolts of Public Key Infrastructure, (CP and CPS development, public key encryption ,Architecture, CRLs, Cross Certification, Applications, etc.)<P>It is truely a credit to the authors, and I would recommend it to anyone who has even the smallest bit of interest in PKI.</span>

                    <span>If you have just started working with PKI software or with OpenSSL and would like to gain a better understanding of X.509 certificates, certificate enrollment protocols and PKI, this book is for you. It's an excellent guide written by two of the co-authors of the "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" (RFC 3280).</span>

                    <span>I was expecting something which is more practical with regards to PKI. Author talks about theory of PKI in half the book. And then provides case studies which has very low utility if you are thinking of implementing PKI in J2EE or .NET or even ordinary ecommerce applications...The title is totally a misnomer. Only good thing i found was that the theory presented was helpful to understand PKI...</span>

                    <span>WOW, this goes into some great detail. I am new to PKI, but this has really opened up my eyes to some of the more exquisite details. Great for anyone interested in PKI, but you do need to have some knowledge on Cryptography.</span>
