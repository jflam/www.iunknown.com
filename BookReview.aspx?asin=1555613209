                    <span>I was very disappointed with this book. The author continually tells the reader to be kind and gentle with children, and then recommends "alternatives to spanking" that are simply other types of punishments: time out, removal of privileges, and the like. She simply doesn't get it that children are human beings who behave as well as they are treated, and who will behave well when treated with love and respect. Would the author respond well if her partner tried to control her in these ways? There are many better choices - see the book titles listed at The Natural Child Project and La Leche League websites.</span>

                    <span>This is just a FANTASTIC book for parents of boys! It is exceptionally easy to read, and loaded with useful advise. <P>I really like the format of the book. Each chapter is centered around a particular subject (examples include Understanding His Challenges and Opportunities, Meeting His Needs, and Giving Him a Postitive View of Himself). The chapters begin with a concise (1-2 page) overview of the subject area and its importance, then specific examples and tips follow for how to deal with that subject, with bullet list recommendations for parents and for teachers. Each of the subjects are those of the utmost importance with respect to boys, how they view themselves, and how their self-image shapes who they become. I have found every tip to be extremely insightful, and the recommendations both useful and usable. I will be keeping this book close at hand, and will refer to it again and again.</span>

                    <span>I've bought a lot of "raise your child to be" books, but this one is one that I continue to refer back to. It is very insightful and VERY well layed out which makes it a pleasure to read (half the battle). <P>This book comes into play when your son turns around 18 mos. old, but you'll use it until he is probably in his teens. I pick it up often and read through areas that are important to me at that time and feel like the tips they give you to communicate really do work. <P>I've definitely gotten my money out of this book and I'd recommend this highly.</span>
