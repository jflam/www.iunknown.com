                    <span>For most of our lives we have talked about, experimented with, and attempted many forms of spiritual community, often with disappointing results.  Not until we met Parker Palmer did we find and learn reliable ways to not only explore our inner lives, but to witness and discover the 'hidden wholeness,' not only in ourselves, but in others, in cirlces of trust.  We have been priviiledged to learn this way of living and being in community through working with Parker and other facilitators through the Center for Teacher Formation over the last ten years.  Now Parker, in HIDDEN WHOLENESS, shares his legacy, the 'live encounter' thousands of people have experienced through a retreat process he began.  Now, the reader can find, in clear, simple language, a description of these practices, and begin to consider a way of being with others that honors the soul and supports us in living the undivided life we all deeply yearn for.

                    <span>Parker Palmer has gifted us all with his revealing reflections and insights about living an undivided life.  He writes about the conflict that we experience when our professional life and our inner beliefs are not aligned.  
<br />"A Hidden Wholeness" addressed many questions for me including:
<br />What happens when the person that I have become, shaped by my work experiences, faces decisions that have to be made...  decisions that I know will feel 'bad' or 'wrong' because they threaten my integrity?  
<br />What happens when I find myself part of an organization or profession that has evolved and changed in ways that are troubling?
<br />What happens when I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place and can't see clearly where to go?  
<br />What happens when advice from others and self-help books are of little or no value?  
<br />Palmer shows how we can support one another in today's busy and often impersonal world by creating a unique and very special kind of community. The ideas presented in this book are well grounded and applicable to all.
<br />This is an important book for all individuals who are concerned about or troubled by the divisions that exist in the lives we lead.  Spending a few quiet hours with Parker Palmer's new book, "A Hidden Wholeness", may just change your mind about what is possible... and this book is one that you will want to pass on and share!
