                    <span>Painter's biography is excellent.  She puts Truth in perspective with the  challenges of her time.  She sheds light on complicated relationships with noteable Abolishionists and with her own children.  This book clearly presents the difficult life of one incredible woman who struggles to do her part to free all slaves, gain respect as a woman and be accepted as a human being.</span>

                    <span>When I read a book, I want to get a lot out of it, as I enjoy the reading of it.  On the second point: this book is engagingly written.  The author questions her own motives and information as she constructs a biography of  a difficult life to document.  We see Painter confront the challenges of  performing biography.  I found it a compelling literary device.  On the  first point, the book mixes biography with history and feminist criticism.   This interdisciplinary focus produces a highly inviting book.  Among other  topics, we find out about the details of slavery in the North, 19th century  religious cults, and the ways in which feminists and abolitionists of the  time exploited Truth for their own gain, as well as how this appropriation  of "Truth" continues to the present.  On this point, we learn  much about contemporary feminism and culture and its need for  heroes-especially African American female heroes.</span>

                    <span>Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol undertakes an interesting challenge as historian Nell Irvin Painter attempts to produce a "historically accurate" biography of a subject that left little evidence of her life.  Moreover, Painter takes on another interesting challenge by attempting to analyze the  meaning of Sojourner Truth the symbol-a task that requires her to analyze  the layers of evidence produced by those who did document Sojourner Truth's  life.  Is she successful at producing a historically "accurate" biography?   Does she successfully "peel back the myth and the legend" in the  evidence left by those who documented Truth's life?<p>I think Painter is  somewhat successful at presenting a historically accurate biography.  I say  somewhat because, on the one hand, she presents compelling evidence  assembled from primary sources that document Truth's life-newspaper  accounts, monographs, etc.  And she obviously has a thorough command of the  secondary sources related to Sojourner Truth.  What is more, I think that  her methodology-what she calls "more or less uncommon research  methods"-allows her to reconstruct a version of Truth's life as best as  possible.  Assembling the pieces of an immense jigsaw puzzle such as this  requires great patience and historical skill, both of which Painter  exhibits in this work.<p>On the other hand, her command of the supporting  sources, the sources that provide context for her analysis of the primary  sources, is a little less complete.  For example, as Painter acknowledges,  religion-popular religion-is central to understanding American culture.   And I think that in this case, one must have a thorough understanding of  religion and the Bible to effectively document Truth's life.  However,  Painter makes at least one glaring mistake in her narrative when she  conflates the stories of Lazarus the beggar, and Lazarus the brother of  Mary and Martha (p. 127).  Painter makes this fundamental error in her  analysis of Truth's speech in an apparent attempt to interject an element  of "class consciousness" into Truth's abolitionist-feminist discourse.   Jesus did not resurrect Lazarus the beggar.  Jesus resurrected Lazarus the  brother of Mary and Martha, a well-respected and influential patron (the  Lazarus to whom Truth refers).  Does a gaff such as this mortally wound the  entire analysis?  Probably not.  But, in a book that so heavily relies on  "imaginative methods" and "unknowns," it is probably a good idea  to have command of the "knowns"-in this case the New Testament.<p>This  analytical error also points to problems in answering the question  concerning whether Painter succeeds in "peeling back the myth and  legend."  Persons who produced the majority of the evidence that  Painter uses had a vested interest in Truth the symbol, which eventually  led to the perpetuation of myth and legend.  Truth is often used to advance  causes such as abolitionism and feminism.  And while Painter dismisses  those who have used Truth the symbol and perpetuated myth and legend, she  is left with little without this evidence.  In the end Painter concedes  that one can not separate the symbol and the person without destroying the  "cultural significance" of Sojourner Truth.  Cultural  significance trumps historical accuracy in the final chapter.  And  paradoxically, it appears Painter falls into the same trap as her  predecessors as she "peels back" the myth and legend.  Her  analysis on pages 126 and 127 (and in other places throughout the book)  strongly suggests that she is adding her own layers and doing to Sojourner  Truth, what others-the ones she dismisses-have done.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Painter does a complete job of culling an abundance of information and ascertaining the real Sojourner Truth from the mythologized one who has been passed down to most of us by way of cursory teaching and mentioning of in classrooms.  This scholarly book is rife with interesting and, at times, disturbing facts about not only the woman named Sojourner, but also about the country named America with its racist and sexist policies and practices.<p>The book is written in a clear and cohesive style, notwithstanding its rigorous documentation.  Anyone who is interested in African American history, women's history, and U.S. history will want to have a copy of Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol in his or her library.</span>
