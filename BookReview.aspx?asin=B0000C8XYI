                    <span>Despite the numerous bad reviews seen here on Amazon.com, I just upgraded from Norton Antivirus 2003 to 2004. I was expecting the worst case scenario: my computer gets bogged down with a memory hog of a program. I have no idea what the bad reviews are for. It runs just fine on my PC, and seems to even run a bit FASTER than last year's version. It makes me wonder what OS and hardware they're running in their PCs.<P>(...)The software works exactly the same as previous versions: it scans for viruses, installs, scans again, and then runs weekly to keep your PC virus free. It also scans incoming/outgoing e-mails as well as incoming files. In this day and age of viruses being in every other e-mail, you really need a product to take care of it for you, so I recommend picking up Norton Antivirus 2004.</span>

                    <span>You can summarize the newest Norton 2004 products with these words: bulky, slow, bloatware, and activation hassles.<P>The Norton 2003 Antivirus and System Works products have worked very well for me and Norton Antivirus has been known to be the premium antivirus solution for computers for many years. If you have the latest updates Norton 2003 is almost the same as Norton 2004 but there is no activation requirement for version 2003. Also, the newer 2004 versions have a few extra features that are suppose to enhance antivirus protection but the software just tries to do way too much. <P>The result of the bloatware is a huge program running constantly in the background, soaking up your computer resources and slowing your system to a crawl. Then there is the hassle of the required activation along with its annoyances and you may wonder if this "new 2004 version" is worth it. <P>I have concluded that Norton AV 2004 is absolutely NOT worth it and instead recommend you find a copy of Norton 2003 Antivirus or System Works Pro. Many online sites sell version 2003 OEM copies for around $20 or less and this version will allow for one year of free updates from the time of your installation. Install a copy of Zone Alarm Pro 4.0 or 4.5 if you want added firewall protection with pop-up blocking and enhanced privacy while web surfing and you have yourself excellent overall protection and acceptable system speed for most newer computers. <P>An excellent option for those older systems or if you want more efficient protection without bogging down you computer speed is using the new McAfee Antivirus 2004 version with the option of also using Zone Alarm Pro 4.0 or 4.5 . I have found this to be a really fast solution to my slower notebook computer. Norton System Works and Antivirus 2003 updates had made my notebook (Pentium 3 1Ghz w/256k RAM) almost non-working because of its impact on system speed. Uninstalling Norton System Works 2003 and installing McAfee Antivirus 2004 allowed my computer run at least twice as fast. The only drawback to using McAfee was that you have to shut down the Zone Alarm Pro firewall temporarily to do the occasional McAfee AV program updates (not necessary for just the virus definition updates). The pop-up blocker in Zone Alarm effects the browser required web site update feature of McAfee. However the antivirus definitions for both McAfee AV and Norton AV can be allowed to fully update automatically if you allow full program access in the Zone Alarm Pro program firewall configuration.<P>In summary your solutions are Norton 2003 Antivirus or the more efficient McAfee 2004 Antivirus. Either program combined with Zone Alarm Pro 4.0 or 4.5 provides excellent overall protection and privacy. If you have a newer or faster system (at least 1.5 Ghz CPU and at least 512k RAM ) then for sure go with Norton 2003. If you are running a slower computer with less memory then use McAfee 2004.</span>

                    <span>The problems began when the installation froze, stretching installation time to a whopping five hours! Once the software was finally installed, it encountered an "internal error" which could be "addressed" at the Symantec website. Unfortunatly, however, the technical support link is non-existent. Literally, "www.symantec.com/techsupp" DOES NOT EXIST!!! This also renders live updates impossible. Of course, this issue could probably be resolved on the phone during the work week for the low price of 30 bucks. Instead, I'll just trash this piece of crap and spend 40 bucks on PC-Cillin 2004. Buyer beware!!</span>

                    <span>That was an OEM and I didn't expect more than a CD-ROM. Nisofts provided me with a Norton Antivirus 2004, which was installed flawlessly. They reacted fast to Amazon order and they shipped the software fast. They deserve five stars.</span>
