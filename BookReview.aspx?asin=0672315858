There is thorough coverage of the Thread API, ThreadGroup classes, the Runnable interface, and the synchronized operator. Extensive, complete, code examples show programmers the details of creating and managing threads in real-world applications.</HTML></span>

                    <span>Very straightforward and  gentle introduction to the Java threading mechanics.It features basic theory and examples for about 3/4 of the book with the rest of the pages dedicated to a few useful techniques to ease and streamline threads programming, which you can use in you applications or as inspiration and examples for your own devices. My only complaint is the presentation method: a bunch of code followed by a bunch of explanations.  I think presenting the more relevant lines of code interleaved with explanations and then the whole example program would make learning much more effective and easy. This book is also starting to show its age, so until a second edition comes out I would recommend the O'Reilly book over this one, unless you can get it real cheap.</span>

                    <span>This is a particularly easy to understand book on Java threads. If you are new to Java or to threading then don't hesitate to buy this book. The topics are clearly explained and in a logical order. The examples are small enough that they are easy to understand, but big enough to get the point across. And they work! Mr. Hyde has clearly gone to a great amount of trouble to make his presentation clear and simple to digest. As examples the diagrams he presents for explaining a deadlock and the timing of events in a wait/notify sequence make what is going on very clear.
<br />
<br />If you are an experienced thread programmer looking for the finer points of threading, this book might not be the best. It does not go into the level of detail that some other books do, for example Holub's book "Taming Java Threads". On the other hand, these books are not the best for beginners.</span>

                    <span>I used this book as a reference in building threaded HTTP<br>and SOAP output queues for a very time critical project.<br>The book is clearly written, with good Java examples.  I did<br>not have time to spend a week reading a book and working<br>through the examples.  This book provided what I needed most:<br>a clear introduction that was well organized.<p>This book is published by SAMS.  Not only is the content good,<br>but they layout and structure are good as well.  This is a huge<br>improvement over the SAMS books that were printed back in the<br>days of Windows 3.1 and DOS.</span>

It covers everything you need to know about Thread, from inter-thread communication, locking, to thread pooling and threads & swing.<p>And... the code examples run correctly!<p>It's worth your money every character.</span>

                    <span>I was studying for the SJCP exam. I had every certification book in the house. However, none of the certification books were covering threads in a coherent manner that allowed me to master the threading part of the exam. This book did. I went from scratching my head at why I missed a thread question in the 100's of practice certification exams to scoring 100's in the thread section of the exams. For those of you that are doing your certification, get this book to supplement the exam guides.</span>
