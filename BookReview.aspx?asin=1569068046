                    <span>If you have ever been to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York then you have seen some of the great display cases that they have put together with artifacts from the history of the game.  Those resources are once again used wonderfully in the "National Baseball Hall of Fame 2005 Calendar" that is part of the Cooperstown Collection. Note: the photograph provided above of the back of this calendar is not the back of the 2005 calendar, but it does give you a sense of what you will find inside.
<br />
<br />For 2005 the members of the Hall of Fame who get their own pages are Honus Wagner, Rollie Fingers, Roy Campanella, Red Schoendienst, Luis Aparicio, Whitey Ford, Rod Carew, Willie McCovey, and Eddie Mathews.  There are also months devoted to the 1955 World Series that was the only time the Brooklyn Dodgers won the title, beating the New York Yankees, the history of the Philadelphia Phillies, and the legendary Wrigley Field.  For each of the players there are caps and uniforms for the teams they were with, which means two caps for both Schoendienst and Carew.  
<br />
<br />But the fun here for baseball fans is in the details, such as the "No Lights" bumper sticker for Wrigley Field, a red 1955 pennant for the New York Yankees, and a photograph of a clean-shaven Rollie Fingers.  Of course, I like the baseball cards, especially when I can point to the 1956 and 1957 Topps Campanella cards and know I actually have those beauties.  Like the previous efforts in this series this calendar is a keeper that serves baseball fans as either reminders of what they have seen at the Hall of Fame or an incentive to go and visit Cooperstown.
