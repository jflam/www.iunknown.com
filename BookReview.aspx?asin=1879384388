                    <span>I have found the first information about Kiswahili in Melinda's book. I am from Turkey and I always wanted to travel to Africa, and so i found Melinda's book in the net and her story triggered my wish out to travel to Kenya and start to learn Kiswahili. I love her book and will always read it, after watching the old film "African Queen" yesterday eveing on TV, I had the strong urge to read some chapters of Jambo Mama. It strangely soothed my soul which longs to be in Africa again. As I am having a baby soon, I cannot travel to Africa for the next two years, so i will keep Melinda's story next to my favourite chair and looking forward the long cold winter nights. I can absolutely recommend to buy this book, if you want to travel to Kenya or Africa or if you prefer travelling in your mind with Melinda to this wonderful country. with love from Turkey Asiye</span>

                    <span>I thorougly enjoyed reading this book! Melinda is a wonderful and entertaining writer whose description of her life in Kenya was written with complete honesty and candor. I am afraid vanity would not have allowed me to be quite so honest. Her detailed accounts of her trials and triumphs kept me turning the pages. Since I have visited Kenya several times, and especially the Masai Mara Game Reserve, I felt as if I were right there with her. She wrote with compassion towards the people she knew and loved there, and best of all, she wrote with a sharp wit and an incredible sense of humor. I found myself laughing out loud often. It wasn't an easy thing she did, moving to Africa by herself for an extended period of time, for Africa and New York are as different as night and day. Melinda did, however, what so many others only think of doing...she followed her dream. For the reader who wants to learn more about modern Kenya, this book is for you. For the reader who wants a fun, interesting, informative, romantic, and heartfelt book to read, then don't miss this one. I highly recommend "Jambo Mama."</span>

                    <span>This was a wonderful book. This book tells an amazing story about life in Africa for an American woman. The writer is truly gifted. She wrote in such a way as to make the story and the people in it truly come alive. This book was incredibly difficult to put down and when I did I could hardly wait to find out what happened next. She has an amazing ability to make the reader feel as though you are sitting right there watching the story unfold. The writer is able to reveal her deepest feelings on the pages of the book and doesn't hold anything back which truly makes this book a gem. This is a magnificent book and a must read for anyone remotely interested about life in Africa. I can assure you, you won't be dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>An African-American friend suggested I read this. We spent a lot of time together in Nairobi in the 80s, and this book captures the atmosphere very well, in addition to the fact that the author is very good storyteller. She ends this as if she is on the brink of a sequel and you end up really wanting to know what happens next. <P>I read the strange comments about this book as a "colonial" account of life in Kenya. It seems to me it is more an honest account about living in a different culture. I like the author's honesty, and I would not want her to tell a different story or try to make her account more politically correct. She changes quite a bit as the story progresses, and she becomes very much part of the lives of her Kenyan staff. She tries to make friends with Africans and expatriots and it is the expatriots that she never gets to know very well.<P>I was interested to read about her attempts to settle in Kenya, but when she began to describe the business she started there I was entirely fascinated. I own some of the rugs made in her factory, and I was impressed by what she did to run the business.<P>She must have realized how similar her experiences were to those in "Out of Africa." The author becomes completely involved in the medical emergencies of her staff, she sees the effect of another African's curse on her cook, and she lives as a lonely woman running a business in Kenya that is inexorably floundering. She even has an affair with an unable-to-commit safari guide.<P>I'd like to know more about the author and what she's done since she left Kenya. She seems like a Renaissance person, gifted in many ways, including writing. Her safaris in Kenya were exotic, but--as it was for many of us--the main importance of her stay there seems to have been her interactions with Kenyans. This is a far less maudlin story than that written by Kuki Gallmann, and it is better written.</span>
