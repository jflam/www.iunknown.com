                <span id="Label1">All Christianity is, to some extent, idolatrous. Christian worship is a response to a worshiper's image of Jesus, and all images of Jesus fall short of his reality--in the same way that all biographies and portraits fail to depict a whole person. In <I>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</I>, New Testament scholar Marcus Borg attempts to understand how popular images of Jesus connect Christians to their savior and isolate them from him. Borg writes about his own evolving ideas of who Jesus was, considers the scholarly and popular religious evolution of Jesus' public image, and investigates with special care the effects of Historical Jesus research on contemporary images of Jesus. <I>Meeting Jesus Again</I> is written in an affable, gracious, and unflinchingly honest voice. Borg's description of his own faith particularly exemplifies these qualities, and gives the reader a simultaneously safe and unsettling new perspective on the peasant from Galilee: "[T]he central issue of the Christian life is not believing in God or believing in the Bible," he writes. "Rather, the Christian life is about entering into a relationship with that to which the Christian tradition points, which may be spoken of as God, the risen, living Christ, or the Spirit. And a Christian is one who lives out his or her relationship to God within the framework of the Christian tradition."  <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I></span>

                    <span>&#65279;Before reading Marcus Borg's masterpiece "Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time" I was a self proclaimed agnostic. After reading it I realized I wasn't an agnostic, but an atheist to the God of conservative Christianity. Borg carefully and compassionately details another form of Christianity, a Christianity centered on love of neighbor, love of self, love of intellect and love of the God in all the world. This book teaches that you don't need to check your brain at the church
<br />door, that you don't need to believe in a Santa Claus like God, that you can be a Christian and love your neighbor whether yellow black or white, whether gay or left or right. 
<br />
<br />Simply put, "Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time" is nothing short of an amazing read that can transform not just your view of Christianity, but even your life. I ought to know; after
<br />reading it in 1996 I started attending a church. Today I am writing you from the campus of a progressive Christian seminary 2000 miles from that church where I am entering my last year of
<br />studies. From agnostic to pastoral prospect, pretty powerful stuff prompted by Borg's thoughtful Spirit-filled writing. 
<br />
<br />I can't promise that this book will change your life, but it sure changed mine. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding the loving heart of Christianity amidst the
<br />noisy discordant clamor of those on the right who claim Christianity means having a hardened heart.  This is an excellent book written by a gifted writer and loving Spirit-filled person. </span>

                    <span>Jesus, who passionately advocated and died for the idea of Grace-which is defined intrinsically as "unconditional" worthiness-has been placed in the center of a religion that uses him as the ultimate "condition" for which Grace may be received.
<br />
<br />It is tragic and sad enough that the ignorant and powerful were responsible for crucifying Jesus 2000 years ago, but its nothing short of tragic hat his original message is re-crucified on a daily basis by an invented theology that cares more about his death than about his wondrous message of unmerited worthiness.
<br />
<br />When the solution becomes the major source of the problem, how long must we suffer in ignorance and fear until we wake up and do something about it?
<br />
<br />Why can't we understand that morality is not the goal, but the byproduct of recognizing our innate worth?
<br />
<br />Why do we continue to put up with an insane doctrine that defines humanity as dirty rotten and worthless sinners, which is an enormous resource of self-hate and self-destruction in our society?
<br />
<br />Marcus Borg and others like him are taking the baby steps that will lead to the true resurrection of Christ, and the beautiful perceptual Kingdom of Heaven that Jesus envisioned. 
<br />
<br />Thank you Marcus Borg for your courage and honesty in writing a book that would have brought you a more ominous fate than just the well intentioned yet ignorant responses I see posted here by those of Faith.

                    <span>I am glad I read this book.  I think it has helped to redirect my search for God and to help me rebuild my faith in Him, so that I move from a fearful relationship with an angry Supreme Master to one with a loving Supreme Parent.<p>I first read the Bible cover-to-cover on my own as a youngster.  This was probably not a good thing, as I mostly came away with an impression of an Angry God.  And I certainly was in no position to understand at the tender age of 11 the cultural background of the world of the Hebrews or Jesus. <p>The trouble is that in some ways reading about the life of Christ is a bit like reading a mystery. Sure you can read the book again, but you already know whodunit the next time you go back to it, and having that knowledge changes the way you see things from then on.  "Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time" has clarified for me the difference between pre-Easter and post-Easter Jesus.  Before this when I reread the Gospels and looked over what Jesus said or did prior to his death and resurrection, I looked at it as though He was the post-Easter Godly Jesus the entire time, that He was always God right from the get-go.  Now I am looking at Him more in the sense of His humanity as it was recorded in the first 3 gospels. When I stop to think about it, I expect He was a pretty normal kid, and I am not sure that He really saw Himself as God as that point waiting around to be worshipped. Rather I do think He was very much a man constantly in touch with His Father, so I am giving more consideration to the example He set where he showed me how to live and how to be in touch with the Father all the time. (Or at least try to be.)<p>Also, as a woman who was raised in a Baptist church, I was always hurt and angry at the way women seemed to be second class citizens, and folks always seemed to back up the reason for this with Scripture. But Borg's book showed me that there was a possibility that God has a feminine side (His Wisdom or Sophia) and that this idea of femininity was dropped in translations made from the Greek texts.  Perhaps that does not mean much to some, but to a girl who heard most of her life how everything was Eve's (and therefore women in general) fault, it meant a lot to me.<p>I also appreciated Borg's information about purity codes and particularly about how Jesus confronted the Pharisees about their mile long lists of who was ok and who was not and how badly they treated those on the "not ok" list.  I can see that this type of thinking is still present in many churches today, which is too bad. A relationship with God should not be about following rules, rules, and more rules but rather about his Grace. I wish I had known this years ago, so that I might have actually _felt_ God before now.<p>So I would recommend this book to people who feel that they are just going through the motions at church (or have given up on church altogether) but could use some fresh insight to get their search for God jumpstarted again.  It's also good for folks who are just starting out on the path of Biblical scholarship.  However, people who believe the Bible is inerrant may be uncomfortable with some of the ideas presented in this book. It doesn't mean they should not pick it up, but they should be forewarned that they may find their beliefs tested.</span>

                    <span>Marcus Borg is the most sensible and sympathetic of the Jesus Seminar scholars I have read.  I found many worthwhile insights in this book: the way he links the Gospels and Paul's teaching on grace (though Jesus and Paul also call us to radical moral purity, and Borg sometimes makes meaning slave to etymology), his discussion of meta-narratives, parables, and aphorisms, and the contrast between "conventional wisdom" and "unconventional" wisdom, for example. <p>But the criteria by which Borg judges whether or not a given teaching really is from Jesus are shaky.  Does the "Gospel" of Thomas have anything of value to say about the life of Jesus?  I doubt it.  Why does Borg assume that only material from the Christian "tradition" before 60 A.D. can be trusted?  If I were to write about the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, at a chronological distance equivalent to 93 AD, I could easily find eyewitnesses.  Why should it have been so much harder for the Gospel writers in 70 AD?  <p>Borg's chief weakness may be his habit of working alternatives into what look like false dichotomies, or trichotomies: holiness versus compassion, individual versus political virtue, "belief" versus "action" versus "becoming."  (Why not all three?  "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength!")  Borg's method of exegesis is often to exagerrate one element in Jesus' teaching, then make that a principle by which to exclude other elements.    <p>Borg identifies JS pronouncements with the "scholarly consensus."  But many first rank scholars (Wright, Hays, Johnson, Meier, Jenkins, and others) find the JS way of working quite flawed.  <p>Borg writes of "pre-critical" and "post-critical" naivitee; but he shows a great deal of what might be called "unidirectional" naivitee.  He explains how, as a young man, he discovered Biblical criticism and lost his faith.  He later recovered a faith, which, like John Blofeld's faith in the bodhissatva Guan Yin, seemed to have "nothing to do with belief."  The problem is, while he learned to treat the Gospels critically, his seminary professors did not seem to teach him to treat their own ideas the same way.  Thus, he makes little mention of another kind of Christian that might be called the "post-critical believer" -- the Christian who has read Borg, Crossan, Pagels, Mack, and more radical critics, and come to the conclusion that their methods and conclusions are badly mistaken -- not on theological, but on historical grounds.  <p>We post-critical believers can only feel marginalized and a bit ghostly, not finding ourselves among Borg's typology of believers.  <p>Borg also attempts to tie the radical compassion of Jesus to his alleged identity as a "spirit person" who experienced mystical unity with God: "There is an intrinsic connection between the boundary-shattering experience of Spirit and the boundary-shattering ethics of compassion."<p>As a student of world religions, I think not.  "All we shamans know that the spirits are happiest when we kill people," one Yamonamo Indian is quoted as saying; and certainly the most active spiritism can coexist with the most brutal denigration of women.  East Indian advedic gurus and tantric Buddhists often rigidly oppress their followers, and a rich heritage of mystical science did not prevent India fromo sinking into a sinkhole of caste and gender oppression.  In fact, the true source of reform and breaking down of social boundaries has far more often come from a strict monotheism -- among the Jewish prophets, Chinese sages like Confucius, the anti-slave movements in the Middle Ages and the Modern West, and even in India and Japan.  <p>In the end, as Dr. Borg shares his own story, he seems rather lost to me, following a "Jesus" who is a worthy enough sage, but incapable of inspiring the joyous songs he recalls with tears from his childhood.  I feel for him.  I think he is quite mistaken about the Gospels.  The more I study world religions, the more I am persuaded that Jesus is the Lord of life, who died for the sins of the world, and rose from the dead.  I think an honest assessment of the evidence leaves that as the most realistic assessment.  I am tempted to echo Dr. Borg's own words, and say, "Dr. Borg, come home, and meet Jesus again, for the first time."     <p>author, Jesus and the Religions of Man / christthetao@msn.com</span>
