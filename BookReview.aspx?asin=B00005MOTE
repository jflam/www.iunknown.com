                <span id="Label1">Packed with multimedia features, Windows XP Home Edition aims to unlock the full potential of your personal computer. It also looks great, with rounded window corners, larger and more detailed icons, and a clean-look desktop.<p>  The best thing about Windows XP is that, because it belongs to the Windows NT/2000 product family, it's designed from the ground up for reliability, security, and networking. XP Home users will soon see the benefits of this. The dreaded Windows crash-and-reboot cycle really is much less common with XP, and, provided the hardware is up to scratch, XP's performance is better, too. The downside is that using a different code base can make compatibility with old applications less assured. Business applications normally run fine, but older games, MIDI software, and system utilities may well cause problems.<p>  Windows XP is more customizable than previous versions, including its visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of Windows in an instant. Fast User Switching is a neat feature for computers used by more than one person--it lets another user log on without killing the previous user's session, and when you switch back, running applications and open documents are as you left them. This is impressive, but what really counts is that XP understands how to deal with multiple users. Each user has their own special folders, such as My Documents, which cannot be seen by other users. And for those with more than one computer, the network setup wizard simplifies setting up a network.<p>  Windows XP Home has many strong multimedia features. New Media Player lets you copy music from CD to hard disk, create your own playlist, and write your own music CDs if you have a CD writer. You can also play back DVD-Video (but only if a hardware or software DVD decoder is already installed) and play MP3 audio files and MPEG videos (but sadly not the popular RealMedia formats). Admittedly, Media Player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives, but it is slick and nicely integrated. There is also Windows Movie Maker, a basic tool for capturing and editing videos that's fun to use, although too limited for serious work.<p>  For Web browsing, XP Home comes with Internet Explorer 6.0 and MSN Explorer. The most significant new feature for Internet users is the built-in firewall. A firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks, in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online, reading private files or causing other damage. XP's built-in firewall is a simple affair, but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connections.<p>  The XP user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of Windows, but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. For example, you can add and remove shortcuts from the Start menu by right-clicking on the icon and selecting Pin or Unpin from the pop-up menu. Windows online help is integrated into a Help and Support Center that works like an internal Web site, with searchable help, tutorials, and walkthroughs. Laptop or other flat-screen users can set Windows to use ClearType for screen fonts, for a more readable display.<p>  There are, of course, some pitfalls. Windows XP Home is demanding on hardware, and it would be a mistake to install it on less than Microsoft's recommended minimum. Business users note: unlike Windows 98 or Me, XP Home Edition cannot join a Windows server domain, so the networking is peer-to-peer only--see Windows XP Professional Edition Upgrade for this functionality. There is also no multiprocessor support, and a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure requires you to obtain a code from Microsoft for full installation and any future system changes. But don't let that put you off: this is Microsoft's best Windows yet. <I>--Tim Anderson</I></span>

                    <span>I recently upgraded to Windows XP from Windows 98 Second Edition, and I have been THOROUGHLY impressed! With Windows 98 I experienced frequent blue screens and crashes. With Windows XP all of those problems are now history. Also, many of the drivers I needed to load AFTER loading Windows 98 are now already included. My video card drivers were loaded, my CD burner functions were all present, and my scanner worked flawlessly without installing any additional software.<P>The biggest hurdle with this product is successful installation. If you have older components you may have significant problems getting them to function with the new OS. Some older apps are also likely to have difficulty. My hardware and my software are all fairly current, so I had no trouble.<P>I have upgraded my newer computer at home with Windows XP, but the older computer at my church study has Windows 98, and will have it for some time. I am reluctant to upgrade because of the installation problems inevitable with the older components.<P>This product is definitely worth the price, but some persons may need to upgrade components BEFORE upgrading their OS.<P>If you have a newer or brand new computer and are seeking the smoothest, steadiest and most solid OS, I HIGHLY recommend Windows XP.</span>

                    <span>Let me start by saying do not attempt to upgrade unless you are going to do a clean install. Use the opporunity to reformat your hard drive and get rid of all the excess waste that has built up on your system over the years. If you do this and download the proper printer driver ahead of time you will be rewarded with the fastest, most stable and user friendly version of Windows ever, as well as a lot of extra disk space on your hard drive. I lost many hours trying to install over Windows ME to no avail and finally decided to backup all my important files and bite the bullet with a clean install. My E-machines 466 Celeron runs faster than ever before and it boots up faster than my friends HP Pentium III running windows ME. I love the updates to my pictures and being able to record CD-Roms with no extra software. The stability is perfect. After three weeks I have only had to reboot the computer one time due to a freeze up or "Blue Screen". This compares to once every other day with Window's ME</span>

                    <span>Approximately one year after Microsoft released its most recent 100-pound gorilla Operating System, most of my impressions of XP remain the same. The memory occupied by the two of the processes that Windows runs on 2000: Explorer.exe and Svchost.exe amounts to approx. 12 MB. Same two processes in XP take up almost 30 MB. If you don't believe me, press Ctrl+Alt-Del, and select the tab named processes. What this translates into, in layman's terms is: Windows XP is considerably heavier on the machine on which it's running. Don't even consider running it on computers with less than 256 MB, even if Microsoft says that you can run it with 128 MB alone. You'll suffer the consequences of slowness if you do.<P>Having spoken about memory, I have to say XP solves some issues that home users have been confronting for a while, such as multiple user login management. Some of the add-ons are nice, but nothing you can't work around with a few downloads: Remote desktop = terminal services, just bundled within the OS, for example; integrated DVD-playing and CD-R burning.<P>They moved around stuff, and applied some of the intelligence they've gained over the past few years (remove icons from the desktop, as most people actually don't use them, for example); and they're being extra-careful not to turn ON too many features you might not want (or afford) to have on your machine, all of which are very nice things. It seems that Microsoft was able to pull off the Operating System that all users have been expecting for the longest time.<P>Every time a new version of Windows has been released, over the course of a few months several patches have been issued to correct issues detected with it, and XP is no exception to this: the day of its release 20 MB worth of patches were ready to be downloaded from the company's web site. Microsft has continued to release patches in the course of the past ferw months, but nothing that would make you think they didn't get the thing right the first time.<P>HEADS UP: watch for a new "feature" that Microsoft bundled with the new OS. It's called Windows Activation(...) In two plates, it's aimed at giving Microsoft a buzz when/if a copy of the Operating System becomes installed in more than one machine, in fact, even if it's only installed in one machine, it warns them about the attempt to install the software in any other machine other than the native one where it was first installed.<P>Now, all in all, it's Microsoft's most stable OS so far! In the couple of months it's been running, it hasn't crashed a single time. It doesn't run all day long (like Windows 2000 Professional used to), but it has not given even the slightest problem. One final tip, though: before upgrading, double-triple check with your hardware provider to see if they have a checklist of steps to follow in order to ensure transparency in the process. I did have to uninstall some software HP knew ahead of time that wouldn't work with XP, and later reinstall the XP-compatible versions, but it was worth every single minute of the 120 minute+ step-by-step process. If you are one of those persons who does his or her own thing, then I recommend (as you should do, regardless) a fresh install after you backup all your computer's files. Good luck, and happy XP'ing!!</span>

                    <span>When I had Windows 98, my computer had a lot of problems. It was always stalling, it was unstable, and practically froze on me 2 times a day over an 8 hour usage. When I installed Windows XP the difference was completely noticeable. I stopped getting the stupid errors on the screen, and my computers functionality and power increased at least by 210%. Windows Xp has its downside though. It still has a compatibility problem with really old programs, (Try Nisus Missle Master 2.5 made back in 1992, for example). But who cares? All I've ever wanted is a computer that can go beyond its limits. Now, with Windows XP, your computer can pass every limit ever made.</span>

                    <span>You can dl service pack 1 and 2 from the MS website for free. The only reason I can think of buying the CD would be if you have a slow internet connection since the dl is quite large. Id recommend upgrading one way or the other to close some of the security holes that plague XP. As a suggestion, be sure to stop your anti virus program during the install to speed things up.</span>
