                <span id="Label1">It's a perennial source of frustration to Jane Austen's admirers that so little is known about her quiet existence as an unmarried woman seeking an outlet for her ferocious intelligence in genteel, rural England at the turn of the 19th century. Carol Shields, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for <I>The Stone Diaries</I>, has already proved herself a writer who can convey large truths with an economical amount of material, which makes her an excellent choice as Austen's biographer. Shields's brief but cogent text makes persuasive connections between Austen's novels and her life (the plethora of unsatisfactory mothers, for example, and the obvious sympathy for women barred from marriage by poverty and from careers by social custom), but she never forgets that fiction expresses first and foremost an artist's response to the world around her, not actual personal history. In fact, Shields argues, it may well have been Austen's sense that the novels she loved to read didn't provide a very accurate picture of the society she knew that fired her own work. Her merciless portraits of the economic underpinnings of marriage and family relations are in many ways more "realistic" than male writers' dramas of battle or females' fantasies of romantic bliss. As for her life's lack of incident, its one major disruption--her parents' move to Bath--prompted a nine-year silence from their formerly prolific daughter. Shields gleans as much as she can from Austen's letters, while remembering that they too gave voice to a persona, not the whole truth, in order to delineate a quirky, sometimes cranky, sometimes catty woman who was by no means the perfect maiden lady her surviving relatives sought to immortalize. An Austen biography will never be as much fun as an Austen novel, but Shields does a remarkably entertaining job of discerning the links between the two. <I>--Wendy Smith</I> </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I've read about seven biographies of Jane Austen, and this would be the one that I recommend that anyone read first.   It pretty much sums up all that is really known about Austen's life and avoids the usual hazards of wild speculation and dubious reinterpretation.   It does not desperately attempt to break new ground but considers the presentation of a solid, readable account of the subject's life as sufficient grounds for its existence.   This is not to say that I accept everything that Shields says, but she does a commendable job.
<br />
<br />There is one serious problem with this biography but I believe that it is the decision of the publisher, not the author.  There is almost nothing in the way of documentation: bibliographies, sources, notes.   I do like this the books that I have read in this series as a good introduction to the various people covered, and as far as I can tell, they are reliable, but one has to trust Penquin's reputation.   They are not scholarly.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that the reader next consider David Cecil's Portrait of Jane Austen as a look at the author in context of her time.  The interested reader should also realize that there are a variety of "specialty" books that focus on houses and places she lived in or visited.
<br />
<br />As for the other biographies that I have read by Tomalin, Nokes, Park, etc., one can get a lot of additional detail about the life of a typical woman of Austen's class, as well as trivia such as the weather around the time of her birth (Make no mistake, I LOVE such details) but the books are weighted down with pretentiousness, unfounded speculation, doubtful agendas and side interests of the authors.  By all means, I recommend them to people with an intense interest in Jane Austen, but not for the person who just wants context for her writings.</span>

                    <span>Carol Shields has deftly woven together literary analysis with biography in her reconstruction of the life and times of Jane Austen. Unfortunately I am not familiar enough with her books to fully appreciate this book. A true fan of Austen's works will enjoy this book a great deal I'm sure.</span>

                    <span>This biography is an enjoyable read for the lover of Jane Austen novels.  Written by an accomplished novelist, it sidesteps the droning tone and monotonous succession of facts that characterize most biographies.  Instead, its short chapters tell a story that is both interesting in its own right and a worthwhile companion to a study of Jane Austen's literature.<p>As a serious biography, however, this account seems to fall short.  It's light on facts (partly due to the unrecorded nature of much of Jane Austen's life - still, there's little in the way of factual information that couldn't be summarized in a magazine article) and its information is not well-documented.  There are certainly more thorough, factual accounts.  Moreover, what Shields' book lacks in hard facts it makes up for in conjecture, the kind of soft-sided narrative that makes for interesting reading but spongy research material.<p>Still, to Jane Austen fans looking for context, this is a suitable resource.  It's written with an eye to her novels and their interaction with her life as well as the emotional and practical trappings of authorship.  It gives readers insight into the atmosphere of her life, the people she knew and the places she lived, what her days were like.  It's interesting and well-written, and short, and sweet.</span>

                    <span>This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right. Each provides a concise but remarkably comprehensive biography of its subject in combination with a penetrating analysis of the significance of that subject's life and career. I think this is a brilliant concept. My only complaint (albeit a quibble) is that even an abbreviated index is not provided. Those who wish to learn more about the given subject are directed to other sources.<p>When preparing to review various volumes in this series, I have struggled with determining what would be of greatest interest and assistance to those who read my reviews. Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<p>On Austen's focus: "Jane Austen chose to focus on daughters rather than mothers in her writing (with the exception of her short and curious novel Lady Susan), but nevertheless mothers are essential in her fiction. They are the engines that push the action forward, even when they fail to establish much in the way of maternal warmth. Daughters achieve their independence by working against the family constraints, their young spirits struck from the passive, lumpish postures of their ineffectual or distanced mothers." (page 15)<p>On one of her dominant themes: "Because of her bright splintery dialogue is so often interrupted by a sad, unanswerable tone of estranged sympathy, stirred by complacent acts of hypocrisy or injustice, the reader of Austen's novels comes again and again to the reality of a persistent moral anger. It is a manageable anger, and artfully concealed by the mechanism of an arch, incontrovertible amiability." (page 57)<p>Nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh on her "isolation": "Jane Austen lived in entire seclusion from the literary world; neither by correspondence, nor by personal intercourse was she known to any contemporary authors. It is probable that she never was in company with any contemporary authors. It is probable that she never was in company with persons whose talents or whose celebrity equaled her own; so that her powers never could have been sharpened by collision with superior intellects, nor her imagination aided by their casual suggestions. Whatever she produced was a home-made article." (Page 142)<p>These brief excerpts guide and inform a careful reader's understanding of Austen's artistic achievement. They also suggest all manner of correlations between her art and personal life. As is also true of the other volumes in the "Penguin Lives" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by Carol Shields. She also includes "A Few Words About Sources" for those who wish to learn more about Jane Austen. I hope these brief excerpts encourage those who read this review to read Shields' biography. It is indeed a brilliant achievement.</span>

                    <span>I found this useful for its biographical information, but I knew nothing of Austen's life going in, so it's very possible that there are better biographies on the market. At any rate, I was constantly frustrated by Shield's take on the novels. Emerson once famously complained that Austen writes only marriage novels. Shields, in effect, responds that the novels aren't just about marriage. Rather, they're also about the conditions of women -- in particular, women of the lesser gentry -- at the turn of the 19th century, and the manner in which marriage is their only means of escape from the drudgery of their prosaic lives. For what it's worth, this idea -- Austen is great because she holds a mirror up to the real conditions of women at the time -- threatens to make Austen look like the Edith Wharton of the early 19th century. What makes Austen great (and Wharton merely very good) is the fact that there's so much more to Austen's novels. Unfortunately, Shields doesn't take anything save Austen's "social commentary" (such as it is) into account. In particular, she completely misses the exceptional depth of Austen's attention to moral psychology. Shields at one point refers to Gilbert Ryle's (unfortunately neglected) study of Austen's novels. My sense is that this book suffers from it's author's failure to appreciate Ryle's main point. Anyone really interested in a sensitive account of what makes Austen's novels so great would be much better served by reading Ryle's essay and leaving this book to one side.</span>
