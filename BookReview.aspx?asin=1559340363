                    <span>I've readed a lot of books about swimming and I must declare that this one is probably the best.<br>It analise every aspect of this sport and supported by an impressionant bibliography it can separate facts from suppositions and errors.<br>This book has helped me to understand the deepest aspect of training and swim propulsion in the four strokes, and it can be well used in addiction with other manuals.<br>I'm emotionally waiting for Maglischo next work.</span>

                    <span>This is the best swimming book I have ever read.  Everything a swimmer or coach needs: training principles, swimming technique, and mental aspects of the sport. It covers everything even how you should split your race. Lots of drills for every stroke.</span>

                    <span>I'm primarily a rower, so I can't speak about the swimming-specific sections of this book.  But I can rave about the more generally applicable sections.  I've used this book for several years to design training  programs for various rowing events, from 500 meters (about 1.5-2 minutes)  to 2,000 meters (about 7-8 minutes) to head races (20 minutes and longer).   Maglischo's explanations of how to balance the levels of effort in a  training program for sprint or endurance events is tremendously helpful, as  are the explanations of how to periodize training programs and create  daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly programs.  <p>The only tiny criticism I  have of this book is that I would find it slightly more useful if the  swimming distances included approximate times for the events.  That way, it  would make transferring the principles to comparable events in different  sports more straightforward.  <p>I recommend this book to any coach or  athlete of any racing sport.  You'll find not only physiological issues  addressed, but also issues concerning pacing and race strategy -- a must  for anyone desiring an internal focus during racing.</span>

                    <span>This book has served me well as a coach for many years, and I have given it as a gift to several coaches and top swimmers.  Whether or not you care to get lost in the endless debate over Bernoulli versus Newton, this book  has much more to offer. I trained under Ernie Maglischo and this book has  served as the marvelous manifestation of his patient and persistent work on  deck.  I recommend it without reservation.</span>
