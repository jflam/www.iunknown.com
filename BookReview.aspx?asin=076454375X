                    <span>Accessing databases and datastores via the internet is becoming commonplace today. This book gives developers the fundamentals of what databases are, how to connect to them with ADO.NET, how to access/manipulate the database information and, especially, how to present it in meaningful ways using ASP.NET controls and VB.NET. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to grow beyond static-content web pages and begin development of data-driven web applications.<P> Written by a team of 10 professionals with different areas of expertise, this book provides a solid foundation for creating web applications that rely on creating, modifying, and displaying information accessed from an SQL database, although the source can be any data repository that has an OLEDB or ODBC driver written for it. Filled with many rich examples, both in the text and in the hands-on exercises, the authors go beyond the "this is the code you need to insert" paradigm and explain what each section of code is doing, reinforcing lessons learned from earlier examples as necessary. The exercises can either be typed in or run from source downloaded from the WROX Press website, both are error-free. The book is full of tips and best-practice methodologies, with an entire chapter devoted to performance considerations. The exercises were tested on students in a school lab and common mistakes are presented in a section of each chapter. WROX Press also has multiple levels of support available to those who need it. The book finally culminates in a "real world" online-auction application that covers all the bases and gives comprehensive substance to the theory and examples previously presented. ---Reveiwed by William S.</span>

                    <span>It is not until you read a book that is dedicated to using databases in ASP.NET that you realize just how much there is to learn. This is a very readable & well structured book with excellent 'Try It Out' examples that provide easy to follow step-by-step guides.<P>Obviously understanding data readers, datasets, command objects and web server controls is vital but there are some rare and extremely useful chapters: componentization - leveraging class libraries for data access, performance, and a chapter that discusses Data-Driven ASP.NET application in the Real World that raises some very interesting issues; for example security tips, raising your own database errors & organizing your code.<P>The authors not only provide information that you would expect but they offer every encouragement to raise the bar by discussing ways to do things even better; for example 'A Better Connection String', creating Data Access classes, and fine tuning dataset & datareaders.</span>

                    <span>I've been reading some of the other reviews on this page, and I can't believe they are reading the same book. I have had problems running the code in several of these exercises, particularly with any code that has the DataGrid control. I've also noticed I'm not the only with this problem, since I have browsed the Wrox website forums and found others who were having the same problems with the code. I even submitted code from Chapter 3, page 67 to Microsoft Support, after receiving nothing but a blank page when I ran it. Microsoft noticed that the code was MISSING a required clause! The exercise in question is the FIRST exercise in the book. If the first exercise you attempt fails even though you made no typos, it's frustrating. I can easily see a novice programmer getting discouraged and giving up. I'm an experienced ASP programmer and even I was getting fed up!<P>I've been a big fan of other books by Wrox, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.</span>

I have found it to be a great foundation book on its subject matter.<P>The authors should get an atta boy for this one.</span>

                    <span>This was my first book on .NET and I think it was a great tool to help me learn the basics of database programming. After building on the basic concepts it goes on into deeper knowledge and real world examples. This book was the only resource I used to not only get started but to continue using as my desktop reference. The book has lots of examples and it's very detailed on the explanations. The authors have a clear and concise style that does not overwhelm the reader with extremely complex details. I recommend this book if you are a beginer on ASP.NET and I also think it serves as a good refenrece.</span>
