                <span id="Label1">The idea of a "category"--a sort of mathematical universe--has brought about a remarkable unification and simplification of mathematics. Written by two of the best-known names in categorical logic, Conceptual Mathematics is the first book to apply categories to the most elementary mathematics. It thus serves two purposes: first, to provide a key to mathematics for the general reader or beginning student; and second, to furnish an easy introduction to categories for computer scientists, logicians, physicists, and linguists who want to gain some familiarity with the categorical method without initially committing themselves to extended study.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book for non-professional mathematicians, like me (I'm a software engineer), who wants to understand modern mathematics and apply its ideas in analysis of complex problems. Lots of pictures and diagrams (compared to terse wording in other mathematical books) really help to understand and master the subject. I think most of negative reviews come from professional mathematicians, but they don't need this book.</span>

                    <span>As a topic in itself, category theory should need not to wait until grad-level to be described just because that may be when category theory's power can really begin to be exploited, but unfortunately, most of the category theory books I have looked at presume that level of mathematics.<P>Similar to what other reviewers noted, I would also say that this book demonstrates the potential of creating a good high-school/undergrad level intro to category theory. But unfortunately, that potential is not quite realized here.<P>There are hokey intermittent "conversations with students", as a tool to describe ideas, that are more distraction than aid. Some of the examples given are rather condescending in their simplicity. Yet, at other times the authors seem to breeze through more difficult topics with little or no examples. And the organization seems erratic - there is no clear sense of a gameplan as to where they are leading the reader or how all the concepts fit together. <P>Functors are surprisingly almost glossed over, as if they were relatively unimportant. There are exercises throughout the book, but with no answers provided, they are not really very helpful.<P>Having said all that, with some focused effort on the reader's part, the ideas do come forth, and admittedly, the authors do cover a fairly broad spectrum of aspects of category theory. This is certainly a non-trivial topic to try and teach, and an introductory book cannot be faulted for not carrying every notion to the nth-degree of either breadth or depth. <P>Category Theory is one of those topics that (to me) appears 'ho-hum' until you see it actually applied to various topics. The authors have necessarily had to perform a balancing act between describing concepts while not getting caught up in excessively complex examples. I think this will leave many readers less than satisfied, but realistically, the book would have been twice as long had they really delved deeper into examples (or they would have had to be very terse in the actual descriptions of category theory, which is the choice most authors writing for a more mathematically-inclined audience seem to make - e.g., _Mathematical Physics_ by Geroch (good book!) or _Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists_ by Pierce).<P>If you are mathematically astute, you probably will find this book tedious. But if you are not a grad+ math major, then this book may well be worth the effort as a way to begin to learn a very profound and powerful set of tools and concepts.</span>

                    <span>I sure hope Schanuel wrote this book and the publisher simply tacked on<BR>Lawvere's name for marketing purposes. This text is a fantastic<BR>example of why research mathematicians should not write for John Q.<BR>Public. The random, pointless examples scattered throughout the book<BR>remind me of the "word problems" that were so popular in high school<BR>algebra texts written after the Chicago School hijacked the educational<BR>textbook market.<P>After teasing the reader with examples of real mathematics, e.g.<BR>Pick's Formula, the authors stop short of actually proving a theorem<BR>and scurry back to their shelter of objects and arrows where they can<BR>safely field trivial questions by ersatz students with politically<BR>correct names.<P>Perhaps Category Theory is just not something that is accessible to the<BR>general public? High school math teachers (I assume one intended<BR>audience for the text) that can achieve even the slightest appreciation<BR>of why Eilenberg and Mac Lane invented Category Theory are surely as<BR>rare as rocking-horse poop.<P>What I would really like to see from someone as eminent as Lawvere write a<BR>first year graduate level book that covers elementary set theory and/or<BR>logic using Category Theory. Translating Model Theory and Topoi(1.) to<BR>this level would be a good start. College math professors are really<BR>the only people in a position to understand and transmit this beautiful<BR>theory to aspiring mathematicians.<P>1.

                    <span>There is a wonderful course in category theory for high school students, just begging to be excavated from this multi-layered book.<BR>Please don't be put off by the disjointed and uneasy combination of materials that cluster around certain themes. You know you will have a lot of work to do when the same definition (of monomorphism) is presented both on page 52 and also on page 336. <BR>With all the elementary themes covered in many varying ways, it would be best to consider this book as having been structured as a retract for which your job will be to construct the appropriate section.</span>

                    <span>As a first introduction to Categories, this book is well written, clever, simple and very clear. However, I was disappointed with it. From the notoriety of the authors and the, yes, cool illustrations I assumed it would be a gem. However, it fell short. I've been toying with Category Theory for a few years, and every time I try to get into a book on Categories I get stumped at the notions of Functors and Natural Transformations. This book, however, dealt with neither at length, despite the fact that Category Theory originated around the notion of Natural Transformations in the first place. (As I understand it at least.) That said, there are many very cool passages in the book, including a functional analysis of a Chinese restaurant and an elegent exposition of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem.<P>Still, for my purposes, I prefer Robert Goldblatt's "Topoi: The Categorical Analysis of Logig" and Michael Barr's "Category Theory for Computing Science". As both are intended for non Category Theorists, both build their presentations of Category Theory from sratch. Sadly, I think both are out of print. Not for the faint of heart, I'm told Saunders Mac Lane's "Categories for the Working Mathematician" is the classic. (It's on my wish list.)</span>
