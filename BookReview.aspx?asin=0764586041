                    <span>JWD at RMU<p>The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn "Critique"<p>Huckleberry Finn introduces himself as someone who appeared in an earlier book reminding us of what happened towards the end of that story.  Though he won't mention it until later in the story, when his irresponsible father has left him by his self.  Huck has been living with Ms. Douglas a widow, a kind woman who wants to teach him all the things his father has neglected, the things all normal kids would usually learn.<p>He tells us about Miss Watson, the widow's sister, who is strict on teaching Huck good manners and religion, and about Tom Sawyer and his stories, a boy like Huck looks up to because of his wide reading and imagination ability.  He is also friendly with Jim, the black slave.  Huck's father returns and takes him away from the widow.  A pig has murdered when his father begins beating him, Huck runs away and makes it look as though Huck.  He hides out on a nearby island, intending to take off after his neighbors stop searching for his assumed dead body. <p>Jim the black slave of Miss. Watson is also hiding on the island, since he has run away from Miss Watson, who was about to sell him and separate him from his wife and his deaf little girl. They decide to escape together, and when they find a large raft, their journey on the Mississippi River begins.  After a couple of adventures on the Mississippi River, a steamboat hits their raft, and Huck and Jim are separated.  Huck goes ashore and finds himself at the home of the Grangerfords, which allow him to come and live with them.  At first Huck admires these people for what he thinks is their class and good taste.  But when he learns about the deaths caused by a feud with another family, he becomes disgusted with the Grangerfords.  By this time Jim had time to repair the raft, and Huck rejoins him.  Two men who are escaping the law and who claim to be a duke and the son of the king of France soon join them.  Huck knows they are actually small-time crooks, but he pretends to believe their stories.<p>After watching these frauds bilk people of their money in two towns, Huck is forced to help them try to swindle an inheritance out of three young girls who were recently orphaned.  He goes along at first because he doesn't want them to turn Jim in, but eventually he decides that the thieves have gone too far.  He invents a complicated plan to escape and to have them arrested.  The plan almost works, but at the last minute the two crooks show up and continue to travel with Huck and Jim.  When all their moneymaking schemes begin to fail, they sell Jim to a farmer in one of the towns they're visiting.  Huck learns about this and decides to free Jim.  The farmer turns out to be Tom Sawyer's uncle, and through a misunderstanding he and his wife think Huck is Tom. When Tom himself arrives, Huck brings him up to date on what's happening.  Tom pretends to be his own brother Sid, and the two boys set about to rescue Jim.<p>The true to his imaginative style, Tom devises a plan that is more complicated than it has to be.  Eventually they actually pull it off and reach the raft without being caught.  Tom, however, has been shot in the leg, and Jim refuses to leave until the wound has been looked at.  The result is that Jim is recaptured and Tom and Huck have to explain what they have done.  Tom, it turns out, knew all along that Miss Watson had set Jim free in her will, so everyone can now return home together.  Huck, however, thinks he's had enough of civilization, and hints that he might take off for the Indian Territory instead of going back to his home.</span>
