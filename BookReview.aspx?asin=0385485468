                    <span>Harvey Mackay shows the reader - be it Homemaker or Fortune 500 Exec - why everyone needs a network. This is not another oh-so-common how-to book that reads more like the author's bio and collection of non-relevant stories - his personal experiences and humorous anecdotes truly illustrate the importance of why everyone needs a network. After he has you convinced that WHO you know is as important as WHAT you know, he then takes it a step further and tells you HOW to go about doing it. I have not had the attention span to read an entire book in over two years - I DEVOURED and ABSORBED this in 24 hours. P.S.: Add my e-mail address to your Rolodex</span>

                    <span>This is the best networking book I have ever read. Networking is the key to my business where I put together groups of executives who help each other. Whether in business or not, these ideas are for everyone. I have When you meet a couple you have not met before, ask how they met and they will begin to tell you the story of their lives, you quickly have new best friends. Someone I know reads the "Who's News" column in the Wall Street Journal daily and set up a system to track anyone he ever met. He is very successful and loved by all. Mr. Mackay is on the right track. Start early and network often. His ideas about how to stand out from the crowd are good. And, although it sounds like a lot to do, start slowly and add one program every few months. You will be glad you did. Networking will help you in other ways too.</span>

                    <span>Diq your well before you're thirsty is the only networking book you'll ever need. In 83 chapters and 310 pages you'll learn everything you need to know to succeed.<P>My first Mackay book was the famous "Swim with the Sharks without getting eaten alive." A book that helped millions of Americans. Now Mackay delves deep ino the art of which he's a master: networking. In todays shark-eat-shark economy, talent alone will not save you. Genuis will not. Experience will not. Guts and hard work will not. If you need a job money, advice, help, hope, or a means to make a sale, there's only one surefire, fail safe place to find them---in your network. But only if you have one.<P>Dig your well before you're thirsty contains Harvey's gold-chip advice, accumulated over a lifetime of business success, on how to build and maintain the network you need. Harvey guarantees you'll never be more than a phone call away from a person in the position to help you get what you want---whether it's the job opportunity of a lifetime or a lifetime partner, the sales prospect of your dreams or the career advice you've only dreamed of. HArvey shows you how to create a network of trusted, valuable contacts that is worth it's weight in platinum.<P>Harvey is uniquely qualified to write this book drawing on his own networking success. You will learn from Harvey's own energizing examples and those he gleaned from world-class networkers like Muhammed Ali, Lou Holtz, Erma Bombeck, Larry King, and Pat O'Brien.<P>Harvey is at his practical, insightful, entertaining best and shows step by step:<P>* how to get to know the people you need to know<P>* how to ask for what you need when you need it<P>* how to keep relationships up to date and alive<P>* how to sparkle in the information age and on the internet<P>* how to unlock any door...anywhere...at any time.<P>Harvey Mackay is more than just a bestselling author and one of America's most sought after busineess speakers, but he is a man who has done it himself and is still an active CEO.<P>Toastmasters International has called him one of the top five speakers in the world. Two of Harveys books made the top 15 inspiritual-self help book list by the New York Times.<P>Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty is replete with "Harvey-isms" like "Networking is not a numbers game. The idea is not to see how many people you can meet; the idea is to compile a list of people you can count on" and "Most people have never figured out that it is better to spend time with fewer people at a one-hour cocktail party amd have a meaningful dialogue than practice the andering-eye routine and lose the respect of most of the people they meet."<P>In these shark-infested times, Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty is a must read, provides real stories and information from the real world with real solutions. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>If you want to read more self-help books but you're tired of the same old put-on-a-happy-face drivel, this may be the book for you. The main theme of the book is this: keep a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of people you meet and stay in touch with them. Moreover, do occasional favors for them because you might someday need favors FROM them.<P>The book is interesting. It is liberally dosed with anecdotes and second-person pronouns--two factors which help greatly in making a book interesting.<P>However, I'm ashamed that I haven't put the book into better practice. In response to the book, I made an e-mail mailing list of people whom I know and sent them an annual newsletter--except that I skipped last year because I didn't have anything to say.<P>I hope you read this book, and I hope you put it into practice better than I have.</span>
