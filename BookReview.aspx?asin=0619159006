                    <span>I had this book over a year. I started reading it when I passed my first ocp exam (1z0-001). This book is very organized and sufficiently detailed to give you a solid knowledge to master the topic covered in the exam 1z0-031, Fundamentals I. I think this book is not written for someone who wants to rush in getting certified. If you take your time and read this book you will get a solid knowledge of the topic covered in the exam 1z0-031, Fundamentals I. The book walks you through some pratices that build over time a complete understanding of the topic on the exam. But I did not rely mainly on this book for the exam 1z0-031. Since the book does not have a lot of practice exam questions I had to use other references such as the Sybex book by (Chip Dawes and Biju Thomas) and the oracle press book by (J. Couchman and Sudheer Marisetti). Those are good books too. But they tend to focus more on the idea of "what you need to know to get certified". The Sybex book is pretty good with Chapters well-structured and explained. The Oracle press book provides more practice exam questions that I used to test my knowledge of the topic.<br>I will definitely recommend this book to ocp candidates. I give 5 stars. I will probably buy the one related to exam 1z0-032, Fundamentals II<br>DeKalb, IL US</span>

                    <span>Oracle occupies over 30% database market in the world. So Oracle's skill is valuable. But it is difficult to learn in the beginning. Although a lot of courses, they are expensive. This book gives u the beginning. After finish it, you will have confidence to take the examination. But if u learn more about Oracle on Linux platform. I am sure that you can find a job in the world. This book is good.</span>

                    <span>I find this book very informative and worth buying for your regular usage&reference. Though it did not cover advanced topics and give more examples in general but the flow of this book is very good and easy to understand. I strongly recommend this book for the people who want to know more about the details of Oracle9i Architecture&Administration.</span>
