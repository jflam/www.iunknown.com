                    <span>I'm shocked by some of the negative reviews. This book has been in print for many years and gave me the foundation for my professional work. I photograph dogs (as a second career) and this book is great! I used to read it over and over again.</span>

                    <span>This book is poorly written and is boring in my opinion. There are many other books on this subject that you should consider. Look at the Nation Geo or Kodak books. The writer's of this book do not know how to teach. Once you look over it, this book will sit on your shelf never to be opened again.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent resource providing both insight and instruction. It also explains the artistic side of photography and shows various effects of composition, lens and selective focusing e.g.The pronciples descibed apply to the whole gamut of photography black and white, print vs slide, medium format, 35 mm etc. Every new and not so new photographer should have this in their library.</span>

                    <span>This is a very well organized and concise book on photocomposition. It has a very thoughtful progression of the covered subjects, taking the reader from basic concepts of graphic design to the practical presentational and psychological principals. From the 5 main chapters of the book I found chapters 2 "Graphic Controls" and chapter 5 "Total Control" the best chapters from the point of view of richness of presentation and its practical value. The other chapters seemed to me shallower and less focused. I share the dissatisfaction of other reviewers with the presented photographs. Even though I understand that those photographs are carefully selected not for their extreme photographic value, but rather for their association with the subject of the topic they are presented for, I assume that the authors could had done a better job of finding or making more appealing pictures. Without a rich set of photographs this books seems to be a bit more "theoretical" then a book on photography, I believe, should be.<P>On the other note, I noted that despite the very careful selection and sequence of presentation of the main subjects, most of them are not covered as deeply as they deserve to. This being a disadvantage on one hand could easily be considered as an advantage, because the book does not overwhelm the reader with details, leaving enough space for creativity.<P>Overall I consider the book to be very useful and educational, especially for high end amature and beginner professional photographers.<P>Despite some criticism presented, I still rate it with 5 stars, which I think the book fully deserves.</span>

                    <span>This book has a very good discussion of Photographic Composition covering all the basics needed for those desiring to improve. The pictures are excellent and illustrate the principles well. However, some of the discussion lacks the depth that I would like. <P>The best book I've found is "Image:Designing Effective Pictures" by Michael Freeman. This has a thorough discussion of all the techniques with excellent illustrations and diagrams. Unfortunately, it is no longer in print. I was able to get a used hardcover copy in very good condition for [$]. It's a must read for those desiring a firm grasp of the basics. Worth treasuring.</span>
