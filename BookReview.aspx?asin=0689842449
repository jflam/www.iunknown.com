                <span id="Label1"><P> In autumn, a strong wind blows flower seeds high in the air and carries them far across the land. One by one, many of the seeds are lost -- burned by the sun, fallen into the ocean, eaten by a bird. But some survive the long winter and, come spring, sprout into plants, facing new dangers -- trampled by playing children, picked as a gift for a friend. Soon only the tiniest seed remains, growing into a giant flower and, when autumn returns, sending its own seeds into the wind to start the process over again. <P> <B>Eric Carle's</B> eloquent text and brilliant collages turn the simple life cycle of a plant into an exciting story, a nature lesson, and an inspiring message of the importance of perseverance.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book. I think that this is a very inspiring story to people who might think they are too small and won't amount to anything. This is not true in this case, it just takes a little longer to develop. The others develop quckly, and they end up ending quickly to. When he keeps going on, and never really gives up. He sure thinks about giving up a lot but never really does. In the end it will work out better for the person who has to try hard to get through everything, something bad is bound to happen to you. When you tr and never give up, you will succeed. You will become bigger and better than anyone who got an east way through life. <BR> Because you had to go through so much on your journey, when everyone else had it easy,when they have to strugge to get through things, you will get to sit back and relax.<BR> And this story demonstrates that just because you are small you can't grow bigger or can't do things. ...</span>

                    <span>If you want a good book for your children and want to educate them at the same time? Yes? Then you should read this book to them it tells the kids how a read gets from the plant then the seeds spread all over. In a cycle over and over. This story tells about a tiny seed like it was any person in the world because every one is different and this seed is different from all the others.</span>
