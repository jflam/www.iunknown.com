                <span id="Label1">What do you get when you combine the resources and ethos of the BBC with the literary panache of one of the world's best narrative historians? The answer is Simon Schama's <I>History of Britain</I> television series. In this well-written and thoughtfully crafted survey, Schama, the bestselling author of books on European cultural history such as <I>The Embarrassment of Riches</I> and <I>Citizens</I>, has managed to be both conventional and provocative. He tells the official version of Britain's story--Roman Britain, the Norman Conquest, the struggles of the Henrys and Richards, Elizabeth I, Scottish rebellions and the English Civil Wars, the American Revolution, the growth of the British Empire, Queen Victoria, the industrial age, and Winston Churchill. But while sticking to a script familiar to anyone who sat up and listened during history class, Schama brings it all alive with memorable prose and presence--Simon de Montfort's rebel parliament is described as inaugurating the "union between patriotism and insubordination"; with Henry VIII, Schama says, "you could practically smell the testosterone." Schama is also particularly enlightening on the symbolism of buildings, memorials, language, and ceremonies, and on the complex relations between England and its Celtic and Catholic neighbors. If history must have gloss, then let it be presented like this. <I>--Miles Taylor</I></span>

                    <span>Like others, I was hoping that I had found a definitive, unbiased and honest history of Britain here.

Every time he speaks he circulates his shoulders (one forward and one back)and thrusts his chin toward the camera. Maybe this is a pysical deformity and I should be more sensitive. But I am sorry, for the money it costs to buy this thing I have to say it should be more watchable; it can make it really difficult to concentrate on what is being said. This visual annoyance is not at all helped by the high class tone and smugness of his speech in which his sarcastic delivery has the effect of talking down to the viewers and not, as perhaps he had imagined, win them over to his point of view without question.<br>Regretfully, low points for style are not made up for with outstanding substance. It's a good general refresher of English history so long as you are smart enough to listen for the missing facts. Some of my main criticisms include his presenting myth as honest history in the case of the whereabouts and final resting place of English King Harold's body after his defeat by Norman King William The Conqueror in 1066. He also refers to this period as "early British history." Just saying that reveals his historical ineptitude and/or basic arrogant attitude to the earlier Celtic and Celtic-Romano British history. On that note he does even mention the word 'Celtic' once when he briefly covers that enormous period of history. Every thing is either Iron Age this or Ion Age that - even Queen Boudica is an Iron Age Queen - We are fairly certain she didn't speak English so I guess she could only have spoken 'Iron Age' as her first language. Of course, the words 'Anglo' and 'Saxon' are used over and over again to describe the next era of history following the Celtic and Celtic-Roman ages. <br>For anyone who misses the point here, answer this question: Why doesn't he (and other revisionist historians) simply refer to a Saxon king as a Dark-Age king or Dark Age Britain instead of Saxon Britain?</span>

                    <span>Mr. Schama does a great job on a very broad subject. In that He takes a very hard and realistic look upon his nations history that makes for a good story. His choice of locations, facts and music are outstanding! He is a great storyteller. This Film is well worth the time money.</span>

                    <span>Schama's History of Britain is indeed a fine introduction to British History (or at least British History through English eyes). This documentary series is very well made and deserves all the 5 star ratings it get's at this site. However, no one seems to mention that this DVD set released by A&E/The History Channel is actually a cropped version, modified to fit a standard TV screen. This series was shot by the BBC in widescreen, as much to take advantage of the new widescreen medium as to project the panoramic grandeur of British history. 
<br />
<br />Both the Region 2 (UK & Europe) and Region 4 (Australia & New Zealand) versions are all in the original 1.85:1 widescreen (enhanced for widescreen TV). Only in America are we afforded the singular privilege of watching this show in a crappy Pan-&-Scan format courtesy of A&E/The History Channel.
<br />
<br />The best buy right now would be to get the UK edition sold under the BBC's own label. Not only does it have 6 discs (1 disc of special features) compared to 5 in the American version, it is also much cheaper. You can get it through Amazon UK (at a 43% discount as of this date). Just make sure your system is able to play Region 2 discs and has native PAL capability. UK programs are recorded in PAL format rather than standard American NTSC.</span>
