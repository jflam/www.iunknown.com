                <span id="Label1">Concise but thorough, this second edition of <i>C# Essentials</i> introduces the Microsoft C# programming language, including the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) and .NET Framework Class Libraries (FCL) that support it. This book?s compact format and terse presentation of key concepts serve as a roadmap to the online documentation included with the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK; the many examples provide much-needed context.  Updated to cover the final release of the C# language, <i>C# Essentials</i> is an easy way for experienced programmers to evaluate and get up to speed quickly on the language best suited to developing web applications and services on the new Microsoft .NET platform.</span>

                    <span>The joy of O'Reilly books is that are concise. You can pick up this book and read it in two days and start writing C# code immediately. This book covers all of the major elements of C#, but without lots of handholding.<P>If you're a beginning developer, this will be a poor choice. However, if you you're a fairly experienced C++ developer, I would strongly recommend this book.<P>I've printed out the C# Language Reference. I know all the answers are in it somewhere, but it's nearly 300 pages of dense writing. Rather than wading through it, I paid $15 for this book and I'm now writing C# code steadily and easily. I refer back to this book for quick reference questions (what's the format for setting a property, what does a COM interop call look like etc.) and then go online or to the language spec for deeper questions.<P>If you want to get up to speed on C# quickly, this book should meet your needs well.</span>

                    <span>If you are interested in programming in C#, just curious or want a reference text then this is a very good book. Being at around 185 pages this book gets right to the point, so it is for programmers familiar with languages like Java, C/C++ or those that are experienced. It contains a language reference and introduction into the .NET framework and class library. It does not cover using Visual Studio .NET and RAD application development. Topics pertaining to the .NET framework are restricted to a few areas, with a few small examples, with pointers given to where to look in the framework SDK online help. If you want to pursue your interest in C# then you can get a more thorough book to follow C# Essentials, but this is still useful as a small quick reference to the language.</span>

                    <span>C# Essentials by O'Reilly is a small, yet complete reference of the C# language. In less than 200 pages it contains a complete specification of the language. Having worked with C# since before it was public beta, and the only documentation that existed was a specification within Microsoft, I was surprised to open the book and learn new things about the language that I was not aware of.<BR>Chapter 1 - Introduction<BR>The first chapter gives a brief introduction to the language and it's relation to the .NET programming paradigm. The one issue I had was the use of the term "Component orientation." The use of the overloaded term "Component" to describe a single class has confused many people and its use in here was no different.<BR>Chapter 2 - C# Language Reference<BR>Chapter 2 is a complete reference of the syntax and features of the language. This chapter really shines. It provides complete explanations of the language features without being too wordy. Additionally, it provides real world contexts for using the features that keeps the usefulness out of academia.<BR>One piece that's incongruent with the recommended coding standards published by Microsoft is that the author places curly brackets on the same line as the construct, rather than moving them to the next line.<BR>Chapter 3 - Programming the .NET Framework<BR>Chapter 3 gives a great introduction to the .NET framework as it relates to C# and covers things such as string use, collections, regular expressions, attributes, threading, COM interop, and others.<BR>Chapter 4 - Framework Class Library Overview<BR>Chapter 4 gives a brief overview of where to find major functionality within the .NET framework. It doesn't go into detail of how to use the class library, but does give an overview of where things are. This chapter probably could have been left out, since the framework is well organized into pretty descriptive namespaces, and the book didn't elaborate enough to be useful.<BR>Chapter 5 - Essential .NET Tools<P>Being only 4 pages, this chapter could have probably been called an index. It lists out the utilities distributed with the .NET framework and provides an abstract of their function.<BR>Conclusion<BR>Chapter 2 and 3 alone are worth buying this book. If you're looking for a concise C# reference, or are looking to migrate from C# from another language, this is the book for you.</span>
