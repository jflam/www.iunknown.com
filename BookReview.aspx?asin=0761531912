                    <span>I read the book page by page and I must say it is the best book on Direct3D so far. Here are the pros:<P>At the beginning of the book, you got an introduction how to configure Visual C/C++ 6 and the DirectX 8 SDK to start immediately. You will be able to get into 3D very fast with the introduction to 3D. The introduction to COM/HAL and Direct3D concentrates on the most important aspects. The chapters on transformations show the complete functionality of transformations. You can learn how to program two independent objects and a camera. This is the starting point for every game and especially space shooters. The chapters on the usage of files to store models give you a very good understanding on the in's and out's of file usage. You will understand the usage of the popular md3 file format used by Quake 3 game titles by examining a md3 viewer. Details of the Direct3D common files framework are covered at the end of the book. So if you like to jump into the details first, read the appendix, although it is easier for starters to start reading the book from the beginning.<P>This is a book for a novice Direct3D programmer and it helps you to understand 3D programming from scratch. .... this book -that covers Direct3D 8- is even better. Read it.</span>

                    <span>I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I've been waiting for a long time for a decent Direct3D book to refer beginners to, and this is one of the best so far. On the other hand, being the "best" among Direct3D books really isn't saying much, and this book is far from perfect.<BR><P>Overall, this book covers a lot of good material, including some of the more advanced aspects of DX8, and the code itself is pretty solid. Unfortunately, the explanations can be a little hard to understand, partially due to the fact that the author isn't a native English speaker (the chapters on physics and collision detection don't suffer this problem, though, being written by someone else), so you may find yourself having to reread things several times.<BR><P>I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have some game programming and DirectX knowledge, but I would recommend it for someone who wants to get up to speed on the latest version of D3D, especially if they have used a previous version of Direct3D - or even another 3D API - or if they are willing to put the effort into working through the chapters to dig out the (truly useful) information they contain.</span>

                    <span>This books is one of the most worthless titles ever to be released by a publishing company! Prima Tech editors should have seen it coming and scrapped this book before it ever hit the shelves. The book "Multiplayer Game Prgramming" by Todd Barren, a book designed to help you understand how to make multiplayer capable games, does a better job explaining DirectXGraphics (Direct3D8) than this trashy book does... This is a terrible waist of time. This book was reviewed by Game Developer Magazine, and explains a ton of mistakes, and complete inaccuracies...like:<P>This book neglects to cover the most "revolutionary" features introduced in the DirectX8 SDK, vertex shaders and pixel shaders, but covers something as advaced as anisotropic reflection. So the shaders weren't left out because they were too complicated, who knows why they were left out!<P>This book is littered with grammatical, technical, and formatting errors. Example: The exponants are left out of almost every equation in the book. Page 475 has 42 missing exponants. <BR>The reviewer also noted that the description of 3d rotation is just plain WRONG! <BR>Also this book contains an introduction to C++, not like many 3D programmers are going to need that.<BR>The entire physics chapter is only 8 pages long, and the first 2 of those 8 focuse only on 3D math.<P>The reviewer was obveously very unhappy with what he found in the book, just as I was. He gave it 1 out of 5 stars. Oh and by the way, the reviewer was Mark Deloura, a programmer who has worked with OpenGL and it's predecessors for more than 10 years now, and very well known / respected.<P>Heed mine and Mark Deloura's warning, don't buy this book!</span>

                    <span>The book Beginning Direct3D Game Programming is an excellent book that truly accomplishes what it sets out to do. The example programs give you a head start to start your own engine. No other book has such a great chapter on multitexturing. Just read it and you never have a problem with alpha blending or multitexturing.<BR>The best book you can get for the buck ... period.</span>
