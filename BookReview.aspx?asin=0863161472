                    <span>... on the history of Black Women in the world. The author basically brainstormed many facts to the reader. Nearly all were fascinating and interesting. <p>However, Sharp, fails to provide an adequate bibliography,  footnotes or other sources for her facts and quotes. Also, she included too  many sarcastic captions (via comic book fashion) which were very degrading  to Black Women (and the crass language was not appreciated either). For  these 2 reasons, I give this book only 3 out of 5 stars. <p>The author has  wonderful information but did not treat the subject of Black Women in world  history with the respect and sacredness it deserved. Nevertheless, the book  is a good start. I recommend with hesitation. For immediate follow-up: a  better, more scholarly book is Ivan Van Sertima's Black Women in Antiquity.</span>

                    <span>This book is written by Suandra Harp and it is written in a very entertaining style. The author makes you feel comfortable in the first few pages and makes you feel relaxed that this is going to be an easy  book.<p>The book is divide into 6 or 7 sections dealing with many aspects  of Black Women Influence. For example, one of the sections at the end of  the book focuses on how black women fight in the army and how they have  have fought in many wars. Another section talks about how black women were  part of history and how Cleopatra was really black.<p>The book is written  in very, very easy language and there are probably words on each page which  makes it quick to read. There are also picutres and many quotes from books  to support her point. <p>She tries to show in the book that Black Women  were the orignal beauties and that white people originated from  blacks.<p>Now comes my personal thought of the book<p>The book was good in  the sense that it was very easy to read and it had many sources but the  book portrays as black women being basically perfect and that a lot of  their problems were caused by whites.<p>The book did not show to many  opposing opinions. For example, in the book she talks about Cleopatra being  black but she doesn't give facts to support. This might seem a  contridiction to what I said earlier about her using sources but her  sources in certain parts are from refutable sources.<p>But all in all the  book is good in the sense that it does have some good information about the  history of black women. It talks about how they fought for civil rights and  how they fought for women's rights and many other accomplishments that  black women are responsible for.<p>Buy this book for a fairly good history  of black women.</span>

                    <span>Saundra Sharp has done a great job of blending fact, mythology, speculation and commentary into a riff on Black womanhood that plays like sassy jazz. I bought copies for myself, my friends, my nieces, my daughter  AND my son! If you've ever wondered about the magic and mystique of Black  women, this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>I must say that this book is one of the most damaging and dangerous book to black woman I have yet to read.  The beginning of this book focuses on the afrocentric view of creationism which yes is a theory, however she never fully develops the concept.  The problem with her book is that she does not have a point to many of her chapters.  She uses sarcasim and inunnedo profusely without elaboration.  Ms. Sharp then proceeds to "call out" fellow African Americans in history for their "wrongs" done to other African Americans.  She also makes a point of mentioning woman who "pass" into white society.  What she dosen't say is how they are passing.  Do they deny their heritage?  Or are they just not "black enough" for Ms. Sharp.  The end of the book is somewhat better.  It chronicles acheivements of African American woman through out history.  However, because of the first part of her book, I was tempted to look up every fact because she lost credibilty in my eyes.  I believe that if Ms. Sharpe would slow down and stop trying to be satirical and start trying to teach, she might be able to do some serious writing.  I would not reccomend this book unless all captions written by her were taken out.</span>
