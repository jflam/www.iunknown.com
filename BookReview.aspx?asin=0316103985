                    <span>This book stands out because it is one the most readable books you will find in the history section. It is very clear and you do get a lot of information about the time that representatives from all the states were in Philadelphia during a hot summer to write the Constitution.<p>If you are a highschool student it is therefore very interesting because it gives you a good insight in how this remarkable document came into being. For more advanced readers it is also very interesting, it is especially better than any other book on this subject, it makes the whole process clearer than in a standard history book. It also gives a great explenation of the men who were involved. Through looking at the private documents of the participants she makes the process more human, and therefore more easily understandable.</span>

                    <span>After having read this novel for a class of mine, I compared the information presented to me to The Constitution itself. To my surprise, the facts that were given about The Constitution matched the majority of the document. Having said that, the book is what I would consider a slow read. It's an alternative source to studying our Founding Fathers and what the author portrayed as their thought processes. If you're looking for another way to studying The Constitution itself, you're best off with a copy of the document in front of you. The book is very informative if you are doing research on the time period and the thoughts that plagued the minds of those who drafted it, but if you're looking for a fast-paced plot filled adventure, or even a plot alone, I would recommend that journey to another department of your local bookstore.</span>

                    <span>Miracle at Philadelphia is a great book for anyone looking to understand the facts regarding the founding fathers and the Constitutional Convention. Having been told to read this book for class, we expected it to be another boring, wordy book. However, the book turned out to be very informative. It was not a hard read and could easily been read in a relatively short amount of time. The book does not read like typical history books we were used to. It is more of a novel in the sense that it is not just bombarded with facts, but flows like a story should, without missing any details. The book did an excellent job of not only explaining the draft of the Constitution, but also everything that led up to it. By reading this book, we learned many things that were unclear and unknown about the founding fathers and the Constitutional Convention. The author explained in great detail, in such a way that was not boring for the reader. Yet, it still covered all the facts. I recommend this to anyone interesting in learning about early America or someone looking for an interesting book.</span>

                    <span>When I first heard I had to read this book for my law class.  I though great another boring book I have to read for class.  Then my teacher told my class that it told of the story of the constitional convention.  Ok, I that point I though maybe it won't be that bad.  Then I started to read it and I found it was very interesting.  It also gives a detailed account of parts of the convention you don't hear about in the history books; like what they did at night and on days off.  I would recommend this book to anybody who is either studying law, history, or just wants to better understanding of what happened that summer in Philadelphia.</span>

                    <span>As a high school student, this book is easy to read and comprehend and introduces the Constitution very well. It defines clearly how the Constitution came about, what it meant, and how important a role compromise and sacrifice played in the matter. It describes the problems that were encountered, which helps to portray exactly how hard it was to get all of the delegates to accept the Constitution. It also gives background information of the delegates and their contribution to our country. After reading this book, an appreciation is developed for all the work that our forefathers put into the Constitution, and for the fact that it remains effective to this day. The Miracle at Philadelphia is definitely an asset to have in the classroom if one intends to fully understand the history of the Constitution and its benefits.</span>
