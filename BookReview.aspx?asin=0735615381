                <span id="Label1"> Performance tuning is increasingly important as desktop applications move to a Web-centric, software-as-a-service model. Performance analysis and turning ensures that .NET-based applications perform as well as or better than traditional desktop applications. Direct from a team at Microsoft that has analyzed hundreds of Web-based and .NET-based applications, this book shows developers how to plan and execute performance tests, configure profile tools, analyze data from Microsoft Internet Information Services, analyze transaction costs, and more. </span>

                    <span>This is the First book that discuss testing web application using Microsoft ACT (which I find not the best testing tool, see Astra Load Test, it is perfect).<BR>the book will divide the testing to phases and tiers, for example it dicusses how to optimized and find bottle neck in web tier (ASP.net Code), managed code and SQL server.<P>I didn't find anther book that discuss "Stress Testing ASP.net" application.<P>The will tell you how the found the "Memory Leakage" and they will tell you their exprience in finding problems with web sites.<P>If you r intented to "know" how to stress test you application, buy this book now</span>

                    <span>I had pretty high hopes for this book and was therefore a bit disappointed. The book focused heavily on several testing suites (ACT, Application Expert, Indy) which good from the standpoint of learning about the tools that are out there. Of course, it's not terribly useful if you can't get your hands on those suites.<P>The parts of the book that focused on non-application specific performance testing concepts were generally weak and didn't go into enough detail. It would have been nice to see some of the testing documentation that the book refers to, but no such luck.<P>One thing I found particularly annoying was in the description of the various Performance Monitor objects. The various descriptions offered in the book were EXACTLY the same as the text that is produced by clicking on the "explain" button in the "Add Counters" dialog of perfmon.<P>With that said, the book is cheap and a quick read. It's probably worth buying, but don't get your hopes up that you'll be doing any serious performance testing after reading it.</span>

                    <span>Although I have not read this book extensively, I have still found sound advice in its pages. This book is a great guide to anyone who wishes to learn more about, or conduct Performance Testing. From Bottle necks to security, this books covers a broad range of subjects. For a reliable source of testing information, directed towards web applications and more, refer to this book. Thank you.</span>

                    <span>I've recently had an opportunity to read Microsoft ACE Team's ... book "Performance Testing Microsoft .NET Web Applications" and would highly suggest this book to anyone who is looking to find performance bugs or increase performance on your teams web applications. The book is well written, gives real world examples, explains the most common bottlenecks in different areas and how to detect them (disks, network, web tier, sql tier, etc) and has a great section on how TCA works. ... I highly recommend this book.</span>
