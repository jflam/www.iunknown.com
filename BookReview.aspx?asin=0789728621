                    <span>This work gave the impression of a first draft without any follow-up;  a book that was rushed to the presses just so it could claim to be the first; and a book whose author, who has written other books that were much better, didn't seem interested in the book himself.  Yes, when you write an ExamCram book, you are not suppose to delve into every detail;  but completing a sentence should not be considered optional.  <p>Very disappointed;  thank god for Amazon's return policy.</span>

                    <span>The author, publisher and technical reviewer should all be ashamed if not the subject of a class action lawsuit. The book is full of mistakes, misinformation, and bad writing. It was clearly never proofread or reviewed by anyone with any significant Java web componennt development experience. The following sentences typify the quality of information the author imparts. <p>A web application includes many parts; it rarely is just one class or file. (pg 11)<p>A web application includes many parts; it rarely is just one class or one JSP. (pg 16)<p>When I take my certification exam later this week, I wonder if there will be a question like this:<p>How often does a web application consist of only one class or file?<p>A) never<br>B) rarely<br>C) often<br>D) occasionally<p>I have read 130 pages so far and I continue reading only for the entertainment value. Each page I read destroys several thousand brain cells. <p>Someone from Sun should read this book and revoke the author's SCWCD certification.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book in the hope that it will shield light, obviously i was wrong this time. I should say I hardly read a chapter. The text is boring and not well presented (at least it does not encourage me to read more). I have tried to read it as to justify the money I have paid but end up with sleepy eyes that I rather read another text book by manning.<p>I think just forget about this book,no harm not reading.</span>
