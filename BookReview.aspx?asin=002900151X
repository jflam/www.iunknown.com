                    <span>This book is more of the same rehashed, recycled, repurposed content from the authors. Much of this material is available in any basic marketing text. In fact, this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding. If you've worked at any of the big agencies: McCann, JWT, Y&R, you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour. All the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak. The "editorial reviews" listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as "cases" in the book. 
<br />Remember this before you buy: the author, and the firm for whom he works, use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called "thought leadership", a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking. Save your money. Don't become a victim of Prophet's propoganda. Buy something with substance like Jean Noel Kapferer.

                    <span>This book is a comprehensive and holistic approach to brand , although a but out-dated. For more updated concepts I reccommend 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. The author presents an expanded view of the meaning and role of brands and gives a new dimension, deeper than the single, limited conceptualization of a brand as a product. The role of the organizational associations, of the culture values and the emotional imput is very well integrated to understand the multidimensional meaning of a brand. Both books will help brand, marketing and/or commercialization managers to best leverage their corporate, range and product brands. Additionally, the insights presented to understand brand and company valuations are very well explained.</span>

                    <span>Building Strong Brands realizes right away how crucial a brand identity is in today's economy.  Well written and researched, Aaker delves into case histories of some very well known brands--such as Saturn--to forcefully argue his premise about the vital importance that a well-established brand identity can play in marketing and selling a product.  Although his case histories are strong ones, each situation is unique.  Guerilla PR: Wired is laden with various techniques to help an organization market its brand identity.</span>

                    <span>¡§Brand¡¨ has been a powerful tool for years.  With the use of ¡§Brand¡¨, products and service can differentiated from the competitors.  With the use of ¡§Brand¡¨, customers can identify the products and services from different brands and they can purchase the one they trusted.  With the use of ¡§Brand¡¨, company can provide products to customers while the ¡§Brand¡¨ can serve as the guarantee about the quality for the customers.  With the use of ¡§Brand¡¨, company can prepare strategies to build up customer loyalty towards the brand.<p>So, it seems that it is very important for company to make use of ¡§Brand¡¨.  And it seems that once the company has built up the ¡§Brand¡¨, they can be successful.  It also seems to me that they should keep on using that ¡§Brand¡¨ since the company has put effort to build customer loyalty towards the brand.<p>However, after read this book, I found that the above belief is wrong.  Actually, ¡§Brand¡¨ need to be changed over time.  For example, just like what mentioned in the book, if the ¡§Brand¡¨ was poorly conceived, or the ¡§Brand¡¨ is out of date, or the ¡§Brand¡¨ appeals to a limited market, or the ¡§Brand¡¨ is not contemporary, or the ¡§Brand¡¨ is tired.  It means that it is time for the company to change its ¡§Brand¡¨.<p>So, if you want to know more about ¡§Brand¡¨, <br>if you want to know how to build a strong ¡§Brand¡¨, <br>if you want to know whether it¡¦s time for the your companies¡¦ ¡§Brand¡¨ to be changed, <br>or if you also have the incorrect beliefs about ¡§Brand¡¨ that I mentioned, <br>it would be a good idea for you to read this book to know more about ¡§Brand¡¨.</span>
