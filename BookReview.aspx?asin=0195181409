                <span id="Label1">A staggeringly popular work of fiction, Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has stood atop The New York Times Bestseller List for well over a year, with millions of copies in print. But this fast-paced mystery is unusual in that the author states up front that the historical information in the book is all factually accurate. But is this claim true? As historian Bart D. Ehrman shows in this informative and witty book, The Da Vinci Code is filled with numerous historical mistakes. Did the ancient church engage in a cover-up to make the man Jesus into a divine figure? Did Emperor Constantine select for the New Testament--from some 80 contending Gospels--the only four Gospels that stressed that Jesus was divine? Was Jesus Christ married to Mary Magdalene? Did the Church suppress Gospels that told the secret of their marriage? Bart Ehrman thoroughly debunks all of these claims. But the book is not merely a laundry list of Brown's misreading of history. Throughout, Ehrman offers a wealth of fascinating background information--all historically accurate--on early Christianity. He describes, for instance, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (which are not Christian in content, contrary to The Da Vinci Code); outlines in simple terms how scholars of early Christianity determine which sources are most reliable; and explores the many other Gospels that have been found in the last half century.  Ehrman separates fact from fiction, the historical realities from the flights of literary fancy. Readers of The Da Vinci Code who would like to know the truth about the beginnings of Christianity and the life of Jesus will find this book riveting.</span>

                    <span>While I certainly have respect for Dr. Ehrman, I think it ought to be mentioned that we published a book which covers not only the religious controversies, but also the art and history issues, in a very balanced way. The book is Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Burstein. He headed a team of scholars and journalists--something like 40 or 50 all told--and they either wrote for the book, contributed existing work, or were interviewed. Among the interviewees was Dr. Ehrman.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer (of course): I am one of the lesser authors of Secrets of the Code.</span>

                    <span>This book was precisely what I was looking for and had begun to think would not be created.  That would be a critical response to the claims of the fictional Da Vinci Code that while "critical" was not a reaction against Dan Brown's book.  Simply put if you are curious about the claims made about items related to church history in the Da Vinci Code, this is your book.  Ehrman clearly states what was proposed in the book and compares it to what history can actually tell us about what happened.  As he so clearly and correctly states, history comes from one of two sources...it is either 1) from sources or 2) made up.  As the Da Vinci Code is a WORK OF FICTION the author can write whatever he chooses that will further the storytelling process.  If one has had their curiousity piqued and would like to learn more about what we really know about the early days of the church and the New Testament set aside the really excellent work of fiction and turn to this fine work by a historian.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Ehrman is absolutely my favorite author and scholar of historical Christianity and the New Testament and this book reinforces this opinion.  Dr. Ehrman's writing style is extremely clear, so even an individual with no background in the study of the New Testament will have a clear understanding of what Dr. Ehrman is writing about.  
<br />One does not need to have read The DaVinci Code in order to get a great deal out of this book.  Dr. Ehrman includes the passages he is discussing in the book and then refutes/agrees with them.  In this way, he covers a broad range of topics in early Christianity from the historical Jesus, Gnosticism, the formation of the canon, Constantine's role, etc.  Even if you have read a great deal on these topics, this book is a great refresher.  I do recommend this book for people just getting into the study as it covers so much and does such a wonderful job of it.  However, don't get the wrong idea, this is by no means an exhaustive study of those topics, but a great start or overview of them.  Highly recommended!  </span>

                    <span>Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code" really was an engrossing read. But much of its power for me and for many readers lay in how compellingly it steered us toward belief in yet another "vast conspiracy." We live, after all, in an era defined for many by a dangerous blurring between imagined great conspiracies and equally colossal but bona fide deception and cover-ups by the institutions of power. Because of its immense success, Brown's book has spawned a parasitical industry of silly, imitative pseudo-history and shallowly reactive analysis. Bart Ehrman's "Truth and Fiction..." is neither of these.
<br />
<br />When you read first-rate Science Fiction you probably find yourself thinking, "could it be?" - the distant future becomes tangible. If you read first-class Historical Fiction you've probably felt more of an, "I knew it!" - the dim past becomes peopled and coherent. I experienced a powerful combination of both reactions when I read "The Da Vinci Code". Maybe you did too.  It was not just a ripping, good yarn; it tied together millennia-old histories that were as unknown to me as the 30th or 40th centuries are unknowable. 
<br />
<br />Ah. But the future really is fiction! It doesn't exist and is therefore subject to speculation, while the past was once someone's reality and is subject to the scrutiny of its actual artifacts. We tend to associate becoming too engrossed in futures with the tinfoil-helmet crowd, but we acknowledge the study of the past to be a legitimate field of professional study. Or do we?
<br />
<br />Bart Ehrman is clearly one of those professionals - an historian of the Biblical and Early Christian eras. Dan Brown is a yarn-spinner. In this book Ehrman reminds us to remember that there is a difference.
<br />
<br />Could it be? Is "The Da Vinci Code" is mostly imagined, made-up, invented. I knew it... so did you.
<br />
<br />In this thorough but very readable and not overly pedantic book, Bart Ehrman methodically takes apart the invented histories of DVC and assembles the more likely realities for us. He does not do so in a hostile or antagonistic way; in fact he repeatedly mentions how much he enjoyed reading DVC. But he is systematic in dismantling the fundamental pseudo-history at the core of Brown's book. By dissecting out the fabrications, Ehrman helps us to see what's left: believable personalities and credible institutional motives for sure. But any good Sci-Fi writer will do the same. Brown has merely avoided the tinfoil-hat association by claiming something presumed more real for his base - the past.
<br />
<br />Ehrman's book is also an excellent commentary upon how history is actually done. He reminds us how honest historians, especially those of the barely-documented, distant past, can only approach the "more likely" at best. But approach it they do. He does a fine job of showing how such history is accomplished when done well; of how he and his colleagues have spent lifetimes building careful layer upon careful layer of the likely. But he demonstrates why "likely" has to be enough, and how it must be contrasted with the merely "imagined." Ehrman makes it clear that one starts with the knowledge that history, even so presumably certain a past as our own "remembered" history, is always viewed through filters and passed forward to the present through distorting lenses of personality and culture. He gives a good sense of how working through this sort of fog is challenging enough not to be further burdened with reacting to fiction.
<br />
<br />Now fiction is fiction, after all. But good Historical Fiction generally fleshes-out real events with a cultural matrix and people and personalities that are plausible. We think: "so that's why that happened." Good Science Fiction populates a future with equally-believable peoples and motives and a credible path from our "now" to their "then." We think "so that's how it's going to be." In Sci-Fi, the more distant the future, the wilder the fiction can be - but we read it as imagination and smile and enjoy. It seems that Dan Brown has created a new, more hysterical genre, call it Hy-Fi, which leaps an equal distance in the other direction to a past in which he can erect fabrications that only a clucking small crowd of historians will object to. But Ehrman is no chicken! This is clearly a David & Goliath mismatch, but Bart Ehrman has not backed down from the challenge. Good for him.</span>
