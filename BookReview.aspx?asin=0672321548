                <span id="Label1"><P>A fresh perspective on planning, designing, implementing, and migrating to a Windows Server 2003 environment.  <B>Rand Morimoto</B> and his co-authors began writing this book using their experience from several very large client implementations, some having more than 100 servers in production.  On a daily basis, as this book was in production, they had clients with thousands of users taking advantage of the Windows Server 2003 security, scalability, performance, and reliability functions months before the product release.  Because of that unique experience, the authors of this book were able to compile the best practices, installation and migration tips and tricks, performance optimization techniques, configuration tuning, and server management techniques for the readers of this book.  Rather than revising from previously published chapters in the <I>Windows Server 2000 Unleashed</I> book, this book was written completely from scratch with the belief that this approach would incorporate the true recommendations from the author team for best practices, tips and tricks to get the most out of Windows Server 2003 networking environment.</P></span>

                    <span>I bought this book a couple months ago based on the reviews here on Amazon. The primary purpose of buying the book was to help guide us through the design and migration from NT4 to Windows 2003.<P>While we have a long way to go (we're about 1/3 the way through our migration), we used the Windows Server 2003 Unleashed book as our bible. We're looking to expand our migration to include IPSec security and Group Policies once we're done with the core migration.<P>The only thing I was disappointed with the book was it's lack of information on IPv6. That's my next project here, but as I've been reading on the public boards, Microsoft may be changing the way they support IPv6, so maybe it's better we just hold off.<P>But I bought the book for migration hints from NT to 2003, and this book guided us along the way. Two thumbs up!</span>

                    <span>The coverage in this book on disaster recovery and business continuity is outstanding! I was in the middle of writing our DR/BP plan when I noticed this book had a whole chapter dedicated to DR planning. I took a chance and bought the book hoping there would be helpful information as I help my team justify our company's migration to Windows 2003.<P>Very detailed steps, and great recommendations on benefits other organizations have received in their migration process. The steps on migration from Windows NT4 to Windows 2003 as well as the security sections are well defined.<P>Very helpful book!</span>

This book is not ideal as a study guide but more as a reference book for people who are already administators or systems enginners. The book is well presented and easy to read. Well worth buying</span>

                    <span>"And Then There Were None" was an amazing book written by Agthia Christie. It is of course a murder mystery. It is generally about ten people who are brought to the house in the middle of nowhere and one by one they start to die. None of the people can figure out who the other one is the killer. It is definitly one book that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</span>
