                    <span>The subject is not only the animals, but also life. Attitude is all, from cover to cover. By far the best book I've ever seen on the subject, where you can feel a relationship between Lanting and the animal. Just buy it !</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most beautifully published books I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. If you love animals, photography, or just high quality book publishing, this one will bring a great deal of satisfaction. Lanting's images transcend mere animal identification shots as he clearly develops a relationship with each of his subjects. When you look at a portrait of a chimpanzee, you see pride and when you look at a photo of a family of Emperor penguins, you feel all the symbolic meaning of parenting on a spiritual level. Full of amazing photographs, this magnificent book makes a great gift (my mom loved hers) and comes highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Frans Lanting does it again in Eye To Eye--a brilliant collection of intimate portraits and daily activities of various animals. Like Jungles, it's a book that no natural photographer should be without. When you can see the individual hairs in a courgar's fur coat, it makes you kind of wonder what it would be like to be that close to one. <BR>Looking at Lanting's work is always like looking through a book of artwork, as if he is the Picasso of photography and we are looking through his masterpieces.</span>

                    <span>Wow !!! How can anyone get so close?! <P>These photographs are stunning. The talent of Frans Lanting oozes from these pages. <P>There is a closeness to the subjects here that borders on the intimate. In some cases, one wonders how he actually managed to get the shot.<P>The focussing and exposure is spot on and the composition is perfect.<P>I have tried to follow this type of photography and I am only too aware of how difficult it is to obtain these sorts of images.<P>I take my hat off to Frans Lanting. This is a brilliant work. A completely unique approach to wildlife photography. His behind the scenes narrative to the shots is illuminating.<P>This book is a valuable reference for all nature photographers. Sensational !</span>

                    <span>EYE TO EYE is right! Frans Lanting has his best book to date with these tight / intimate shots of a variety of animals. Great photography and moving intimate images will make you feel like you're really close to these subjects. As a photographer myself, I look to a Lanting as one of the very few photographers I can learn from and an example of a photographer with his own vision. Lanting gives me all that and the great pleasure of viewing the pictures he's made, not just snapshots of the same boring viewpoints done by so many other published photographers. If you want closeness to animals without the risk, but this book!</span>
