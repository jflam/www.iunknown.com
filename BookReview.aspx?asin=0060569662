                <span id="Label1"><p align="center"><i>"I spent five years of my life being treated for cancer, but since then I've spent fifteen years being treated for nothing other than looking different from everyone else. It was the pain from that, from feeling ugly, that I always viewed as the great tragedy of my life. The fact that I had cancer seemed minor in comparison."</i></p> <p>At age nine, Lucy Grealy was diagnosed with a potentially terminal cancer. When she returned to school with a third of her jaw removed, she faced the cruel taunts of classmates. In this strikingly candid memoir, Grealy tells her story of great suffering and remarkable strength without sentimentality and with considerable wit. Vividly portraying the pain of peer rejection and the guilty pleasures of wanting to be special, Grealy captures with unique insight what it is like as a child and young adult to be torn between two warring impulses: to feel that more than anything else we want to be loved for who we are, while wishing desperately and secretly to be perfect.</p></span>

                    <span>Autobiography of a face is a true story about Lucy Grealy, the author. She tells her story of having cancer and how she had to live with a distorted self-image for more than twenty years and have over thirty reconstructive surgeries before she could come to terms with herself. She developed a fear of never being loved at some point but gratefully she learned to define herself from inside out. She realizes that beauty is found deep within.<BR>I felt this was a very easy book to read. The language wasn't too big and it was easy to follow. If you like true stories about real people then you will like this book. Lucy Grealy is a very good writer. I feel she is a very strong person for not giving up on herself and I'm glad she made something of her life. I really liked this book.</span>

                    <span>In "Autobiography of a Face", Lucy Grealy explores how her disfigurement from cancer surgery came to be the central theme of her life and that of her family.<P>Even the title shows how Grealy has identified herself with her face above all else. The autobiography of Lucy Grealy has become the autobiography of her face because for a great part of her life Ms. Grealy was nothing more than a face, or at least it seemed so. Doctors, fellow students, family members, and complete strangers see not a woman with a disfigured face; they see a disfigured face. <P>Grealy shows how she also falls under the spell of her disability, allowing it to control her life and dictate her future to a greater extent than it otherwise would. Yes, having a disability means that sometimes you have to say "I'm disabled, therefore I can't....", but as Grealy finally learns, it also means sometimes saying "I'm disabled, but I can!".<P>All in all this is an inspiring book, one I'm glad I read and one I would highly recommend, especially to other disabled readers.</span>

                    <span>I just finished Autobiography of a Face and I found it just a beautiful, touching read. Lucy writes with such incredible introspection and heartfelt feeling that one must stop from time to time to just reflect on her insight. I truly wondered where she got the strength to endure all that she did. I felt her emptiness in situations and yet her strength inspite of it. Her mother just seemed to totally not get the whole experience or at least couldn't deal with it, so Lucy was left to her own devices. The insight into the boy she meets in the hospital who is paralyzed after a diving accident just blew me away. She writes, "I did it for him. I'd close my eyes to feel the height, see the bright blue of the pool winking below me, bend my legs, and feel the pull in my calves as I jumped up and then down, falling from one world of unknowing into the next one of perpetual regret." What a gut-wrenching insight into the soul of this young man. She allowed me to view the world from a whole new perspective and I thank her wherever she may be. She was definitely an old soul who hopefully fulfilled her karma.</span>

                    <span>i found the book very well written, but very, very sad. it seemed weird to me, when searching through the reviews, that most everyone discusses her as if she's alive, unfortunately she no longer is. i feel that that part is inextricable from the rest of the story and its message. this is not a story about a woman who overcame cancer and her feelings of insecurities, it is a story of a person who, after undergoing grueling treatments may have conquered the physical illness, but never its emotional consequences.it garnered a lot of sympathy and empathy from me.i felt so sad for her and wished that she had joined support groups, seen a good therapist, and had had a better support system to start out with.shame that the world has lost her.</span>
