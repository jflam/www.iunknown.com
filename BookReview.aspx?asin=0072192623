                <span id="Label1">With a revised Microsoft operating system comes a revised set of security holes and means of attacking them. <I>Hacking Exposed: Windows 2000</I> presents a snapshot of known Windows 2000 security weaknesses and the tools that have been developed to exploit them, in turn enabling system operators to mount better defenses. This book builds on and contributes to the small but respected Hacking Exposed series, giving network administrators a detailed picture of the threats their Windows 2000 machines face--and all the motivation they should need to install the latest patches right away. Which points out a characteristic of this book: Many of the problems it catalogs are known bugs that shouldn't be a problem if you've installed the latest fixes and have good password and privilege policies. The point: Even with this book on your shelf, keep an eye on the security sites for news of emerging problems.<p>   Joel Scambray and Stuart McClure have chosen to organize their book according to the steps involved in system compromise (identifying a target, gaining access and privileges, using or destroying the system, and so on) as well as by area of vulnerability. In addition to well-written passages that explain general hacking strategies and concepts, the authors devote sections to software (meaning native Windows commands, tools that are part of the Windows NT/2000 Resource Kit, as well as external software). Sometimes, they'll just offer a description, but most of the time, the authors present a step-by-step guide to carrying out the exploit at hand. This is a valuable book that every Windows 2000 expert should read closely. <I>--David Wall</I><p>   <B>Topics covered:</B> How to break into a Windows 2000 system and, by extension, how to go about defending against attacks. Sections deal with tools for locating victim systems, gaining access to them, and either damaging them, overloading them, or using them as bases for further attacks. The authors also highlight the weaknesses in Windows 2000 services, including Internet Information Services (IIS) and Microsoft SQL Server. </span>

                    <span>Now here is one of these books that you just GOTTA have. If you only buy one or two books a year, this is one of them. Remember how enthused I was about the original "Hacking Exposed" in W2Knews? Well, they have done it again, but now with an all-Windows 2000 focus. This is the end-all of hacking into your W2K servers. A must-read if you want to secure your networks and a 'Stu's Warmly Recommended!' I'm holding a fresh copy just off the presses in my hot little hands. I know what I'm going to do this weekend! It's a treasure trove of information no W2K sysadmin should be without.</span>

                    <span>Quite honestly, I believe that the material covered in Hacking Win2K Exposed should be covered in the MCSE 70-220 exam -- but it isn't. These guys not only cover all the tricks of the Black-Hat society, ranging from screening and enumeration to password cracking to privilege escalation exploits, but they also give the reader important information on how to implement countermeasures against these attacks.<P>Out of the box, Win2K will do a better job of protecting the OS than NT -- for example, the default domain group policy settings will prevent user enumeration, even though they permit null sessions (stand-alone systems, by contrast, are just as vulnerable to enumeration as NT 4.0). However, by default, the system is just as vulnerable to to attacks against legacy LM based password hashes as was NT -- this book explains how to avoid this while still maintaining compatibility with legacy consumer Windows products. And the named pipe impersonation privilege escalation exploit was one that I had not heard about. SP2 fixes it, but it's definitely something that you need to be aware of.<P>This book is a treasure trove of security-critical information for Win2K administrators. You will learn how to apply group policy to effectively lock down your Win2K systems against many of the attacks commonly used against Win2K. You'll get links to all kinds of freeware ranging from hacking tools to intrusion detection software so that you can assess the security of your own Win2K network. You'll learn about the vulnerabilities of IIS, SQL Server, and Terminal Server as well as how you can deploy these services securely.<P>This is real-world stuff. You just can't learn it by studying for 70-220. Hacking Win2K Exposed is probably the one book that I'd try to grab off the shelf if my library were on fire.</span>

                    <span>Extremely well organized and presented in an easy-to-grasp way, Hacking Windows 2000 Exposed will have the novice's jaws dropping, yet even the seasoned Win2K expert will raise an eyebrow (or both). The latest hacks and cracks are explained in detail, allowing the admin to really and truly see what they are up against and why security is so important to ANY computer attached to a network. I highly recommend that before you attach a Windows 2000 system to the Internet, read this book and test your system's security fully -- before an unwanted intruder does.</span>
