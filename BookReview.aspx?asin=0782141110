                    <span>If you are new to FireWorks MX and DreamWeaver MX, DON'T waste your time with this book. There are too many errors, inaccuracies and incomplete process steps. Plus, the CD does not have all of the sample files mentioned in the Hands On portion of the lessons.<br>If you are experianced with FireWorks MX and Dreamweaver MX, nothing savvy here either. No new tricks, no great tips. <br>Needless to say I was very disappointed.</span>

                    <span>1st few chapter chapters showed promise.  Laid out easy to understand.  Fireworks chapters are obviously written by someone else and leave alot to be disired.  Not very intuitive examples, make you struggle though it, that and missing files from cd dont help.  Typo's through out book, and chapter 30 has a bullet point on the first page of the chapter about the topics to be covered on Finding or Preparing a Host Server, but the topic isn't covered in the chapter.  Copy Editors sure fell down on the job in this book.</span>

                    <span>When I purchased this book I had high hopes for it, as most of the customer reviews had given it a high rating. But, this is probably the most uninspiring web design book I've ever come across.<p>Yes, all the technical details are in there, so if you're looking for a reference manual, perhaps this book would be a good one to have on your shelf ... but Macromedia's own help files, website, and user's guide provide the same information. So, why spend the extra [$$] for a volume that's not nearly as succinctly written?! <p>If you're the type who likes to learn by doing, then you'll be disappointed with "DW/FW" Savvy. The tutorials are lackluster and the included photos/layouts on CD-ROM are unbelievably amateurish. The Fireworks section is just "OK," which is surprising since Joyce J. Evans is a highly regarded expert. Once again, everything you need to know is included, but you're definitely not going to say "Wow, I want to do that!"<p>My advice is to sprint on over to Project Seven's website and purchase their "Dreamweaver MX, Building on Solid Foundations" ebook. You'll learn *so* much and have a truly enjoyable time while you do. PVII's team has a design aesthetic that provides for clean, functional, well thought out pages coupled with cutting edge CSS techniques that will have you just marvelling at how much you can do with styles.<p>Bottom line, your money could be better spent elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>If you have a limited budget or are a beginner to Fireworks/Dreamweaver, don't waste your money on this book.  <p>This is one of those books written by commmittee  - a group of authors each doing separate chapters. Unfortunately it reads as if none of the authors ever coordinated with each other.  One glaring example, most of the illustrations are B&W and the text keeps referring the reader to the see color examples in a later chapter. Unfortunately most of the examples the reader is sent to see are not in that chapter at all! Whilte there is a copy editor and a technical editor listed as part of this book's production team they don't appear to have done anything constructive.<p>I have been making notes in my copy as I find typos, grammatical errors and errors in the tutorials (either mistaken directions or missing directions or material missing from the included CD). Virtually every chapter has several errors of each kind.<p>The beginner will quickly become confused, or worse, give up on trying to learn.<p>There is a Yahoo group run by the lead author of the book where some of the errors were beign collected. A week or so ago the author noted that the book had gone into a 2nd printing.  It is possible that some of the many errors in the first edition were caught and fixed. I certainly hope so. This book does real damage to the image of Sybex as a publisher of quality material.</span>

Regardless of your experience with Dreamweaver and Fireworks, you're sure to learn something new.<p>The chronological organization covers both programs in a logical manner for beginners that are starting with an idea and working their way to a final website.  For the more advanced readers there are numerous indexes so that the desired information is easily found.  Something all readers will find especially useful is the seven-page appendix of Windows and Mac Keyboard Shortcuts.<p>This book is great for anyone interested in mastering Dreamweaver and seamlessly integrating Fireworks for more efficient web design.</span>
