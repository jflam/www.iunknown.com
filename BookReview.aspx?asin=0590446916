                    <span>This book starts out with the birth of Sojourner Truth and takes you all the way through her life.  You learn about her as a slave, as a free woman, as a preacher, an abolitionist, and an activist for the rights of both blacks and woman.<p>I personally did not know much about Sojourner Truth, but I do now.<p>If you are looking for a great novel to entertain you or for something to keep you on the edge of your seat, then this book probably isn't what your looking for.  If you want to learn about history and an inspiring lady than I would say pick up this book and read.  There is nothing worng with knowledge and this book is a great way to learn.</span>

                    <span>Sojouner Truth Ain't I a Woman takes place in the 1700's-1800's, about 300 years ago. This genre is non-fiction. If you like true stories then read this!<br>	This story is about black people being slaves. Sojouner works for a family that beats her. She works for them for about 13 years. Then she gets sold again and the family tells her she can leave at 27 years (a year before she is suppose to.) The family says, "No you can't leave we changed our mind," when she was about to leave. They finally make a deal and say, "Okay, you can leave." <p>	She knows she has no place to live and people invite her to live with them, but she has to work for them to get money. Then she leaves and tells stories of her life and people like the stories! <br>	<br>When I read this book, I thought to myself, I feel sorry for black people back then. I really loved this book so much! My opinion is if you are prejudiced then you should read this book, and that might change your mind.</span>
