                    <span>i've read this a while ago, but it's amazing how some book just follow you through life. this book certenly flollow my life, but in it's styple and description and also with it's intention and massage.<p>written originaly as 3 saparated novels, the 3 diffrent stories, who doesn't happend on the same planets or times, interact one several levels, the concepts of the joined alience of menkind throughout the universe, mind reading and the meaning of being an explorer and an alien in a diffrent planet. are meaningful not only to the sience fiction side of the story, but also, and perhaps mostly to the way we precive ourself, both as indeviduals and within a society. each story takes a diffrent view and plot line exsamening those issues and adding to them, it's own world and atmospher.<p>what i loved mostly about this book is that, unlike many other books, which take their scenery from know situation and sets, like period in earth's history, or from movies and myth. those worlds are recreated all new - the people, places, and societies are unknown to the reader and so, every page's a surprise, and at no point is seem predictable or familier.<p>it took my a long time to get used to that style, this book doesn't match a ganere and is a very indevidual unique creation. it stimulate the mind and senses and creativity. i highly recomand it</span>

                    <span>I know this book was originally 3 seperate novels but, I liked how it was all combined into one. I thought it was pretty unique to have three divergent plots actually fit together, beautifully, to form a single coherant story.</span>

                    <span>I read this book over a year ago, and usually after that amount of time I can barely remember the plot of a book let alone the details.  Yet I was amazed with the City of Illusions story in this book.  This is by far my favorite story by Ursula K. Le Guin, even over the Left Hand of Darkness or any of the Earthsea series.</span>

                    <span>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>35 years on, Planet of Exile hasn't aged a bit. As I just rediscovered -- my copy (with an evocative Josh Kirby cover) dates from the early 70's, and I don't recall rereading it since then. I was prompted to do so by a recent reread of  her stunning "Semley's Necklace" (1964), another story in Le Guin's Hainish universe, which she recycled as the prologue to Rocannon's World.<p>While PoE doesn't have the depth or complexity of her best work, this is a grand, mythic story of  love and death; fear of the stranger, and the sad consequences; a bitter battle to save one's home; the joys and ashes of victory. And the grey, grinding cold of Great Winter: 5,000-some days of darkness, cold and ice (UKL does winters really well). Strong stuff. <p>My God, this was her apprentice work!<p>The rest of RW, after "Semley's Necklace", isn't up to PoE, but is quite readable. I haven't reread City of Illusions recently.<p>Happy reading!<br>Pete Tillman</span>

                    <span>In their efforts to defend themselves against the oncoming fleets of the Shing, the Hainish peoples (all humanoids in this area, for the Hainish were an old race that had long spread out from their home world) had banded together in defence. <br>But not all wanted to part of the Hainish Alliance.<br>In _Rocannon's Word_ Rocannon was an ethnologist investigating Fomalhault when his team was killed by such a band, but Rocannon found a secret in Fomalhaut's hinterlands that would give the Alliance an edge.<br>Sent out from Terra centuries ago in order to raise the tech level of a primitive world, the expedition were informed of the arrival of the Shing and from the ensuing silence deduced defeat. Now this planet had to be made into a home, but it couldn't be untill the expedition accepted their exile! (_Planet of Exile_)<br>In _City of Illusion_, an all too fallible member of an off world team is discarded by those who had taken his ship when it arrived in Earth orbit and left to die in the primitive culture that was all that was allowed by the alien overlords. Taken to be one of those overlords by the suspicious villagers, only the belief of a young woman enables him to carry on to find out the truth behind Earth's long silence.</span>
