                <span id="Label1">As the global economy becomes at once a fact of everyday life and the inspiration for violent protest, George Soros offers his provocative analysis of globalization and outlines a new agenda for the leading nations of the world. <P>Over the past decade, "globalization" has become a buzzword for everything that is happening in the world economy or even in international relations generally. But as even a cursory glance at recent headlines reveals, not everyone is happy with globalization. Violent protests are now a regular feature of international summit meetings, and many young people have expressed their strong opposition to policies that they see as enriching the rich at the expense of workers, the environment, and traditional culture. <P>As the world economy has transformed in the 1990s and early 2000s, no individual has grappled with the social and political implications of globalization more than George Soros. <I>George Soros on Globalization</I> seeks to assess not merely how well the world's financial institutions have fulfilled their larger mission of helping the entire world strive for prosperity, but also to point the way toward fixing the problems that have emerged in the globalization regime as a whole. Unlike other proponents of globalization, Soros does not dismiss the criticisms of the protesters; indeed, he welcomes them and acknowledges that in many ways the protesters have a clearer view of the issues at stake than the bankers and bureaucrats do. We ignore the protesters' message, Soros warns, at our peril.</span>

                    <span>This book is an interesting take on the problems inherent in globalization. (Think the Argentinean default)<P>Soros has distinct credentials to write on the subject:<BR>1 - He's made quite a bit of money (Billions) off of currency speculation.<BR>2 - He has financed numerous foundations attempting to resolve the problems described.<P>The book makes for interesting reading to the non-economist, in that it explains the WTO, World Back, IMF and other international organizations supporting global development. It defends their success against their missions, while highlighting the deficiencies. Soros admits the complexity of the problem, and proposes several solutions.<P>There were two major weak spots in the book:<BR>1 - His concept of Special Drawing Rights could use more explanation. Identical descriptions occur 3 times, but none are accessible to the lay reader.<BR>2 - He makes blanket accusations against "market fundamentalism" without defining it, or explaining why it continues to be the dominant view.<P>Bottom line: If you're looking for a high level explanation of the issues with globalization and the key international organizations involved, this is the book for you. If you're looking for clear resolutions, this may prove elusive.</span>

                    <span><P><BR>This is an easy to read common sense book that absorbs and addresses some of the criticisms of the World Trade Organization, speaks to the weakness of the International Labor Organization, and proposes the equivalent of a global Marshall Plan, but as a multi-national initiative. It is essential reading at a time when too many politicians do not yet make the connection between terrorism and what George Soros has called "the other axis of evil: poverty, disease, & ignorance."<P>At a time when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is treating anti-globalization activists as just one step under terrorists (in one recent case denying a Canadian activist entry to the U.S. to honor an invitation to speak at a U.S. university), George Soros' is easily the most responsible and the wealthiest voice cautioning all of us that the combined forces of globalization (which reduces citizen sovereignty) and consumerism (which reduces citizen prosperity) could be the death knell of capitalism.<P>I am reminded of how the U.S. Secret Service ran amok against so-called "hackers" (the best of them trained at MIT and now multi-millionaires) because it did not understand that hackers are like astronauts, pushing the edge of the envelope, and it did not understand that it was the U.S. communications and computing industry that was criminally negligent in offering the consumer and the government a national information infrastructure that was incredibly fragile and full of security holes. It was industry that failed to exercise due-diligence, and it was hackers that exposes these flaws well in advance of the Y2K panic. The anti-globalization activists, Lori Wallach among them (and she has clearly influenced Soros in this book) are the 21st Century hackers for world peace and prosperity.<P>Globalization and consumerism threaten billions of Arabs, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, and Russians around the world--and thus they threaten us as well. Although many brilliant minds foresaw these challenges in the 1970's, among them those speaking to the limits to growth, sustainable growth, and the need for new forms of world governance, it is only after 9-11 that the world appears ready to listen to George Soros and others who understand that we cannot continue to emphasize short term corporate profit over long term citizen survival.<P>His proposals for Special Drawing Rights are helpful, and merit adoption. It is with a little concern, however, that I see his concession to "elite" management of these remedial resources. I lean toward the view that the people are now both informed and connected, and that we must empower down to the neighborhood level if we are to restore civil society around the world (this includes no longer supporting repressive governments for the convenience of our corporations), so there is still a gap between Soros and the natural leaders down in the ranks with the people.<P>Thomas Jefferson said that "A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry." Justice Brandeis said that the greatest threat to a nation's liberty is "an inert citizenship." George Soros may be said to be the first and foremost educator and leader on the critical matter of whether of whether or not this Nation might yet surmount great challenges of its own making.</span>

                    <span>Soros was convicted of inside trading at the end of 2002. He broke the law by trading using inside information in the takeover of Societe Generale.<P>I guess with globalization, wealthy people will get wealthier so they can cheat, lie, trade on inside information and then try to manipulate the elections of the United States and countries in Eastern Europe. <P>From a new site detailing Mr. Soros crime:<P>"Mr Soros and three other defendants, the court found, bought Societe Generale stock when it was cheap, and cashed in their investment when the price rose after the bid became public. <P>Two other businessmen implicated in the scandal - Edmond Safra and Robert Maxwell - have since died." <P>Robert Maxwell killed himself after cheating British workers out of their pensions and engaging in a huge fraud to cheat investors. Safra was also a dubious character. Soros is known by the company he keeps. <P>Avoid this book. There are better books written by reformed criminals. It is a shame Enron blew up because he would have made a good CEO there.</span>

                    <span>A millionaire financier, international philanthropist, and critic of the global capitalistic system, Soros has written several books on the benefits and costs of so-called globalization. In this new volume he extends his views on the need for safety nets in developing countries and public goods production (e.g., education and environmental protection) and discusses the greater likelihood for financial crises due to the greater freedom now available for volatile international finance flows. Inequities of globalization have generated, on the one hand, protests against international organizations (especially the International Monetary Fund and World Bank); on the other hand, these bodies are criticized by market fundamentalists opposed to interference with the efficiencies of free markets. Soros notes that protesters overlook such causes of poverty as armed conflict, oppressive and corrupt regimes, and weak governance; and while free markets are good at generating wealth, poverty alleviation is not always inevitable. To assist poor countries, Soros proposes that rich countries issue SDRs (an international reserve asset) to the IMF, contributed according to an income-based quota system; an independent board would be appointed to supervise assistance operations. Written in generally clear, nontechnical language, this book deserves attention by students and practitioners of foreign economic affairs. General readers; upper-division undergraduate students and up; and professionals.</span>

                    <span>Well, I read a book on Globalization by George Soros. That was interesting in that he is a world financier who believes that the current system is unjust and that institutions need to be strengthened. He had some suggestions that I found interesting, the ones that I understood at least. George seems a little full of himself at times, recounting his own activities that seemed a little self-gratifying, which probably comes from being so influential and powerful as a leading world hedge fund manager. But his humble beginnings, his deep concern for justice and fairness in the world economic order, and his commitment to effecting some kind of positive change in the world are extremely admirable, and I am very impressed by him.</span>
