                <span id="Label1">The Web is rapidly becoming the front end of choice for applications. Why create a custom front end that will run only on a single PC when you can deliver a Web-based interface to anywhere in the world? Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) is part of the Windows NT operating system, and by using its Active Server Pages (ASP) technology you can create Web applications using server-side scripts and COM objects.<p> Visual Basic is an evolving development environment, and the <I>Visual Basic Developer's Guide to ASP and IIS</I> is designed for Visual Basic 6 developers who want to take advantage of its Web development features. You won't need to know HTML to use this book, since it contains a guide to ASP and HTML. The heart of the book is a look at VB 6's Web class features. Web classes are a way of building COM objects that are used to modify HTML templates. You'll learn how to use Web classes to query databases, handle security, and work with client-side scripts. If you're interested in using Microsoft Transaction Server to improve Web application reliability and link to external applications, there's plenty of information to get you started.<p> This is a book for both the beginner and the hardcore VB developer. It's a welcome guide to an often overlooked feature of Visual Basic, with plenty of source code and examples. There's enough information here to use the <I>Visual Basic Developer's Guide to ASP and IIS</I> as both a tutorial and a reference. <I>--Simon Bisson, amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>I am a programmer. I currently develop in Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and VBscript. I purchased this book in order to learn ASP, and I've struggled through the first six chapters. I must tell you that, so far, the "book" is garbage. The examples are mismatched (i.e., the pictures don't match their descriptions), and the exercise projects don't work. I followed the examples word for word, line by line, only to find that after the exhausting effort, I accomplished nothing. I thought perhaps it was me at first, but after I downloaded the sample code from the Sybex website, I found it to be identical with the code I had written. When I tried to run the code I downloaded (presumably, this code was written by the author of the book), it also did not work. Chapter 5 in particular is overflowing with errata, only one of which is addressed in the Errata section of the Sybex website. I don't mind telling you, Mr. Jones, that I feel cheated...I hope you are enjoying the [money] that I paid for this doorstop. I could go on all day about this POS, but I must now go down to the bookstore and try my best not to get swindled again.</span>

                    <span>This book has been very useful to me so far--the author seems to have a good grasp of the subject. The issue I have is with the code downloads from the Sybex website--it seems to contain a lot of errors--the code for chapter 7 is especially bad. Also, I wish the auther had not included so much ADO in the book; while I understand that ADO was relatively new when the book was written, I do not feel that it was necessary to include so much of it, since the author says the book is for those who already know VB well. As a result I've had to waste a lot of time tweaking the database code to get it to work with my system, and I haven't learned anything new from doing that.</span>
