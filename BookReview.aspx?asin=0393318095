                <span id="Label1">"From my mother I learned to write prompt thank-you notes for a variety of occasions," Melissa Holbrook Pierson writes. "From Mrs. King's ballroom dancing school I learned a proper curtsy and, believe it or not, what to do if presented with nine eating utensils at the same place setting.... From motorcycles I learned practically everything else." Pierson, an intellectual New Yorker, is open to her own contradictions--she is bold and fearful, a motorcycle-crazed poet with a Ph.D., and these seeming incompatibilities are what make this book so good. She can write equally well about the visceral pleasures of riding and about the pains of heartbreak or her own displeasure with her fears.<p>  This is the motorcycle memoir for those who are sick of memoirs--or motorcycles. It is a book for people who don't know what the big deal is about riding, or why the Guggenheim Museum in New York, in a swirl of controversy, would exhibit motorcycles as works of modern art. "Riding on a motorcycle can make you feel joyous, powerful, peaceful, frightened, vulnerable, and back out to happy again," Pierson writes, "perhaps in the same ten miles. It is life compressed, its own answer to the question, 'Why?'"  <I>--Maria Dolan</I></span>

                    <span>I read this book a couple years ago and I could NOT put it down.  Sure there was the common theme of motorcycling, the part of the conversation I could relate too.  But really, that was the setting around which she wove a great personal tale.  Overcoming -- not fear -- but deep anxiety.  I see reviews written that this is anti man or other strange interpretations.  I think if you read closely she lays out her own issues early in the book.  The book is her journey to overcome those.  She learns about herself -- the good and the bad -- and about people.  
<br />
<br />I think it is a fun, interesting adventure.  I recommend it often and buy copies for my friends.</span>

                    <span>This book will further your insight into why motorcyclists ride and why they think what they do about their bikes, motorcycling, and each other. But by the time Pierson is on to her second bike mechanic boyfriend, you will realize that you're going to have to see the truth for yourself, because the author has her hands so full with her own issues -- anxiety, delusion, hypocrisy -- that she can hardly help herself or her endlessly sick bike, let alone help you, the questing reader.
<br />
<br />She does give you all the clues you will need, so don't despair. It's just that you're on your own in figuring out what the clues mean.
<br />
<br />The Fallen Bike Incident is a good example of Pierson's lack of self-knowledge, and why this book is accused of male-bashing.
<br />
<br />In the rain, Pierson's bike has fallen over due to the soft, wet surface she has planted her side stand in. This is a classic blunder. It's in the curriculum of the motorcycle safety course (of which Pierson is a graduate) and she even mentions elsewhere in the book how, for this very reason, wooden blocks were passed out in the dirt parking lot of a motorcycle rally. You can easily conclude that it is her own damn fault her bike fell over, but you won't read her admitting it in so many words, and this lack of personal accountability is everywhere in The Perfect Vehicle.
<br />
<br />In her motorcycle class she has been taught how even a grandmother can lift up even a fallen Honda GoldWing (800+ pounds of bike), but for reasons unexplained, she is unable to lift her sub-400 pound Moto Guzzi. Again, no admission that she failed to learn the very thing she was specifically taught to do; you just read that it didn't work out and draw your own conclusion. So she asks a driver in an idling van for help, and he stares at her blankly, as she frantically begs "Quickly!" Finally the nice man gets out of his dry van, into the rain, and helps her right her fallen bike, to her eternal non-gratitude.
<br />
<br />Reflecting later, Pierson intuits, and apparently comes to believe, that the reason her benefactor didn't instantly leap into the downpour to assist her was because he was thinking that since she is a woman, she wanted help lifting a bicycle, not a motorcycle, and so she was once again the victim of rampant sexism. She will shortly use this incident as a springboard to launch into one of many catalogs of undeniably valid examples of cruel and unfair treatment women have suffered in the history of motorcycling. This stuff is good to know and you'll be glad you read about it, but keep in mind, these terrible things happened to other women, not Pierson.
<br />
<br />In several place we read explanations of her attraction to the woefully unreliable Moto Guzzi bikes, namely that they're stylish, sexy, and that fixing your bike all the time gives you a deep sense of self-sufficiency and personal identification with your machine.
<br />
<br />It's a fair characterization of the series of Moto Guzzi enthusiasts Pierson repeatedly enlists to fix her broken-down bike for her, gratis, but this admirable, self-reliant, hands-on individualist ain't Melissa Pierson. She apparently never begins to master bike mechanics in her 35,000 miles of riding. She's more the damsel in distress with delusions of rugged independence. You would feel some pity if she had left out all the haughty, off-hand dismissals of Japanese motorcycles for the crime of providing exactly what Pierson and millions just like her really need: an affordable and reliable bike, albeit one that lacks "character."
<br />
<br />She at least respects BMW and Harley-Davidson enough to give us fully-cardboard-cutout stereotypes of those riders, but those bland, bloodless Japanese aren't even worth the time. Oh, and in case you didn't know, "rice burner" is not really an epithet of derision. I bet "broad" is, though.
<br />
<br />It's an all-purpose snobbery. When in France she finds herself at a hotel that dares offer exactly what Pierson and millions like her really need (it's affordable and they've got a room), she sniffs "Holiday Inn, of all places!"
<br />
<br />So while the author only grows a little in the course of this book, you the reader will have the opportunity to learn much more in the ugly truth behind Pierson's inadvertent revelations, as well as benefit from the several places where she is actually on to something real and manages to convey it without getting hung up on her own issues. The florid descriptions of what it feels like to ride are quite fine if you accept them outside the context of the neurotic author's world of prejudice and denial. </span>

                    <span>Besides a few  obligatory negative remarks regarding white males and negative overtones about Harleys, this book is a good read.  RIght off the bat we get the resume of this writer telling us she has the educational requirements to write this book.  The writer is very good at putting to words what a lot of us must feel on the bike.  I do feel sorry for her though, she just never seems to get that biking is just about feeling for a lot of us.  THis writer seems to have it in for white, male harley riders.  So, if you the reader do not care about a women riders' point of view by pass this book.  However, if you are, as I am, not educated with words but interested read this book.</span>

                    <span>As a motorcycle newbie, I've been reading a number of technique-oriented books in order to become a better rider. But I wanted to find something about the actual experience with a more autobiographical slant.  I spotted "The Perfect Vehicle" on Amazon.com, and it immediately caught my interest.  The reader reviews were quite interesting, ranging from exuberant identification to scathing dismissal.  Any book that generates feedback of such jarring disparity must have something to say, so I went ahead and took a chance on it.  <p>Ms. Pierson has pretty much bared her soul in this book, and my attention never wandered from start to finish.  She's a strong, yet vulnerable woman who embarked on a quest to reconcile her desire to find a man worthy of her love with a need for independence and adventure.  Motorcycling was the medium that allowed her to explore both of these (apparently) conflicting dictates of the heart.  After much relational and highway mileage, Ms. Pierson seems to have made peace with herself, and this book is a well-written chronicle of that journey.   <p>"The Perfect Vehicle" does contain some interesting facts about motorcycle history, rallies, and so on.  However, it's Ms. Pierson's relationships and riding experiences combined with the resulting insights that really make this book shine.  Some reviewers have slammed her for being a man-hater, too introspective, or a Moto Guzzi snob, but I disagree (well, the Moto Guzzi bias might have some merit, but I have a similar affection for Harleys, so I won't cast stones).  If I grow half as much as she did via motorcycling, I'll consider the money invested into my H-D Fat Boy well spent.  "The Perfect Vehicle" is a great addition to the motorcyclist's library, and anyone who has a passion for adventure and self-discovery will enjoy it as well.</span>

                    <span>My wife and I became interested in Motorcycle riding, and I looked for a book from an Author that shared this interest.  Melissa Pierson shares the intimacy she has uncovered for Riding in this book.  Along the way, we experience her first motorcycle purchase, personal relationship problems, and ride with her to the Blue Ridge Mountains, Canada, and a difficult riding trip through Germany.  She shares with us how the outsider may view the female motorcycle rider. She also gives various accounts of past female riding in history and the motivations behind it.  Her enthusiasm for motorcycles is infectious but she is quick to point out the dangers of riding and gives multiple accident stories to dramatize this effectively.  <br>My only negative view on the book is that the latter half of the book involved her seemingly high view of the Moto Guzzi Motorcycle.  I don't know personally if these motorcycles are reliable, but she shares breakdown after breakdown story with these cycles, that I began skipping pages that delt with this and I could not help wondering why she would have not picked a more reliable cycle like a Yamaha or a Honda.  Other than that, the book is good and would only strenthen interests in freedom riding, and motorcycles in general.
