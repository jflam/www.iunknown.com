                    <span>Perhaps I expected too much, but this book is so voluminous that one assumes it should contain all the answers to Excel related questions (as many people believe the books of `Bible' type should :-). On my second try, I was greatly disappointed to find that the only reference on important programming function `ADDRESS' is a one-line definition! So, if you never used Excel before, I guess this book would be a good place to start. Otherwise, continue to search for the true Holly Book elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>John is a great writer.  I have a number of his books in my library.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, he's not keeping up with the product.  The primary changes in Excel 2003 (xml, SharePoint integration, InfoPath, etc) are essentially missing from his Book.
<br />
<br />Its like he took the Excel 2000 version of his Bible pretty much just changed the cover.
<br />
<br />I returned my copy.</span>

                    <span>And I thought that I knew Microsoft Excel. I was sure put in my place. This book will do it for you. I'm going back and taking notes again just so I don't forget since this has so many things that I wasn't aware of. 
<br />
<br />If you need to 'really' learn Excel, this is your book. He makes it easy to follow, easy to learn, and even fun. 
<br />
<br />I wasn't even half way done and I knew that this book was a "BARGAIN!"
<br />
<br />thanx John</span>

                    <span>The book is really a Bible... A lot of useful information for people that are beginning to use this spreadsheet. I also believe that this book could be a great asset for those who have a good understanding of the tool. It's easier to find a solution in the book's index than looking for it on the help feature of the software. I really have to recommend this book!</span>
