                    <span>I was unable to finish this book.  It was unbearable.  It was hard for me to believe the writer teaches anything at any college, except maybe how to mop.  While I expected crazy stories, they were outlandish to the point of unbelievably.  While I can enjoy some long tales, and yarns as well as anyone, these yarns are so over-embellished I found myself doubting the author actually lived any of the events he discribed.  I suspect the author probably actually rides a BMW motorcycle, and maybe is educated, but attempted to write this "book" in a manner he or she thought would be appreciated by uneducated rough biker types.  If I am correct, that might explain the feel of un-authenticity.  I just could not believe a supposed college professor could write so poorly, nor could I believe a rough-and-tumble person that is capable of the situations the author claimed himself to get into, would buy and ride three or more brand newe BMW motorcycles in his life, or be able to keep a steedy job teaching in order to afford those brand new bikes.  The type of person that would live the described experiences from this book would ride a rat bike held together with duct tape and wire, not ride a brand new German bike.</span>

                    <span>If you love riding motorcycles and have spent much time on the road, you will find Mark Tiger Edmonds to be a kindred spirit, a Brother of the Road.<p>My sister gave me this book for Christmas this year.  I read it in two days and as a result have provided copies to all my riding buddies for their Christmas gifts.  <p>Tiger, hope to meet you along the road one day and buy you a cold one.  Thanks for sharing your adventures with us.</span>

                    <span>Every once in a while, a writer comes along that provides a wholly unique insight into what makes their world tick.  Their adventures hit home with a tapestry of humor, pathos and down-home wisdom.  They also just plain  entertain. Mark Twain, Johnny Cash, Garrison Kielor, Woody Guthrie come to  mind.  But now, you can add the name of Mark Edmonds to that exclusive  list.      When not teaching Writing at St. Leo University in central  Florida, Dr. Edmonds, or "Tiger" as he's known to friends, climbs  aboard his weathered BMW, and continues to tour the United States from  border to border, and coast to coast.  His newest book, Long Rider, details  a million mile odyssey over a 35 year stretch that also includes journeys  into Canada, Mexico, Belize and others.  Not only are the stories riveting,  they are written in the genuine style of an American Gulliver.     This  book is not to be missed!  For bikers, and non-bikers alike, this is  definitely one for your library, and the cab of your Peterbilt.       Mark  has written and recorded a companion audiocassette tape of Epic Motorcycle  Poetry called, "Gather 'Round Me Riders."  His gravelly,  coffee-edged, seductively smokey voice tells captivating tales of the road,  highlighted with the compelling production of the night he met the devil in  a rain storm.</span>
