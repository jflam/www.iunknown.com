                <span id="Label1">Chapter 1 of <I>Information Rules</I> begins with a description of the change brought on by technology at the close of the century--but the century described is not this one, it's the late 1800s. One hundred years ago, it was an emerging telephone and electrical network that was transforming business. Today it's the Internet. The point? While the circumstances of a particular era may be unique, the underlying principles that describe the exchange of goods in a free-market economy are the same. And the authors, Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian, should know. Shapiro is Professor of Business Strategy at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley and has also served as chief economist at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. Varian is the Dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley. Together they offer a deep knowledge of how economic systems work coupled with first-hand experience of today's network economy. They write:  <blockquote> Sure, today's business world is different in a myriad of ways from that of a century ago. But many of today's managers are so focused on the trees of technological change that they fail to see the forest: the underlying economic forces that determine success and failure.  </blockquote>  Shapiro and Varian go to great lengths to purge this book of the technobabble and forecasting of an electronic woo-woo land that's typical in books of this genre. Instead, with their feet on the ground, they consider how to market and distribute goods in the network economy, citing examples from industries as diverse as airlines, software, entertainment, and communications. The authors cover issues such as pricing, intellectual property, versioning, lock-in, compatibility, and standards. Clearly written and presented, <I>Information Rules</I> belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who has an interest in today's network economy--entrepreneurs, managers, investors, students. If there was ever a textbook written on how to do business in the information age, this book is it. Highly recommended. <I>--Harry C. Edwards</I> </span>

                    <span>The book starts by proclaiming that neo-classical economics is adequate for explaining the information economy. This claim is not backed up in the book. First, textbook neo-clasical equilibrium theory contains neither money nor 'information'. Second, the book merely discusses qualitatively and nonsystematically ideas like positive feedback and increasing returns that were better presented by Brian Arthur. Third, even asymmetric information is not discussed (Ackerlof and Stiglitz are not even mentioned). Fourth (or zeroth), there is not a single empirical graph in the entire book, and nothing of modern ideas of network theory. So I would say that the book is more or less on the same level as Kelly's (pre-bubble-bust) "New Rules for the New Economy". All of these books implicitly hype the unregulated free market, in the face of both qualitative and empirical evidence that unregulated markets are not only unstable but are detrimental to human health and well-being.</span>

                    <span>It was astounded by what descriped in the opening of the book: at first, the events seem to be at the current, but then they were happened at the last turn of century!<p>It is still the best anlaysis of network economy among 5 books that I read about, though 2 of which are also from Harvard.  This book just touches the heart of network economy, and it gives me a lot to further analyze the continuous economics events happening in the globe.</span>

                    <span>I read this for an information-age econ class I'm taking, and I really liked it. The authors refute the idea that traditional economic rules don't apply to the age of computers, information trading and cyber sales. They make a convincing case that it's all the same econ, just a new application, and I learned a great deal from it about both the traditional models and the economics of selling information. I really recommend it for anyone. It's very readable, accessible and cogent.</span>

                    <span>You will have to come back to it many times to improve continually your understanding and practices in the network economy... Invest money and time in "Information Economy, a Strategic guide to the Network Economy" is a real good investment as it gives you guide lines to understand deeply the emerging Network Economy but also how to deal strategically with the main encountered issues: pricing, versioning, rights management, lock-in approaches, and information policy.<p>Even if Carl Shapiro and Hal R Varian are saying that: "Technology changes, Economics laws do not" their careful analysis on networks and positive feedback is conducting them to write "Strategy in network markets is distinct from strategy in markets for information content, not to mention traditional industrial markets". In network markets positive feedback based on Metcalfe's Law - the value of a network goes up as the square of the number of users - makes the strong grow stronger ... and the weak grow weaker.<p>To maximize your return you need to find the balance between openness and control, compatibility and performance and to be ready to build alliances, to battle for standardization on your own or with partners... "It is not enough to have the best product, you have to convince customers that you will win" is a crucial idea to apply in the network economy to ignite a positive feedback and reach the critical mass necessary to fuel explosive growth. <p>The authors are presenting, through real-life examples including the Microsoft Netscape browser battle , a complete battlefield with maps of strategies and tactics to win and stay in the network economy. Keep this guide close to your hand, as it will become your better source of knowledge to be at the forefront of the New Economy. Personally I plan to re-read this book on regular basis to make sure to extract all the richness the authors have put in.</span>

                    <span>"Information Rules" is a hand book for economic layman to understand emerging Internet economy, to help reader to apply feasible strategies into network business. As author mentioned in the beginning of this book, this book is seeking models, concepts, and analysis, which will provide reader with a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles in today's high-tech industries, and enable reader to craft winning strategies for tomorrow's network economy.<p>Technology changes, economic laws do not. This is the thesis of this book. Shapiro & Varian do a great job of explaining how the fundamental principles of economics are still relevant, even in the new network economy. On the other hand, the technology increases the pace of economic game and requires greater speed and agility to keep playing. Thus, it's necessary to adopt new strategies based on fundamental economic principles.<p>Shapiro & Varian develop this thesis into ten chapters: The Information Economy, Pricing Information, Versioning Information, Rights Management, Recognizing Lock-In, Managing Lock-In, Networks and Positive Feedback, Cooperation and Compatibility, Waging a Standards War, and Information Policy. Specific strategies are suggested in each chapter. At the end of each chapter, "lessons" are summarized to for readers to outline the main ideas efficiently.<p>Following are some feature points and strategies this book has reached to enable myself to the network economy.<p>Point 1: Information is costly to produce but inexpensive to reproduce.<br>The competition between Britannica Encyclopedia and Microsoft's Funk & Wagnalls brings reader into this topic. The cost change of information products is coming up with the shifting of pricing models and corresponding versions of a product to create both the maximum revenue opportunities and establish the largest number of members of the product's network of users. <br>Strategy: Personalize your product and your prices<br>There are three ways to pricing information: personalized pricing, group pricing and versioning. Let's analogize those strategies to the modern fashion industry, a fashion designer can tailor dresses specifically for the need of one customer (personalized pricing) or a group of customer (group pricing). At the same time, he/she also designs different styles (different versions of your products) which are hanged in the window of shopping center. This allows customers to select the styles (versions) that best meets their needs and enables you to pick up as wide a base of customers as possible. There are variety of dimensions along which you can version your products: delay, user interface, convenience, image resolution, speed of operation, flexibility of use, capability, features and functions, comprehensiveness, annoyance, support.<br> <br>Point 2: Switching costs and lock-in<br>The total cost of switching = cost the customer bears + costs the new supplier bears. In companies' stance, products that can achieve "lock-in" will benefit from the "switching costs" that preclude customers from switching-over to competing solutions. The more successful you are at getting customers more locked-in to your products, the more successful you will be in keeping customers at peak prices.<br>Strategy: <br>1.Invest to build an installed base. 2.Cultivate influential buyers and buyers with high switching costs. 3.Get your customers to invest in your technology, thereby raising their own switching costs. 4.Sell complementary products and access to your installed base<p>Point 3: Positive feedback<br>The value of your product to new users depends on the total number of other users there are (externalities). As the base of users grows, more and more users add in. In information economy, the companies that have been propelled forward by positive feedback will become the biggest winners. So, it is the ultimate metric of success that each company pursues. <br>Strategy:<br>There are four generic strategies in network markets for igniting positive feedback, Controlled Migration (Windows 98), Performance Play (Iomega Zip), Open Migration (fax machines), Discontinuity (records to CDs).<p>Point 4: Standardization<br>The key assets in winning standards battle are: 1. Control of an installed base, 2. Intellectual property rights, 3. Ability to innovate, 4. First mover advantages, 5. Manufacturing abilities, 6. Presence in complimentary products, and 7. Brand name and reputation. Preemption and expectations management are two basic marketplace tactics that companies will need to employ.<p>Point 5: Intellectual property<br>Given the low cost of reproduction and quick, cheap and invisible distribution, protecting and managing intellectual property are more difficult. Although authors believe that the technological advance offer new opportunities which are far outweigh this rights problem, the solutions recommended here are relatively weak and difficult to carry out. <br>Strategy:<br>Take advantage of the lower distribution costs by promoting your products more effectively. Such as giving away free samples to sell the content, selling complementary products, choosing the terms and conditions that maximize the value of your property. <p>Besides those core points and strategies the book reaches, examples which integrate those points make whole book more readable. Authors use examples not only happened recently, but also 100 years ago. Such as interconnection battles were already existed in 1900 when local telephone companies were interconnected with Bell to provide long-distance service. 100 years later, browsers are interconnected with operating systems. History provided a pretty good guide for evaluating network-centric business.<br>However, almost all of these cases involve the very large firms: e.g. Microsoft, IBM, AT&T, which have strategic planning, high capitalization, and access to best consultants. But the very essence of the new information economy today is entrepreneurship, like Napster, Visi-calc, etc, with good ideas and lucky chance.<br>The most contradictive part in this book is chapter 6. Authors offer both sellers and buyers alternative strategies on how to manage Lock-in. No matter how effective those strategies are, the dilemma here is that if both sellers and buyers adopt the alternative strategies this book recommends, who will be the winners ultimately?<br>This book was published four years ago. The network economy has changed a lot since then. From the beginning of 2001, most Internet companies experienced the toughest time. As a reader of this book, a question comes to my mind constantly: are those information rules still applicable in today's network economy? According the thesis of this book, the answer should be yes. It's time to test the models of this book.</span>
