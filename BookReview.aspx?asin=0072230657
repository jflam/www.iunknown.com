                    <span>While most Oracle professionals associate Tom Kyte with Oracle developers, many of the insights from this book are helpful for the DBA staff. This book is somewhat mis-titled (as it is not really a Oracle design book), but it does have lot's of great examples of Oracle best practices and justifications for all assertions. Overall, highly recommended for both developers and DBA staff.</span>

                    <span>If you've ever looked over anything about the Oracle database, you've likely come across the name of this book's author, Tom Kyte. Like his articles, this book is designed to help the reader get the most out of the Oracle database. This is an excellent book for understanding the inner workings of Oracle database engine.<P>The theme of this book is that by understanding how Oracle works, you can write highly scalable, high performing applications. If you don't know how your database works, you'll always be frustrated and less likely to have a well-performing database. The author is absolutely serious about this point and drives it home by dispelling many myths surrounding Oracle (e.g. partitioning is always better than not partitioning). By discussing these technical details, the reader is equipped with the knowledge to build an application designed to perform.<P>If you're looking for a book to learn how to write effective PL/SQL, then you might be slightly disappointed by this book. While there is a great chapter on the Oracle specifics of writing SQL, this book is designed to architecting the entire database, not just the SQL statements run inside the database. I think this a very effective (and sadly novel) approach to database design. There are all too many books out there which concentrate on writing fast SQL, with little regard for the underlying data design and structure.<P>This is by far the best book I have read on understanding how Oracle works. The author covers everything from design to disaster recovery. If you are responsible for maintaining an Oracle database, I would highly recommend this book.</span>
