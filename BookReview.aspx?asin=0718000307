                    <span>Next time someone asks you to recommend a version of the Bible. You can suggest this one. With Litergically based "Morning and Evening Prayers" pg. 755 and an informative letter titled "How to read the Bible" by Bishop Tim Ware on pg.762 and a section on pg. 820 titled "Interpreting the Scriptures." This Bible helps bring Orthodoxy to the masses. And with the numerous versions out there many will find this one, to be one of only about three they really need to keep handy. (others that might be kept handy are the NRSV already mentioned, The Jerusalem Bible and The Orthodox Study Bible NKJV.) <BR>Unfortunatly, the study Bible consists only of the New Testament books (but one only has to get "The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocryphia" or NRSV) for O.T. interpretations that are geered twords Christian Orthodoxy.</span>

                    <span>_The Orthodox Study Bible: New Testament and Psalms_ is the only Eastern Orthodox study Bible available. This edition only contains the New Testament and the Psalms of the New King James translation. The text is commentated upon by notes giving the Orthodox teaching on Scripture. Currently, scholars at St. Athanasius Seminary are at work translating the entire Bible from the Septuagint, and will include the entire canonical Old Testament, including the Deutero-Canonical books (or as known to Protestants, the "Apocrypha") that are in the Greek Septuagint but not the Hebrew Bible. This edition contains information on how the Bible is viewed in the Orthodox Church, an outline of Orthodox history, tips on how the Bible is to be studied, a glossary of Orthodox Terms, a list of the Seventy, the lectionary and Orthodox prayers. The Canon of Scripture was decided AFTER the Ecumenical Council of Nicea, in which the Nicean Creed was drawn up as the statement of Orthodoxy, thus the Scripture is given its authority by the Church, and Scripture forms the centerpiece of the Church's Tradition dating from Christ and His Apostles. As another reviewer noted, this edition is a "who's who" of Orthodoxy, including Peter E. Gilquist, Jack Norman Sparks, Archbishop JAKOVOS, Bishop KALLISTOS, Bishop MAXIMOS and Fr. Anthondy Coniaris.</span>

                    <span>I applaud the efforts of those who contributed to the creation of this study. There are many helpful notes, introductions, and topical studies that elucidate themes central, or at least unique, to Eastern Orthodoxy. In particular I found helpful the notes in the Epistle to the Romans. At the same time, I was very disappointed to find that in many places the notes were quite dumbed-down. To make it worse, in the section of morning and evening prayers, which, by the way, are very handy, there is no mention of Mary, the Mother of our God and Savior Jesus Christ!! This has lead me to conclude two things. Firstly, this production is intended to convince Portestants that we Orthodox do indeed love the Scriptures and it is a tool to draw them into our fold (which isn't a bad thing!). Secondly, the claim that it is THE Orthodox Study Bible leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Perhaps I'm a nit-pick, but to neglect the Mother of God in the prayers is wrong when it's touted as THE OSB. Perhaps in its second printing it could be modified to say AN OSB.<P>Although there are many differences between the Orthodox and the Catholics, which I in no way dismiss as superficial, I still find the Jerusalem Bible's notes helpful. The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, my former home, has published through Concordia Publishing a helpful study Bible which an Orthodox could read with profit, although there will be obvious differences in parts (i.e., Romans and James). I recommend these titles since they are more scholarly than the OSB in most respects. Nonetheless, everything they say cannot be endorsed as Orthodox and, depending on the subject in question, caution must me used. <P>I think it can also be said that the whole idea of the interpritation of scripture is that the Church in our liturgies and sermons tells us what the meaing is and we learn by finding the scriptures within the liturgical life of Mother CHurch, the Bride of Christ. THat is also why in a sense we have no need for an authoritative translation. Of course some are better than others (I.E. Jerusalem bible over the NIV), but it is still not enough. We must have the mind of the Fathers from Abraham on down. <BR>All in all, don't forget that the concept of a study bible can lead to a "me and my bible" mentality even if you are reading one with notes from the holy Fathers. Keep going to liturgy, say your prayers, love your neighbor and your enemies and our loving Fahter will show you His will- with or without a Protestant-geared bible.<BR>THat said, it can certainly be used with profit. Just don't see it as the end all.</span>

                    <span>The foot notes are the best part of it. The text is just the NKJV New Testament with Orthodox footnotes to guide the reader in an Orthodox (pun intended) interpretation of Scripture. I'd get it all over again if I had the chance and I encourage all Orthodox Christians to do the same.</span>
