                    <span>Epting showed us where to find those places read about or seen in the movies, or on TV with his first boo "James Dean Died Here." In "Marilyn Monroe Dyed Here" he's back for another round of our cultural history, the book is not as rich as his first one. Sometimes it feels as if he's being forced to scrape the barrel a bit more for his landmarks. There are still a lot of fascinating places to be found and visited, but his first book used most of his 1st string material, so here he is often forced to revisit movies and events, and find the *other* places that might not be so important or known. As others have said, one would like to have more pictures, but a number of the places visited this time can't have pictures - the site is gone, or are a bit more generic. Would the listing for the hospital where the first test tube twins were born be a better listing if there was a picture of the building? I think not. <P>That said, the book is still a great trip along memory lane. Finding places where the famous and infamous met their end (there's a great section on the end of many of the gangsters we have heard about) or the building we saw in the movies, or every week on TV. Epting also is very good at noting what places are private, helping to try and prevent the curious trespassing. For those with a literary leaning, many of our famous authors are put in the locations where they produced their masterpieces. It's the kind of book you toss into the car for a road trip, or leave out on the coffee table for a conversation starter. The two volumes make an indispensable set for any fan of popular culture and the offbeat.</span>

                    <span>"Marylin Monroe Dyed Here" is one of those books that spawn great conversations. For those of you that own or have read Epting's first book, "James Dean Died Here" you know exactly what I'm talking about. It is FILLED with all kinds of killer facts and locations where historical Pop-Culture events took place. For instance, did you know the community park where "Bad News Bears" was shot, was actually built for the movie? Or do you know the location where the Rolling Stones recorded "Satisfaction" or "Paint it Black"? Or the fact that the opening for the show "Three's Company" was shot on the Santa Monica boardwalk? There are tons of facts from movies and music, to celebrations and murders! <P>You'll be amazed with all the information you'll find in this book (not to mention the cool cover design). And no matter where you live, there is probably an event that took place in your town which makes it relevant to practically everybody living in the United States. This book has facts which go back hundreds of years all the way up to stuff that happened last year. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Pop-Culture. It is a MUST HAVE!</span>

                    <span>You can purchase this book, and also Chris Epting's book<BR>"James Dean Died Here", and take mini-vacations to see landmarks, and other interesting locations in YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, CITY, OR STATE!<BR>This book is another interesting book for those like me who "have to put it down"...in other words "busy". <BR>So, each page and each pop culture location is a "chapter"!<BR>This is a wonderful take-a-long for WHERE EVER you are going, and WHENEVER. <BR>If you think you've seen it all in that city you're traveling to, think again, and look it up in this book!<BR>Also, this would be a great book for teachers, and for home-schooled children. GREAT FOR FIELD TRIPS TOO!</span>

                    <span>Another well written (and well researched) book by Chris Epting. No matter what interests you this is one of those books can't put down. Who knew that the apartment I used to drive by in San Francisco was once home to Osama bin Laden in the 1970s. Want to see it now? The address is right there in the book. Buying some flowers in Sherman Oaks? That shop used to be the gas station where James Dean bought gas for his Porsche just hours before he died. Stopping at the North Hollywood Bank of America to use the ATM? Did you know that this was the site of one of the biggest shootouts in the long history of the LAPD? Hundreds of stories from all corners of America are documented, along with photos and addresses so that you can stand where history was made. This is a book you will want to take with you whenever you travel and also would make a great gift for anyone of any age. The only negative is that we will probably have to wait at least a year for Mr. Epting's next book. If you know anybody with the Travel Channel get them this book-it would make a great TV series.</span>

                    <span>Chris Epting's 'Marilyn Monroe Dyed Here' because of its pick-up/put-down style, is a must-have, must-read coffee table or bathroom reader. We were thrilled to see in it places we have visited, intrigued by places we now hope to visit, and mortified to learn of places we walked past unknowingly. The book is very well researched and amusingly yet informatively written.</span>
