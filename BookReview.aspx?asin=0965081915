                    <span>I cannot recommend this book highly enough for the home gageteer. The author Jan Axelson is a rare example of someone that knows her stuff, explains it well to novices, and provides excellent generic examples of code. The examples provided cover situations such as; exporting data bits out thru the parallel port, reading info from the data port, searching for data ports and addresses, and using the parallel port to communicate pc to pc.  Seldom do you find a  "can-do" person that provides excellent instruction at a beginner's level.   The fascination of this book is that as home computers become more powerful, they are still limited in their effect on the external environment, except through dedicated peripherals, such as printers, scanners, etc. With this book, a pc port relay kit (purchased off the internet), and maybe a semester of Visual Basic instruction and " you da man ".  Once you can open and close a relay connected to your parallel port from a visual basic program you are off and running.  Most electrical devices in you home become fair game.  This book needs an update, except for a Tour-de Force in the beginning chapters of code segments in Pascal, Assembler And Quick-Basic, the remainder of the book is in Visual basic 4.0.   This reader had no problem importing the examples provided on the enclosed floppy disk into Visual Basic 5.0 .  This author has also written a sister book "The Complete Serial Port ", and it is on my "must read " list.</span>

                    <span>i found this book to be of great use.  it is fairly well written, comes with software and lots of sample circuit schematics for building things.  <p>there dont appear to be that many books on this subject available (last time i looked on amazon i got 6 results) and i was pleased to find that this book provided me with the information i required to complete certain projects.  household automation and a security system being among them.<p>i have to admit that the visual basic code is a bit long winded, and am left asking the question, why not just use assembly language (3 lines of code required to write to or read from a port, as opposed to dozens of lines of code to do it with visual basic).  though i guess most people dont have time to go and learn how to program in assembler before hand.  but if your reading this and have considered maybe learning assembly language, i urge you to do so.  its not neally as hard as people say, just takes some getting used to and some patience.  a good beginner assembly language book is Kip R. Irvine's "assembly language for intel based computers".  and a more advanced one which i hold in high regard is "The 80x86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers (Volumes I & II) Assembly Language, Design, and Interfacing".  NOTE:  assembly language is really the only way to go for real time control.<p>overall im very happy i bought this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting this information, unless they were intending to do something with an nt based operating system, in which case this book is useless to them, beyond explaining how the parallel port works, and for the example circuits.</span>

                    <span>Do not purchase the e-book version of this book.<br>The e-book version is over protected, Over priced and almost completely usless. <br>You Cannot print or copy and past the example code for use in your own programs. You do not get the Code disk with this either.<br>Neither can you copy the e-book to another computer or, as I was wanting, to a PDA. (The e-book is encripted)<br>Do Not waste your money on the e-book version of this book!<br>You will be better off with the Hard copy + Code disk.</span>

                    <span>Jan really created a masterpiece here.  This book is a must for every hacker's library.  Every Visual Basic user needs the information in this book if they plan to use the PP for I/O.  In addition, it is full of very helpful information.  No fluf pages here, all solid meat!</span>
