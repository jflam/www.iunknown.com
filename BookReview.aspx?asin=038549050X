                <span id="Label1">This inspiring autobiography from two-time NFL Most Valuable Player Brett Favre provides an honest, detailed look at the author's personal struggles along the way to becoming a successful pro quarterback. After overcoming an injury from a serious automobile accident in college, drug addiction early in his professional career, and persistent doubts about his ability to lead the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl, Favre met his challenges head-on and established himself as one of the sport's superstars.</span>

                    <span>First I want to say something about the book. It's great!! If your a true fan of the Packers and want to know about one of the teams, and NFLs greatest players, buy this book. It shows you the kind of person Favre is on and off the field. He takes you through the ups and downs of his life and career that have made him the person and player he is today.Now, for the other reviews I read before writing this one. What promted some numbnuts to write about the packers loss to St. Louis in the playoffs in a book review?? They must be a Bears fan! Another one decided to write that Brett and his family were (...) That's intelligent. I know when I go to read a review about a book that interests me, I want to have to wade through the garbage that idiots like that jerk take up space with.For those of you with a brain in your head, trust me, Farve: For The Record is a great read!!</span>

                    <span>As a Londoner, who learnt to appreciate American football at 21, I wanted background reading to enhance my enjoyment. I started by looking into favourite players of mine, so came this book!<P>I wanted to understand what goes on in players mind before a big game. How they react to the coach barking orders. How they conduct themselves on and off the field. This book helped me to do all these things and more. Favre is not a roboback, he is an individual with flair and creativity, which is why this book is so entertaining. <P>I seem to be able to climb right on into Brett's head, and into his personal life through the pages in this book, which is enlightening to say the least. We hear about his highs and lows, and he is frank about his addiction to Vicodin, and his relationships with players and coaches alike.<P>I think this book is for American Football fans only, which explains why this was my first Amazon purchase, (This book isn't in print in the UK) but for a fan of the Packers, or just a Football fan in general, you can do no wrong in buying this, which will no doubt increase your respect for the stress players endure every game.</span>

                    <span>Will Brett ever update this book to include the humiliating defeat to the St. Louis Rams in the playoffs last week? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love reading about his near-death experiences behind the wheel, and his love of prescription medication as much as the next guy, but what I really want to know is how he looks his teammates eye-to-eye after completely folding and ending the Packer's season. Does he really want us to believe he doesn't drink anymore? After that game, if Brett doesn't go out and get a case of Pabst to wash down the 3 bottles of Vicadin he has been saving for such a humiliation, I'll be greased-up and defiled like the 17-year old babysitter at Mark Chamura's house. I wouldn't be surprised (or saddened) to see Packer fans (are there any left up dere?) lining up on rural overpasses and the top of tall buildings (packing plants?) waiting to jump to their not-soon-enough deaths after losing to Kurt Warner and the lowly Rams. We can only hope Brett is jumping next. Before you jump, please write a new chapter for us Brett!</span>

                    <span>This is a good book ,the problem came from the fixation they put on his painkillers addiction and the problems it bring with his wife and teammates.You also have a lot of details about the health problems this addiction caused to him,a little bit like "Drugs is bad to you,see what it do to me."His wife almost let him down for that,his teammates are tired of him asking for Vicodin and others painkillers.The two or three first paragraphs talk about that, but chapter after chapter they come back with it.The book talk to much about his "post popularity" life and not enough of him when he was unknown.His "post popularity" life are report in all the daily newspapers,that why I expect to learn more about Bret Favre before he was a star.They pass to fast on his teens years,his collegiate years.The reason to write a biography his to talk about the unknown parts of someone life,but in this book you just found what everybody read on the last five years newspapers.That a good but incomplete book.</span>
