                <span id="Label1"><P> Competing on Internet time means competitive advantage can be won and lost overnight. In this penetrating analysis of strategy-making and product innovation in the dynamic markets of commercial cyberspace, bestselling <I>Microsoft Secrets</I> co-author Michael Cusumano and top competitive strategy expert David Yoffie draw vital lessons from Netscape, the first pure Internet company, and show how it employs the techniques of "judo strategy" in its pitched battle with Microsoft, the world's largest software producer. <P> With a new afterword updating the events of the year following publication of the hardcover edition, <I>Competing on Internet Time</I> is essential and instructive reading for all managers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who want to succeed in ultra-fast-paced markets. Managers in every high-tech industry will discover a wealth of new ideas on how to create and scale up a new company quickly; how to compete in fast-paced, unpredictable industries; and how to design products for rapidly evolving markets.</span>

                    <span>Probably fine as a business tome, but as an entertaining read, I found this a failure. I hardly got through the first few pages; the books starts with a long, obvious and patronising exposition about how internet has transformed our lives and what a revolution it's been. It reminded me a lot of "The Road Ahead" by Bill Gates.<br>  Microsoft has been commercially successful, but at the cost of integrity. It has none whatsoever. This may indeed be Microsoft's downfall in the end, because the hatred towards this company is reaching a fever pitch. More and more users will realise that they can get by using other operating systems and products, supported by companies who have a less selfish vision for the future of computing.</span>

                    <span>One thing that I especially enjoyed about this book is that it almost completely avoided any gratuitous Gates/Microsoft bashing that appears to be vogue these days.  Instead, Cusumano and Yoffie take the reader on a detailed yet interesting dissection of the organizations and decision making processes of the top brass at both Microsoft and Netscape.  I also liked the way the authors would candidly point out where bad decisions/strategies were made, but fairly analyzed why they failed, and why they might have seemed like good decisions at the time.  The allusions and comparisons to judo strategy in business were interesting as well.</span>

                    <span>These two business school professors (...) interviewed many people at Netscape and elsewhere. Though the conclusions do not come through as strongly in the book as they might, we learn that Netscape made three major mistakes: 1) it did not focus and execute on a long-term strategy, 2) it's software engineering practices were not as good as Microsoft's, and 3) it's software engineers were not as talented as Microsoft's. The biggest mistake was Netscape kept changing its mind about what business it was in. As a result, it was not able to execute hard enough and long enough to win.<p>Focus and Execution are key element of any business success!</span>

                    <span>Michael A. Cusumano and David B. Yoffie have written a play-by-play of the competition between Netscape and Microsoft in an enormously detailed book that became an instant classic. Adding to the insider scoop, the authors take the opportunity to show readers how they can apply the "lessons" from this historic corporate battle to their own businesses in the context of today's fast-paced world, which runs on "Internet time." Critically acclaimed, the book is filled with facts, figures, insights and strategies, and manages to do it all without drowning in tedium. We at getAbstract highly recommend this book to people in all business. It's exceptionally well written and flows like a good adventure saga, which it is. (getAbstract note: Despite its commendable Judo tactics, Netscape in late 1998 was acquired by America Online Inc. in a deal that was roundly viewed as a final victory for Microsoft in the browser war.)</span>

                    <span>I had bought this book about a year ago, but never got around to reading it until now. My mistake! This is an excellent chronology and analysis of Netscape's growth and the challenges it faced. The quotes from the interviews with many key people at Netscape, as well as people at Microsoft, joined with the authors' analysis was great. I found many, many analogies to Netscape's perdicament  with my own challenges at work. I read "AOL.com" by Kara Swisher, which was a good chronology of AOL.com, but it's the analysis and chronology that really differentiates "Competing on Internet Time" from most other "high-tech" books.</span>
