                    <span>I bought this book because I wanted to get closer to an original translation of the I-Ching. I found Alfred Huang's version very appealing, and I liked his occasional comments on the Taoist versus the Confucian view. But then I took another look at Kerson and Rosemary Huang's I-Ching (ISBN 0-89480-319-0), which goes to a pre-Confucian translation of the oracle based on recent archaelogical findings. Previously I found Kerson and Rosemary's images limiting, now I find them clear and poetic; but I had to read Alfred Huang's version to appreciate the difference. I'm giving it 4 stars because now that I've seen both, I feel they work best together.</span>

                    <span>this is by far the best translation I've read, it simply outdoes any other English translation.  it focuses on the ancient Chinese tradition that follows the I Ching, and has a great deal regarding the history that it carries over the three thousand years of its exsistence.</span>

                    <span>Pretty much what has been said in other reviews are accurate. I want to say that there is a certain logic and flow to both Alfred Huang's writing and to the sequences of the hexagrams that I did not see in other texts. He also stresses that the core of I-Ching is not about divination but about coduct and sincerity. I never expected a book on divination could be so touching. Although it is probably out of character for Mr Huang to read reviews of his work, I hope that he does for the sake of knowing the lives he touched rather than for ego. It made me into a Taoist.

                    <span>Expertly translated by Alfred Huang, a third-generation master of Wu style Tai Chi Chuan, Chi Kung, and Oriental meditation, The Complete I Ching is the ancient Eastern philosophical classic and book of divination that has been used since ancient times to seek meaning. This English version is exceptional in that it includes full translations Confucius' Ten Wings, his commentaries and insights that are crucial to the wisdom the I Ching has to offer. An extensive introduction teaches the reader about the subtleties of the translation as well as instructions for using the I Ching in the manner it was meant to be used. Due to its exhaustive and meticulous accuracy, The Complete I Ching is the version to have for English speakers interested in exploring the insights and uses of this age-old resouce.</span>

                    <span><br>The most difficult task when translating a document from its original source language into another language is to carry across the full *meaning* of the work (as it was intended, not how its interpreted). This is virtually impossible to do without a thorough understanding of both the original language (that which the document is written in), and of the culture that is transmitted via that language. Until now, this has been the same problem that has plagued other English translations of the I Ching.<p>Previously, these other translations have relied upon a Western perspective and understanding, leaving something important behind... the cultural wisdom behind the I Ching. Even the best translations available prior to that of Master Huang (those by Wilhelm, Legge and Blofeld) have failed to fully relate the cultural wisdom inherent in the I Ching. They've come close, but close isn't close enough.  These translations lack the open-endedness of the Chinese I Ching that lead to its multiple interpretations and are inherent in the Chinese writings of antiquity. To gain an understanding from a Chinese perspective requires an understanding that only someone living within the culture and fluent in the language, with many years of practical experience (and training), has to offer. Enter Huang.<p>To truly experience a culture, and its wisdom, one must experience it first hand. Raised in China and spending a good many years of his life working with the I Ching, Master Huang has gained an understanding of the I Ching that most of us could only hope to experience. He has taken on the monumental task of translating this amazing book into English, with the cultural wisdom, open-endedness and fluidity of the original I Ching, and succeeded. <p>This is, bar-none, the best English translation of the I Ching published to date, and the only version you'll ever need (unless you enjoy collecting books). I cannot recommend it enough!</span>
