Or, as a pregnant Mary Gordon said when her doctor told her she was having a boy, "Oh, my God. What am I supposed to do with one of them?" <P> From the earliest days of nursing to the good-byes of college and looming adulthood, these writers collectively explore, in a thrilling range of styles and sensibilities, the delights and frustrations, the deep and often conflicted emotions, they feel in their roles as mothers to their male children. <I>Between Mothers and Sons</I> resoundingly and unflinchingly celebrates this journey we are all making with our boys. <P><BR> with essays from: <P><BR> Julene Bair  &#134;  Janet Burroway  &#134;  Robb Forman Dew<BR> Deborah Galyan  &#134;  Mary Gordon  &#134;  Joy Harjo  &#134;  Anne Lamott<BR> Susan Lester  &#134;  Jo-Ann Mapson  &#134;  Leigh McKinley<BR>  Valerie Monroe  &#134;  Naomi Shihab Nye  &#134;  Eileen Pollack<BR> Jewell Parker Rhodes  &#134;  Patricia Stevens  &#134;  Sallie Tilsdale<BR> Kris Vervaecke  &#134;  Patricia Williams<BR></span>

                    <span>Each in her own way, the writers in this collection make complex connections -- with their sons and with readers. There's a great range of experiences here for the reader who wants to concentrate on the mother-son relationship rather than on family relationships in general.<P>I sometimes cried and more often laughed -- but I also thought about my female friends and their sons, and agreed with what I was reading -- then remembered my mother and sisters and their sons, and argued back -- considered my male friends, and understood more than I had before. <P>The authors had some great stories to tell, and the quality of the writing fully repaid a second (and for some essays, a third) reading. The author's own very moving contribution was my favorite, but months after reading the book, there are many moments I remember.</span>

                    <span>I bought Between Mothers and Sons for myself as a Mother's Day gift when my son was 3 months old. I was moved viscerally by the essays contained in this book. Although I do agree with the reviewer from Wisconsin that the collective voice of these essays is limited, I feel that the emotional tumult felt and expressed by these very talented women is universal.</span>

                    <span>Stevens has gathered a well-written and insightful collection of essays by very talented women. The challenges of raising sons are presented in sometimes poignant, frequently amusing, and generally thought-provoking ways. But I kept wishing for some other perspectives. All of the women whose writings are collected here seem to be on a single page. They're all feminists; few get any child-rearing help or wisdom from the boys' fathers; most seem to have no spiritual foundation (LaMott is an obvious exception). I would have liked to read a more balanced collection of authors.</span>
