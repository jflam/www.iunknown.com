                <span id="Label1">Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the use of functions (in contrast to object-oriented programming, which emphasizes the use of objects).  It has become popular in recent years because of its simplicity, conciseness, and clarity.  This book teaches functional programming as a way of thinking and problem solving, using Haskell, the most popular purely functional language.  Rather than using the conventional (boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language textbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications, including graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader with working programs for inherently more interesting applications.  Aimed at both beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle introduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced topics.  Details about progamming in Haskell are presented in boxes throughout the text so they can be easily found and referred to.</span>

                    <span>As an experienced programmer new to Haskell I found this book both enlightening and frustrating.  The author does a superb job of teaching you how to think like a functional programmer, his stated goal, but occasionally leaps over too many steps for a beginner to follow his implementations.  The book is however quite readable and works well in conjunction with the various on-line tutorials on Haskell syntax.  I'd recommend the book for anyone looking to get into serious functional programming.</span>

                    <span>I already knew Haskell when I started reading this book, but it held my interest right through to the end.  This is largely due to Hudak's choice of interesting application domains (graphics, animation, robotics, music) and how neatly applications in these domains can be expressed in Haskell.  (As an advanced reader, I was particularly interested in the treatment of the design and implementation of his functional animation language.)  More than just that, though, the book's success derives from a very nice blending of theory and practice.  I especially liked his use of calculational reasoning as a approachable form of program proof.  I highly recommend this book if you want to learn functional programming--tastefully--and have fun while doing it.</span>

                    <span>An excelent book on programming. Every programmer that wants to go beyond just the syntax of a programming language, no matter which one, should read this text. You will not only learn Haskell syntax but you will actually master *thinking functionaly*. <br>After reading the first half of the book , I find myself much more comfortable with 2nd order programming and , as I use mostly C++ and Java in my professional carrier, I start to miss the elegance and high level of abstraction supported by functional languages.<br>A book that will help you to master Haskell and change the way you think about programms.</span>

                    <span>This text is nicely produced and has some interesting examples of Haskell programming. However, the book is mainly examples of Haskell and functional programming rather than explanations of Haskell and FP. The exposition is  spotty and assumes a lot. It would best be considered a second book for  those learning Haskell.</span>

                    <span>This book takes a nice approach to teaching functional programming. Paul Hudak uses fun examples, with applications to multimedia. Early on you are using the graphics library to make shapes in windows, and by the end there is Haskore, a cool way to compose music. However, these examples are not  JUST fun, they also serve as nice examples of how to think about and  construct functional programs, in domains where functional programs really  excel. If you ever thought about learning what this stuff was about, this  book is the right choice!</span>
