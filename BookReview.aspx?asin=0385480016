                <span id="Label1">Think you've got a book inside of you? Anne Lamott isn't afraid to help you let it out. She'll help you find your passion and your voice, beginning from the first really crummy draft to the peculiar letdown of publication. Readers will be reminded of the energizing books of writer Natalie Goldberg and will be seduced by Lamott's witty take on the reality of a writer's life, which has little to do with literary parties and a lot to do with jealousy, writer's block and going for broke with each paragraph.  Marvelously wise and best of all, great reading.</span>

                    <span>Anne LaMott has been an author and creative writing teacher in California. And in her book Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, she tells us how she helps her students start writing, often using their own lives as fodder. Her simple advice is: Write, write, write. She suggests we try hard to recall our first memory, first day of school, first love, first of everything. So many of us have stories to tell, but we don't get started with pen to paper, hands to keyboard. She reminds us not to worry about the first draft, and to worry about libel later! 
<br />
<br />I laughed as she described an editor by comparing them to a friend who will "put your pet down" when you pet has outlived its usefulness, and you can't do it yourself. This brand of humor is what you can expect from this and many of her books. 
<br />
<br />Check her out. It took me forever to read Bird by Bird because I highlighted endlessly and took copious notes - and I thought of my first memories. You will, too. 
<br />
<br />Other Lamott books: Blue Shoe; Crooked Little Heart, Rosie; All New People, Hard Laughter, Plan B: Future Thoughts on Faith plus she has short stories in many other books.

                    <span>As an aspiring opera singer, I think "Bird By Bird" speaks to any artist who is struggling with the desire to share their gift with a world that is full of rejection.  Anne's insights are fantastically sarcastic and full of truth.  Thank you for speaking my mind, Anne.  I have quoted you through tears of laughter to more than one friend.</span>

<br />you held my hand, 
<br />when I was at that fragile time after publishing and before getting any feedback.  Any writer will benefit from her wit and inspiration, whether they are just starting, trying to publish, or whatever.  </span>

                    <span>A 1994 book, Bird by Bird, that I just discovered by accident the other day at the library aroused my interest just by the title; the story in the book from which the title is derived is writing advice at its best and most succinct, and as I glanced through it, I immediately became engaged in  author Lamott's ability to make me believe that she was talking to me about a subject that I am deeply interested in--the craft and labor and joy and pain of writing. If you want valuable writing advice--advice that is immediately and enormously useful--read this book. If you want encouragement to seek after and write about the truth, read this book.  If you want to consider the value, significance, and philosophy of writing, and you believe that writing can be a gift to other people (and to yourself,) by now, you know what to do.
<br />
<br />This book is chocked full of useful advice with sensible explanations.  Lamott comes across very human, likeable, and as a person wanting to use her writing as a gift to help others.  She takes us into her confidence and tells us about death, babies, friends, ego, frustrations, fears, and other personal feelings. I enjoyed being let in on how she teaches writing.
<br />
<br />Lamott is very instructive, interesting, persuasive,and in the end, this 237 page book concluded far too quickly.  It is the type of book I will reread sections of, maybe more than once or twice.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I am interested in reading some of her other work.  In my opinion, if you are interested in encountering a "real" person/author, you should be interested as well.

                    <span>My teacher in my creative writing class handed out an excerpt from this book, and as soon as I read it, I knew I wanted to read the entire book, and thank God I did. 
<br />
<br />This is absoluetely one of the BEST books I have ever read. I am not the type of person to pick a favorite book (there are just too many!) but I'm pretty sure this is my favorite book of all time. This was my first time reading Anne Lamott and I am so thankful that I did. As soon as I finished it, I wanted to pick it right back up and read it again, but I settled for Traveling Mercies instead, which is also very good.
<br />
<br />I HIGHLY reccommend this book, especially if you like to write, or want to write. This is the best writing advice I have ever had, and you definetely will not be dissapointed. Even if you don't like to write, I am pretty sure you will love Bird by Bird. The humor is so fantastic, it's the laugh-out-loud type. Laugh A LOT out loud type. Anne Lamott says things that we all think, but do not say. It's great.
<br />
<br />READ THIS BOOK!!</span>
