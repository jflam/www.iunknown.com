                    <span>If you are interested at all in nature photography, you will enjoy and benefit from any of John Shaw's works. Shaw is a clear, concise writer as well as a great photographer. Focus On Nature is a wonderful in-depth look at a meaningful approach to nature photography. In his usual friendly style, Shaw teaches how to capture the environment as well as its wildlife and how to go beyond merely identifying, "headshots" of animals. He makes a good point, along with many others, that since any photographer (who can afford it) can use a long lens, the true challenge is to capture something much more meaningful.</span>

                    <span>What separates this book from many others is that it concentrates entirely on the aesthetics of photography, rather than the equipment. Most photography enthusiasts (including myself) are equipment fanatics, and are convinced that photographic nirvana is just another L series lens ahead! This book reduces the essence of the visualization into its basic elements, teaches you (with fabulous examples) to see nature in terms of light, form, texture, pattern, and color. It will change the way you see the world.</span>

                    <span>John Shaw is an amazing photographer. This is the third book of his that I have bought. What helpful hints, though I wish that he was using Canon instead of Nikon...<P>I will continue to use his many wondeful ideas.<P>I hope that he keeps the great books coming.</span>

                    <span>I'm ordering this one for my husband's Christmas present. He's checked out a dozen or so similar books from the library the past year--this one is far and away the most outstanding. Shaw makes art with his camera--not just pretty pictures</span>
