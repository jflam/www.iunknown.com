                <span id="Label1">Do you remember your first glove? Or the one that meant the most to you? Almost everyone does.  <P>Bernie Williams does. So does Greg Maddux. Hall of Famers Dave Winfield and Jim Palmer do as well. Indeed, just above every major leaguer remembers his first glove. Some, such as Doug Rader, who won five straight Gold Gloves at third base with the Houston Astros, even wore the same glove from sandlot games all the way to the pros.  <P>Glove Affairs: The Romance, History, and Tradition of Baseball Glove will help you recall your fist glove as it shares similar memories from the game's greats. Glove Affairs also provides informative and surprising details about the history of the glove, its evolution, and its place in American culture.  <P>More than just an ode to the glove, however, Glove Affairs serves as a practical guide to purchasing, breaking in, maintaining, and repairing a glove. Dozens of current and former major leaguers offer their battle-tested advice about getting the most out of a glove. They also share countless stories, from the passionate to the hilarious, about the glove and their relationship to it, including their superstitions and rituals, some of which are downright bizarre.  <P>Whether you're a little leaguer seeking tips about buying and caring for your first glove or just a little leaguer at heart hoping to revisit fond memories, Glove Affairs will educate you, illuminate you - and stir your emotions.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book. It's well written, has a good variety of information and is very attractive in it's presentation, plus it's "accessible" to all types of baseball fans. If you're a glove aficionado (which I am not) perhaps you'll not find all you would hope for here, but that sort of book wouldn't be anywhere near as useful. Oh, and I grew up across the street from Noah Liberman and we played lots of sandlot ball together, although I've not seen him in two decades. Reading his book makes me miss those good old days. I still have the glove I used back then but I have to admit it's got some mildew, and I know that's at least one strike against me.</span>

                    <span>A well researched, written and needed book on one of baseball's fascinating subjects: the baseball glove. Liberman has touched all the bases and ... fingers on this<BR>equipment topic. <BR> My favorites and I'm sure many readers will find highly interesting, are the interviews with former and current major leaguers, the men who trusted and trust their living with this tool.<BR> It's a fine catch for any baseball fan.</span>

                    <span>I must say upfront that I am not a glove collecter, so my perspective may be different from the other gentleman. However I am a true baseball fan. A big part of the enjoyment of baseball when you are young is getting your first baseball glove. For me, it started with an old hand-me -down fom my father - so seeing a lot of the old gloves and pictures of the great baseball stars was enjoyable. The bottom line is that this book lived up to the reason I bought it ... it was FUN to read for me. I am going to give it to my son to read and I think it would be an excellant book for all little league players as well. It is obvious that the author has a real passion for the baseball glove and wrote a book that reflected that. I especially enjoyed the stories, the ideosynchrasies of different professional players and the illustrations. I learned a lot of things about the baseball glove that I did not know. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>This is a really neat book. Very different. It covers lots of angles on gloves. Famous people remember their first glove, the history of the glove, pro players and all their insights about gloves, plus fixing a glove and buying a glove and breaking them in. It's nostalgic, but it doesn't hit you over the head with the nostalgia and all that like a lot of baseball books do. These glove collectors on www.Amazon.com seem to have a beef about the book not being a reference book for them, but I wouldn't want that kind of book. This one covers all of the bases!</span>
