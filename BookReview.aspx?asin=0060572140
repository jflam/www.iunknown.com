                <span id="Label1"><p> What happens when the person who is your family is someone you aren't bound to by blood? What happens when the person you promise to love and to honor for the rest of your life is not your lover, but your best friend? In <i>Truth & Beauty,</i> her frank and startlingly intimate first work of nonfiction, Ann Patchett shines a fresh, revealing light on the world of women's friendships and shows us what it means to stand together. </p> <p> Ann Patchett and Lucy Grealy met in college in 1981, and, after enrolling in the Iowa Writers' Workshop, began a friendship that would be as defining to both of their lives as their work was. In her critically acclaimed and hugely successful memoir, Autobiography of a <i>Face,</i> Lucy Grealy wrote about losing part of her jaw to childhood cancer, the years of chemotherapy and radiation, and then the endless reconstructive surgeries. In <i>Truth & Beauty,</i> the story isn't Lucy's life or Ann's life, but the parts of their lives they shared. This is a portrait of unwavering commitment that spans twenty years, from the long, cold winters of the Midwest, to surgical wards, to book parties in New York. Through love, fame, drugs, and despair, this book shows us what it means to be part of two lives that are intertwined. </p> <p> This is a tender, brutal book about loving a person we cannot save. It is about loyalty, and about being lifted up by the sheer effervescence of someone who knew how to live life to the fullest. </p></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In chronicling the events surrounding Ann Patchett's relationship with Lucy Grealy, the author has written neither a biography nor an autobiography, but instead an encomium. That Grealy touched Patchett's life is unquestionable, but Patchett seems unwilling or unable to offer more than surface insight into why she fostered an obviously non-reciprocal relationship with the urchin-like Grealy, who plopped into her life full tilt. Ann extolls Lucy's celebrity-like charisma, but by comparison that often makes Ann seem akin to a groupie. Too frequently Grealy comes across as a petulant child in the "maternalish" consternation of Patchett's voice.<P>The book is beautifully written, but the subject matter is not beautifully analyzed. I would have appreciated more of Patchett's insights and opinions about whether a relationship this intense and unbalanced was really a friendship at all. By the time the book ends, she clearly is still too raw to share this with us. If it had been written with the benefit of more time lapsing since Grealy's death, we might have also learned about the resulting philosophical changes in Patchett's "life without Grealy." As it stands, I fear the book serves as little more than an admittedly interesting footnote to Grealy's life.</span>

                    <span>I read this book directly after reading Autobiography of a Face. Lucy seemed to have a huge black hole in her soul that she constantly looked to others to fill up. Obviously she never learned to love herself, so her friends were her mirrors to her soul. She searched endlessly for love on the outside but her greatest quest was her search for the ability to love herself with all her physical flaws.<BR>I saw Lucy's repeated surgeries simply a way to stay connected with something she knew and a place where she felt comfortable and accepted. The surgeries were physically painful but they gave her an opportunity to have everyone care for her openly and with such extraordinary allegiance, a true sign of love. Lucy could never quite embrace it and assimilate that love into her psyche.<BR>Was it guilt that drove Ann to write this book wondering if there wasn't something she could have done to make the ending different? I felt a sense of relief when Lucy's life was finally over. What quality did she ever have in her existence? I think Ann went above and beyond the realm of friendship. One has to wonder why she hung in there through everything for a one-way friendship? Why was Ann so possessed by Lucy? It's a question we will never know but one that the book continually asks.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Patchett's book is a beautifully written tribute to an exceptionally intense friendship. The author takes you through her relationship with Lucy Grealy although side-stepping prolonged analysis of why their bond was so tight. The reader can draw his or her own conclusion; close attention should be paid to the excerpts from Grealy's letters, which reveal her intellect, her delight in words and her charisma. One thing that astonished me, despite having read Autobiography of a Face when it was first published, was how much physical discomfort Grealy constantly dealt with. Her problem was far more than just an aesthetic problem -- she had only six teeth left, couldn't chew food normally and was constantly in danger of choking because she couldn't close her lips. It amazes me that she was able to be as productive as she was despite to this condition, even before factoring in the multiple surgeries. Grealy clearly had the heart of a lion and it's no surprise that people were drawn to her inner strength, even when it was clouded by her understandable depression and feelings of isolation and want.</span>
