                <span id="Label1">A woman only begins to be a woman when she ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates her life. And as she adapts her mind to that regulating factor, she ceases to accuse others as the cause of her condition, and builds herself up in strong and noble thoughts.</span>

                    <span>The original of this piece "As A Man Thinketh" is a profound piece, but distinctly marred from a female point of view by the inextricably male casting of the reader. This book is a much easier to take read for me and I think for most women (though it would be as irritating for most men as the original was for most women). It is somewhat more subtly marred by the occassional misuse of a gender term - I.e. "womanly" does not substitute straight for "manly" in most usage without making the resultant sentence rather odd.<P>Other than this quibble, it is an excellent book and one I would recommend to anyone as nourishing food to feed your mental life.</span>

                    <span>This book goes with me nearly everywhere. I'd read it several years ago and it was helpful in getting me to get outside myself, and change my attitude a bit (oh, what a helpless victim of circumstance and other people's actions I'd been!)<P>Later, I ordered up several copies to hand out. When I was an executive, other women would sometimes come to me with complaints about who did this to them, and why they were helpless to change. Everything I suggested had a 'Yeah, but...<sigh>' attached to it. Before I hit my mid-40's, I was caught in the drama, feeling responsible and depressed by their circumstnaces. <P>Then I started handing out copies of the book. I'm sure many thought I was nuts, but a couple have actually gotten the message. <P>I'm not a tough-minded broad, but a bleeding heart liberal who finally realized you can help a fellow working-woman to grow not by solving her problems, but by supporting her as she learns she can do it herself.<P>The language in the book (really a booklet) is based on "As A Man Thinketh", but altered just slightly for women. It is invigorating to realize that what is true for the gander is true for the goose.<P>Don't be put off by the style - "Woman is buffetted by circumstances so long as she believes herself to be the creature of outside conditions, but when she realizes that she is a creative power, and that she may command the hidden soil and sees of her being out of which circumstances grow, she then becomes the rightful master of herself."<P>Oh yes! So, here's the message - what you think and do greatly affects what happens to you. You aren't the victim you think you are, so move on! <P>"As A Man Thinketh" and "As I Think" are also available.</span>

                    <span>This book has added a lot of richness and inspiration to my relationship with God. It is true that if one thinks negatively all the time nothing good will come out of his/her but if one thinks positively everything he/she does will yeild good results: this book makes it perferct and simple to grasp the concept. I will recommend "As a man thinketh" to everyone who is willing to improve upon their thinking process. I also believe that we are what we think. You will not regret spending money on it. I bought one for my husband and I keep mine in my purse for easy access and reference. God bless you.</span>

                    <span>A friend gave me a copy of this book in 1992. I have read it every year since. It is a great inspiration and a truly profound book. I look forward to reading As a Man Thinketh as well.</span>
