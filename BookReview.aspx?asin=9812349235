                    <span>I recently purchased this book for my mother who is going to South Africa for a vacation. The book was so helpful for me two years ago, that I wanted to make sure she had it. (My copy is marked up and the seams are a bit worn!) I like the books's balanced report on the history of South Africa, and the fact that it is neither for rich travelers with no budget, nor is it for poor students. The sections on things to buy and places to go are great, with enough examples to give you choices, but not simply a laundry list of restaurants and stores. It also has good information on things like local languages and cultures.<P>Great book and I'd recommend it to anyone.</span>

                    <span>I had the opportunity to visit SA for a month in 1999. I knew going that I would have an informed friend to host and guide me, so I did not bring any guide books with me. However, when I returned home and had 34 rolls of film to show, I wanted a book to accompany the photos and act like its own souvenier. After looking at many titles, I settled on the Insight Guide because of its excellent balance of basic information (incl. a well-written chapter on the history), color photos (on the order of National Geographic), maps, tourist information (what to do; where to go; how to prepare; etc.), and candor about apartheid. I never regretted paying a few extra dollars more for the book because it stood head and shoulder above the competition. It's the book I would have made had I the opportunity. The mulitple authors are well-informed, and though some info might be outdated, one has to remember-- this is AFRICA!</span>

                    <span>I've just come back from a 4 month stay in Africa - spending 3 weeks of that time in the Republic of South Africa. This book is packed with useful information on South African life, the different regions of the country, and the major cities/tourist resorts. In addition, beautiful pictures depicting South Africans and their country fill this book. The back of the book has several dozen pages with hotel listings, tourist information, and other need-to-know information - VERY useful. One compliant I have, though, is that some of the information is out of date: ie. phone numbers for hotels, train times, etc. I was glad that I had this book for my trip to South Africa, I was able to enjoy my time there just that little bit more because I had this book with me.</span>
