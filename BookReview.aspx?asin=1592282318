                    <span>Let me start first with if you have not red Highliners or Breakers you need to read these first to get all the background <P>Hank Crawford is a fisherman in Alaska and a captain of his own boat who has fished for many species and now that the king crabs have seem to disappeared from the height and amount in the glory days.At the start of this book Hank has just buried his best friend Jones Henry after his boat is capsized.Hank himself is recovering from injurys he got trying to rescue Jones but he can still guide is boat while the crew he has been with for the last few years are bringing the fish.<BR> Hank faces many new struggles in this book as you remeber in the last book Hank much to the dismay of his fellow fisherman and friends had sign an exclusive contract with the japanese to bring the fish. This arrangement seems to be working pretty good for hank as he is going to be set up with a new and larger fishing boat hank goes back to japan and even ends up with a japanese crew which does not go over well with his crew.And his wife jody has got her on boat to captain another hit with the boys.In this book they fish mostly for salmon and black cod which is a new market for them.<BR> I should have stated that this along with the other two books are works of fiction but the author being a former fisherman and in the coast gaurd has done a brilliant job with the desrcibtion it makes you feel like you are right there fishing with them you can feel the cold air smell the salt and fish i highly recommend these three books</span>
