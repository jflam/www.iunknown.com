Hands-on, real world examples show you how to write programs that flow correctly and produce accurate results. At the end of the book, you will use the concepts you have learned to build a blackjack game. Also included is an appendix that discusses where to find compilers, other C resources, where to go from here, and what kinds of careers you could go into with the knowledge she gained from the book.</HTML></span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for beginners. I am fluent in Visual Basic but I had never been exposed to C. Suddenly I find myself needing to develop DLLs in C. I was scared to death because of the short time I had to catch up. I did not think C was that easy to understand until I started reading this book. Even if your previous knowledge on programming is very poor, this book will take you step by step so that you will be soon programming. The style in which it is written is very clear and simple, with very good down-to-earth explanations. The examples are very simple, they just show the concepts and are far from being a technical challenge, but they serve their purpose well. Mistakes: there may be a few, but nothing that can drive you lost (at least to me). However, it does not say much about using a compiler and if you are looking for advanced topics this is not the book, but, in this regard, the editor is very honest: at the back cover you can read it is for beginning to intermediate level users. I am ready to jump into the advanced texts. Thanks Mr. Perry.</span>

                    <span>This book should be the textbook for Beginning Computer Programming.<P>I am a relative beginner to programming. In the past, I have found programming tutorial books to be absolutely boring because they lacked examples. This book is ALL examples. It is a very good way to teach the language because at every stage of the learning process, I am forced to take an active role in the learning process. I am halfway through the book and I have already typed in about 20 mini-programs that have progressively become harder and more complex. The result is that I am naturally becoming comfortable with the C computer environment.</span>

                    <span>This book is for the beginners and not for the Advanced C# programmer. There are a few statement structure mistakes in the book, but i would have never knew that unless i had read the fabulos book. The author also responds to your questions which is a plus although he may take a while since he is a buzy individual.<P>What could have made this book really better though is some excercises to be done to test your C# programming knowledge, to see if u really understand it.<P>All in all if you are looking for a book to start you up on C# programming this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>This book, while a good introduction to C, is very poor in quality. There are a number of outright mistakes, and quite a few typographical errors. The line from the inside cover says it all: "_C By Example_ language is described thoroughly." Unfortunately the same lack of care shows up in the example programs and the incorrect sample output for them.<P>Wait for the next edition, or buy a different book.</span>
