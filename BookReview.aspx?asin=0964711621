                    <span>This book is great for computer contractors or for those considering going into computer contracting. I read this book when I first contracting about five years ago (I thought I had already reviewed it, but my review does not show up). The information is still current and is greatly helpful for those, like me, who want to cross every 't' and dot every 'i', or at least to try to. A great deal of valuable information inside.</span>

                    <span>This book is good as far as providing lots of useful information, but I can't use its advice just yet as I am just getting into the computer field. In other words, its too advanced for me right now. I am going to order another book listed here, The Secret Path to Contract Programming Riches..." It seems to be perfect for those who want to start from scratch in the computer industry. <p>But, I will keep this Janet Ruhl book for reference when I am more ready to make the move into contracting.</span>

                    <span>In my first book, "The Secret Path to Contract Programming Riches", I chose Janet Ruhl's earlier book, "The Computer Consultant's Guide", as required reading for an overview of the ins & outs of the consulting lifestyle, because it was the ideal complement to the highly specific and technical instruction for the raw beginners targeted in my book.<p>"Janet Ruhl's Answers for Computer Contractors" will now replace it, as required reading in the next edition of my book, for many reasons:<p>1) It gives promising contractors everything they need to maximize and maintain a contracting career.<p>2) It reveals the absolutely important insiders' tips on working with consulting firms, contract brokers and recruiting firms - I've been contracting for over ten years, and I've seen some really wonderful brokers and some really shady brokers.
