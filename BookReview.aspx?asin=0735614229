                <span id="Label1"><I>Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming</I> is a tutorial. It's meant for programmers who already know an object-oriented language and want to apply their knowledge in the standardized environment provided by the Microsoft .NET Framework. The book, written by Jeffrey Richter, a programmer and the .NET columnist at Microsoft's magazine for its developer community, takes a more or less language-agnostic approach to the run-time environment (though many illustrative examples are in C#). It aims to untangle the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and some of the Framework Class Library (FCL), and generally succeeds, particularly at the former. Richter shares his knowledge of the key classes you can instantiate in the CLR, and the kinds of operations you can perform on and with them.<p>You can read this book, or individual chapters, from beginning to end. You'll probably find it more helpful, though, if you read individual sections as you encounter problems or develop an interest in specific aspects of the CLR (ideal for those middle-of-the-night "I wonder how it does..." questions). Richter typically lets his code do most of the talking, and he'll often introduce a section with a prose summary of the CLR way of doing something (sometimes with a supplementary diagram) before unleashing a string of quick examples that illustrate variations on the theme. In an unusual and helpful tutorial move, he makes heavy use of the ILDASM utility to show what goes on at compile time. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How the Microsoft .NET Framework--in other words, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and parts of the Framework Class Library  (FCL)--runs Microsoft .NET applications, and how to write software for the framework. Shared assemblies, characteristics of CLR types (including their properties, methods, fields, and events), and object orientation all get ample coverage. There's particularly detailed information on text manipulation (including internationalization and localization), arrays, custom interfaces, and the managed environment (garbage collection) in the CLR environment.</span>

                    <span>Its one of the best books, but surely not a Bible and Not a 5*. It DOES NOT cover all topics. Most importantly, Threads and Asynchronous calls are missing. No remoting or web stuff either, and not much on security.  
<br />In essense, this is a very good book to get started but not as a reference for 'everything in .Net'. This covers basic types, text, strings, enums, exceptions, arrays, memory management..you get the idea, right?
<br />We at work, read through the entire book - and in the end, had to go to the O'Reilly book by Juwal Lowy for Threading, thread synchronization and async calls... So, If you are a Backend or middle layer developer, get Juwal Lowy and Richter. Between the two you will have most of .NET programming covered (other than web specific stuff)

                    <span>As most of the reviews suggest, it is a great book and I highly recommend you to buy it. 
<br />
<br />There is a cheaper alternative to buying this though. Search for The Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming in C# Collection by the same author (Jeffrey Richter). That edition contains this book with lots of additional materials (CDs, Class Library posters etc) and surprisingly its MUCH cheaper than buying this by itself.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I can strongly recommend this (the C# edition of this book), as it comes with many great posters and fixes all the errata from the earlier edition. In my opiniion, this is one of the best C#/.NET books ever released (I would put Juval Lowey's latest book up there as well).
<br />
<br />I can say from experience that many of the interviews I have done for contracts for my .NET Consulting company have been largely out of this book. I would imagine the same would hold for individuals, and I certainly borrow some concepts in my interviews (which only one in 100 can pass).
<br />
<br />There is little not to like about this book, but I would of liked to have seen more on Threading and more of the FCL, but the goal of the book was to give you the foundation not so much the practical 'do this and this and this' without knowing why. For people who want to be above average this is almost certainly a must read and for technical leaders you must know this information somehow, by reading this book or some other way.

                    <span>You have to love this book.  Simply a must read for any .NET software developer.  It does a fairly good job of staying language neutral, but you will get the most out of the book if you are comfortable with C#.<p>No other book I have read comes close to explaining the CLR in such a graspable way.  There are six or seven different sections of the book I find myself pointing colleagues to everyday.  One of the most overlooked, misunderstood and necessary topics has to be boxing and unboxing.  This is explained extraordinarily well.  I still find myself reading this section over, pleading with my brain to commit some of the trickery of the compiler to memory.  Another favorite section is Chapter 11 - Events.  Nobody could possibly read this chapter and not feel completely comfortable with designing a type that exposes an event.  And then, the cherry on top, he walks you through explicitly controlling event registration... WOW!  Great stuff.<p>This book is packed with all the core concepts you need to know to be a successful programmer.  The longer you go without it, the more of injustice you do to yourselves and your clients.</span>
