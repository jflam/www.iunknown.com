                    <span>James Humes rightly emphasizes the importance of being an efficient communicator for all avenues of life.  Humes gives his audience 21 tips that he has identified through a meticulous examination of some memorable quotations attributed to famous politicians and writers.  Speakers can stand out in front of a crowd or among a small group of people by applying these tips to their presentation.  Why bore an audience by telling a lengthy joke at the beginning of a speech, inviting the audience to fall asleep though a windy talk and busy slides or ending a presentation on a flat note?  Instead why not speak about a personal experience to which the audience can relate, energize a talk by the use of a memorable bon mot or end a talk on a strong note?  No one needs to be one of the famous people quoted in this book to come up with a striking note that makes the difference between a boring speaker and a riveting one. </span>

                    <span>Well written, short and to the point this book has served me well.  I bought it for what my classmates considered a minor presentation.  I learned no presentation has to be minor and impressed my classmates, professors and any other audience under any occasion or circumstance.  </span>

                    <span>Red Auerbach used to teach his legendary Boston Celtics to stick to the fundamentals. This book is filled with help to make your speeches memorable. This book will add impact to your next talk whether in school, work or a one on one meeting. The author presumes a basic knowledge of speech construction. If you want help with that read Jack Valenti.</span>

                    <span>definitely a very helpful and easy to read book.  this guy has VERY obvious conservative leanings - his criticisms of democrats and drooling over republicans are a bit annoying.  but if you can get past all that it's a handy guide to making one of life's chores more fun for you and your audience.</span>

                    <span>I expected a lot from this book and was still pleasantly surprised. James C. Humes is a very experienced speechwriter and speaker that takes the time to tell you some great secrets of public speaking. <p>The book goes through every aspect of speaking from opening to closing and beyond. Each section has many great ideas to take from it. There was no chapter that I did not walk away from saying, "That was a great idea!" When he makes a recommendation, he backs it up with supporting facts and real stories that illustrate the point. <p>The book is also easy to read. The writing style is easy to read and is interesting. Humes seamlessly ties in stories from the great speakers of history to demonstrate his ideas. Many of the stories are humorous, but all are good. Humes is also very clear in his recommendations, which leaves little confusion on the reader's part. <p>I would recommend this to anyone interested in public speaking.</span>
