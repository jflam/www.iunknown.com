                    <span>The 1920s were the "Golden Age" of sport. Bobby Jones, Jack Dempsey, Bill Tilden, Babe Ruth and Red Grange were immortalized in the newspaper accounts of Grantland Rice, Damon Runyon, Heywood Broun and others. In the early 1950s, Grange told his story to Ira Morton, a Chicago sportswriter and fellow Illini.<P>Red Grange was a huge star and gate attraction, a primary reason for the success of the infant NFL, organized in 1922. His gridiron exploits - first at the University of Illinois, later with the Chicago Bears - earned him the nickname "Galloping Ghost". Despite fame, Grange remained humble. Through high school and college, he worked summers hauling ice to pay for his education and condition his body for football. His adventures in Hollywood at the dawn of talking pictures remind us some things don't change.<P>A knee injury early in his pro career slowed Grange, but he adjusted to his limitations - he played quarterback more often - and earned his spot as a charter inductee of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon retirement from playing in 1934, he took on several business ventures and became a broadcaster, paving the way for a host of ex-athletes in many sports. Grange is a fine example of sport as character builder. He was a great runner, but fully acknowledged the essential contributions of his coaches and teammates.<P>2003 marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of his autobiography and the centennial of his birth (June 13). Read this book as a way to celebrate both.</span>
