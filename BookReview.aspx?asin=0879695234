If you are a graduate student, a physician with research intentions, or a laboratory technician, this book is indispensable. If you have to manage or mentor such people, giving a copy to each of them will greatly improve your life, and theirs.</span>

                    <span>If you are a first timer to the lab setting as I was 3 yrs ago, this is a great book to have as a reference. Kathy Baker covers lab etiquette, lab lingo, bacteria, mammalian cells, DNA, RNA and safety. Everything a good lab technician should know. Diagrams give you insight to unfamiliar equipment and she provides notable references if you need more information. The great thing about this book is that it provides you with the basic tools you need to get started at a low cost. Once you have read this book you'll be ready to take on more in depth literature without hesitation.</span>

                    <span>As a 5th year graduate student with extensive lab research experience at a well known reputatable school in New York City, I would not recommend in purchasing this book.  It was in fact being given out for free to new incoming graduate students a few years ago at my school, a practice which since has been terminated due to a general consensus from the student body revealing a lack utility in the book.  I actually told one of my colleges to "burn this book" because I felt that much of the information was actually detrimental to one's graduate school career.  A main concern about the book was that many of the so-called standard protocols were outdated and eclipsed by the fact that in terms of practice, many research labs have their own adaptations of protocols (for good reason) which are proven better than the generic protocols listed in the book.  You see...it is not good in science to hold steadfast to rigid ways, and in contrast one needs to adapt to the new social and academic climate.  It is a time of flexibility and novel creative thinking.  The face of science is finally changing, and it should rightly do so. This leads me to my second beef about this book. The introduction focuses mainly on "lab etiquette".  I find that the ideals brought fourth by the book come from out-of-date "old school" principles and functions to brainwash the naive young researcher into life-long scientific servitude.  This book only serves to perpectuate negative stereotypes of scientists in society as lacklustre dorks who do nothing but devote their life to research.  Many scientists are like this...and you wonder why.  The bottomn line is that I would not recommend this book to a graduate student, and not even to an undergraduate science student, unless you can find it used...and perhaps slightly singed around the edges.</span>

                    <span>As other reviewers have already said, this is a wonderful book for navigating the laboratory, especially if you are like me, and have only a little lab experience. It covers everything from basic sterile technique and media-making to working with antibodies and radioactive materials.<p>At least as helpful as the introduction to lab skills is the introduction to people skills and proper lab etiquette. This book contains some invaluable resources for getting good work done, working well with others, and not stepping on anyone's toes in the process. Given how opaque lab society can sometimes be for newcomers, this is a wonderful resource.<p>While this book may a bit on the pricey side, it makes a great reference, and is sturdy enough to be lent out to colleagues, assistants, stuedents and new hires time and time again.</span>

Many of the pages are of reference quality such that you'll want to consult again and again.  Especially useful for students with little or no prior experience in a life science research lab.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful resource for any lab that has rotating personnel.  Often, experienced researchers don't have the time or interest to orient new people but it's all here, and I would be surprised if even an experienced scientist could read through this whole manual without finding useful information.<p>The author uses common sense and a casual style, and assumes that the reader knows nothing.  Early chapters explore BASIC basics, like getting along with colleagues, getting started the first week, questions to ask, and safety procedures; lab setup and equipment; and organization.  Later chapters discuss designing and setting up experiments, using a lab notebook, presenting data, making reagents, including storage and disposal, and working in a sterile environment.  Final chapters detail work with eukaryotic cell cultures, bacteria, dna/rna/protein, radioactivity, centrifugation, electrophoresis and a light microscope.  Along the way, the reader will learn how to format a journal article, work in a hood, or stay in touch with the PI.  The only thing missing is library research, but since this is a bench guide that seems a forgivable omission.<p>Spiral bound and formatted for easy access and understandability, the volume concludes with a glossary and a good index.  Black and white line drawings and pictures identify items found in labs and illustrate techniques from pipetting to making entries in a notebook.<p>This is not a textbook written by someone who's never worked in a laboratory; it is a sensible, intelligent guide -- the dream tour you'd like to have each of your technicians or students given if you only had the time!  Also handy if a person is having problems and you want to refer them to written material.  Any working lab could benefit from the addition of this volume.  Fabulous.</span>
