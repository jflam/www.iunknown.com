                    <span>This book is about the best general overview of the various Special Forces units in the American arsenal from a "signal to noise" ratio that I have read to date. By that I mean what the book presumes to offer and what it actually delivers is pretty much on par. Everybody looks for different things in these kinds of books but generally I think people who read books about special ops are looking for organizational details of how these units do what they do and "sea stories" of them doing it for real.<P>Like any book that covers a lot of ground, however, it is more of a general look than an in-depth study. There are certainly better books that drill down on a particular service this book is the best I've read so far at wrapping them all up in a single package without skimping too much or misrepresenting the content. Now, there are some chapters that are just barley enough to whet one's appetite. For example, the chapter on Delta Force is not much more than what you'd find in an exclusive magazine article on the subject. This is simply because the author was not given the same level of access to Delta Force as he was able to gain for the SEALs or the Green Berets so it is not at all well balanced from a unit perspective.<P>What is balanced is the author's approach to explaining what the core mission is for the units he examines (namely the Army Green Berets, Delta Force and PSYOPS, Navy SEALs and the Air Force Special Operations chopper pilots) and a taste of what they do. The author takes a contemporary view of his subjects rather than bogging things down too much with the unit's past histories. Instead he focuses on what they were doing at the time the book was written (late 90's). The latter half of the book is a look at some of the ops that these units participated in during the Gulf War. I appreciated this approach since I feel that Special Ops is definitely an up-to-date topic meaning that I am more interested in what these units are doing now than what they did decades ago.<P>This then becomes the book's major downfall. Namely that it is out of date being written in the late '90s. Despite this disadvantage I think the basic mission parameters and operating styles of the units showcased are essentially the same so it is still a valid reference for general information on the special ops forces involved. Overall, though, I think the balance achieved was good and it is well worth a paperback price. I look forward to a similar book that covers the work that these units have done in Afghanistan.</span>

                    <span>This is a very insightful book that is clearly well researched. The author really sheds light on the types of training and the selection process that American Special Forces soldiers must endure. The Green Beret training was particularly insightful because the author takes you along on some of the war games that the soldiers have to play. The author travels along to "Hell Week" that all Navy Seals have to endure. Where the author stands out, is that he successfully captures the personalities and emotions of the people that he follows. They all come from unique backgrounds, and the author really captures how their personalities affect their thinking as soldiers. I especially liked the fact that the author did a section on Air Force special forces pilots, the guys who fly the helicopters that deliver the more glamourous ground troops. They don't get enough recognition in the action world of hollywood. However, one wonders who designed such a complicated helicopter. REad the book, and all will be explained. The one big disappointment in the book (the reason I'm giving it three stars) is the limited look at Delta Force (the anti-terrorist force). Compared with the rest of the book, this section lacked the detail that made the other sections interesting. This was probably the section that I was most looking forward to so it was quite a disappointment. 3/4 of the book is hugely enjoyable but that one section was a bit lacking.</span>

                    <span>I HAVE READ MUCH ABOUT SPECIAL FORCES AND TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS A BIT GENERAL. BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A JOURNALIST IT ISN'T REAL SPECIFIC. IF YOU HAVE NO OR LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT U.S. SPECIAL FORCES THEN THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. EVEN WITH MY KNOWLEDGE OF THEM I STILL LEARNED A FEW THINGS ABOUT SPECIAL FORCES.</span>

                    <span>I read this book a few years ago and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone intersted in the US Special Forces. <P>Douglas Waller puts you right into the heart of the action as if you were right there standing side by side America's elite soldiers. <P>The prologue is a great introduction to the book and recalls a botched Special Forces (Green Beret) mission during Desert Storm that--instead of resulting in catastrophe--showed how brightly a compromised A-Team shined against incredible odds.<P>The rest of the book is just as good. This is one of the best books I've read on US Special Forces. Read it now!</span>
