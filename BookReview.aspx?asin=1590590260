                    <span>After reading this book, I not only find it helpful, but I also took note of several things.  First, the release date of the book was just three months after the first release of .NET.  Assuming that it takes over six months to write and publish a book, the author had to have started writing the book using a Beta release of Visual Studio .NET and probably finished it using the Release Candidate if it was available to him.  Anyone who knows Microsoft Beta releases, knows that the last thing to get any attention is the Help files.  They are always spotty and many times non-existant, at least until the release version.
<br />
<br />Secondly, the author tells you up front that he is a VB developer and will not use much C# code.
<br />
<br />I did find that there are some sections with too much code, and sometimes not enough explanation.  However, the code does work; I have tried it, and I will take working code over innocous verbage any day.  I often times have purchased a book that costs more that this one, just to get help with one problem and this book helped me in several areas.
<br />
<br />Obviously, any buyer has a right to their own opinion, but sometimes, self-proclaimed gurus ought to take into consideration the time at which a book was written, and the subject material, upon which research for the book was done, was available at the time the book was started and completed prior to release to the publisher.  Apress is noted for having good books and they don't let bad ones out.
<br />
<br />I hope Mr. Smith will write a second edition and cover some of the subjects that he and others have still not yet touched on.

                    <span>I am flabbergasted that this book has been published in the state it is in. I can only assume no one reviewed it.
<br />
<br />It is teeming with badly written and largely irrelevant code samples. For the most part, only four or five lines of a four or five *page* code sample are relevant to the topic at hand. And they are poorly - if at all - explained. The obvious is stated and the subject quickly changed.
<br />
<br />The writing style is boring and uninformative. I have learnt close to nothing from this book and am outraged by the blatant mistakes with regards to .NET. Take, for example, page 313 (the grammatical mistake is as printed):
<br />
<br />Microsoft has intimated that there will be other languages from Microsoft as well as other languages from . . . This is possible because of the set of unified classes provided by .NET Framework.
<br />
<br />Um, no. It is actually possible thanks to the CLR. The author obviously has very little understanding of .NET. It's as if he wrote the book while trying to teach himself the fundamentals.
<br />
<br />As a final note, do not expect C# code. The book title does not allude to the fact that most code is written (badly) in VB.</span>

                    <span>I keep stressing the fact that I have not seen a single intelligently written Visual Basic (.NET) source code. This book is not an exception. The code segments are plain sloppy and don't cover enough features of Visual Studio .NET 2003
<br />Better luck with C# in the next edition.</span>

                    <span>I found that it is largely full of code listings, and short on background information. The coding style seems very much stuck in the VB6 world, and the author needs to acquaint himself with the guidelines for coding in .NET (e.g., naming, etc.). <p>At the time I bought this book, it was the only book around for VS.NET add-in development. I did get some value out of it, but now that I've done more development of add-ins and VSIP packages for Visual Studio .NET, I find this book very thin on information, and full of sloppy errors.<p>It might be useful if you are writing VS.NET add ins (but take it with a grain of salt). If you want to develop add-ins, and learn about Visual Studio .NET in general, "Inside Microsoft Visual Studio .NET" is a far better choice.</span>
