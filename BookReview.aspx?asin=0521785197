                <span id="Label1">Scott Ambler, author of Building Object Applications that Work, Process Patterns, and More Process Patterns, has revised his acclaimed first book, The Object Primer. Long prized in its original edition by both students and professionals as the best introduction to object-oriented technology, now this book is completely up-to-date with new material in every chapter. There are also new chapters on good OO programming techniques and OO software testing. All modeling notation has been rewritten in UML notation. Review questions at the end of each chapter allow readers to test their newly acquired knowledge. In addition, the author takes time to reflect on the lessons learned over the past few years by discussing the proven benefits and drawbacks of the technology. This is the perfect book for any software development professional or student seeking an introduction to the concepts and terminology of object technology.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span> Even though object-oriented programming (OOP) has been around for many years and is taught in the computer science programs at colleges and universities, there are still many developers who do not know it. What this means is that those who are now performing the migration to OOP are primarily old dogs that need to learn the latest tricks. This book is perfect for that task, Ambler writes very clearly and covers all of the major aspects of OOP. 
<br /> There are two outstanding features of the book. The first is the clear writing style and the second is the completeness of coverage. Not only are the fundamentals of OOP covered, but the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is also introduced. Since the U in UML could now be considered a representative for Universal, most developers need to be able to understand it. Ambler also covers some of the basic features of design patterns, components, use cases, object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design and object-oriented testing. These are generally considered to be advanced topics, but as presented here are well within the level of an introductory book.
<br /> The only negative point is the significant amount of duplication that is done. For example, on page 410 there is a boxed region for the definition:
<br />
<br />Subject Matter Expert (SME) - A person who is responsible for providing pertinent information about the problem and/or technical domain either from personal knowledge or from research.
<br />
<br />An excellent definition, but the problem is that it was already defined on page 35 and was used many times in the pages between 35 and 410, especially in the chapter on gathering requirements. There are many similar situations throughout the book, so many that I often considered segments redundant.
<br /> This book could also be used as a textbook in a course on the principles of object-oriented programming without using a specific language. Some Java code is used, but it is very skeletal and is used to demonstrate the initial steps in constructing your application from the design principles.     </span>

                    <span>This book is very useful for me. As a JAVA Programmer i was always confused with the notations used by various authors. I found the notations used in this book to draw various design diagrams are simple and understandable. I thank author for producing such an excellent book for Object-Oriented programmers and designers. </span>

                    <span>It is a good book to teach you about OO concept. The author generalizes the CRC card methodology in OO design. It is an excellent idea. However the examples are not in details. Moreover the explanation is not writing in simple English. You need to read several times to understand the idea. <p>I hope in next edition, the author can provide more examples and use one case to explain the idea in step by step. Summarize tables can provides will be much better.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book!  Not that it's perfect, but nothing is.  This book is not only a very clear, extremely well-organized approach to learning and/or becoming expert in "Object Orientation and the UML," as the the cover says, but he presents this together with a development methodology that makes  a *lot* of sense.  For example, for those of you who have read Karl Wiegers' excellent "Software Requirements," did you notice that at the end of the book you knew exactly what good requirements are but not how to get there? Me too!  But Ambler takes you on a whirlwind tour, with each page absolutely *packed* with value, that instead leaves you saying "hey, now I know not only what good object oriented designs are, but how to get there from here!"<p>This is a strange thing to say, but this book actually gave me the requirements engineering methodology I needed to get from point A to B -- having requirements that Karl Wiegers would be proud of!</span>
