                    <span>This is a keeper book! I keep going back to it month after month. It has home styles as they came thru history grouped by style. It has pictures of house features that help identify what style a home is. It has lots of pictures. The only weakness I can think of is it does not have a lot of information on Home-styles being built right now. AntBiscuit@cs.com</span>

                    <span>I worked for a few years as an architectural historian doing historic building surveys and wore out at least 2 or 3 copies of this wonderful book. There are lots of "pocket guides" to architectural styles which will tell you that yup, that thing with a turret is a Victorian. But this book is a priceless resource for anyone with more than a casual interest in American domestic architecture. The McAlesters focus on ordinary houses (rather than rare architectural landmarks) and cover everything from dog-run log cabins to Greek Revival cottages to 1950s ranch houes. The writing is clear, the level of detail is just right, and the book has hundreds of black and white photos and illustrations.<P>I learned about domestic architecture to make a living, but even 20 years later still enjoy it as a hobby. If you're a professional in the field, this book is essential. But I would strongly recommend it to amateur enthusiasts as well. Once you learn to recognize housing types, every drive becomes a history lesson.</span>

                    <span>A very useful reference, even for those (like me) just starting to understand different styles of homes. My only gripes: more photos, color photos, and more specific information on the photos would be more useful.</span>

                    <span>Are the differences of the Ionic, Doric, or Corinthian Columns a little fuzy to you? And are these columns found on Early Classical Revival, Greek Revival, or Italiante? (it's a little tricky, they can all three be found on all three but rarely together). McAlestor & McAlestor have transformed a world of bleak descriptions and bland designs and turned them into an understand system of brillant diagrams and excellent pictures. This book was assigned in my historic architecture/preservation class and serves as the DEFINITIVE SOURCE for architectural identification. Buy it and throw it in the car. The world has made some great houses and McAlestor does the BEST JOB of explaining it to all of us!!!</span>

                    <span>I stand in awe of the amount of work that must have gone into this book. Photographs of existing examples of every style of architecture (from #1, a Winnebago bark wigwam, to a sampling of NeoVictorians) in every region of the United States dominate its pages (their size is the only reason I don't rate it at five stars: you'll definitely want a magnifier). A lengthy (61pp) preface explains the roots of American house styles and all their basic elements, from plans and shapes to methods of construction to decorative details. Each chapter concentrates on a basic style, from "Pre-Railroad" (log cabins and plains soddies, including a splendid series of sketches showing the former's possible permutations) through "NeoEclectic" and "Contemporary Folk;" all include a map showing the locations in which that type was common and the period of its outward spread, and most have ink sketches of details such as doors, windows, roofs, and general shape. Whether you're a dedicated "house-walker" or just curious about the kinds of houses people have lived in over our nation's history, this comfortably sized and clearly illustrated volume should be on your shelf. I refer to it regularly in writing about past house styles.</span>
