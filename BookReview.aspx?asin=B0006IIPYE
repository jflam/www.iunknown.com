                    <span>Anatomy Of Hell is a very twisted and disturbing sexual "thriller" that is specifically suitable for alternative film lovers, and it can be rather overwhelming for the mainstream viewers. The last movie that is similar to this film that I had seen was Irreversible(Monica Belluci), which was more engrossing and distasteful than Anatomy of Hell. In this conversational erotic film, the two leads explore many issues revolving body parts, sexual desires and politics. Don't expect the sex and nudity to be stimulating, because it's rather shocking and the sexual activities are hardcore, not similated.
<br />
<br />It's quite a surprise to see that Rocco Siffredi(legendary straight porn star) could pull of Frenching kissing a guy in a gay bar in the opening scene. He was cruised by Amira Casar and when he saw her cutting her wrist in the bathroom, he took her to the doctor. Then they went for a walk together, and later she orally served him on the street. She persuaded him to go home with her and would pay him a big chunk of cash if he would stay and watch her where she's unwatchable. He was curious and agreed with the deal.
<br />
<br />In the following four days, they talk about sex and she allowed him to "scrutinize" her body while she was sleeping. He reluctantly indulged himself to play around with her body parts. She gets penetrated by him with fingers and his (...) and the handle of a gardening tool.....
<br />
<br />She seemed to enjoy the domination and humilation on him. He breaks down into massive tears after having the first sexual act, because he was so revolted. More shockingly of all, is the scene when he made out with her while she was having her period. It was visually disturbing to watch his blood soaked (...) and his reaction to what he had done. Even more shocking was when she puts her blood-soaked tampon into a glass of water, and they both drank half of it!
<br />
<br />What really bothered me was the unsafe sexual intercourse and the drinking of the "period water". I don't know how the director could film such scenes. It's so hardcore and engrossing. I am surprised that Rocco Siffredi is quite good at delivering long dialogues and he excelled in the emotional scenes as well as the sex scenes. </span>

                    <span>In the Catherine Breillat film "Anatomy of Hell" a nameless man (Rocco Siffredi) and a woman (Amira Casar) meet in a club when he discovers that she has slashed one of her wrists in the bathroom. He takes her off for medical attention, and then the woman offers the man a deal. The deal is this: she tells him that she'll pay if he watches her when she's "unwatchable." He agrees and for the next four nights he goes to the woman's remote, cliff top home and watches her in the bedroom. 
<br />
<br />Breillat is known for controversial envelope-pushing films focusing on women. "Anatomy of Hell" is the most controversial of her films to-date. So before you rent it, before you buy it, be warned ... you are going to see something that looks amazingly like an adult film in its no-holds barred approach to sexuality. Siffredi, by the way, is a former Italian adult film star with an impressive number of titles such as "Captain Organ" under his belt. 
<br />
<br />The man and the woman in the film are the fleshy embodiments of attitudes towards the other sex. He, for example, sees the woman sprawled out on the bed naked, and comments that a woman's "fragility" arouses either "homage or brutality" in the male. Her comments include the observation that men want "to lock up" women, and that men like to wrap veils around women because they "anticipate shrouds." Both of the characters approach their odd relationship with extreme views about the other sex. He's a misogynist, and her opinion of men gravitates around the idea that men see women as possessions--possessions with rather messy once-a-month problems. Her self-mutilation hints that she has problems with self-worth, but she seems to enjoy the man's distaste towards her more than anything. She wallows in his disgust, and for the next four nights, this unhappy pair proceeds to bring out the worst in each other.
<br />
<br />On one level, the man and the woman could represent a couple who meet and arrange a strange bargain. But on another level, these characters represent attitudes--and they're not supposed to be 'real' people. With fixed ideas about the other sex, they approach each other and engage in a strange and ultimately unsatisfying relationship filled with dislike and a bizarre exploitive need to denigrate and then possess the other person. They are thrown together in a hell they create for themselves. I have a particular fondness for French films in which moral dilemmas occur and then the characters proceed to work through the situation (the films of Eric Rohmer, for example). In "Anatomy of Hell", the fact that the man and the woman are symbolic creates a much more elusive film--intriguing but vague, and faintly disturbing. While I did enjoy the philosophical aspects of the film immensely, I did not enjoy the film's obsession with certain body fluids, or some rather startling close-up scenes. These sections of the film do not appear to be added for shock effect, for they genuinely add to the plot. Nonetheless, the scenes are rather grotesque and hardly pleasant On another note, while it may seem peculiar to mention one scene of animal cruelty (amidst all the extreme bedroom action), it should be mentioned to all animal lovers that this scene exists in the film. 
<br />
<br />The DVD includes a number of extra features--an interview with director, Catherine Breillat, the theatrical trailer, and a photo gallery. The film is in French with English subtitles--displacedhuman</span>

                    <span>My response to this dvd and the PR guy review:
<br />While watching this I thought, this is...
<br />Distasteful
<br />Egregious
<br />Compassionless
<br />Profane
<br />Awkward
<br />Insipid
<br />Illegal (in some states)
<br />Extemporary
<br />(just watch...you'll see)
<br />Frenchy director Breillat's "Hell" is simply another experimental flop. She continues to work with and direct actors that are reminiscent of automotons, or zombies at best. Lack of emotion, convinction and believability runs rampant throughout more half of this film. Steer clear and enjoy something else instead. I'm no prude, but this was a waste of time and money. Borrow it from someone before you rent or buy it.
<br />You'll still get upset at your rental store or friend for allowing you to see it without a warning.
<br />
<br />"Come" to think of it....maybe this is what hell is like for women...they only get to have sex with gay dudes (where's that thing been?), and as for men, they only get to watch it all while....uh...well, you know.</span>

                    <span>This is, to me, Breillat's best movie. The subject matter of the movie has been delved in by others, so I won't waste time on it.
<br />A generic woman finds a gay man, to observe her and explore the perception that men have of women. During the course of four nights, the perception is dissected, and examined. The woman expresses, nude, before this male that is not attracted to her, her deepest concepts of the battle of the sexes. He in turn, although by definition not attracted to women, observes, comments and indulges. In the end, as in most of Breillat's movies, the questions are left for the viewer to answer, and also to ask.
<br />The actress, Amira Casar is a beauty, and we see a lot of her. The acting is tightly done, and if appears stilted, it is because the situation is in itself stilted. 
<br />You will need a stong stomach to watch the whole movie, since there is a particularly revolting scene, but even that scene, fits with the story, and with the desire of the woman to be totally exposed, totally vulnerable and totally degraded.
<br />I have watched some of Breillat's work (A real young girl, Romance) and to me, this is the deepest, most thought provoking of her movies. As opposed to the previously mentioned ones, that I watched once and resold, or gave away, I shall keep this one, and will probably watch it again, more than once, to dissect it further.
<br />The DVD has an interview with the director, and there we find out why a body double was used for the close-up shots: She wanted a hairy person </span>

                    <span>Anyone familiar with maverick French filmmaker Catherine Breillat will pretty much no what to expect when they watch Anatomy of Hell. Those unfamiliar with her work will probably gravitate between a mixture of disgust and wonderment that she can get away with putting such scenes onto film. Reportedly banned in several counties, Anatomy of Hell is a kind of psuedo-feminist, kinky, existential journey that takes the viewer on a journey literally right to the heart of the woman.
<br />
<br />Set against a backdrop of artfully dilapidated chateau set atop a cliff, Breillat brings together two completely disparate individuals to share several nights of sordidness. The combatants are a woman played by the French actress Amira Casar, and a gay man played by the abs-of-steel straight Italian adult film star Rocco Siffredi. The two bump into each other on the stairs of a gay disco. The girl is on her way to the restroom to slit her wrists with a razorblade - she's angry that none of the men are paying her any attention. 
<br />
<br />After the guy helps with her wounds, she performs oral sex on him, then propositions him: in return for money, he will spend four evenings with her. Over the course of their time together, they artfully entwine on a makeshift bed, embark on a solemn round of talking, and, at intervals, partake in some filthy kink. There are lots of graphic close-ups of private parts and various scenes involving lipstick, a garden fork, menstrual blood, and a glass of water. 
<br />
<br />The scenes are clinical in every respect; they are also dirty, badly edited and shoddily choreographed. And at times, it's almost as if Ms. Breillat's only motivation is the shock value. The dialogue is often awkward, stiff and pretentious, with lots of references to feminine subjugation and male domination. It's actually hard to figure out what the director is trying to say in this film, in any case, there's lots of talk about men and women's essential, bestial, and obscene natures. Maybe the film is trying to answer the question of what women actually want both sexually and spiritually. The woman is obviously after male approval and into celebrating her womanhood; and she probably picked a gay man to do it with because she knows that he will not become emotionally involved with her and remain non-threatening. 
<br />
<br />I just didn't buy the essential premise of this movie: A gay man would never be able to do some of the things to a woman that this man does, even if she paid him exorbitant sums of money - it just wouldn't happen.  Siffredi's character, at his stage in life, would be totally comfortable with who he is; he even admits that he finds women's bodies unappealing, and has no desire to gaze upon what she's got to display. 
<br />
<br />The acting is passable, although I thought Siffredi was surprisingly good - he has an earthy, brooding quality, which lends itself well to this kind of sexually angst-ridden story. Anatomy of Hell is a hard film to watch and it's filled with images you're not likely to see anywhere else, even in pornography. The more conservative viewer should be well warned to stay away, but I think the more open-minded viewer might admire the film, probably more for its voyeuristic qualities than anything else.
