                <span id="Label1">Stuart Banner's <I>The Death Penalty</I> is a richly detailed overview of American attitudes toward and implementation of capital punishment throughout its past. Banner decries what he sees as today's prevailing "smug condescension" to history, and states that executing a fellow human in the 17th and 18th centuries, though exponentially more common than today, was "just as momentous" an act. He traces changing technology and venues as well as the relatively constant arguments--legal, philosophical, and religious--of proponents and opponents. The book is rich with fascinating sidelights, among them the chilling practice of "symbolic" executions, the idea that dissections, viewed as a sort of punishment beyond death, were thought to act as deterrents to capital crime, and how the rise of newspapers as a mass medium hastened, in part, the demise of public hangings. <I>The Death Penalty</I>is free of polemic and cant, admirably disinterested, and at once rigorous yet thoroughly accessible. <I>--H. O'Billovich</I></span>

                    <span>First an introduction: From 1986 - 1992 I was employed as an investigator at the Office of Capital Collateral Representative (CCR) in Tallahassee, Florida, where Scharlette Holdman worked as the supervisor of the investigators from October 1985 - March 1988. 
<br />
<br />I have known Scharlette since the mid-1970s death penalty debates at Florida State University, including the debate between Professor Richard L. Rubenstein (author of "After Auschwitz", "My Brother Paul", "The Cunning of History: Mass Death and the American Future", "The Age of Triage", "Religion and Eros", and other books) vs. Baptist Minister and Philosopher Will Campbell (the debate was circa 1977). 
<br />
<br />Her office, the Clearinghouse on Criminal Justice, was in the same wing of the Petroleum Building as my office at Common Cause in Florida (where I was a full-time volunteer during the day and worked at the Brown Derby Restaurant at night from 1981 - 1986). 
<br />
<br />The Petroluem Building was next to the State Capital, the Florida Supreme Court and the State Archives and Library. When it was torn down, the space and the space for the first CCR office became the Mary Brogan Art and Science Museum and a storm water retaining pond. The Petroleum Building was called by those of us who worked or volunteered there the "Forces of Good" (FOG) Building -- as opposed to FOE -- Forces of Evil, such as Associated Industries, the Chamber and other big business interests in Florida. The FOG building also included (not an exhaustive list) the Clean Water Action Project, the ACLU, NOW, Florida Legal Services, Migrant Farmworker's Organization (directed by Cliff Thaell, who has more recently been a Leon County Commissioner for about ten years or more), Mike Vasilinda's television news service.
<br />
<br />About every two years at CCR there was a Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist-Maoist purge due to the pressures and dysfunctions of the work and the people. I survived two such purges. With the third, I was the first to go in the spring and summer of 1992. 
<br />
<br />When Scharlette had essentially declared war upon CCR in 1987 and thereafter, some of us decided to investigate her background given some things that we had heard. Low and behold, Scharlette's claim of a PhD in anthropology from the University of Hawaii and a Master's Degree from Memphis State (now University of Memphis) don't exist.  A claimed undergraduate degree from Memphis State: I no longer recall if this was confirmed by the university. 
<br />
<br />We used Scharlette's Social Security number, her maiden name and her married name -- with all this information, both universities had no record of Scharlette having received any degrees from these institutions. 
<br />
<br />As I understand Scharlette, she needed the "degrees" to confer upon her "credentials" that she really never needed as she is indeed then and now a national expert on capital mitigation, litigation, etc. However Scharlette can be deceptive, as her lack of a PhD and Masters so demonstrates. Even today she claims to have the degrees as when she gives presentations regarding capital cases, she is identified as "Dr." A key word search of her name will bring up some of the presentations that she has made in the past several years with the title "Dr." preceding her name. 
<br />
<br />If she has received any honorary or other degrees since 1990, that would be new information for me. If anyone can assist in this matter, please contact me at phar208452@aol.com or my mailing address: P.O. Box 38458, Tallahassee, FL 32315-8458. Thank you.</span>

                    <span>The recent actions by former Illinois Governor Ryan have raised many questions about capital punishment in the United States.  I have read or heard several commentaries that have suggested the new focus on the death penalty may lead to its abolition.  As an opponent of capital punishment, I hope this is true.  But I doubt it.<p>A reader of Stuart Banner's "The Death Penalty: An American History" will realize very little new can be added to the debate.  Banner provides an extensively detailed account of all aspects of the death penalty throughout the past 350 years.  From colonial times through the execution of Timothy McVeigh, this book looks at the logistics, politics, and theology of capital punishment.  The author comes as close to complete objectivity in presenting the history as possible.  Banner is fair in showing the strengths and weaknesses in arguments for and against capital punishment.  And he provides fascinating information concerning the debates that surrounded periodic changes in how the death penalty was administered.  Throughout history there have been many debates:  the merits of hanging versus electrocution;  the arguments for and against public execution; the role of penitence (thus the name penitentiary) in punishment.  <p>I found that this history of one issue was very much a microcosm of the broader history of the United States.  For instance, I was not familiar with the legal term petit treason.  This describes the concept of treason-an offense against someone to whom absolute loyalty is owed-in private life.  Those convicted of petit treason were subject the "more severe" punishment of death by burning.  In 17th and 18th century America two classes were capable of being convicted of petit treason.  The classes were slaves "convicted of murdering their owners or of plotting a revolt" and women "convicted of killing their husbands." (p. 71)  <p>Class played a pivotal role in the move from public hangings to jail yard executions.  Banner describes how elites in the 19th century became appalled at public hangings because the large crowds were rowdy and displayed lower class sensibilities.  Simply put, those in power were not opposed to hanging-they were opposed to being in the presence of the working class when the restraints of the workplace were removed.<p>Class, race, and gender divisions are evident in almost every area of this controversial issue.  And no great American controversy would be complete with religious implications.  In fact, no less a public preacher than Cotton Mather worried in the 17th century that he could rise to the occasion of giving the sermon to the crowd of thousands that attended executions.  As the author notes about public hangings:  "An execution could be a splendid occasion for reinforcing religious authority."  To this day, capital punishment attracts those in authority to make religious arguments both in opposition and support of the death penalty.   <p>As stated earlier, this book is not a polemic.  It is an accurate history of one of our most contentious issues.  As is the case with history, I am sure both those if favor of capital punishments and abolitionists can find many facts to support their beliefs.  It is also true that a better understanding of history must allow all involved to reconsider some beliefs.  "The Death Penalty: An American History" should be read by every legislator who will vote on state-sanctioned killing.</span>

                    <span>It's a testament to the balance found in Stuart Banner's history of the death penalty in the U.S. that I'm still unsure where he stands on the controversial issue. If I had to take a position, I would say that he's probably against it, but even after reading his three-hundred page book I can't be sure. That's a remarkable feat for a subject matter that immediately unbalances many people.<p>But "The Death Penalty: An American History" has other virtues. The book is scholarly, yet still an easy read for any interested layman; it is comprehensive, but doesn't get bogged down in details. Banner begins with capital punishment as practiced in colonial America and ends with public attitudes and constitutional issues in the late twentieth century. While the book basically follows a straightforward chronology, its chapters are arranged thematically.<p>Some of the most interesting parts of the book are in the beginning. How Banner describes public opinion toward the death penalty in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the way executioners then -- who often were killing a man for the first and only time in their lives -- handled their duties, and the relationship between the public who viewed the execution and the condemned man, were all very fascinating to me.<p>But no part of this history is boring. Banner does a remarkable job of sustaining interest even when the book turns to modern times, where the history of the death penalty focuses more on legal and abstruse matters. Banner always clarifies the issues at hand, explaining clearly and objectively the importance of what he is writing about. I cannot recommend this book too highly. If you have any interest in the death penalty, read it.</span>

                    <span>Most books that are written about the death penalty tend to be partisan either filled with impassioned criticisms or passionate defences. This book is unusual as it is measured and objective. <p>It is not a long book but it looks at a surprisingly large number of issues not only about the penalty itself but the ritual around it, the means used and a detailed explanation of the constitutional argument that led to its abolition and its resurrection... <p>In describing the way the death penalty is administered the one interesting point made by the author is the discrepancy in its implementation. Almost all of the death penalty cases occur in the Southern States. There appear to be a number of reasons for this one being the fact that these states have the highest rates of murder, the only crime which realistically now attracts the penalty. The author however makes the point that another key factor in the geographic distribution of the death penalty is the way that defendants are represented. In the North the state funds public defenders officers which provide a high standard of legal representation. This means that during the penalty phase of the trial care is undertaken to call evidence that will lead to imprisonment rather than execution. In the South the system of providing legal assistance is for the state to pay private lawyers to undertake death penalty cases. The fees are stingey and as a result defence lawyers are often have no experience or skill in running such cases. Mitigatory evidence is seldom called and the usual methods of arguing for a lesser penalty are not used. Capital cases in the South are littered with tales of incredibly incompetent defence lawyers. <p>The writer appears to be a legal academic and the most interesting part of the book is the explanation of the constitutional arguments over the legality of the penalty. The explanation of the arguments over how it was argued that the penalty was cruel and unusual and the legislative changes which were used to overcome these arguments is excellent and makes a complex area easy to grasp. <p>All in all an interesting book for those who wish to read about the subject.</span>
