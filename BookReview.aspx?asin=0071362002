                    <span>This study aid provides information about all possible content on linear algebra courses. I passed all algebra tests with the help of this and other nessecary books. Everyone should have material such as this piece. Not only do I reccomend this book, but it also works for everything possible. The guidelines in this book help you know the subject, and this book is easy and hard. For excellent knowledge of mathematics, natural sciences, computer science, etc. you can count on this.</span>

                    <span>I would say that the structure of this book pleased me. I used it as a theory review for my qualifying exam in Linear Algebra. For that purpose it served quite well. It has a nice, constructive structure. It will make your knowledge organized and will not overload you with too much abstractions. Especially I enjoyed the fact that definitions and key theorems are situated separately from their proofs, that allow you to familiarize yourself with theory in general and after you know everything there, you may concentrate on the proofs to make your knowledge more sophisticated. At least this is the way how I did work with this book. As for exercises, they are not very difficult, I would say undergraduate level only, so that it is good for those who has a weak knowledge in this subject. For those who want to go beyond Linear Algebra I would suggest Kostrykin, 3 volumes, but it is in Russian ;-)</span>

                    <span>i'm currently taking linear algebra from one of the authors of this book. the first day of class the instructor passed out a corrections sheet for the book. even with the corrections sheet, i found many wrong answers in the answer sections.<p>the pros<br>- low cost compared to a normal textbook<br>- easy to understand explanations<br>- concise<br>- lots of problems<p>the cons<br>- many, many wrong answers in the answer key means that you'll spend a lot of time checking your math with a calculator.</span>

                    <span>After reading the first chapter I found 6 errors within the first 14 pages.  These are simple equation errors. For example, page 6, the distance equation has a1-b1 and it should be an-bn.  These Phd's should have had a student(may be several) review their work for the simple errors.</span>
