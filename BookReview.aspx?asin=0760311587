                    <span>After each chapter I found myself inspired to put a new twist in my cycling trips. A good read for the riding, and the non riding season for those of us in the mixed climate zone. Will remind you why you enjoy this lifestyle so much, or let you know how easy it is to become hooked by it. Peter is a cycling "soul mate" who hits home with every page.</span>

                    <span>I own a lot of books about motorcycles, from Hell's Angels to Proficient Motorcycling.  But more often than not, I pull Egan's Leanings off the shelf when I'm in the mood for a quick fix.  Egan writes well and with insight, but without the pseudo-philosophical B.S. of Persig et al.  This is a collection of aricles with the earliest dating back to the 70s, so some observations are a mite dated, but Egan captures the experience of riding (and buying, and fixing, and being stranded) so wonderfully, that I enjoy reading every word in this book.  Egan has a good sense of humor that runs as an undercurrent through most of his writing. Leanings is like having a tray of your favorite appetizers at hand any time you fancy a snack.  When I set this book down after reading for a spell, I don't feel as if I just finished Atlas Shrugged, but it always puts me in a better mood and makes me want to pick out a bike and go for a ride.  Plus I give any writer that knows how to properly kick-start a large displacement single a bonus star, and I bet Ayn Rand couldn't do that.  Without this book, I also never would have bought V Four Victory on DVD, so I owe Peter Egan for that as well.</span>

                    <span>Peter Egan's book is a compendium of his Cycle World features going back over twenty years.  His personal history chronicles the actual or imagined lives of most of us who have lived with motorcycles during the sixties through the present.  When reading Egan's adventures with his various bikes and his pink tent, I feel like I'm on the road with him - moving Barbara off the pillion while circumnavigating the Isle of Man, or Ireland, or Route 66, or New Zealand, or wherever.  This book has become my constant bedside companion, carrying me back to my cycling youth, or time in Vietnam or helping me envision my "in process" restoration projects on a winding country road on a perfect spring day.  Thanks, Peter.</span>

                    <span>Peter Egan and David Edwards are the reason I subscribe to Cycle World. Egan's feature articles and columns reprinted in this book NEVER fail to leave me with a smile. Absolutely a must if you're an avid motorcyclist.... and if you're not, reading this book will make you want to go out and buy an old Triumph and start riding. I don't know of any other writer who so adeptly sums up the love of motorcycles and riding in every article. Great stuff.</span>

                    <span>I own about 12 motorcycle books and this one is my favorite.  Written in the conversational style of Clement Salvadore and Fred Rau it is a great read.  A person could read the whole book at once or savor it over a period of time.  The chapters are told over a period of time that I can identify with.  If you are passionate about riding or working on motorcycles this book is a must.  My only problem with it is that when I read a Peter Egan article, I hear Dave Despain's voice in my head reading to me.</span>
