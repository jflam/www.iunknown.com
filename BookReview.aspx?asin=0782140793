                <span id="Label1"> Are you evaluating NT 5 for your company? Here's the information you need to assess the impact that Active Directory Services will have on your network. This technical preview explains the concepts behind directory services, how Active Directory is implemented within NT, and how Active Directory interoperates with internetworking technologies. You'll learn how to plan your Active Directory implementation, how to roll NT 5 out successfully, and how to use Active Directory effectively in your organization to make networked life  easier for both network administrators and network users. </span>

                    <span>My only substantive criticism of this book is its reluctance to define its audience, and correspondingly, using a title that misrepresents its content.<P>This is a book for a party that has former hands-on experience with a similar technology (e.g., X.500, NDS, LDAP) and needs to manage a Microsoft implementation. Or for a hands-on technician who is new to the technology in general. <P>The author is a former Novell employee and this is the third version of the book, so readers can expect some broad insights and no vendor bigotry. In many sections, one can tell that "Server 2003" was added to the text via "search and replace", but it matters little, and Server 2003 was directly addressed in areas where it matters (i.e., global catalog servers, etc.).<P>Architects and implementers should pass on this one, but managers and consultants should pick it up.</span>

                    <span>This is, with no doubt in my mind, the worst book on Active Directory I have seen. I can't believe Sybex decided to publish the second edition (let alone the first) with all errors and such superficial coverage of practically every Active Directory topic. I'm under impression that its author had no practical experience in dealing with any real Active Directory deployment. If you are serious about learning Active Directory from experts, check "Mission Critical Active Directory" by Jan De Clercq and Micky Balladelli (Digital Press) or "Windows 2000 Active Directory" by Alistair Lowe-Norris (O'Reilly).</span>

                    <span>Mastering Active Directory provides the framework to understand and set up the Active Directory system. However, it covers Active Directory in more general theoretical terms and does not do a thorough job of detailing how to plan and implement the system. If you are unfamiliar with NDS or other Directory Services, the LDAP protocols and similar then this book is a good place to start. If you are already familiar with such things then you will find this book to be lacking in useful information. My recommendation would be to purchase the book if you are new to the whole Directory concept and read it as a foundational text and then graduate to a more detailed text, such as Windows Active Directory Design and Deployment, before actually implementing Active Directory or attempting to resolve problems with it. For someone who already understands the concepts they should just go ahead and move to the above mentioned book and skip this one.</span>

                    <span>I'm in the process of taking Microsoft's MOC classes for MCSE, including 2154 & 1561, the two classes on Active Directory. They aren't bad, but they totally ignore the simple fact that AD is a database! <P>This book was great! DHCP, DNS, and AD itself are all explained in view of their being databases. I'm a laid-off Access trainer, and this was JUST what I needed! BTW, it also included the best intro to LDAP I've come across (I'd already seen it in the courses, but it "clicked" for me with King's explanation). This book isn't specifically for the MCP courses, but it sure gave me a great foundation for those classes. I recommended it to the other students in my classes, and I unreservedly recommend it to you!</span>
