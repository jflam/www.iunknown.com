                <span id="Label1">What does a mother do when her teenaged daughter is spinning out of control and nothing is bringing her back? Here is a searingly honest memoir of motherhood and a testament to the power of love and family.<br><br>When Adair Lara&#8217;s daughter Morgan turned thirteen, she was transformed, seemingly overnight, from a sweet, loving child into an angry, secretive teenager who would neither listen nor be disciplined. The author, her youngest son, Patrick, her ex-husband, Jim, and her new husband, Bill, all stepped on a five-year roller-coaster ride in which Morgan incarnated the chaos principle in torn jeans and dyed hair. Drinking, drugging, disappearing, suspicious companions, failing and cheating at school, joy riding in a stolen car&#8211;there was no variety of adolescent acting out that she didn&#8217;t indulge in. For Adair Lara it became an endless sojourn at the end of her rope, a trial immensely complicated by the reappearance in her life of her aging father, a man who had abandoned his wife and seven children decades earlier. Inevitably, Morgan&#8217;s misbehavior revives memories of her own headstrong adolescence, while her father&#8217;s presence makes agonizingly real for her the consequences of giving up. Paradoxically, he also becomes the source of her best advice.<br><br><i>Hold Me Close, Let Me Go </i>is an emotionally charged, often brutally honest memoir that all parents (and anyone who was ever a teenager) will experience shocks of recognition from while reading. It imparts invaluable lessons about holding loved ones close through the roughest passages and about the power of family to overcome the most grievous obstacles. Adair Lara is a clear-eyed and eloquent witness to the complex costs and rewards of motherhood, and her book will redefine for readers their idea of what being &#8220;a good enough mother&#8221; really means.</span>

                    <span>They say to write a good memoir, you must write as if everyone is already dead. Man, Adair Lara knows how to follow that advice - and apparently is still on good terms with everyone in this book. Stupidly shelvedin parenting sections, bookstores should better market this as memoir. No one, having read it, would take it for a parenting manual. It's one woman's story of her difficulties, triumphs, and failures, challenges and sacrifices, doubts and agonies of blundering her way through parenting one of god's most difficult and brilliant (always a dangerous combination) teenage girls.<BR>Also, as Lara is primarily a humor writer, it's screamingly funny, and laugh you will, when you're not holding your breath to see what new devilment Morgan (the daughter) will get up to next. I think the most profound lesson a parent would get from this book is that if you love your kids and let them know it, you'll all probably survive those difficult transitional years.</span>

                    <span>It can be very difficult to know how to approach one's children. Many of the advice books make it sound like a cookie recipe; if you measure the amount of ingredients carefully and bake so long, the product will be perfect. In fact, there is no way to know when you start how one's children's lives will work out in the end. Most parents want the best for their children but may not know how to make it happen. It is very hard for parents to face this, let alone write about it for the public. I enjoyed reading Adair Lara's book because I thought it was honest. There seems to be a genre of books about difficult teenagers and Morgan fit the type. At the beginning cuddly and adorable; as she grows older argumentative, yelling, bewailing her fate to be in such a boring family, running away. In fact, Adair's family seems pretty interesting, maybe too much so. And it is true that some of her family events did distract her from Morgan, but can anyone stand to spend 100% of her time thinking about her rebellious and hurtful daughter? And with so many divorced families these days, isn't it better to have her father living upstairs than in some distant city? This book again confirms Tolstoy's observation that all happy families are alike, but all unhappy families are unhappy differently. The only addition I would have liked to see would be a statement that her daughter had read the book and agreed that it should be published.</span>

                    <span>A daugther spirals out of control. Yet mom is busy with her new husband (what a gem he is), shuts her daughter out of her home office and generally puts her head in the sand--thinking that simply worrying about her daughter means she is being a mother. A mother stands up and tries to do what is right-takes action and does something.<P>It is very annoying to read how this mother excuses her own (and her daughters behavior) without EVER learning a thing. Whatever Morgan does, mom grounds her, sends her packing to another relative-does everything but mothers this girl. I would be VERY interested in a book by Morgan--"How I pulled myself out of a terrible time in spite of my mother"</span>

                    <span>I was so fortunate that my husband found this book at the airport. He picked it up because we were having so much trouble with our oldest teenage daughter. He read it first and highly recommended I read it. Twenty or so pages through I realized our daughter was a clone of "Morgan". The diagnosis from the psychiatrist was identical. (Even the name of the psychiatrist was identical). Deans' (the drug rehab counselor)assesment that "she feels safe to act out because you have such a secure home" was told to us by the "first" psycholgist to see our daughter. Our home is not a broken one either. No second or third marriages here. It was so nice to feel "not so alone" reading about Ms. Laras ordeal. If you have another child like I do who "follows the rules" behaves and listens, its hard to reconcile that your a lousy parent. After reading her book I believe it was the luck of the draw when it comes to children, and they could be wired very differently. Even if I couldn't identify with Adairs "Morgan" it was still an excellent read, beautifully written. There were diamonds scattered on EVERY page. I was transformed while reading about Adairs life with her on and off father, so much like my own, a difficult high I.Q (er). <BR> I have and will continue to recommend this book to other parents of "difficult" children. Thank you Adair Lara</span>

                    <span>I was looking forward to reading this book having read Adair Lara's column for years and following the "antics" of Morgan. I thought it might provide some insight into raising teenage girls as I have three myself. <P>This book was a disappointment from the get go. I was appalled at the lax way Ms. Lara had of "excusing" Morgan's dangerous behavior. She is very, very lucky that her daughter came through the kind of abusive behavior she exhibted, and that Mom allowed, ALIVE! Teens need boundries...teens need parents who know how to say NO and mean it and most of all teens need parents who aren't afraid to make decisions for their "children" no matter how unpopular it makes them. I couldn't believe that when things got bad she sent her away not once, not twice, not even three times...but four times that she shared with the readers. Believe me, there are many times that we "strict" parents would love to send our teenager to live with someone else so we could get on with our lives. Guess What? Being a parent means hanging in there through thick and thin....and why would you send a troubled teen to live with relatives who had trouble sticking to boundries all their lives. <P>This story was painful at best to read and I kept at it hoping that Ms. Lara would finally stand up and do what was right. I found the ending very hard to take....after many chapters of one destructive behavior after another on Morgan's part all of a sudden she was cleaning the house, cooking, friendly and....graduating from college?? <P>I implore any parent of teens who reads this hoping for advice on how to handle unacceptable behavior to consider it a comical at best and as a guide to what NOT to do with your teen.</span>
