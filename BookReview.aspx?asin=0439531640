                <span id="Label1">Meggie&#146;s father, Mo, has an wonderful and sometimes terrible ability. When he reads aloud from books, he brings the characters to life--literally. Mo discovered his power when Maggie was just a baby. He read so lyrically from the the book <I>Inkheart,</I> that several of the book&#146;s wicked characters ended up blinking and cursing on his cottage floor. Then Mo discovered something even worse--when he read Capricorn and his henchmen <I>out</I> of Inkheart, he accidentally read Meggie&#146;s mother <I>in.</I> <p>  Meggie, now a young lady, knows nothing of her father's bizarre and powerful talent, only that Mo still refuses to read to her. Capricorn, a being so evil he would "feed a bird to a cat on purpose, just to watch it being torn apart," has searched for Meggie's father for years, wanting to twist Mo's powerful talent to his own dark means. Finally, Capricorn realizes that the best way to lure Mo to his remote mountain hideaway is to use his beloved, oblivious daughter Meggie as bait! <p>  Cornelia Funke&#146;s imaginative ode to books and book lovers is sure to be enjoyed by fans of her breakout debut, <I>The Thief Lord</I>, and young readers who enjoyed the similarly themed <I>The Great Good Thing</I> by Roderick Townley.

                    <span>After finishing this book just a few hours ago, I have many thoughts and comments on its ending, and overall, itself. Ms. Funke' s idea to enlight Mo and Meggie with the ability to read characters out of their books is absolutely delighting. It gives the reader a thought about the real book, Inkheart, itself and what would happen if characters in it would literally pop-out! <BR>The end popped questions in my mind like: Are we part of a story that is on ink and paper? How can the real inkheart (book) tell a story about the precious one full of fairies and trolls? <BR>The ending wasn't how I expected Cornelia Funke would tie up her story. Shadow just kills Capricorn and the rest of his men, happiness is restored, and everyone lives happily ever after...good for a fairy tale, but not this one. She did better with The Theif Lord, which I thought was as excellent, if not better, than Inkheart.<BR>Overall, four/five stars would be my rating for this book.</span>

                    <span>... it took Funke wa-ay too long to tell it. After reading the tight, well-paced "Thief Lord," Funke's earlier book, I and my sons were eager to jump into "Inkheart." More words do not, however, necessarily mean a better story nor, seemingly, more action. A 500+ children's book can be forgiven if there are twists and turns throughout, as well as numerous multi-dimensional characters. But Funke's book is a pretty straightforward affair, all plot resolutions having been assumed from the get-go, and all characters (half a dozen primary ones) introduced right up front. The translation from the original German felt somewhat rushed and weak. There were several occasions in which words were needlessly repeated within a given sentence or neighboring sentences. Also, the translator, Bell, didn't seem to realize that this children's book just might be read out loud to, well, a child. Oftentimes, homonyms adjoined one another in a manner which confused my sons, to whom I was reading the book out loud. All in all, this felt like a much-too-fast followup to the success of "Thief Lord." There's a terrific story here, but a rushed effort created unnecessary problems.</span>

                    <span>This is the story of Meggie, a girl who has been brought up on books,and loves them more than anything, except her father, whom she calls Mo.<BR> She, like everyone, has often wondered what it would be like to live in a book world, but when a book world comes to her life, it isn't as nice as you might think.<BR> Mo is called Silvertongue, because when he reads aloud, things come out of books.Sometimes the things are alive, and not very pleasant.<BR> Capricorn, a villain from the book Inkheart came to life in our world when Meggie was just a baby, and Mo has been running from him ever since. He couldn't run forever, and when Capricorn catches him, only Meggie---who might also have the silvertongue curse---can save him, with the cooperation of the slightly bonkers author of Inkheart,Fenoglio.<BR> Things end all right, but many bad things happen that can never be healed. That's what gives this book its beautiful realism.</span>

I read this book in about 1 week (but iam a very fast reader when i like a book alot). If you love the deep fanasty books like I do a really good series of books is the everworld series by K.A. Applegate. The everworld books took me a couple chapters to get everything straight but after that it was super!!</span>

                    <span>Honestly, I'm a fan of reading, and have read many books of many genres. But this book was incredible! I literally could not put it down. The characters were interesting, the plot concept was amazing, the action was enthralling. I could not wait to see what happened next, and was deeply disappointed that the book had to end. The ending was very satisfying, however. I will definitely be reading Cornelia Funke's other books and hope they come close to this!</span>
