                <span id="Label1">For most writers, the greatest challenge of spiritual writing is to keep it grounded in concrete language. The temptation is to wander off into the clouds of ethereal epiphanies, only to lose readers with woo-woo thinking and sacred-laced clich&#233;s. Thankfully, Anne Lamott (<i>Operating Instructions</i>, <i>Crooked Little Heart</i>) knows better. In this collection of essays, Lamott offers her trademark wit and irreverence in describing her reluctant journey into faith. Every epiphany is framed in plainspoken (and, yes, occasionally crassly spoken) real-life, honest-to-God experiences. For example, after having an abortion, Lamott felt the presence of Christ sitting in her bedroom:  <blockquote>This experience spooked me badly, but I thought it was just an apparition born of fear and self-loathing and booze and loss of blood. But then everywhere I went I had the feeling that a little cat was following me, wanting me to reach down and pick it up, wanting me to open the door and let it in. But I knew what would happen: you let a cat in one time, give it a little milk and then it stays forever.</blockquote>  Whether she's writing about airplane turbulence, bulimia, her "feta cheese thighs," or consulting God over how to parent her son, Lamott keeps her spirituality firmly planted in solid scenes and believable metaphors. As a result, this is a richly satisfying armchair-travel experience, highlighting the tender mercies of Lamott's life that nudged her into Christian faith. <I>--Gail Hudson</I> </span>

                    <span>While we read this book "Traveling Mercies," without consciousness we find ourselves we give ourselves up to description of Anne Lamott reluctant but honest journey into faith. With sharp and bittersweet humor, Lamott reflects a past bad relationships with men, with drugs, with alcohol, and worst of all in all her life. This book has framework of a daily story about how she comes closer to God through her whole life from young girl to now: one of her best Catholic friend in young age, good memory of church, father's hatred to Christians, her English teacher Sue's born-again Christian, beginning to worship with her Jewish friends, especially learning Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, death of her beloved father and friend Pammy, shouting "help me" because of sickness, loving singing, conversion, and so on. All these stories give her to follow God while ups and downs.
<br />
<br />We also live following not our own way not God's way. We live for our pleasure. After reading this book, however, what I find that even though Lamott lives like this way, she tries to pray everything which seems even trivial. That is to say that she shows what faith is and how it can be grown through struggle between her everyday life and faith. We can reflect our life just as she did while reading this book.
<br />
<br />Quick read and helpful! Recommend.

                    <span>Jesus says, "Our FATHER in Heaven.."
<br />Annie posits, "God is she/her."
<br />
<br />Jesus says, "Go and SIN NO MORE."
<br />Annie suggests, "Go and mourn no sin. Just talk about it."
<br />
<br />Jesus says to those in the faith, "By your words you will be either acquitted or condemned."
<br />Annie breezily trips off multiple profanities that lace her essays, amusing many, offending just as many (unnecessarily!).
<br />
<br />Jesus says, "I tell you, love your enemies, pray for them."
<br />Annie rejoins, "I tell you what, I can't stand/hate right-wing conservative so and so's (a few more choice expletives @*!#).
<br />
<br />Jesus says, "In the Scriptures are eternal life...God's Word is TRUTH."
<br />Annie feels, "Buffet-style spirituality works for me. Jesus in my belief system is first-among-equals along with Buddha, new-age, eastern meditation, Virgin Mary, dalai lama-blessed scarlet wrist cord, etc."
<br />
<br />Jesus says, "Judge not lest you be judged. For with the measure you mete out, it will be measured back to you."
<br />Annie passes judgment on those persons/groups she vehemently opposes with biting, witty, sarcastic, venomous barbs of bile.
<br />
<br />Jesus lovingly says, "Repent of ALL your sins or perish...observe EVERYTHING I command you..If you love Me, You will do what I expect as My disciple."
<br />Annie seems to shrug, "I've taken care of the biggies that I write about again and again. But my mouth and attitude and stance toward opposite political views and bitterness and hostileness and self-absorption and selective discipleship and selective use of the Bible? God loves/accepts me just as I am, thank you very much. That's what makes Grace/Faith so wonderful."
<br />
<br />Jesus says, "By their fruit you will know true forthtellers from false prophets."
<br />Annie, not just privately, but publicly, vocally and unabashedly in print before thousands 'preaches' a faith that in comparison to what Jesus preached and lived, comes across as a worldview 'transformation' sans noticeable life and language reformation - this after being a churchgoer since the late '80's with the shepherding of her pastor and friends in the faith. 
<br />
<br />Thoughts on Jesus? Thoughts on His Faith as found in the Gospels? Hardly. More like thoughts on what she wants to believe as evolved-extract from multivarious sources topped off by a form of christianity that needs much more extensive acquaintance with Bible instruction and discipleship mentoring that leaves out the aggressive lip and lives out the agape love. 
<br />
<br />Yes, the hallmark of the genuine Christian faith is that the Lord Jesus (term never seen in the book?) is like a gentle fisher of people: He catches us first, then cleans us. King Jesus loves us just the way we are, but loves us too much to leave us that way (proved by His bloody death on the cross - see The Passion of the Christ to get an idea of HOW MUCH HE LOVES Annie and all of us).
<br />
<br />When a book purportedly on 'Christian Faith' subtly encourages the reader to become like (or at the least accept the self-satisfactory state of) the author rather than to become more Christ-like in every aspect of life, you have to wonder what sort of belief system is advocated.</span>

                    <span>As a word of warning, this book is full of crass and offensive language and situations.  You will not find someone pretending that everything is okay, but freely admitting the painful details of her life.  Lamott has suffered through many trials in her past including early and frequent promiscuity and abortion, heavy drug use, financial problems, alcoholism, bulimia, and suicidal thoughts. Yet, because of this `hold nothing back' mentality, the book is very real, funny and sometimes insightful. We see a woman grasping for faith and hope in the midst of a crazy life full of heartache.   
<br />
<br />This book may help those who feel they are unacceptable to the church because of things they have done.  Lamott reminds us that God's grace is for all people in all circumstances.  It pushes us past the misunderstandings of Christians as people who have everything together.  Here, we find a very non-typical `Christian' woman, who may help reach others with the Good News that Christ died for us while we were still sinners.  I would recommend this book to friends and others who have been turned off by traditional Christianity, hoping that it may provide a door for them to reconsider what this Jesus stuff is all about.  
<br />
<br />Finally, the book serves as call for all of us in the church to live out the Gospel message through lives of love and service.  Lammott says, "when I was at the end of my rope, the people at St. Andrew tied a knot in it for me and helped me hold on. The church had become my home" (100).  I pray that her experience may describe all of our churches as we reach out and welcome in all types of people, so that they may know their true home in the unconditional love of Christ. </span>

                    <span>Traveling Mercies by Anne Lamott is a compelling story infused with acute and wonderful insights about life and faith. A collection of Lamott's personal experiences, this book shows how hard life can be, and how gracious God always is. Traveling Mercies is about, among other things: a troubled childhood, drinking, drugs, bulimia, death, empty relationships and fulfilling ones, a search for spirituality, parenting challenges, and bad hair days...but nonetheless, and most of all, it's about faith-miracles and blessings, forgiveness and grace. Lamott writes with the clarity and honesty of one who is self-aware, perhaps painfully so at times. Funny and frank, she uses her own struggles and joys to illustrate truths a reader can recognize, all the while demonstrating a faith tested and formed by the real world.</span>

                    <span>Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith by Anne Lamott
<br />Anne Lamott's honesty in her book Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith was truly moving and inspiring.  She did a fantastic job of brining the reader through her conversion of faith.  The book covers a wide spectrum of her life, building up to the moment outside her home where she simply discovered it was not possible to ignore God anymore.  Anne's writing is one that will have you laughing out loud and then quickly silent by the struggles and things she faced.
<br />This is by far a must read for young adults and older who may be struggling with discovering how a life of faith and the difficulties that life throws our way.  Anne's story will inspire you to find the relevancy of God and God's involvement in all of this.  </span>
