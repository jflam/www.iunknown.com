                <span id="Label1">Flexibility exercises are one of the most underutilized yet profoundly effective fitness activities available to golfers for both their long game and their short game. Increased flexibility not only increases power and control-it reduces the potential of injury. Presented in an easy-to-follow format, the Golf Flex program is simple and can be done at the office, on the course, or at home and requires only 10 minutes a day. Special sections include: first aid and simple rehabilitation for injuries, how to keep your rotator cuffs in good health, and head-to-toe stretch sequences for before and after a game of golf. Professional athletes have discovered the value of flexibility training, and have "flexibility specialists to stretch them before and after a game. Now you can have one of America's leading trainers be your guide to golf's secret weapon: Golf Flex.</span>

                    <span>I am not a golfer, but I did enjoy this book. Stretching is so important in any sport that you do. I think golfers forget how important flexibility is to their game. The photos are extremely helpful. The book is written in a way that is very easy to read and understand. I look to giving this book to all my golfing friends and family.</span>

                    <span>If you want to hit the golf ball further (and who doesn't!) you need to do flexibility exercises on a regular basis, every body knows that, right? But what exercises should you do? Well, this Golf Flex book details the exact exercises you should do and shows you (with clear pictures) along with simple and clear instructions how you should do each stretch to get the best results for your golf game. <P>I've started using this program and I'm already hitting the ball longer as well as feeling better physically and mentally. I highly recommend that any golfer who want's to make golf easier and more fun get this book and start using it. This book will not do anything for you unless you follow the advice but if you do, watch out - your golf shots will travel further and your golf swings will be easier.<P>I did have a few questions about this book so I emailed Paul and was almost shocked to not only get a response back but the responses to my questions were detailed and well thought out. <P>Get this book today and as soon as you get it start doing the program because the older you get the less flexible you will become UNLESS you do some regular stretching program!</span>

                    <span>Being a hack golfer I'm open to anything that will help my game. Although I do stretch prior to every game, I was doing only the stretches I was familiar with from years of playing raquetball and suspected I was missing some key stretches for pre- and post golf. In other words, I know I could do a better job. <P>This book could have been so much better! It's not awful, but the one star is awarded because it pales in comparison to other tomes available.<P>This is just a book with a marketing angle. To borrow from another local sport: I took the bait, they set the hook. Golf? Stretching? That's me! (This is a good time to give me that dope-slap.)<P>I either didn't understand the instructions or it's not a 10 minute a day program. The first time I attempted the program it took me 45 minutes to complete...I was definitely stretched out but I was also quite short on time. I can't devote that much time every day to a stretching regimen. It's possible that I was suppose to go through several of the exercises faster than I did. If that was the case, I don't think I'd get the benefit of the stretch. <P>After purchasing this book, I put more focus on finding a good book on stretching for golf. I found it. Get Bob Anderson's "Stretching". The book is well written, concise, and clear. (Time for another dope slap: It's considered the best on the market.) Plus, there are clearly described stretching programs for almost every atheletic endeavor...from bowling to football to windsurfing. <P>I wish I hadn't wasted my money on "Golf Flex", but at least it was cheap.</span>

                    <span>I am far from being the most athletic person in the world. This was one of the reasons I became interested in fitness for golfers. I do, however, know how to set up a regular stretching routine from high school gym classes, and found little new here to add to the exercises I already knew.<P>Where this book will offer a range of ways to get going for the person who has no memory of gym class, most of the routines here are pretty much common knowledge. It may make a good reference for the variety of stretching routines that exist, though, meaning that anyone who buys the book will get their investment back in some fashion. If you are looking to get more out of your dollar, look into a more general book on fitness and exercise. It may not have golf in the title, but the aim will be the same: producing a looser and more fit body.</span>

                    <span>Though this book does contain a comprehensive list of stretches, it lacks a solid routine for their use. The author states that you can improve your game in 10 minutes a day, but it would take quite a bit longer than that to complete the 30+ exercises. The only routine offered does not incorporate the exercises into a daily routine.</span>
