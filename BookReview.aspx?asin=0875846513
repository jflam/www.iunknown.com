                    <span>I'm running a small consulting company and my prior goal was to identify what Balanced Scorecard is and in what way can I suggest it to my existent clients.
<br />
<br />I've started learning BSC from "Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System", a Harvard Business Review article by Kaplan and Norton.
<br />
<br />The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action is a great book, but it's far away from scorecard success step-by-step. 
<br />
<br />I've searched with google for Balanced Scorecard and related topics, but there was just "Kaplan and Norton wrote..." or "Our consulting company..." articles. Also, I've found Strategy2Act software, that seems to be a good point to start developing BSc.
<br />
<br />My opinion is that it's a great book for every independent consultant. But there are a lot of job to translate this conception into something useful for real company. 
<br />
<br />For my opinion the good idea to start with is "connect everyone with strategy". It sounds like easy to do, but effective way to start using BSc ideas in company strategy.

                    <span>This book is a seminal work that has significantly affected the way businesses frame and execute strategy. <p>In a nutshell, the authors show you how to view your business strategy, drivers and key indicators in four dimensions - financial, external (customer satisfaction), internal (processes) and learning/growth.  They then show you how to link these to your strategies and develop and execute plan for transforming them into action and results. <p>The good and the bad. First, the good - before Kaplan and Norton published this book there was no standardized method for framing and measuring what's important. This book rectifies that. Also, the ideas first introduced have been embraced and extended to the point that a book search of similar titles returns over 2600 hits, and a google search using 'balanced scorecard' as a keyword returns ten time that many.  This is a clear indication of how influential this book is and remains eight years after publication. But those are simple statistics.  What's important about this book is many of the other resources that have sprang from it assume that you are familiar with the concepts and approach in this book. <p>The bad - the writing style, as noted by others is ponderous. That does not diminish the concepts and approach.  It is also showing its age, but only because of the body of work that this book has inspired, which has greatly extended and refined the basic ideas.  You will still need to read this book to get the most out of the body of work that is based upon it.  Also note that even Kaplan and Norton, the authors, have extended this work into strategy maps and a 'strategy-focused organization' paradigm.<p>Overall this book has - and will continue to - influence thinking. The ideas set forth are still evolving and have been embraced by some of the largest (and smallest) companies on the planet.  If you are new to this material I recommend visiting Balanced Scorecard Institute (ASIN B00006CKQ2) for introductory information, and Balanced Scorecard Online (ASIN B00006DBZ5) for more detailed material.</span>

                    <span>If you want to rise to the top in your business and career you need to have a great system for managing results. The management cycle involves defining objectives, assigning responsibilities, developing performance standards, evaluating results, and developing improvements where necessary.<p>There may be many layers or hierarchies of organizational objectives, such as Corporate, Branch, Department, Team, and Individual. A good management system will capture all of the organizational objectives, and all will be linked to the overall business strategy. One helpful tool for capturing organizational objectives is the Balanced Scorecard. This system<br>uses measures in four major categories:<p>1. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<p>2. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION<p>3. INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES<p>4. LEARNING AND GROWTH REQUIREMENTS<p>The actual measures selected are highly dependent upon the type of business and should be carefully developed to ensure proper<br>results are obtained. The goal is to select measures that best relate to the overall company strategy. As such, each scorecard will be unique. I have used a Balanced Scorecard and highly recommend them to help organize the complex assemblage of organizational objectives into a unitary whole. This fantastic book tells you everything you need to know. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Kaplan and Norton are the visionaries behind the Balanced Scorecard (BSc), and this is their first book on the subject.  BSc as Kaplan and Norton conceived of it was focused on measurement, specifically measuring variables that had some linkage to corporate financial results so that the direction of the organization could be determined prior to the occurrence of a bad quarter or two.  THE MEASURES OF ANY MANAGEMENT CONCEPT ARE ITS ADOPTION AND ITS STAYING POWER, AND KAPLAN AND NORTON'S BSc IS AN OVERWHELMING SUCCESS.<p>BUT companies that enacted BSc's started to tie them to corporate strategies, making them strategic management tools and not just measurement tools.  One of the advancements was to tie define measures that measured the success of strategic intent as defined by specific objectives and goals.  Another was to create cause and effect maps of the objectives, called "strategy maps."<p>Measurement is, of course, still an important part of the BSc, but the process of determining what to measure begins higher up the strategic ladder.  KAPLAN AND NORTON THEMSELVES CHRONICLE THE GROWTH OF BSc INTO A STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT TOOL IN THEIR SUBSEQUENT WORK.<p>So, this book is a bit outdated, though it is still a useful introduction.  However, I recommend that you try:<br>* Strategy Maps: Converting Intangible Assets into Tangible Outcomes by Kaplan and Norton<p>* The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment, also by Kaplan and Norton<p>* Balanced Scorecard Step-by-Step: Maximizing Performance and Maintaining Results by Paul R. Niven<p>And a good introductory article to the idea of strategy mapping is "Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System", a Harvard Business Review article by Kaplan and Norton that is also available on Amazon.</span>
