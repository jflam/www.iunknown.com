                    <span>This is a fun little book that gives some interesting insight to the life of Dr. Seuss, but be aware that it IS a children's book that you can read in 20 minutes. If you're looking for just a nice little tribute, this is it. Don't expect any overwhelming detail or depth. It's just for fun.</span>

                    <span>For anyone who has ever read a Dr. Seuss book (and who hasn't?), this is by far the best book for adults OR children on the life of Theodore Geisel. Well-researched, well-written, and full of interesting facts. Ms. Weidt is a masterful biographer. And Ms. Maguire's pencil sketches are right in the spirit of some of this playful legend's best work. Thanks to both of them for their attention to detail and revealing some intriguing aspects about Mr. Geisel that sent me looking for more.</span>

                    <span>Oh, The Places He Went <P>I highly recommend Oh, The Places He Went for any young or old people who want to learn about the stunningly exciting life of everybody's favorite children's author, Theodor Geisel Seuss. This book explains his life story from young to old. I was doing a school project on a biography or autobiography so I got this book and it helped! This book is a #1 source of information on "Dr. Seuss." What I like about this book is; the book has great drawings and is very easy to understand. What I dislike about the book is that the sketches could be colored.</span>

                    <span>I did a presentation on Dr. Seuss for a college course. I researched for days and this book contained more helpful information then all of the books and websites put together. The best thing about "Oh, The Places You'll Go" is that it is written for children and is very easy to read. The book is entertaining as well as informative, the author got her information from the family of Dr. Seuss and includes many examples of the kind of person Theodore Geisel was, just look at how he quit smoking! This easy to read biography is good for children or adults that want to learn more about this wonderful author for a school assignment, or for entertainment.</span>
