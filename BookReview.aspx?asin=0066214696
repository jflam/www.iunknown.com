                <span id="Label1"><P>Michael E. Gerber is a truly revolutionary business thinker. His unique E-Myth insights have helped transform hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world.</p> <P>According to Gerber, The E-Myth is the myth of the entrepreneur. Most businesses fail to fulfill their potential because business owners are not entrepreneurs (as most people think them to be) but "technicians suffering from an entrepreneurial seizure." After all, says Gerber, most Physicians are the quintessential technicians -- they build practices by doing the work of the business...by seeing patients! As a result, most Physicians don't own a true business, but a job -- the all-consuming daily routine Gerber refers to as "doing it, doing it, doing it." Sound familiar?</P> <p>With <i>The E-Myth Physician,</I> Michael Gerber focuses on the business of being a Physician, rather than the work of it. He reveals a radical mind-set that will free Physicians from the tyranny of the unprofitable, unproductive, perpetual routine -- juggling patients, hiring, firing, doing everything that needs to get done. Drawing on thirty years of experience working with small business owners, including many Physicians, Gerber provides revolutionary, practical, and enlightening insights on how to produce the best real-world results in the practice, in a Physician's life.</P> <p><i>The E-Myth Physician</I> explores critical topics such as money, people, management, patients, and growth. It teaches you how to:</P> <ul> <li>Implement the ingenious turn-key operation, a means of creating a Franchise Prototype that embodies your unique set of talents and that produces consistent, predictable results each and every time without your having to do everything yourself <li>Recognize, understand, and manage the four factors of money -- income, profit, flow, and equity <li>Nurture the power of change to transform your practice while enabling it to grow exponentially -- without your having to be there all the time</P> <p>Anecdotal and always profound, <i>The E-Myth Physician</I> also provides insights on a broader level. It leads Physicians to become business visionaries by relinquishing tactical work and embracing strategic work -- working on their practices instead of just in them. Gerber's revolutionary ideas empower Physicians to build successful practices and successful lives.</P></span>

                    <span>Anyone who is currently in practice or is considering doing medicine should read this book. Unfortunately one is never taught at medical school the fundamentals of running a medical practice profitably. Doctors erroneously believe that because they are good at medicine or surgery or paediatrics, they will necessarily believe that they are able to run a practice well. This couldn't be further from the truth. Gerber, in an insightful work, manages to expose many of the pitfalls in running a medical practice. I can only say from personal experience that initially, one gets validation from medicine because you are working at the coalface - doing the work of a doctor. Eventually, it dawns on you that you don't in fact have a life - you have effectively bought yourself a job. Every chapter has nuggets that have resulted in a multitude of paradigm shifts in my strategic thinking towards my practice. If you are happy doing the work of a technician and working 80 hour weeks for 50 weeks of the year, don't read this book. If you are seeking something better from practicing medicine, I would suggest reading this book in conjunction with The E-Myth Revisited - Why most small businesses don't work and what to do about it. I would also suggest reading the Robert Kiyosaki books, which will give you another lucid perspective on the pitfalls of being in a profession.</span>

                    <span>Ever been talking to an person of an older generation and he or she starts to ramble? That's what it felt like reading this book. Even the structure and chapters of the book are disorganized - "I'm going to talk to you about employees" . . ."Now I am going to talk to you about money". . ."Now I am going to talk to you about people" and so on.<P>As far as business issues, the author seems to obsess about doctors keeping on time with appointments (which should be a legitimate focus of business operations) but does not offer any solution to the predicament of when a patient has further health concerns. Do we cut them off and tell them to schedule more next time? Defer them to a nurse?<P>And what about other issues a physician faces? Managed care contracts, malpractice, competition, long hours, declining reimbursement. . .?<P>The only redeeming quality about the book was his recommendation to produce a procedure manual of sorts for your practice. That sort of thinking can help one organize themselves.<P>But all in all, I would pass on this one.</span>

                    <span>I have read many of Mr. Gerber's books and have applied his insights to my own practice (not medicine, but financial planning). <P>I work exclusively with physicians and his commentary is right on. Many physicians who feel his book does not provide solutions to their problems are very much still a technician within their practice, working within it and not on it. <P>I have showed clients of mine, who originally did not feel the book provided enough answers to their problems, how the service they receive from my firm is directly attributed to Mr. Gerber's book. <P>After doing so, you can see the light go off in their head, and many of my clients are running more effecient offices, making the same or more money, and most importantly are enjoying what they truly love to do, practive medicine.</span>

                    <span>My partners and I read the E-Myth Physician after reading the E-Myth Revisited. The concepts and systemization of our company have significantly changed our practices in the last year. After looking at some of the other reviews I noticed a common theme, people either love the book or hate it. Those who were not pleased with the book all have another common theme in that they did not feel it offered any "practical" solutions to their problems. That point of view absolutely supports Gerber's idea of the "technition" working in the business and not working on the business. I would not recommend this book for people looking for quick solutions to daily problems in their practice, but if you want to change your practice and the way you look at your business it is an excellent addition to the E-Myth series.</span>

                    <span>I agree with Dan who posted a review 2 posts before me. I am a physician and have read a few of Gerbers books. His Emyth revisited is a good book. However, his other books such as this one which is supposed to be geared towards specific profession. He only gives you some very basic concepts that offer really no solutions to these problems. I think most of us who understand our problems wish to have some questions answered and get help solving them not just simply reiterate what we already know. He does an absolute poor job on the money section of the book even though he implies that it is one of the most important aspects of the business. It is a terrible book on application to problem solving. Emyth even though does not necessarily cover application all the way either but it gives more useful hints than this one. <P>Organization: C-<BR>Application: F<BR>Usefulness: F<BR>Re-read: F<BR>Overall: D-</span>
