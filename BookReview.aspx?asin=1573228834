                <span id="Label1">Here is a moral system based on universal rather than religious principles. Its ultimate goal is happiness for every individual regardless of religious belief. Though the Dalai Lama is himself a practicing Buddhist, his approach to life and the moral compass that guides him can lead each and every one of us-Muslim, Christian, Jew, or Atheist-to a happier, more fulfilling life.</span>

                    <span>Don't let the simplicity of this book overshadow the power of its message: "When the driving force of our actions is wholesome, our actions will tend automatically to contribute to others' well-being. They will thus automatically be ethical." With the courage to point out that religion is not a requirement for ethical behavior, the Dalai Dama discusses virtue, compassion, and our spiritual connection to the world. He does so as a simple and honest man without holding himself as holier than anyone else. Describing how humans can make a constructive difference on the planet, he appeals to people to tap their highest potential and to go for their personal goodness, despite the social currents that discourage one from doing so. <P> This is a book about discovering your ethics rather than just acting out cultural norms. If you appreciate simplicity of style and communication based on real substance, allow me to also recommend "WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK" by Ariel and Shya Kane. In an age of widespread doubt, these two books are refreshing reminders that the principles underlying a fulfilling life are both simple and practical.</span>

                    <span>This book was written at the time of the change from the 20th to the 21st Century. The Dalai Lama used the change to the new Millenium as a call to ethical and spiritual reflection and to an awakening to a new, informed inner life.<P>The book is eloquent and compelling. The Dalai Lama's command of English is somewhat limited, and the text undoubtedly was subject to substantial editing. But the sincerity and power of the book shines through, as does the Dalai Lama's modesty. It is something of a rarity for a book to sound the call to spiritual renewal while refusing to proselytize or to promote a specific creed.<P>The Dalai Lama promises repeatedly that his book is concerned with ethics and spirituality rather than with Buddhist tenents. There is nothing in this book, for example, that even suggests the reader take up a meditiation practice. Although there is a substantial treatment of the difficult Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination, the Dalai Lama makes good on his word. The book can be read and appreciated by people who are secular -- without a religious faith -- and by those who are committed to a faith tradition other than Buddhism.<P>The Dalai Lama's basic message here, I think, is that all people strive to be happy. In the West, we tend to equate the pursuit of happiness with materialistic success. This goes part of the way to happiness but has difficulties in terms of the anxiety, competitiveness, and insenitiveness to ourselves and others that it creates. The Dalai Lama's answer, in common with much religious and spiritual writing, is to look inward. What is important is how the Dalai Lama elaborates his teaching in this book.<P>The Dalai Lama insists that spiritual renewal requires a commitment to ethical behavior. There are two levels to this. The first, more basic level, is to act in a way that doesn't bring harm. This is a seemingly simple teaching, but one difficult to put in practice in specific situations. The second level is to aim to be other-directed rather than self-directed in one's actions. This means acting with patience, generosity, compassion, nonviolence, empathy, thought for the other person, rather than for oneself. For the Dalai Lama this second level underlies all spirituality and religious traditions and is more fundamental than any metaphysical or faith issues. People can disagree on the latter or not hold any religious position at all.<P>After developing the foundations of what he sees as ethical and spiritual behavior, the Dalai Lama offers suggestions for the individual's redirection of him or herself in terms of restraint, virtue, compassion, and the relief of suffering. Again, I was struck by the modesty of the teaching and by the Dalai Lama's claim that spiritual redirection can be independent of the individual's commitment or lack of commitment to a religous creed. The Dalai Lama emphasizes at one point that "we are not talking about Buddahood here" but rather about how any individual can aim for ethical and spiritual redirection.<P>A chapter in the final section of the book discusses "the role of religion in modern society." The Dalai Lama explains his own commitment to Tibetan Buddhism but insists again that such commitment is unnecessary for the individual to redirect energy to the ethical/spiritual life. In fact, in this book the Dalai Lama discourages religious conversion but urges the reader to remain in his or her own faith and work within it. He maintains that all religions teach the same basic ethical and spiritual precepts while their metaphysical or faith commitments differ. He offers a plea that people from different faith traditions learn that they can learn much from each other while maintaining their own belief system. He reiterates that people shouldn't force themselves to have a religion at all if they are committed to a secular worldview.<P>There is a great deal of wisdom and simplicity in this book. It may be valuable to those who want to consider redirecting or better understanding themselves.</span>

                    <span>Despite being a book by the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, this is not a religious work. Nor is it spiritual or a plea to act against the miserable state of Tibet. It is as void of pretence as a scientific book on ethics. Well, which is what it is: a scientific, sociologic book on ethics. <P>But the Dalai Lama manages to make more from it. He is teaching the reader on his subject, not by preaching or swaying, but purely by illustrating and logic. He doesn't use easy language the entire time, nor does he put everything in metaphor or make a thrilling story of it. Yet, there is something between the lines of exposition with which he manages to instil on the reader that he speaks words of wisdom and truth. <P>I could find only one word that describes this text accurately: convincing. This is the sort of book that, upon finishing, needs to be read again - purely out of angst that the lesson you have just received, might dissipate with time. It leaves you feeling that with a little patience and devotion, you will be a happier, warmer person. <P>This book needs no preaching or swaying, this book will make you stand up and act out of own impulse. And get this: it will work too. <P>This book gets five stars.<P>Bram Janssen,<BR>The Netherlands</span>

                    <span>This is in the top 5 of my favorite books. The Dalai Lama masterfully articulates some of the most important principals that are set forth by the Buddhist religion into understandable everyday language. When these principals are applied to one's life the effects are dramatic and carry incredible impact. He makes a point of the fact that this life is a journey and that we must continually be mindful of these principals. He quite skillfully is able to breakdown what can sometimes seem like a hectic and empty existance into very simply understood terms. Pointing out that all humans have two main desires; to acheive happiness and avoid suffering. He goes on to give seemingly simplistic, but often overlooked guidelines in order to acheive these two main desires. He links many of these thoughts with superb logical reasoning. Empathy is a main theme and the book does a wonderfull job stressing this eternally important principle. You will not regret reading this book!</span>
