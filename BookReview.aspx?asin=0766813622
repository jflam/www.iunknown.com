                <span id="Label1">Read the Prose.  Study the illustrations.  And apply what you have learned to design your own pages.  It's easy with Basics of Design; Typography and Layout for Beginners!  This heavily illustrated, compact guide is ideal for readers with no graphic design or art education background who need to create first-rate visual page designs.  Entrepreneurs challenged with designing their own business cards, and administrative assistants suddenly put in charge of producing newsletters and fax cover pages, are just two examples of readers who benefit from the information in this primer.  Its uniquely conversational tone - combined with numerous "before" and "after" illustrations- provides everything needed to design pages as effective as those of professional designers.  Part One introduces readers to important design principles, as well as how to use color and images to add impact to designs.  Part Two concentrates on the basics of typography.  Part Three features a number of common design projects of the variety frequently assigned to non-designers (.., company business cards, fax cover letters, graphical and statistical reports, and more).  To further aid readers, each project is accompanied by a brief listing of some of the special considerations involved in that type of visual page design.  The final chapter of the book lists useful design books and resources for readers interested in advancing their typography and layout skills.</span>

                    <span>There is not much mistaking the purpose of this book judging from the title. It is for beginners, and it delivers admirably. Graham takes the reader step by step and in a very systematic way through the basic tenets of graphic design. Each chapter deals with a specific aspect of design and how the reader can use it to communicate more effectively. Graham gives plenty of examples of what to do as well as what not to do and the text is well illustrated, though it could have used more examples in color. That is a small criticism though and one that does not really detract from the book in any way. The beginning designer will come away from this book with a firm foundation in design and with skills that they will utilize for the rest of their career. If you are looking to learn about graphic design then this book is the perfect starting point. </span>

                    <span>A friend of mine recommended this book as a solid introduction to graphic design. The author, Lisa Graham, covers the principles of design effectively and even throws in some unexpectedly funny explanations that really make the point. For example, the beginning of the Balance chapter is hilarious and made me realize that a page really can make a person feel weird, if it isn't designed using the design principles. Once I read that balance chapter, I realized that many of her illustrations also were surprisingly humerous, and reveals what must be a delightful sense of humor. <p>If you buy this book, keep in mind that the humor is used to support the points Graham makes, and is not the sole focus of the book. This is after all a design  book and makes some serious and informative points.<p>Perhaps what is most effective about this book is the thorough explanations she gives on why a design works and why it doesn't work. This is a refreshing change from many other introductory design books that I looked at where the primary focus of the text seemed to be to show off pretty pictures. Pretty pictures are nice, but WHY do the designs work? WHY don't they work. Basics of Design tells you why, and in such a wonderfully understandable way that you remember, and easily apply what Graham teaches.<p>Good job Lisa. When are you going to write more books on graphic design? I'll be sure to keep an eye out for more of your work!</span>

                    <span>Having wasted much time looking through a number of other books supposedly covering the same subject, this book is a welcome relief. <p>This book covers in adequate detail the essentials and the basic principles of design, including emphasis, contrast, balance, alignment, repetition, flow, the use of images, color, typography, etc. It gives enough explanation with examples for one to get a good grounding on the subject, without getting too technical, keeping the book highly readable. A part of the book also focuses on specific design situations, including logos, flyers, newsletters, resumes, etc. <p>Perfect for anyone with no formal training in design, but would like to improve his/her understanding of design.</span>

                    <span>I am a complete dunce at design (or at least I was). Whatever the optical equivalent to a "tin ear" is, I have it. In this book Ms. Graham gives step-by-step simple and yet logical and practical instruction on how to make one's designs both attractive and effective. Her writing style often made me feel as if I were being given advice by a "friend in the design business." I began using the principles that she teaches in my web pages and flyer designs before I was even half-way through the book. The improvements that I saw in my abilities were amazing.<p>This book has (the basics of) everything: typography, contrast, color, flow, emphasis, etc. Most of the books I had examined prior to finding this little gem were nothing more than over-sized "picture books" with writing in the margins, I couldn't bring myself to spend the money on so little information (but they sure were pretty). This book, on the other hand, is mostly text with small, well-selected illustrations, and at the end of every chapter the author gives several "case-studies" of the current topic and walks the reader through each one.<p>I cannot imagine a better book for someone new to design.</span>
