                <span id="Label1">Ever since Jack Nicklaus, the greatest golfer in the history of the game, unveiled his first golf course design in 1970, he has been winning kudos for his visually striking layouts and challenging yet playable holes. More than 235 Nicklaus courses have sprung up around the globe, earning the Golden Bear Golf Digest's designation in 1999 as the world's leading active designer.  <P>At least 30 Nicklaus courses have been ranked in various Top 100 lists, from Shoal Creek in Birmingham, with its sharply etched bunkers and rock-strewn creeks, to Castle Pines outside Denver, carved through a mile-high site that affords stunning views of the surrounding mountains.Here, Nicklaus reveals how he builds his courses and shares the secret of how to "read" a golf hole and play it well. With tips from the master on how to plot out strategy on the fairway, this book-with its superb course photos, plans, and diagrams-will be the season's top holiday gift for any golfer. AUTHOR BIO: Jack Nicklaus, widely recognized as the world's greatest golfer, is also one of the top golf-course designers in the world. Winner of 71 official Tour victories, including 20 majors; five-time winner of the PGA Player of the Year Award; and named Golf Magazine's "Player of the Century," Nicklaus heads the Nicklaus Design company based in North Palm Beach, Florida. Chris Millard, former Executive Editor of Senior Golfer Magazine, is an award-winning golf writer whose work has appeared in Golf Digest, Golf World, Golf Magazine, and the New York Times. He lives in Atlanta. Pete Dye was a top amateur player in the 1950s and is now one of the most revered course designers in the United States. He divides his time between Delray Beach, Florida, and Indianapolis, Indiana.</span>

                    <span>One of what is becoming a library of works on golf course designs written by leading architects - fun thing here is that not only do you hear from Nicklaus the architect but also get more insight into Nicklaus the golfer (something not found in books by Trent Jones, Trent Jones II or Fazio in their books).<BR>What is surprising are the sometimes very technical descriptions of drainage, irrigation and agriculture that you don't find in books of the other leading architects. As with the other books of this type on the market, lots of great pictures, lots of great stories and narratives about designing of particular courses and just generally interesting stuff about golf and golf courses.</span>

                    <span>Of all the books I have read by Jack Nicklaus, this is the most accessible. Who would have thought that the subject of golf course design could evoke such excellent writing and superb description. Nicklaus has finally teamed with a writer to match the caliber of his own golfing and design ability.<P>I only wish that Nicklaus -- or his Boswell, Millard -- would have taken the time to compare Nicklaus's style to the classic links-style courses such as Saint Andrew's and Fenwick.<P>A great write and a great read!</span>

                    <span>While some will argue whether Jack Nicklaus has been supplanted by Tiger Woods as the greatest golfer in history,there should be no debate about the place that Chris Millard occupies among golf writers. He is at the top of his game in this outstanding book with witty prose and masterly pacing. Mr. Millard's writing captivates the reader, be he or she a scratch golfer or duffer. At the same time, it provides keen insights into what made Jack Nicklaus a legend that will endure. The book plays like a championship Nicklaus course, but with no bunkers or water hazards to divert the reader from the round of his/her life. Simply put: it's outstanding.</span>

The photos and writing are as clean and graceful as the courses themselves, and the book helps you understand the "why's" behind the design decisions.</span>
