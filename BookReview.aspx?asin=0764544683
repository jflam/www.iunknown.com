                    <span>This book is excellent. I highly recommend it for everyone from admins learning about what hackers are trying to do to their network to seasoned exploit writers. The best part of this book is that if gives a very solid foundation to anyone interested in the field. The only negative thing that I can say is that you can see a slight difference in writing style between some of the chapters, but I suppose that is to be expected with so many authors.</span>

                    <span>If you want to learn how to exploit software, this is is a MUST for your library. An awesome book despite a few errors in the text.
<br />
<br />The only issue I have is with the numerous promises of additional resources on the web site that have never materialized.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The Shellcoder's Handbook covers important and relevant aspects of exploiting system and program vulnerabilities. The point is made clearly; however, examples and figures include errors that make it very inefficient to experiment with the examples. Considering this current (1st) edition, I'd rather recommend interested readers to have a look at other available documentation (e.g. Smashing the stack for fun and profit). This book does not tell the whole story for new Operating Systems either; for example, Fedora Core 3 comes with several protection mechanisms that must be disabled in order to successfully test some of the less complicated examples. Fazit for readers: this book is a nice read but in its current edition ineffective for hands-on experience. Fazit for editor: eliminate errors and update instructions for testing examples on current operating system releases.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Just the sheer wealth of information is something you are rarely treated to in ANY book. 24 chapters of very deep security tips.
<br />
<br />I haven't read the whole book yet as I've skipped to the advanced topics but I can say i've learnt quite a bit despite the fact that I've read many papers on shellcode/buffer overflows.
<br />
<br />I can see why some people said this book is dangerous because it will help the attackers. Although this idea of security through obscurity is absurd, I have to say that it will be difficult for most attackers to come up on their own with the things discussed in this book.
<br />
<br />In all cases, kudos to the authors for writing such a comprehensive handbook. I hope we'll see a sequel to it.</span>
