                    <span>This book is an overly-detailed, almost academic discussion of organizational theory.  Some of the basic organizational principles include listing a project's "processes or system[s] into manageable parts" , breaking down projects into  prioritizing projects by how aggravating they are, tackling the #1's first, etc.  Her discussion of how to compose and analyze the daily to-do list is overly-detailed -- for example, calling a student's mother to determine why he didn't show up for class yesterday is an immediate task that just cropped up, while getting in touch with an equipment supplier is "a basic, medium range task."  What does that mean??  And I don't think most of us struggle with figuring out what is really important and what isn't; what we need is something that will help us accomplish what is most important.  The financial planning section is overly detailed -- assess income, analyze fixed expenses, prepare a budget, etc.  I'm consulting a Getting Organized book because I need to get motivated and empowered to plow through the pile of clothes on the floor and the pile of papers on my desk -- This book is better-suited for folks who are already organized and want to be even more so.  This book might be a good choice if you are already reasonably organized and are looking for detailed discussions of the processes that might enable you to become more organized in all aspects of your life.  If you are currently at a lower level of organization, I recommend Don Aslett's books on clutter; for me, they have been much more readable and useful.</span>

                    <span>I have read many books in my life, many of which I have made the grand statement that my life was altered afterwards.  None has had such an impact in such a short period of time. In the beginning of the book, Ms. Winston provides readers with a self-evaluation.  My wife and I sat down and did it together, and reluctantly added up our points.  We ranked in the "Disorganized to the point of Chaos" category.<p>But, in the past two weeks or so, we have begun to implement the author's suggestions, many of which boil down to common sense.  One reviewer is harsh in his criticism because of dated material, because of her suggestion to use carbon paper to make back-up copies of all correspondence.  I, too, was surprised at this anachronism in a newly revised edition, but I forgave her for all of the other great advice.  If you too are disorganized "to the point of chaos", BUY THIS BOOK.  It may change your life, too.</span>

                    <span>This book is so outdated as to be laughable.  She talks about carbon paper and white-out!  Computers are treated as something for technologists.  She says Sidekick is the most popular software.  In fact it is no longer marketed or supported.  Memory typewriters are compared favorably to computers!  However, her Two-List Time Plan was worth the price of the book.</span>

                    <span>When I took over the daily operation of a National Guard Armory I wasn't sure what I was getting into. The Armory had a staff of one, Me! I needed to get organized fast!      The administrator whom I was replacing had his own system in place. I was fortunate, I was able to work with him before he left for his new assignment.      The National Guard runs and thrives on chaos and a crisis management system. Every day there was a new crisis to cope with, mostly the making of the higher headquarters. There was always too much useless work and never enough time to get it accomplished.      At least once a day I would get a phone call from higher headquarters about some useless piece of paperwork the just discovered they needed yesterday at the latest and now wanted everybody to jump through hoops!      Short and long term planning were never practiced, just given lip-service.      Winston's book was a great starting point. It helped me get ahead and stay ahead of the Puzzle Palace Jockeys.      There is something here for everyone. If you learn just one new idea and put it to work for you, the price of the book will have been well worth it!</span>

                    <span>The author defenitly provided me with fair suggestions to organzie myself better, however, most the suggestion were common things. However, do not compare yourself with me because prior purchasing this book, I still was a great organized person; it's just that I like to be perfect.</span>
