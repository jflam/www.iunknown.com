                <span id="Label1"><p>This book answers the question, Do you need to learn C# or VB .NET to develop in .NET? You'll learn that the answer is in fact no, at least until you're good and ready. With Managed C++, your hard-earned skills as an established C++ developer or beginner won&#146;t be wasted. Microsoft touts that .NET is language neutral and this book proves it, at least in the area of C++. <i>Managed C++ and .NET Development</i> is truly a .NET book applying C++ as its development language&#151;not another C++ syntax book that happens to cover .NET. </p>  <p>There's no other book out there like this one. It's written for the C++ programmer who wants to write new .NET programs and not just migrate existing ones. To this end, author Stephen R.G. Fraser covers topics such as collections, multithreading, I/O, XML, ADO.NET, GDI+, Windows Forms (using the new GUI design tool introduced in VS .NET 2003), Web services, and Web Forms, focusing strictly on new code development. </p></span>

                    <span>Most .NET programming books focus on C# or VB.NET, and that's pretty much it. This makes Stephen's choice of Managed C++ as a general-purpose .NET programming language unusual and refreshing. As the examples in the book demonstrate, Managed C++ is in no way inferior to other, more "traditional" .NET languages. Plus, you will learn to do things that are simply not available in any other language...Stephen covers a lot of material in his book. No doubt, he has valuable experience in he field and he is successful at sharing it. - From the Foreward by Artur Laksberg, Managed C++ Compiler Development Team, Microsoft Corporation</span>

                    <span>This is thorough introduction to managed C++ development. In other words it introduces MS extensions to C++ for the .NET and CLR environments. If you are writing native C++ mostly, then this book will be of limited interest. Of course, the reason this book was necessary is due to the overhaul of Framework 1.0 and its updating to 1.1. The update has done away with the 'old' IDE and pushed users again into relearning class construction, property options, etc. in the new IDE. The author fills a valuable gap in helping to interpret the new IDE for users. The downside of the book is that it lacks a level of abstraction that would unify the many examples in the book. This may suit day-to-day programmers, but it may dismay the college student and academic. Otherwise it is a good book, simply because it is almost alone at present. However, with the arrival of .Net 2003, early .Net books on C++ may become redundant. Hopefully MS will bear the cost of learning in mind before changing the .net Framework again.</span>

                    <span>I must say this is the best book i've red, i mean the book i've had most fun with. I red this large book in short period of time, and you know what that means! <BR>This is not the book you will get bored with. It's rare to find the book which is both fun and advanced. i think this one is precisely it. I'm so glad to find out how to write asp.net page with (managed) c++, it's a great felling! the way the chapter about managed c++ in asp.net is explained is beyond the good,hence excellent. it's so easy plus you have fun with it and before you know, you can program web pages with c++. I was also amazed with chapter on web-services. i red few times about this new technology but first now after i red Stephens Managed C++ i understand completely what the web services are and how to write them. And in both asp.net and web-service chapter you get simple sampels which is extremely importent to get someone understand what you talking about but beyond that there are also advanced sampels with ADO.NET and Web-forms. Beautifull!!<BR>To begin with, the book explains shortly .NET and than explains what Managed C++ is (it's c++ adapted to .NET , and there are some minor differences in syntax with the original c++)<BR>Than the book compare how Managed c++ language looks like in .NET, so you get all details and what you need to corectly write c++ programms i .NET. The rest of the book is about Windwows Forms, Advanced Windows Foram, GDI+(drawing) and so on..<P>What a author!</span>

                    <span>A reviewer stated that in chapter 2 there are Visual Studio .NET commands that are not found in the Visual Studio.NET Standard addition. <P>Hmmmm this confuses me... the only commands used in chapter 2 are standard .NET Framework commands and have nothing to do about Visual Studio.NET. Maybe the reviewer should contact the author and ask for help before posting misinformation.<P>Though, it is true that a few of the features covered in the book are Enterprise specific, creating SQL 2000 database within the studio comes to mind (but there are free downloadable workaround to this.) <P>All in all, a great book about Managed C++!</span>
