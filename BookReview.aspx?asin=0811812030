                    <span>I have always thought that Mitsuaki Iwago's nature photography is unsurpassed. His ability to capture images that are original is uncanny. For anyone interested in the Serengeti-Ngorongoro ecosystem, or African Wildlife in general, "In the Lion's Den" is definitely worth buying. However, the superb photographs are let down by poor printing and limitations in the text accompanying the images. The captions rarely relate well to the images and, in some cases, appear to be incorrect. For example, several pages in the middle of the book show stunning photographs of two male lions fighting. The final photograph in the sequence shows a male lion roaring with a caption indicating that the victor remains in a high state of tension. However, the lion pictured has no blood on its muzzle, whereas the preceding photographs show the bloodied victor biting through the scull of its opponent. 
<br />
<br />Despite the limitations, I would still recommend this book on the basis of the photographs alone. However, for those also hoping for informative writing on lion behaviour, this book would prove to be disappointing. Another thing I noticed was that the printing quality was poor compared to his other books.

                    <span>Iwago has brought to us breathtaking photos of the Lion....in their  world.........the glory and the defeat of this most powerful animal clearly  portrayed. I am always awed by Iwago's ability as a photographer......he  has a special gift for capturing animals on film and In The Lion's Den is  solid evidence of his talent !!</span>

                    <span>This is a very informative book about lions.  The book has
lots of pictures.  There are some pictures that contain
blood in it.  Though it's only because it shows a lion
 killing its prey.  As a lion lover I really enjoyed this 
 book.  I've been trying to locate a book like this one.
 There are also cute pictures of lion cubs playing around.
 
 Overall it's a very nice and informative picture book about
 the "King of the Beasts".</span>
