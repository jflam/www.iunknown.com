                <span id="Label1"><I>VB & VBA in a Nutshell: The Languages</I> documents the latest version of the world's bestselling rapid application development environment. Paul Lomax's explanation of the language comes in two main parts.<p> First, Lomax explains the structure and syntax of Visual Basic (VB) and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programs. He details all the important stuff, including how to work with variables, how to create custom functions, how to create classes, how to handle errors, and how to react to user events. If you're up to speed on general programming concepts and just want to know how to get something done in VB/VBA, you'll find this part of the book especially handy.<p> The second, and largest, part of the book is a language reference in the classic O'Reilly style. Every function, statement, keyword, and miscellaneous bit of code has a clear, complete entry. Each entry includes a statement of syntax, a description of the function's purpose, a quick example of its use, and some tips for using it successfully. The reference documents the language as it exists in VB6. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>I assume most readers are familiar with the strengths shared by many of the O'Reilly Nutshell series, and so will not belabour this point.  Instead, I will go straight to the primary reasons for recommending this book:
<br />
<br />+ The section "Programming Tips & Gotchas" gives you valuable insight into each function call.  I have yet to find another VBA book that does as great a job as Lomax did.  Those tips have saved me hours and hours of testing and debugging.  (My only criticism, if any, is that this section should be expanded.)
<br />
<br />+ Note that this book was published in 1998, but most info in this book is transferable to VBA in Office 2000/XP since the VB language has not changed that much.
<br />
<br />+ Although not intended as a "learning book", the non-reference chapters (Ch.1-6) are nonetheless highly readable.  (If you are an intermediate/advanced programmer who has solid programming experience but new to VBA, you can dive right into the first few chapters without problems.)
<br />
<br />+ It addresses these topics very well: memory "allocation" and "deallocation", event-handling concepts, collection and dictionary, object variables and class modules.
<br />
<br />+ Personally, I find this book much more precise than Walkenbach's "Power Programming with VBA".  (Get Walkenbach's book only if you haven't program before.)
<br />
<br />If you want to build data structures (stacks, trees, etc.) with VBA, you may want to consider Ken Getz and Mike Gilbert's "VBA Developer's Handbook".
<br />
<br />A final word of caution:  This book does not teach you how to program List Boxes, Drop-down Boxes, or other Windows controls. Go to another source for this.  (In most cases, googling newsgroups would suffice.)</span>

                    <span>I am very new to programming. I ignored the previous recommendations mentioning that this book was not for begginers and I ordered it anyway. I have read the first three chapters straight through and used much of the book as a reference which I beleive it was meant to be. I found this book together with Access 2002 Desktop Developer's Handbook and Access 97 Macro and VBA Handbook gives me a better understanding of the VBA language. The book is informative and is a fairly easy read. I would recommend this book to any beginner that is serious about learning VBA.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent reference on the VB/VBA Language 6.0. For every function, statement, and keyword in the base language, there is a one-page-or-so explanation; most importantly, this book includes the inevitable "gotchas" in programming in a Microsoft environment. This book is the ideal replacement for the MS online help, which, in my experience, has *never* told me anything I didn't already figure out, and *always* fails to describe the behavior that causes the problem that made me look for help in the first place. The one trick I failed to find immediately in this book was the need to use "Is" to compare an object reference to "Nothing." (It's in the book, just not where I first looked.)<p>That said, one warning: this does not describe the object model of any application. If you want to understand why Excel's Range object is not behaving the way you expect, this book says nothing. There are other thick books to describe that.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First off, this book is EXCELLENT. I'd say this is probably the best computer book I have ever seen and used.<p>My complaint is that O'Reilly is now producing the book without RepKover, which is (I think) that "unglued" portion of the outer binding that allows the book to lay perfectly and effortlessly flat on a desk. The _great_ aspect of RepKover is that I can lay the book right in front of me without having to "hold it down" with my arms while I read from it while typing.<p>I got my book in 1999, when they used RepKover. Today, they (sadly) don't use RepKover for this anymore.<p>So I'd say the 1999 book is the most perfectly produced computer book I have ever seen. (Yes...I do mean that). Everything about it exceeds all expectations.<p>But the 2002 book, because it doesn't have the best binding, brings it down a notch.<p>Somebody mentioned that this is a VB book but not VBA. That is simply not true. It is both a VB and VBA book. The focus is on the language, not on respective application objects. (Read the title: VB and VBA in a Nutshell The Language) I am a VBA programmer and I use this book all of the time.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>For the basics of programming in VB this may well be a good book but if you're an experienced programmer and want to dive in at the deep end and program in VBA for Excel, Word etc then this book won't help you much. Better to buy Walkenbach, Green or Kofler. For a terse, precise clarification of language syntax it gets top marks.</span>
