                    <span>This book is NOT suited for electrical engineers who want to learn SCADA. It is, however, adequate for business men or managers who would like to acquire a general (very general indeed)understanding of SCADA terminology. Themes within the book are treated superficially sometimes, with a greater depth in others (such as when addressing protocols) that is not consistent nor coherent. I do not recommend this book for a Power Systems Engineer, student of such systems, or any electric or electronic engineer that wishes to understand SCADA.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>For training technicians, this book provides an excellent introduction to how SCADA systems work. Most of the more detailed system information requires training and manuals from specific vendors who usually provide good information on their products but little in the way of a system-wide view.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to contain mostly dated, simplistic information and believe it to be unsuitable for an engineer.  It will NOT advance the expertise of anyone with even minor expertise in this field.  I'm stunned that it has ISA backing and is a second edition.  Don't waste your time on this book unless you need only a casual, conceptual understanding of this subject.</span>

                    <span>I had to prepared an introduction course on SCADA system. This book by himself is a complete course. I had no trouble to find information and build a 3 days course to engineer learner. They were very satisfy with the contents of this book. Thank you for your sugestion to purchase it.</span>
