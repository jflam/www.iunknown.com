                <span id="Label1">With nearly 250,000 sold, Harvey and Paul Deitel's<I>C++ How to Program</I></B>is the world's best-selling introduction to C++ programming. Now, this classic has been thoroughly updated! The authors have given this edition a general tune-up of object-oriented programming presentation. The new Fourth Edition has a new code-highlighting style that uses an alternate background color to focus the reader on new code elements in a program. The Deitels' <I>C++ How to Program</I></B> is the most comprehensive, practical introduction to C++ ever published -- with hundreds of hands-on exercises, roughly 250 complete programs written and documented for easy learning, and exceptional insight into good programming practices, maximizing performance, avoiding errors, debugging, and testing. This new Fourth Edition has an upgraded OOD/UML case to latest UML standard, as well as significant improvements to exception handling and operator overloading chapters. Features enhanced treatment of strings and arrays as objects earlier in the book using standard C++ classes, string and vector. The Fourth Edition retains every key concept and technique ANSI C++ developers need to master: control structures, functions, arrays, pointers and strings, classes and data abstraction, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions, polymorphism, I/O, templates, exception handling, file processing, data structures, and more. It also includes a detailed introduction to Standard Template Library (STL) containers, container adapters, algorithms, and iterators. The accompanying CD-ROM includes all the code from the book as well as essential software for learning C++. For anyone who wants to learn C++, improve their existing C++ skills, and master object-oriented development with C++.</span>

                    <span>Hi,<P>I have just tried to learn C++ from many on line references and a few books and most of them fail to teach C++. <P>This is a text-book for a college C++ class and it is clearly aimed to teach you all the basics from Standard C++, not teach you the Win32 programming. Also, it is perfect for readers who want to learn C++ by them selves (like me). I admit that for a long time, learning C++ was a scary thought, but reading this book not also ended my fear like taught be C++.<P>Why does the authors start OOP explanations only after a few chapters? Well, first you need to understand the syntax. I knew C and Java, so the initial chapters simply gave me a good revision of the syntax and taught me a few more. The examples<BR>are pretty good. The exercices are also presented in huge proportions, so readers can't complain about projects they could try to learn C++.<P>Pointers always scared me, now I know that it was due to writers who tried to make this subject a myth. And it is not. <P>Of course parts of the text might be redundant for some and new for others, so it is just a case of skipping a few lines.<P>My only complaint is that it does not cover MFC, but then I think the idea was to present the C++ standard, and the next the reader should choose which IDEs or Operation Systems to code.<P>And the price is really expensive.</span>

                    <span>I have been using the Deitel books for the last 4 years. I have tried Java How To Program 2nd, 3rd, and 4th edith; as well as the Visual Basic 6 How To Program Book. All of them are well written and easy to understand. The end of chapter exercises are good for reinforcing concepts, and some are challenging and require that you think a bit. Thats the challenge of programming, problem solving! I find it difficult to believe that people could be finding the C++ How To Program Book hard to read. I have just purchased it, and it very EASY compared to the other C++ books out there. Programming isn't for everybody, and C++ happens to be more complicated than a lot of other programming languages. I feel that C++ can be mastered as a first programming language, but it might be better for a first timer to start with an easier language like Visual Basic or Java to ease into C++ programming. I hope this helps.</span>

                    <span>This book is well organized, and gives clear, readable descriptions of the whole C++ language - and that covers a lot of area.<P>There's a lot of thud factor here, well over 1K pages. A lot of that is taken up with sample code and with programming advice that seems to help beginners. If you just want a language handbook, that's way more than you need or want. I tolerate it, though, because of the clarity of the rest of the presentation. <P>(If my emphasis on clarity seems excessive, that's because you haven't experienced Stroustrup's "stream of conciousness" style.)<P>This book gives only minimal and incidental descriptions of the standard C/C++ libraries, the STL, and all the other necessaries of the C++ world. Well, you can't have everything. Not if you want to be able to lift the book, too. This picks a topics and covers it - you'll need additional references for the rest.<P>This does what I want: it gives me the language, all of it, without requiring a linear search through the whole text. Until I find something better, I'll use this for my C++ reference.</span>

                    <span>I have 5 books on C++, but this was by far the best. It was easy to understand, clearly written, and very thorough. Each time a question started forming in my mind, I'd find the answer in the next sentence or paragraph. No book will ever be a "one stop shop", but this one comes pretty close. If you need to teach your self C++, I'd highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I used this book for my first college programming class and still use it as a reference today. It starts with basic procedural programming and quickly introduces objected oriented programming with an interesting elevator simulation. It provides full programming examples unlike many other text books. The colorful code highlights and icon coded notes enhance learning and make this book a joy to use. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to learn C++. <BR> I have only one beef with this book. The binding doesn't hold up well to constant use. I have large sections of pages falling out of my copy. To be fair, I have used this book a lot, but I have also tried to take good care of it to no avail. At this price, I think Dietel should provide a hardcover with a solid binding.</span>
