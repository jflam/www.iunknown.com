                    <span>Embedded Ethernet And Internet Complete by computer networking expert Jan Axelson is a very practical and "user friendly" instructional guide to designing and programming tiny web servers and using TCP/IP to communicate over local networks and the Internet. A truly in-depth, detail-oriented, and very comprehensive resource replete with examples, suggestions, basics to get started quickly, and more, Embedded Ethernet And Internet Complete is an ideal reference for professionals as well as those who aspire to a professional level of competence in their own right. Also very highly recommended are Jan Axelson's other computer instructionals: USB Complete; Serial Port Complete; and Parallel Port Complete.</span>

                    <span>Recently, I took my daughter to a play about a giant. At turns, the giant was played by an actor and a 30-foot effigy. The other characters were each played both by a person and a 12-inch marionette. It was technically well done: the scale shifted up and down effortlessly.
<br />
<br />This book does the same thing, swooping from a description of the bitfields in an Ethernet frame, to the nuances of multithreaded network programming, to details of HTTP, SMTP, POP, and FTP; from making network patch cables (really!) to choosing network-ready embedded processor boards, to architecting whole networks. Somehow, the reader doesn't notice the transitions; this vast range of information is all integrated flawlessly.
<br />
<br />The intended audience is embedded systems programmers who want to learn about networking. Someone wanting to build a hardware IP router would find most of what they'd need here, at least regarding the theory and the software. More basic setup information for the specific hardware (including the Java-programmable TINI board) that are used in the excellent examples would have been welcome; some details on assembling a test rig would have let a hardware novice dabble more confidently.
<br />
<br />The focus of most of the book is excellent, but the momentum does start to dissipate in the last few chapters; the very last chapter on network security in particular feels tacked on.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to learn about Ethernet or IP networking, on embedded systems or not.</span>

                    <span>I wish I had read this book before embarking on my current project. Jan Axelson's "Embedded Ethernet and Internet Complete" gives a great introduction to connecting embedded devices to ethernet and via ethernet to the internet. It would have filled some gaps in my knowledge and saved me some grief further down the track. This is an excellent introduction to creating applications using ethernet capable embedded devices such as the 
<br />Rabbit Ethernet Module or TINI based systems.
<br />
<br />This book shows detailed examples of building embedded webservers, including those hosting dynamic data and gathering and using user input. In similar detail, the book has very useful chapters on e-mail and FTP applications on embedded systems.
<br />
<br />It even has a great chapter comparing a number of different MAC 
<br />controllers, that I wish I'd seen before choosing the one I'm currently using (it introduced me to one I hadn't seen before - that may have been better for my application than the chip I'm using). Unfortunately, that's about where the low level stuff stops. I was hoping for some examples and tips on communicating with these MAC controllers in an embedded environment with limited RAM and ROM resources. This book didn't go down to my level there. For those who are interested in this stuff, consider also buying "TCIP Lean" by Jeremy Bentham, which misses out on most of the stuff in this book, but covers the lower levels of talking to the MAC very well (the two books are, in fact, wonderful companions without too much duplication 
<br />between them).
<br />
<br />All in all, a book that definitely has a place on the bookshelf of anyone considering working with embedded intenet connected devices, particularly those with limited recent exposure to ethernet device and internet protocols. For me, it fell a little short of the possibly unreachable superlative "Complete".

                    <span>Jan does an excellent job of describing Ethernet basics and its use with small systems - embedded devices that use Ethernet for communications and control.  Jan describes a range of embedded devices that might be employed for data acquisition and control applications.  Also described are the other hardware components of the actual network that may be implemented.
<br />Device manufacturers typically include a simple web server that may be used for access.  Jan illustrates the code that may be employed from a desktop PC and examples of code that may be downloaded to the embedded devices to enable them to operate independently.  Recommended!
