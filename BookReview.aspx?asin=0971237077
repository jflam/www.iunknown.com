                    <span>Dogs For Life one of the most feared YET respected crews in West Baltimore. Created, and strongly influenced by two young Brothas; Dayvon (thorough in thought) & Ty (tight murder game) both leaped into the game as boys pledging their lifetime membership or "until death!" 
<br />
<br />Dayvon Freeman was anything but your typical street hustler born in the hood. Dayvon was privileged with two parents, a nice home, the right schools, and the capacity to do great things. This self portrayed black sheep took to the streets, and never looked back. 
<br />
<br />Tyrone Adams was a victim of circumstance. Son to junkies killed because they couldn't pay their drug tab. Ty's only relative his Uncle an OG was a hustler. Tossing Ty out into the streets early he grew to love the drama, and was built for warfare. 
<br />
<br />Now Dayvon & Ty were men. As leaders in DOGS FOR LIFE they had major success in the streets. Strong 10 year run, prosperous to the entire family. A family that was at MAXIUM STRENGTH. When you've gotten all that you can what else is left? 
<br />
<br />Sitting tight on a three year bid. Ty recognizes that THUGGIN' was definitely just his be all that ends all! Dayvon, sees the possibilities of what his wealth could afford him and wants to move beyond THUGGIN'. 
<br />
<br />In the blink of an eye DOGS FOR LIFE would plummet down from its manifesto of love, only to be overthrown by major disloyalty. 
<br />
<br />Along with money, and fame...comes a hefty price of pain! 
<br />
<br />A Thug's Life is an experience of urban tension. Leaving the individual reader with the opportunity to glimpse each character as they elect to live a certain way including the consequences that goes with their choices.

                    <span>Best friends Dayvon and Ty are more like brothers than friends.  Nothing can come between them.  Or can it?  As the leaders of the ruthless DFL (Dogs For Life), they have the streets of B'more on lock.  That is until Ty gets knocked.  Being his brother's keeper, Dayvon holds things down while his partner is gone.  Time and experience has Dayvon considering making a change.  Maybe it's time to give this steet life up.  But what does Ty think of Dayvon's change of heart?  Is Dayvon going soft?  Or maybe he's a snitch?  Is that why Ty is locked up and not Dayvon?  Dayvon's decision unknowingly starts a chain reaction of events that no one is ready for.  Will the streets of B'more ever be the same?
<br /> 
<br />I had been waiting on Mr. Long's debut novel.  After reading his short story in 'The Game,' he piqued my interest.  His story was one of the VERY FEW  worth reading in that book (don't get me started!).  He did not disappoint with 'A Thug's Life.'  It was an enjoyable read, but rather on the short side.  I look forward to big things from this author.
