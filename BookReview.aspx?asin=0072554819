                <span id="Label1">The Fourth edition of Database System Concepts has been extensively revised from the 3rd edition. The new edition provides improved coverage of concepts, extensive coverage of new tools and techniques, and updated coverage of database system internals.   This text is intended for a first course in databases at the junior or senior undergraduate, or first-year graduate level. Database System Concepts, 4th ed. offers a complete background in the basics of database design, languages, and system implementations.   Concepts are presented using intuitive descriptions, and important theoretical results are covered, but formal proofs are omitted.  The fundamental concepts and algorithms covered in Database System Concepts 4th ed. are based on those used in existing commercial or experimental database systems.  The authors present these concepts and algorithms in a general setting that is not tied to one particular database system.</span>

                    <span>I read some of the reviews here. The comments varies from a good book to a worthless one.<p>If you are really interested in making a career out of databases, then this is a book you got to read. An analogy that comes to mind is "You got to have a strong foundation to build a sky craper". This is exactly what this book is. It helps you build a strong foundation. <p>I got hold of this book when I was in my 4th Semester of my BS in computer science (1994 - 2nd Edition of this book) to clear my Database concepts exam. Ever since, whenever I feel I might not have understood some concept, I go back to this book. <p>One thing you got to understand is, its not a book that you can just read through and tell people that you have understood the concepts. You need to work the book.<p>Rgds,<br>Naveen<br>IBM DB2 UDB Certified Specialist.</span>

                    <span>I've read both this one and "DATABASE SYSTEMS: A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND MANAGEMENT" (Connolly/Begg), and the latter is by far the best. Some ideas that takes a few seconds to grasp Connollys book, took me about a half an hour to grasp in this one (which I noticed when I tried to refresh my memory). The reason is that it is written in a sometimes incredibly difficult and complex way. Why? For no good reason at all, as far as I can see. The descriptions are not any more "rigorous" or "exact", they are just difficult without gaining anything. The ideas are the same.<p>Avoid it, unless you want to waste you time with a book that makes learning 10 times slower than with a good one.</span>

                    <span>This was the required book for the Databases class at the University of Utah Computer Science department. It is a good book if you want to learn the theory behind databases. If you want to actually learn about practical information then pickup "The Practical SQL Handbook" by Bowman and others.  Also note that the E-R diagrams Silberschatz uses is not widely used. I found the book to be poorly written. Buy this book only if you need it for school.</span>

                    <span>Too simplistic and way below computer science level. Good for an average user, who just wants to learn the concepts and theories but not going to actually create a database! It's all theories and theories and theories!<br>I sure know what a "primary key" is or what "relationships" are and how many kinds exist, etc, etc ...  but it didn't really teach me how to create it.  Just one or two vague examples, that's all.</span>

                    <span>I found 4th edition of this book quite informative for a database programmer. It discusses how database works internally. It includes topics on data storage, B Tree, query processing, query optimization, parallel database, distributed database, web databases etc. However, the language should have been more comprehensive. Examples should be more.</span>
