                    <span>Although I have been a follower of XP and have read David Astels works before, I was initially apprehensive on reading another book on XP programming.<P>One of the goals of XP is to be succinct and iterative - ironically I had difficulty finding XP books that had followed the goals of XP. My assumption is that many of the books have been rushed to publication.<P>"Practical Guide to XP" has many more plusses than minuses. There are actual hands-on examples, with code. About a quarter of the book is devoted to test and source code from an XP project. I am normally not a big fan of having complete source code from a project in a book - aside from making the book heavier it generally serves little purpose. In this particular case, it makes sense as the processes of XP can be "followed through". XP is a development process/philosophy - as such it is better for newcomers to follow an actual implementation to fully appreciate the concepts. <P>This book will help somewhat to clear the fog on the many views on XP. XP, like all development methodologies, is a combination of art and science. There will be many views on methods of practicing XP and each project will be unique. This book will help you decide what you need to use for your particular project.<P>Hope this helps - please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.</span>

                    <span>The XP book market is getting increasingly crowded; this book differs from the pack as it walks through examples in an easy to grasp format. The book is geared towards Java developers; this is not a problem per se but non-Java developers should be aware of this. My copy of this book is beaten and worn! <P>I think this is one of the only XP books that links back into Agile Modelling. This is very helpful as XP readers sometimes get the impression that XP throws the baby out with the bathwater; design is still important! <P>Another aspect I liked was the inclusion of quite few photographs; this helps bridge the gap between the words and understanding. If you're seriously interested in using XP you should get this book. <P>Where was this book 2 years ago!</span>

                    <span>No muss, no fuss; just a straightforward exposition of what XP is, and what it is not. If you are wondering what all the fuss over XP is all about, this book won't disappoint you. XP is commonly characterized as "Forget planning, just code!" This book clarifies that misconception, and others. It is really directoed at answering the question "How come XP projects don't collapse in chaos?" After reading this book, XP didn't sound nearly as crazy as it does on the newsgroups.</span>

                    <span>I read this book before I read Extreme Programming explained by Kent Beck and found it very helpful, with plenty of resources.<BR>Anyway I recommend reading other books that deal with the theory of XP or you might not get the whole picture.<P>If you already know XP, but don't know how to start then this is the book for you. It will guide you through a real world example making clear what a story card, team velocity, etc. are.<BR>Needs some more work to make it VERY clear and FULLY understandable.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a good introduction to XP. I feel like I have a solid foundation from which to learn more about this software development approach. It has many good examples and metaphors which help to bring the approach into reality.<P>HOWEVER...this is one of the most poorly written books I have read in a long time. The errata on this thing would be almost as long as the book itself. It seems as though they took the spell-checkers word that it was correct with no real proof-reading. For example, they mixed the words "emersion" and "immersion", "complimentary" and "complementary" and others like this. I have never seen so many run-on sentences in a published book. These sentences are copied word for word out of the book. I'm not making this up. "The release will work, that is, it will pass acceptance tests set forth by the customer during conceptualization." Here's an example of a sentence that passed the spell-checker, but makes no sense. "However, it you know it's a trap, and because..." <P>In conclusion, I wouldn't buy this book until it's in 2nd edition. The publisher has some work to do on this to clean it up and make it worth $29.99.</span>
