                    <span>Well i recived this book as a gift. When i started to reading it i didnt know anythig abaut directx. I must say its a exelent book, it explains everything u need to know abaut d3d. its a great introduction to begginers but is also great for advanced users. It has a part on win programming so u dont need to also know theat before buying, but u need to know c++.</span>

                    <span>I am an applications programmer who was interested in learning graphics API. I was interested in learning something I could use for 3D game development that skipped over the 2D garbage I endure with Javascript. After quite a bit of research on my part I discovered this book. And I enjoyed every page. Very professional for a programming book and very to the point, the author takes on a romp through basic techniques used in DirectX. Granted he stays completely in Direct3D and does not discuss DirectPlay or DirectSound, but this is a beginning DirectX book. He gets you to understand the meat of the subject, 3D. This book covers the essential math you'll need to understand the following chapters. The chapters after that cover vertex buffering, programmable pipeline, vertex shaders, effects framework, transformations, ect. The only thing that wasn't covered, that I was expecting, were the animation functions and charector animations. Other than that it was a fine text. All in all it took me one week to read this book, dedicating about an hour a night. Subsequently I followed up by reading through it again and taking notes. A follow-up book will be required to begin making games of any great substance. This title was a perfect INTRO to the topic of Direct3D.

                    <span>Firstly, let me say that this is a beginner book and even though it says "Game Programming" in the title it doesn't have much to do with game programming.  That said, it still gives you a better head start in game programming than most books that actually do cover game programming (if that makes any sense).
<br />
<br />What I like about the book is that it has almost no coverage of Win32 and COM (there is a good appendix if needed, but you really should get books dedicated to the subject).  The math overview is particulary good simply because the author relates it to Direct3D all the way, so you aren't left to figure out how to implement the theory through the DirectX API.
<br />
<br />The other topics are all solid introductions to the various parts of Direct3D (setting up, lighting, meshes (very good), vertex/index buffers, v/p shaders etc) and a very usable camera class and a nice simple introduction to terrains.
<br />
<br />You certainly aren't going to be able to write an AA title after reading this book but it gives a solid introduction that you can work from, which is sadly lacking in most other books.</span>

                    <span>If you're going to learn Direct3D, GET THIS BOOK.
<br />
<br />I have other books (Beginning Direct3D Game Programming by Engel), and they don't hold a candle to this book.
<br />
<br />Not only does he explain everything you NEED to know, he tells you to look up whatever he doesn't explain within DX's SDK.
<br />
<br />Everything he does in this book has a plan.  The organization is top notch, with the starting point being a primer on how to set up visual studio to compile and run directx programs.  The next step is a math primer which should be mandatory for any book that is about 3D graphics, but apparently other authors would rather spend their time talking about higher level stuff in a beginner's book.
<br />
<br />I have to say that without this book, I would have had a lot tougher time learning Direct3D.</span>

                    <span>So far, i bought 5 directx books. this book, was the first one who realy helped me start writing my own 3D scenes. i love this book because its a small one (400 pages) and focuses only on important things. i always have the dilema when buying a new book: whether to buy a 1000 pages book or a small one like this one. i always pick the bigger one and i always seem to be wrong. you should always start withg small beginners books and continue to the larger ones.
<br />anyway this book helped me alot and today im ready for the big ones.
<br />one thing about the source code: sometimes it takes a lot of effort to run it under vc++6. personaly, after struggeling with the vc++6 compiler, i switched to vc++7 and everything was fine.
<br />the book's web site is very good - very friendly. all your questions will be answered by the author and you'll find a lot of extra information.
<br />Buy this book even though you have much larger books at same price. here you'l learn the basics of direct3d (version 9) with much less pain.
<br />cheers!
