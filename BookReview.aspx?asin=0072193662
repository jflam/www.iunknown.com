                    <span>This is a very good Java book for not only the certification exam but also the one which helps you to get clear concept. I have experience in programming Java and now decide to go certified. I do feel this book help me quite a lot in the exam preparation. It serves as a very good review for the Java knowledges I have. The price of the book is also very nice. I can say that you get far more than you paid. One thing I would like to mention is this book probably a little bit tough for the newbies. If you are new to Java and do not have much OOP experience, I will not recommand you this one. Although most of comments here are negative, I still want to give this book a high rating.</span>

                    <span>This book is only worth purchasing as a doorstop<p>There are numerous errors in the test areas.  The result is that you can not determine whether or not you are indeed prepared.  It will waste your time to use these materials; to speak much less of your money!</span>

                    <span>I have been working with Java for 4 years now and decided to finally get certified.  <p>I decided to go against my instinct and not read amazon's reviews before purchasing the book.  It was a terrible decision.  <p>There are so many errors in the testing sections of this book, that I will most likely have to pay more money and get another book just to straighten my mind out.  Examples of this include things where the author suggests you choose 3 out 5 possible answers for a multiple choice question, and then only lists 2 correct answers in the solutions.  Now granted this inhumane struggle is a great way to learn the langauge, but isn't that what I paid the author to do in the first place?<p>Do not waste your time on this or other passport books.</span>

                    <span>What's Good:<br>1. Gives you good overview of what to expected on the exam.<br>2. Questions at the end of each chapter and their answers (not all answers are clear but overall it's acceptable).<br>3. Quick summary at the end of each chapter. <p>What's Bad:<br>1. Tons of errors. Just look at the book's webpage. The lack of professionalism on the publisher's part is quite evident. Let me put it this way, if I had know it had this much errors prior to purchasing this book, I wouldn't have purchased it.<p>2. Very weak in area's where explanation IS necessary. It really annoys the hell out of you after a while. This is definitely not a book for beginners, but even if you are an expert some statements in the book will make you say "huh, what the heck are they talking about?"<br>3. The accompanying CD is worthless! Just go to "JavaRanch.com/maha" for mock exams.<p>What's Ugly:<br>1. The book's index is just horrible! You can hardly find what you are looking for even though something pertaining to it is discussed in the book.<br>2. No glossary. What's an exam book without a glossary? The book make's it nearly impossible to do last minute check on things you don't fully comprehend. If the back of the book index was good the lack of a glossary would have been acceptable but it isn't.<p>I would recommend that you go to your local library and check it out rather than purchase it. You definitely shouldn't rely on this book alone to prepare you for the exam.</span>

                    <span>The contents of the book are OK if you already know Java and want to quickly brush up. There is too much assumed to just pick this book up as your first Java certification book. My major complaint is that there are numerous errors in the question and answers and on the CD's practice exam which is the main reason for buying. It is very frustrating to look at a list of answers and feel that none of them are correct or to look for a third when only two are - you find yourself doubting your knowledge and then, doubting the rest of the book's contents.</span>
