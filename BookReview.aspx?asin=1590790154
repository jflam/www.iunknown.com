                <span id="Label1">Business guru Verne Harnish's firm Gazelles has brought hundreds of businesses to fast-growth profitability. Now he shares entrepreneurial secrets in this must-read business primer. Harnish has discovered John D. Rockefeller's underlying strategy. Further study uncovered three winning habits:  <P>*Priorities: A few rules remain consistent with a firm's core values and long-term goal. Others change regularly -- what Harnish calls the Top 5 and Top 1 of 5.   <P>*Data: Key metrics should be measured over time (Smart Numbers); short-term metrics provide a tighter focus on an aspect of the business (Critical Numbers).   <P>*Rhythm: A well-organized set of meetings keep everyone aligned and accountable.  <P>In addition to case studies, a bonus chapter co-authored by Rich Russakoff reveals winning tactics to get banks in competition to finance your business venture. MASTERING THE ROCKEFELLER HABITS provides necessary tools for making strategically smart decisions and for  keeping everyone aligned and accountable to those decisions.</span>

                    <span>For any entrepreneur who is planning on growing their company, Mastering the Rockefeller Habits is the one book to read. Use this as a manual, I have, and it has made all the difference in the world. It's practical, intelligent, and easy to read and follow.</span>

                    <span>I am delighted with Mastering the Rockefeller Habits-it exceeded my expectations. As one familiar with Verne Harnish's background and experience, I was expecting a no-nonsense, to-the-point, application-oriented book of immediate value to entrepreneurs. This is there in spades. What I found above and beyond this was a plan of action complete with tools applicable for any size organization or function within a company attempting significant change. The non-profit I research and write for is tasked with helping product-centered companies transition to services-led businesses. The opportunities and roadblocks that Harnish lays out for the small, fast-growth company are almost identical to the issues and obstacles found in the start-up businesses trying to incubate in large corporate parents. Therefore, the principles and tools found in Mastering the Rockefeller Habits align perfectly with the needs of those organizations trying to create new, fast growth services business inside their corporations, no matter their size. Foundation of both research and experience, easy to read, and immediate application. I am recommending this book to all our constituents.</span>

                    <span>It doesn't get more straighforward than this. Unlike other jargon-filled business books, Mr. Harnish speaks directly to business owners and executives in clear, concise, easy-to-implement language.<P>This is a "How-To Manual" for anyone intent on growing an enduring enterprise. This is not for "get-rich-quick" business owners.<P>Mr. Harnish has helped us triple our revenue in the past 4 years buy applying the lessons in this book along with the lessons learned at his Rockefeller Habits Seminar. All employees must read this book and take his course.<P>If you don't implement the ideas in this book, I believe you are short-changing your customers, employees, and shareholders.</span>

                    <span>If you're trying to get your company to the next level then this is the book for you. I'm a CEO of a small 48 person business services company that does lead generation for the complex sale. Our company had grown 95% every year for five years and made the Inc 500 so I thought I had things figured out...until our growth hit the wall.<P>The biggest value I got from this book was reducing my 100 page strategic plan to just 2 simple pages. Verne calls it the "Planning Pyramid"<P>You can down load the Planning Pyramid yourself at www.gazelles.com. Also, there's an online course (still in beta) and it's free visit http://www.teamcarney.com/gazelles/<P>I followed each chapter step that he laid out... values, vision, BHAG, sandbox, annual and quarterly goals, critical numbers, milestones and objectives. <P>We've now set a clear vision and our entire team knows our critical numbers which has resulted better communication, honesty, accountability and ultimately teamwork. I'm pleased to say that we've broken through to the next level and I give credit to this book for helping me get my strategy in order. <P>Bottom line: The book is worth the investment.</span>

                    <span>Planning is everything. Our company used to be great at developing plans - we had grand plans, plans we'd worked on for months, and plans for our plans. We were planning experts. But we couldn't implement. Our plans sat in fancy binders and we pulled them out to look at them periodically, felt better because we had them, and couldn't figure out why things weren't happening like we'd planned. <BR> <BR>Then we read Mastering the Rockefeller Habits. And we found we could actually implement the plans that we learned how to develop from the methods and techniques defined in the book. We now have plans that work. And our company has matured tremendously as an organization from following the book. I strongly recommend that any company, from young start-up to those more mature, read and implement the strategies in this book. It will change your world.</span>
