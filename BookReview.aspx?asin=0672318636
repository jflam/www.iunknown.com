                    <span>The title says that you'll learn ASP 3.0 in 21 days, but you'll learn so much more! You'll learn how to write your code so that you or a co-worker can expand or change it years later; how to use business objects (and Microsoft's built in objects); how to design multi-page projects for maximum efficiency; how to read and write from a database; and, most importantly, when using a certain method (such as connecting to a database) is most helpful and when it's a resource-wasting idea.<P>This book has its own support forum linked off of the 4guysfromrolla.com webpage so that Scott Mitchell and millions of 4guysfromrolla.com fans can provide you with help if a code example isn't working. ASP and ASP.NET folks seem to be the happiest 'been-there, debugged that' programming community on the web, so don't be shy.<P>If you want to build interactive applications, but your servers aren't running Microsoft.NET or a similar runtime, this book is for you. If you want to learn how to make cool webpages, this is your book. Learn VBScript in a browser-independent format? Buy the book. It's just that good!</span>

                    <span>The book helped me make the transition from an HTML hack to an ASP coder. I have been working with HTML, JavaScript and Perl since 1994, and a year ago, I became involved in a project that required learning ASP quickly. I purchased this book along with Active Server Pages for Dummies and Beginning ASP, and this one was by far the best. It says 21 Days, but working around the clock, I got through the book in about a week. <P>If you are a web developer, this book explains 95 percent of the stuff you need to know - like how to set up database connections (DNS and DNS-less), how to code pages to add, update and delete items from a database, how to use the many VBScript functions in ASP, ASP components, and a great chapter on debugging ASP. (Every code example in the book works!)<P>There are only a few minor shortfalls, like there is nothing on how-to add password protection, security, and the database examples are primarily based on Access rather than SQL Server, but this information is freely available on the web and shouldn't stop anyone from buying this book. Even though it has been months since I worked through the tutorials, I still find myself using it several times a week as a reference.<P>This book has helped add ASP to my programming skills and it ranks among the top five computer books that I have purchased.</span>

                    <span>...and a great reference for the advanced programmers.<P>This was the first ASP book I bought when I began to learn the language two years ago. It has an excellent tutorial methodology to it which is very easy to comprehend. It is also well written by two guys that know what they're talking about! (You can visit their web site at 4guysfromrolla.com)<P>Even though I have since purchased several other books on the subject (hoping to expand my knowledge base), I continue to find myself referring back to this one. Granted, this book is certainly not the be-all for Active Server Pages, and I have not found one that is, however, it is by far the one to begin with and hang on to.<P>FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY! I definitely recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>Excellent stuff if you are a beginner.<BR>For advanced junta, there are other hard-core books on ASP, forget this one. <P>Actually this book is only for beginners. If you know nothing about ASP then this one is for you. I am not sure that you will be able to do any advanced scripting with this one, but if you are a newcomer to scripting world or ASP then this is the ultimate choice. <P>Everything is explained in a simple manner. Starting from the basics of ASP to VBScript, Objects - Session, Server etc, File System Object and to Databases, everything is explained keeping "beginners woes" in mind.<BR>There are lots of examples that help you to grasp the VBScript and ASP.<P>Must buy for a beginner.<P>If you want to enter ASP, then this is the first step. GO GET IT !!!.</span>

                    <span>This book is epitome of how all textbooks should be written. This is the kind of book I am used to getting from SAMS publishing. <P>You can tell the authors took their time and did not appear to be trying to beat a deadline as one of SAMS other books I purchased recently. <P>If you do not know ASP read this book and you will be very, very comfortable with it when you are done. This book makes you want to start coding web pages immediately. You just want to wallpaper the Internet with your ASP pages.</span>
