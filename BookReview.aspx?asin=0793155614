                    <span>Anyone considering purchasing this book is likely to be a marketing or business professional, and has probably already read many other books that turned out to be marketing 101, re-hashed. Well, if you are looking for some true inspiration and useful tactics for your own business or industry, you've found the right book. In Creating Customer Evangelists, Jackie and Ben present their theory, six tenets and case studies in just the way that will get you pumped to be your own company's evangelist. <P>For example, I loved being reminded of the oft-ignored opportunity of having suggestions and ideas filter through the company from the top down (as in the book's case studies of Mark Cuban, Dallas Mavericks, Maxine Clark, Build-A-Bear Workshops, and Colleen Barrett, Southwest Airlines). With the head of the company showing an interest (often reading all the customer email or snail mail they receive) and assigning follow-through, the company's employees can more fully understand and participate in the company's directive. When that's the case, authentic change and continual upgrades in customer experience are sure to follow. In theory, "bottom up" filters should also work, but if someone on the sales floor of the chain athletic supply store in Bozeman, MT, has a customer idea to share with the company president, there's much more chance the suggestion will fall by the wayside as it fights its way upstream. <P>Fortune 500 companies might not realistically be able to put such a program into place, but they can certainly set up a system that works almost as well - like creating "customer evangelist" positions within their company and giving that person/team true and direct access to the ear of the CEO. For the many more of us who aren't operating within such huge corporate bodies, the possible rewards seem worth the effort when you look at the successes covered in Creating Customer Evangelists. Buy this book and see the possibilities for evangelizing your company in a whole new light.</span>

                    <span>What an incredible book. After reading this book, you realize the impact you have on your friends and family and you will want to be an evangelist for more products and services. The case studies in this book also show that it's not about investing millions of dollars in a marketing campaign - but about using a little creativity and personality to give your customers a feeling of excitement in buying your product or service so they will WANT to spread the word about your offering.<P>This book is excellent - not only as a must read for businesses but for anyone who buys anything. Everyone is an evangelist for something, but this book really makes you realize the benefits of your evangelism - and it makes you want to be an evangelist for more products, services and people. From a business perspective, it shows you how other companies have provided an atmosphere for growing evangelists - do you know how you are growing customer evangelists in your organization? Read the book - and I guarantee you will get ideas on how to create these relationships with your customers.</span>

                    <span>What does it take to get your customers to see the light, to praise your product like evangelists selling their creeds? How do you create customer evangelists whose word of mouth will convert other acolytes to your product? Authors Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba offer chapter and verse. They tell you how to encourage customers to preach your message for you. However, before consumers will take to the pulpit, you must have an excellent product or service that converts their thinking. There's good information here, though not much new. The last chapter sums everything up as nicely as a homily, and the appendix provides additional tips on e-mail marketing and jump-starting the evangelical process. The authors' penchant for name-coining adds little; at best it's confusing and at worst downright annoying ("word of mouse" is cute, but "Napsterizing"? "Customer Plus-Delta"?). We are is glad to see someone preaching the cause of being customer-oriented - we're already pretty faithful about that.</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure how to put this... Ben and Jackie just "get it" when it comes to not only customer service, but business as a whole. I've never actually read a book before that made me speak to it out loud like it was a person. Every chapter I was saying things like "Brilliant!" and "Wow! Now that's what businesses should be doing". Smiling through the entire book, it not only talked about the concept of it, but gave great examples and THEN tells YOU how to do it in your business. Pure genius. Just buy it, period.</span>

                    <span>It seems fitting to be writing a review to evangelize a book written on the topic of making evangelists out of your customers. I can't help but think after reading Creating Customer Evangelists, "how can I let as many people as possible know how wonderful this book is!"<P>I'd venture a guess that many of you reading this review have delved into a lot of business books in your lifetime. I'm sure that the best of intentions were taken into each book, only to find out that ½ way through the majority of them, they had lost their relevance and hadn't delivered on their promise. I mean, really, how many books about marketing can possibly have any really interesting and immediately helpful ideas? <P>While CCE is not a fiction thriller, it will keep you as engaged as any good novel would, because at it's heart, it tells a lot of great short stories, and it tells them with insight and conviction. The book follows a "case study" approach and illustrates a world-class case example of a company doing CE right in each chapter. And, unlike those feel-good business books about how breakthrough something is that leave you hanging with no action items, CCE includes a full set of appendices on how you, yes you and your business, can get going on your CE efforts.<P>The book lays out the process of creating customer evangelists in the following order:<BR>1.	Customer Plus-Delta (you need to be continuously gathering customer feedback)<BR>2.	Napsterize Your Knowledge (share and share alike, and freely, and not cheap crap either - put some good material out there!)<BR>3.	Build the Buzz (find the WOM networks in your industry and tap into them, not blatantly, but intelligently. Oh, and give to get. See principle #2)<BR>4.	Create Community (encourage your customers to mingle, either physically or virtually - build a coalition of customers around your cause)<BR>5.	Make Bite-Size Chunks (devise specialized, smaller offerings to get your customers to bite) The software industry uses this tactic with abandon. When's the last time you bought software w/ out a trial download?<BR>6.	Create a Cause (focus on making your world, industry, community, and company a better place because you were involved)<P>These are easy enough principles to understand, but NOT_EASY_TO_EMBRACE. How many of you are prepared to "Napsterize" what you know to everyone in and around your industry? Really, how many? Do your marketing managers actually "participate" in the industry and community, or are you all a bunch of bystanders.<P>Creating customer evangelists is about more than "implementing a few best-practices", this is not six-sigma, but there are ways to measure, and Ben & Jackie have an entire appendix devoted to those to!<P>Are you ready to embrace your best customers as customer evangelists? Get the book - get the culture!</span>
