                <span id="Label1">When T.J. Wray lost her 43-year-old brother, her grief was deep and enduring and, she soon discovered, not fully acknowledged. Despite the longevity of adult sibling relationships, surviving siblings are often made to feel as if their grief is somehow unwarranted.  After all, when an adult sibling dies, he or she often leaves behind parents, a spouse, and even children&#8212;all of whom suffer a more socially recognized type of loss.<br><br>Based on the author's own experiences, as well as those of many others, <b>Surviving the Death of a Sibling</b> helps adults who have lost a brother or sister to realize that they are not alone in their struggle.  Just as important, it teaches them to understand the unique stages of their grieving process, offering practical and prescriptive advice for dealing  with each stage.<br><br>In <b>Surviving the Death of a Sibling</b>, T.J. Wray discusses:<br><br>&#8226; Searching for and finding meaning in your sibling's passing<br>&#8226; Using a grief journal to record your emotions<br>&#8226; Choosing a grief partner to help you through tough times<br>&#8226; Dealing with insensitive remarks made by others<br><br>Warm and personal, and a rich source of useful insights and coping strategies, <b>Surviving the Death of a Sibling</b> is a unique addition to the literature of bereavement.</span>

                    <span>From the very first sentence, I was awestruck, mesmerized. I could not put this book down. TJ's heartfelt candor brought me on a journey of soulful insight and greater appreciation of what my daughters experienced in the loss of their older sister, Jackie; an event, forever blemishing their cherished sisterhood. Surviving the Death of a Sibling has helped to soothe their wounds, leading them on a path of healing and peace. It is a must read.</span>

                    <span>Thank heavens I found TJ Wray's website and that it brought me to her book.<P>After the loss of my 29 year old brother to cancer, I did the best I could to "deal with it". I was fortunate to have support, many do not. Unfortunately, when I started to feel more depressed about his death 2 years after, I was concerned that I was slipping into a clinical depression. The more I worried that I was "losing it", the sadder I became. <P>Ms. Wray's observations about her own loss helped me to realize that my feelings were not unique. I was not going crazy and it allowed me the time to work through them. Grief sometimes comes in waves and this book is like a boat on top of those waves....you can still feel the rocking motion, but you no longer feel like you are drowning.</span>

                    <span>On March 17, 2004 my younger and only sibling, lost her battle with the most vile, aggressive, and nasty cancer in medical books. I was her primary caregiver and we had made a pledge when she was diagnosed in June 2003 that we WOULD BEAT THIS. Through 5 rounds of chemotherapy, radiation, and even surgery, her doctors fought to save her life but her oncologist had also told us from the beginning that unless he could get her cancer under "control" - not remission - that she would get very sick, very fast. And she did.<P>The morning my sister passed away I was with her and two of her treatment nurses came in the hospital room to offer condolences. Both also were sobbing, as the bond between my sister, me and the medical staff can, and DID become extremely close and intense. "Joan" insisted that *I* read Ms. Wray's book and also insisted that she, herself, would purchase it for me. She brought it to me during my sister's wake and I have been reading it for the last 3 weeks. It has been such a comfort.......Ms. Wray speaks as if she were in my home with me...... and most of all what Ms. Wray and every other person who has experienced an adult sibling loss is mentioned in this book say is exactly what I am now feeling. I also know what is to come, and yes, I HAVE been pushed aside as the grief of my elderly parents and my sister's only daughter seems more important to others than my grief as a sibling. <P>Not so, with Ms. Wray, and I highly recommend this book to any surviving sibling. It is getting me through and while I know I have a long and lonely way to go, with Ms. Wray's help and those who also told of their own stories in Ms. Wray's book, I know I will.</span>

                    <span>I lost my older brother Jose in October of 2002 after a 3 month battle with a brain tumor. The shock that such a healthy, athletic, and fit man of 46, in the prime of his life would be so cruely taken away so quickly from his two girls and family was devestating. The realization that no one really comprehends the depth of this loss to his little brother (33) at the time, who looked up to him his whole life, was disheartening UNTIL Ms. Wray's book. I found this book spoke to my heart and understood my deep sense of loss. I found myself underlining passages upon passages where it felt that the personal stories in the book captured feelings that I've gone through during my brother's illness and since his passing. The comfort that this book has provided was most welcome. I know reading this book has helped to begin healing what is very much a recent and profound wound. Grief is a process they say -- with a "disenfranchised loss" of a dear brother or sister, this book is a wonderful aid on the road to healing and hopefully, one day, peace.</span>

                    <span>My eldest brother died a number of years ago in a very tragic accident, and I still feel pain every day when I wake up. My friend found this book and gave it to me to help ease the pain and depression. I read the first review by Devon Hanahan and I agree 100-percent. Ms. Wray writes in a style that makes you feel that she is sitting right next to you reading the book aloud. Nobody can ever totally get over the death of someone so close as a sibling, but Ms. Wray's book makes a huge difference.</span>
