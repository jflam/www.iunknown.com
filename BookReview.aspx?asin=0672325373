                    <span>I am a part time programmer, making the transition from Access VBA to VB.Net. I don't have time to code in notepad and want to use all the productivity tools available (read Visual Studio 2003). This book gave me the basics for text boxes, combo boxes (big differences) etc. and provided good real world examples. Also the downloaded code worked and was easy to follow.
<br />Great job.</span>

                    <span>Great introduction to VB .NET and the Visual Studio IDE. I am a novice MS Access developer migrating to Visual Studio .NET. This books is an excellent quick start for devloping with VB .NET. But don't expect to get in depth. It's just a primer, but well worth it if that's what you need. You will need to continue learning with other books. Also, the DVD-ROM 60 day trial version of Visual Studio is great. I'm going to buy the full version when done.</span>

                    <span>Every once in a long while, a great book comes along that forces even someone like me to post a public opinion. This book unlike a lot of other "great" books takes you step by step and actually show you "HOW it is done" and not just tell you what you are to do.<p>After trying another VB.NET Beginners book that was highly touted on the internet I almost gave up.<p>I came accross this book on the shelf of Borders just by chance<br>and what a pleasure, pure pleasure.<p>This is a sample of how these kinds of books should be written<p>THANKS MR. FOXALL !!!!!!!!</span>

                    <span>If you just starting out with VB.net then this is a good book to start out with. A well written book that keeps your interest and presents its subject matter in a straightforward, easy to understand manor. Each lesson builds on the previous lesson enabling the beginner to get a grasp of the subject matter quickly and easily as well as build a good foundation for more advanced books. Excellent book for the beginner.</span>
