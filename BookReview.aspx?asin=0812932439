                <span id="Label1">"There really is a Jerry Maguire. Only he's not some schlumpf struggling to make it on a wing and a prayer like Tom Cruise in the movie. . . . His name is Leigh Steinberg, and he's been cultivating a choirboy image for twenty years. He also happens to be the pre-eminent sports agent of our time."<P>--San Francisco Examiner Magazine<P>"This is a book about the process of negotiation.   Which means that this is a book about life."<P>Leigh Steinberg is the premier agent in sports. He has negotiated over $2 billion in contracts for the athletes he represents--who include Troy Aikman, Steve Young, Drew Bledsoe, Kordell Stewart, and Warren Moon--but he has also spent twenty-four years as a sports agent living by a strict personal and professional code of ethics. Steinberg's philosophy of ethical dealings and responsibility is well known in the sports world--and well known to moviegoers as well, because Steinberg's way of doing business was a model for Cameron Crowe's wildly successful film Jerry Maguire and the "manifesto" of business ethics that was the premise of the film.<br><br>Steinberg has always believed that negotiation is about more than the bottom line: the most successful business dealings are not always the ones that pay the most; they are about balance, perspective, objectivity, and values. A success in business must also be a success in one's own life. And in his book, Steinberg shares the secrets of successful negotiation, breaking the process down into the essential steps, from "Orientation" through "Making the Deal," and giving step-by-step practical and inspirational advice that will get any two people or parties, in any situation, to come to terms.<br><br>Full of great inside sports stories and characters, <B>Winning with Integrity</B> is an intelligent, insightful, and inspiring guide to the art of negotiation in business and in life--from the most successful businessman in sports.<P>"It's fashionable now, after the movie, for a lot of agents to talk about heart, but Leigh was the only one talking like that in 1993, when I began research."<P>--Cameron Crowe, director of Jerry Maguire<br></span>

                    <span>Winning with Integrity  is a great self help guide for the Jerry Maguire to be. The author helps the reader to realize that it is all in negotiating. Whether it is how successful you are in life to life in general if you cannot negotiates well, you'll go nowhere.<br>Even though the author does seem a bit self absorbed the reader is able to see how negotiating well will help you get ahead. Leigh Steinberg has negotiated more than 1 billion dollars in contracts for the athletes he represents famous athletes such as, Troy Aikman and Kordell Stewart he also spent 24 years as a sports agent living by his own strict moral rules. Mostly everyone in the "sports world" knows of Steinberg and they follow his moral standards. He was the inspiration for the film Jerry Maguire, "SSHHHOOOWWW MMEEEEE TTHHHEEEE MMMOOONNNEEEYYYY!!!!!''</span>

                    <span>This book is pretty much a joke.  There are some useful points on negotiating, but by and large the author goes out of his way to pat himself on the back for his career success.  Obviously Leigh Steinberg has plenty of lessons to teach aspiring negotiators, agents, etc., but a more even approach--i.e. listing actually conflicts or problems (as opposed to those that amazingly Leigh resolved through sheer brilliance and perseverance)--would have made for much better reading.</span>

                    <span>For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. Leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a real treasure and entertaining at the same time.  And best of all, you don't need to be a sports fan to appreciate the examples Steinberg uses.<p>It is a shame that some readers have found this book shallow and only written to brag about his exploits.  They are missing the real point of the book and the positive outcomes that can happen from true negotiating, not just getting what you want.  If you are looking for a book on 'How to be Persuasive and Always get What you Want', this is not your book. <p>Rather, it helped me build a solid mental foundation and framework  when I enter negotiations.  Also, you need to have the right attitude when you enter negotiations.  This book will help you.<p>There are some remarkable examples that provided me with some real insights on perceptions.  It opened my eyes that the world I see is not what everyone else sees.  With his examples, I began to see how that applies to the business world as well.<p>I own a company that provides HR and OD consulting and I get emails EVERY day about hostile work environments.  In many cases I refer them to this book to make sure their perception of the problem is on track with the problematic person.  <p>If you are looking at this book for ANY reason, I suggest you buy it.  Also, because of all the famous people involved in the negotiations, it was an easy read.</span>

                    <span>This is a refreshing book, that counters WINNING THROUGH INTIMIDATION type books, that portray the business world as a jungle, where you have to negotiate with knives drawn. Steinberg practices integrity in his business  life, and in his personal life. Steinberg actually lives down the street  from me (although I don't know him), and he does wonderful things for the  local community, that seem to come from the heart, rather than from a  chance to be seen publicly as a benefactor, and pat himself on the back. He  is in inspiration. And a nice guy who finished first!</span>
