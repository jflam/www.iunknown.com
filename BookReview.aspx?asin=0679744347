                    <span>I enjoyed this book, even though it is heavy on legal court cases.  Don't let that fool you, though, it's not a legal reference.  This book covers significant cases in privacy using a very interesting approach.  There a interviews and behind-the-scenes stories that explain what happened, how the plaintiff felt, and what the outcome was.  
<br />
<br />If you liked this book you will love "The Digital Umbrella."  It is a great compliment to this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is written by a couple of lawyers who specialize in privacy issues. It is essentially a collection of thoughly researched court cases with added commentary from the authors. As such, it reads like...well... a collection of court cases.<p>A copy was originally lent to me by a very well-read and intelligent friend of mine who considered it overly dry. I, on the other hand, loved it. It's very details-oriented from cover-to-cover and packs in a wealth of information that is invaluable to anyone interested in the legal aspects of privacy.</span>

                    <span>Since I was a child I wondered what Caroline Kennedy would write about should she become a writer. Thanks to all whom have help bring about finding out. <br>I chose this book to rate as I see so many books written by others that are destroying their subjects names, lives, and reputations.</span>

                    <span>Although the word "privacy" does not appear in the United States Constitution, most Americans believe that their right to privacy is not just legally protected but fundamental to their lives, their way of living, and this country's democratic system. Abstract and difficult to define, privacy is nonetheless perceived as one of our most basic and coveted rights.<p> But is it? How well are we protected? And what, exactly, are we protected from?<p> Through a seamless interweaving of landmark cases, lesser - known but equally important trial decisions, and dozens of anecdotal narratives, Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy, authors of the best - selling In Our Defense, make an urgent and complicated issue more absorbing and accessible than ever before. In thier hands, we can finally see the law translated into relevant human experience.<p> The Right to Privacy delves into six general areas: Privacy versus Law Enforcement, Privacy and Your Self, Privacy versus The Press, Privacy versus The Voyeur, Privacy in the Workplace, and Privacy and Information. Can you refuse to comply when a police officer asks to look through your luggage? Is there anything you can do to prevent all those computerized data banks from filling up with more and more personal information about you? Can television cameras follow a breaking news story right into your home? Does your boss have a right to know that you are homosexual? a smoker? dating a co - worker? Who is entitled to make life - or - death decisions for someone who is no longer able to do so? Legally,the answer to each of these questions revolves around the right to privacy.<p> We live in a society in which our right to privacy is much discussed, misunderstood, and, in many cases, seriously threatened. The Right to Privacy will enrich the discussion, shed light on many of the misunderstandings, and illuminate the real - life, everyday impact of one of the most important issues of our time.</span>

                    <span>Dear Ms. Alderman and Ms. Kennedy, thank you so much for taking the time to write this enlightening and extremely important book. Living in a society where privacy rights are trampled upon in excess with lack of concern for dignity, ethics, and human empathy, I applaud you both for your diligence and your efforts in expanding public knowledge and awareness on this topic. Hopefully there will be more and more legislation undertaken to adress the concerns specifically noted in your book. What an overwhelming project that would be... and what an important one...oh yes and my guides just stated you know where to begin first..love you, they say :) Sending much love and light..God Bless, I will remain... Anonymous.</span>
