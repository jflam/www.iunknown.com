                    <span>What Cameron does best is explaining "why?", as in "why is my bike designed the way it is?". If you want a service manual or a quick suspension setup ("3 klicks of preload, seven of rebound") guide for your make and model, look elsewhere. 
<br />
<br />Cameron explains every facet of sportbike technology (engine, brakes, suspension, tyres, etc. etc.) by showing the general principles that dictate why it has evolved like it has, and how the same principles shaped the racetrack creations of past decades. If there would be an updated edition covering also the most recent developments (EFI mapping, radial brakes, etc.) I'd buy it, but even this edition covers completely  95% of the sportbikes out there, and 95% of this book applies to all sportbikes. Plus Cameron's writing has a delightful dry wit that never lets you forget that the ultimate key to fast lap times is not in tweaking and tuning and spending $$$, but that the biggest lap time improvements come from learning to ride better.</span>

                    <span>I received this book today.  Gave it a quick look through and it seems to be just what I wanted.  I don't want a book that says do this and that to your bike, I need something that give me the theory and lets me plan it myself.  I have been building and restoring bikes for 5 years and basic performance is not a problem for me.  I am building a CBR600 from the ground up this winter and need to know what to do and what not to do to keep it reliable, but add a good kick.  <br>This book seems to have lots of pics and drawings that explain how to tweak the entire bike to your needs.  Goes far beyond bolt on and shows just about everything under the sun you could do.  does talk about bolt on products for beginners though.   Looking forward to reading the entire thing this weekend.</span>

                    <span>Well, I was looking for something to read along with my new Clymer's guide, thinking that in addition to just the basics about my bike I'd be well served to understand performance issues.  This book is probably GREAT for people planning track days, who have a lot of self-service experience under their belt, but for a beginner to the mechanics of motorcycles the information is SO advanced it's basically useless.<p>Good stuff to learn, and I'm keeping the book because I figure by *next* year I'll be saving $$ for track days.  Just too much for "all I wanted to know was how to gap my frikken plugs properly!" me.<p>I give it 3 stars as what I read was fairly clear, and the diagrams did seem to accompany the text well enough for me to realize I was WAY OVER MY HEAD.  ;)</span>

                    <span>Despite the misleading cover, this is a wonderfully compiled book of all things related to how a motorcycle handles. I passed over this book several times because the cover made me think it was a book on how to do wheelies and stupid sportbike stunts.  I could not have been more wrong. This is a must have book for anybody who likes to wrench on their motorcycle in the garage and wants to improve upon the design without making things worse. Cameron is brilliant at explaining the physics of how and why a motorcycle behaves the way it does without having to delve into the intricate mathematical equations so commonly found in books of this nature.</span>

                    <span>This book really changed everything for me with regard to motorcycle performance. Before reading this book I (like most other people) thought that motorcycle tuning was just a question of upgrading say airfilter, jetting and a louder pipe and of you go. What this book teaches is that the world is not that simple. A bike is a system of interrelated parts and you can't just change one of the parts and expect good results. Even if you do the tuning right there is still a price to be paid in performance. You want top end? Be prepared to sacrifice the lower end and the reliability. It's all about what you want from your bike.<p>In the end the book changed my focus from engine tuning to suspension and brakes and I really love the result. The above-mentioned mods was what I originally intended and would have destroyed the trait of my bike that I love the most. A killer torque straight from the bottom and up.</span>
