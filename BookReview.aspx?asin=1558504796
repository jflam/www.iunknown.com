                    <span>I thought that this book was a good read because i have been a customer for Nike for many years now and so I got more information on how the company started and etc. But i did not like how Nike used poor labor to make their shoes and how they sell the shoes for more than they are made for. But anyways this was a good book to read on a powerful company.</span>

                    <span>I think the book was ok it wasn't the best book I ever read.  It shows how a small company like nike how it came from a small shoe company in the 70's to a big athltic shoe indutry.</span>

                    <span>After reading this fascinating account, I am somewhat dumbfounded by some reviewers who didn't find any real corporate insights here.  There are plenty, especially the spirit of the place, which one quickly realizes is the heart and soul.<p>Bookcased by Air Jordan's entry and retire, Katz in good prose that flows well style relates how a middle-distance runner and his coach and eventually some Japanese shoes turned into the giant Swoosh Just Do It corporate wonder.  For those of us from this time in our history, one distinctly remembers the embodiment of that spirit, Prefontaine.<p>You see the dominant style of the venture comes from the playing fields, and many customers for it shoes can feel it, and so they buy it.  Others are caught up in its powerful draft, not understanding at all the athletic side.  Knight does, and he and his company relished it and grew it.  Amazing.  I remember setting right next to a mother and her teenage son, both of us guys trying on cross-training shoes.  Me, non-Nike, and this young kid insisted he would only wear Air Jordan.  The salesman said they didn't have any in that style in his small foot size, the smallest size 2-3 sizes too big.  The salesman said it would be harmful to his feet to wear them, but the kid was incensed to have them on.  And mom gave in.  Stunned, I was.  Then to hear about what kids would do to have these shoes.<p>I relate to all of this as one who never really cared personally for those who stood for the Swoosh ala McEnroe, but respected very much their talent and drive.  That's my response to their history and this fascinating chronicle of it:  I don't really care personally for what they were about, but have great respect for their drive and talent.  You have to give it to them.<p>They ran the great race, up those trudging hills, and through those barriers that all distance runners have to run through.  That great cover photo says it well, does it not!</span>

                    <span>FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE KIND OF BORING, BEFORE READING THIS BOOK I<br>THOUGHT THAT KATZ WOULD TELL THE READERS MORE OF THE<br>BEGINNING OF THE NIKE COMPANY. I WOULD OF HAD A BETTER<br>UNDERSTANDING IF I WOULD OF SEARCH ON THE INTERNET THAN<br>ACTUALLY READING THE BOOK. IT KEPT ON TELLING HOW MICHAEL<br>JORDAN-NIKE RELATIONSHIP. BUT IT DID NOT MENTION ANYTHING THAT<br>GRABBED MY ATTENTION, ONLY WHEN THEY MENTION THE CONDITION<br>WERE THE WORKERS WORK AT, THE SWEATSHOP!!!!</span>

                    <span>This book was kinda hot.  I liked how it stayed on point, unlkike other books.  It inticed me to keep on reading.  THe book was very inciteful on the corporate world and how Nike is runned.  I especially liked how there were a lot of examples and pass references of Michael Jordan and he was "Nike".</span>
