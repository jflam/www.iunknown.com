                <span id="Label1"><P> A memoir of extraordinary depth and searing honesty, <I>In the Ghost Country</I> is the story of Peter Hillary's physical and emotional journey across the icy wastes of Antarctica. A place where the thoughts and memories of a lifetime were called forth by the blank slate of the Antarctic snows -- so real that the ghosts of lost friends and loved ones walked with him in the white maelstrom. <P> In the Antarctic summer of 1998-99, Peter Hillary and two companions skied to the South Pole -- each man pulling a 440-pound sled 900 miles across some of the most forbidding country on earth. The plan was to complete the tragic journey of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, to the Pole and back. But under the pressure of a relentless media spotlight, fatal team chemistry, and food and fuel stores, the expedition fragmented into hostile isolation. Instead of completing Scott's journey, they found they were repeating it.  <P> For Peter Hillary,  this was the loneliest trek of his life. Estranged from his companions, tortured by the sensory deprivation of "the great white everywhere," Hillary's journey became a hallucinogenic pilgrimage through a country where "he could see the dead and the places of the dead": the ghosts of too many friends who had perished at his side in the mountains; and most powerfully, the ghost of his beloved mother, who it seemed "had turned up on the ice to keep me company."  <P> <I>In the Ghost Country</I> is the story of that trip, a chronicle of profound isolation, grief, and loneliness. It is a meditation on a lifetime spent on the edge. Told here are the tragedies: on Ama Dablam in Nepal, a near perfect climb until its shocking finish with an unexpected death; on Makalu where half the party was wiped out; on Everest where two more were lost, including a great friend; and later on K2, in 1995, where Hillary barely survived the storm that killed seven people. <P> But here also are the "marvelous times": Growing up in New Zealand, where the family's holiday adventures were turned into documentaries; first seeing Everest at seven years of age; the near-fatal teenage adventures; working on the schools and hospitals that Sir Edmund built for the Nepalese people; traveling with his father and Neil Armstrong to the North Pole; summiting Everest twice. <P> Informed by a strong literary sensibility, <I>In the Ghost Country</I> is compelling contemplation of adventure and a joyful tribute to "the rapture" of getting "out there" on the edge.</span>

                    <span>I'm the type of traveler who prefers a cabana on the beach to an icy plain hundreds of miles wide, but I have always loved adventure books' potential for exploring the metaphysical extremes of life.<BR> This book does a brilliant job of communicating why some people feel compelled to leave family and friends behind to spend weeks or months in an extreme environment with nothing but an uneasy conscience for company. The language is vivid and provocative, whether describing the eerie landscape through which Hillary treks or evoking the tragedy and comedy inherent in having to pitch an adventure to potential corporate sponsors and in grappling with a famous father's legacy. Best are the passages in which Hillary is left by his companions to cross the ice alone, and is visited by the many ghosts who didn't survive their own treks across the ice or climbs up the mountain. The frequent cuts from Elder's evocative prose to Hillary's matter-of-fact reportage to excerpts from an explorers' guidebook to bits of Sartre provide a multi-dimensional experience that must resemble the actual experience of exploration more closely than most tales of adventure.<BR> I finished this book a couple of months ago, but it still lingers in my imagination. I was so moved by it that I sent copies to several friends. Now all I can do is wait and hope for another book by this duo.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was in Australia recently for business (art dealer) and read two broadsheet newspaper reviews about this book, which I had read before heading Down Under. One said it was a ``must read'' for anyone interested in the adventure game, but ``deserves a much wider audience'' because of its searing psychological insights. It also noted ``the triumph of the book'' lies in the way the two voices complement one another. The other review said Elder (who carries the main narrative) was trying too hard to be original. The book is an original: a duet, where Elder paints the emotiional, historical and physical landscapes and Hillary speaks directly in the voice of someone telling wild tales, giving the feeling that he's right there in your ear. Elder's voice is in plain type, Hillary's in bold. The structure gives the book its pace and deepends its empotional resonance. Perhaps if the publishers had included a note to that effect for people who might struggle to get it -- but personally I don't think it's hard to figure out. If you enjoy literary intelligence, youi'll love the book -- if you like your stories straight up and down maybe you won't.</span>

                    <span>Man oh man. Two journeys -- one a lonely haul to the South Pole, the other a haunting visitation to the past, as ghosts rise up to keep Hillary company. It's a thrilling concept, made more exciting that this is how the brain works under the pressures of social isolation and sensual deprivation. The son of Sir Edmund has certainly spilt his guts here. But the writing is so poetic and evocative much of what could have sunk this book is transcended. Nowhere have I read a better exploration of the interior life -- the mind -- of an adventuring man, or of any man for that matter. Hillary's partner Elder is obviouskly the genius here, not to take anything away from Hillary who has become a surprisingly more forthright writer than he was in his youth -- but it's Elder who has clearly taken the reigns here and through using two voices -- his and Hillary's -- has crafted a masterpiece of form and revelation. Certainly blows the mystique.</span>

                    <span>The buzz in Britain is that this book has broken new ground in writing about the emotional life of a man, in this case an adventuring man, and that it is superbly written. I found the use of two voices worked brilliantly to create clever shifts in pace and to heighten the feeling that Hillary is whispering ion your ear. My husband is a sports addict, and he didn't really get into it. I found it very exciting, and I expect this is one of those books that will sharply divide readers and critics. Anyone worried about wasting their money, can read an excerpt on the Barnes & Noble site. You'll either be intrigued or not.</span>

                    <span>Loved the book overall, felt the writing had a very beautiful rhythm to it, found some of Elder's imagery a little baffling sometimes -- but I have to say that for such a complex piece of work, even for a work of art, it is unforgivable there is no index.
