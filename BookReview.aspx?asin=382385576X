                    <span>Photographer Stefan May has compiled a fine collection of b&w photos that rates high on the scale of eroticism, but [thankfully] falls way short of smut. There's a spontaneity in Mr. May's portrayal of passionate couples, but what's more amazing is the intimacy infused in his work through extreme angles, creative cropping and the depiction of depth and movement. I enjoy this book more every time I pick it up.<P>I'd say that "Couples" falls squarely between the refined artistry of Patrick Demarchelier's "Photographs" and the joyfully haphazard presentation of Sante d'Orazio's "A Private View." Mr. Demarchelier is unsurpassed (my opinion) in "nailing" a photo: perfect pose, perfect angle, perfect exposure, perfect everything. Mr. d'Orazio does a great job of chronicling a glamorous and fun lifestyle. Whereas these two artists (both masters) still leave the viewer somewhat at a distance from their subjects, Mr. May brings us right into the photo with a perspective that can only be had from an involved point of view. Sometimes we're spying ... undetected; other times, we're right in the scene ... point blank, yet ignored; still others, the subjects are looking right at us ... caught in the act. There's movement, there's action, and everywhere there's the sense of erotic touch. Sheer brilliance. The chemistry (yes, those pheromones) of physical attraction is on virtually every page, but nothing about the photography is "dirty" or "in your face." <P>Save for the thickness (it's not), "Couples" is a large format book with coffee table dimensions. The 100+ photos range from 3" x 5" all the way up to fully both pages of the open book. There seems to be an overall randomness to the ordering, front to back, although there are many groupings (with titles) in place to portray photographic "suites" of a suggestive nature. Not surprisingly, the couples are all gorgeous. Not one looks at all posed, i.e., the spontaneity of the photo shoot(s) comes across very strongly. These had to be the most enjoyable gigs for everyone involved.<P>"Couples" is recommended for lovers of love, as well as lovers of great b&w photography.</span>
