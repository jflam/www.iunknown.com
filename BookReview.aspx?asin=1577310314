                    <span>I first read this book in 1993. My own son was ten and I was grappling with the issues all fathers face when raising a son. I read alot,but this was the first fathering book, the first parenting book whose words leaped off the page and seized me. The author was honest, his words resonated with the integrity of life lived and hard lessons won. Upon finishing the book, I felt liberated and genuinely empowered about being a father. This is not the only book available on fathering a son, but it's the best I've ever come across and I can't recommend it highly enough. And Letters to My Son is not just a book for fathers, like many great books with an abundance of insight and inspiration, readers will find many simple truths on faith, travel, love, sex, aging, God and dying.</span>

                    <span>This book is extremely well written and very insightful. A great book for any man or any father of a boy. The book is full of wisdom and advice that will provide insight to the reader on how to convey values to their son. It crafts solid explainations to difficult questions that men have throughout life. <P>The book gives the reader the tools to become a better person and to appreciate other people and life in general. It could be called "the gentle-mans coaching guide". I couldn't put the book down until I finished it and I can't remember the last time that happened. <P>Hats off to the author for crafting this magnificient work which gets us to stop and think about what is important. That's quite a feat in this "point and click" society.</span>

                    <span>La La La La...just a lot of empty rhetoric that has no value to kids anywhere. My dead father has more wisdom in his stale stools than any of the essays in this book. I say, "Seek a better book."</span>

                    <span>This book touched me deeply by saying many of the same things that I hope to convey to my two boys. Mr. Nerburn's style is practical and sweet but not preachy. Even if you are not a parent, I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Nerburn's "Letters to My Son" is probably one of the best books on masculinity that I've read. Believe me, even though Nerburn's quiet and nurturing style of writing is much different than that of Robert Bly and Sam Keen, his words are just as powerful. I read quite a bit, and fully believe that Letters to My Son is right up there with Iron John and Fire in the Belly. This book is probably one of the undiscovered gems in the literature about men.<P>Every father should read this book, as should every son.</span>
