                <span id="Label1"><P><I>I found myself wondering what would have happened if I had said yes. . . . Would she be alive today? Would we be together? Would we be happy?</i> <P>This is the story of a small-town kid who moved to the big city, fell in love with a beautiful, mysterious woman, and found himself in competition with the most eligible bachelor in the world, John F. Kennedy Jr. <P>Now, for the first time, Michael Bergin reveals the truth behind a life lived in the limelight and a relationship shrouded in secrecy. From his early days growing up in a small blue-collar Connecticut town, to his meteoric rise as fashion icon and television star, to the passion he shared with the enigmatic and complex Carolyn Bessette, this is an inside look at the world of beauty, power, and celebrity. <P>In 1992, Michael and Carolyn met in a bar in New York City. She was unlike any woman he had ever known -- sophisticated, successful, with bewitching charm and grace. An intensely passionate relationship was born. Not long after, Michael landed the coveted Calvin Klein underwear campaign, and his career took off. The future looked bright, and Carolyn and Michael seemed destined for a long and happy life together. <P>But it was not to be. Four years later Michael was an international fashion icon and Carolyn was Mrs. John F. Kennedy Jr. -- however, the story doesn&#146;t end there. This is the truth about their lives, a tale full of warmth, humor, heartbreak, and tragedy. <P>.Above all, <I>The Other Man</i> is a testament to the enduring power of love and a story about the painful choices we make with our all-too-human hearts.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful, truthful book that explores the depths of true love. I found myself wanting more...No matter how famous or powerful someone is they still fall prey to "real emotions" that the average person experiences. I think this book is a wonderful book and story that makes you feel and experience the joy and the pain of the relationship between Michael and Carolyn Bessette. I saw the interview on A & E and my heart was absolutely breaking for Michael. I am happy to learn he is happily married with a beautiful family. I respect him for coming forward and clearing Carloyn's name. I hate to hear some of the things that have been said...and he had wonderful things to say about her...when he talks about her he just glowed. I think he is very genuine.</span>

                    <span>Before reading this book I'd always had the impression that Carolyn B-K was a shallow, status-conscious golddigger. After all, the only guys she dated seemed to be models, tycoons, football-team captains, etc. Well, this book not only confirms all of the above, but also tells you that she was incredibly hard-hearted, cruel, dishonest and manipulative in her dealings with men! (Besides which, she didn't seem to understand the concept of contraception. I mean, THREE abortions in five years?) <P> I am absolutely shocked by the reviewer from NY who defended CBK by saying that she was "just like any other woman" -- GOD! *I* am certainly not like this shallow bitch, nor are any of my friends. She treated Michael Bergin like shit, using him as a sex toy when it was convenient for her and then dumping him when better prospects came along. But then, after she'd dumped him, she'd throw tantrums and trash his apartment if she discovered he was seeing other women. What's really sad is how long Bergin put up with this shit and believed her lies. It amazes me how many men find psycho-bitches attractive, and get bored with those of us who are reasonable, sane and nice. Bergin comes across as sweet, but a bit dim and naive. (I practically laughed out loud when he kept repeating how "classy" he thought CBK was -- after her incredibly slutty and obnoxious behavior, and let's not forget about wearing a thong in Hyannisport!) And apparently JFK Jr. was just as dumb as Bergin. <P> At least Bergin (or his editors) had the sense to stick to the interesting stuff and not try to pad the book with a lot of extraneous stuff about his childhood, his grandparents' childhood, etc. The book moves along at a very good clip, and the stuff he tells about life as a male model was interesting, too (though depressing).</span>

                    <span>Michael Bergin comes across as very genuine and sincere. He eloquently describes his insatiable desire for Carolyn Bessette and the turbulent relationship they shared. Together, they shared great joy and heartbreaking pain. <P>One can only conclude that there was definitely a deep love, a strong connection, and an everlasting bond between Carolyn Bessette and Michael Bergin. Definitely worth reading!!</span>

If what this brainstem says in the book IS true, he looks like a human bobo doll being used by a very troubled, yet smart as a fox woman.<BR>She was no dummy.<BR>This dude needs to get a life.

                    <span>Unlike many of the other reviews here I did actually read the book and did not dare to comment on it until I had. Michael isn't a literary genius by any stretch of the imagination, but I found his book very entertaining and easy to read. I appreciated his humor a great deal. For all of his good looks and charm the man has a wonderful, genuine modesty. He seems to me someone worth knowing.... Caroline on the other hand may have been a different story.<P>Do I believe him? I do! I believe that those who have posted negative comments and attacked Michael are those who wanted to keep Caroline on her Camelot pedestal. I always believed that she was overrated and was tired of seeing her face on every magazine and hearing constantly of her beauty. I didn't see it. I found her white, gaunt and hawk like features far from any ideal! C'mon, it is obvious that the media hype is what made her...That, and the hotties she bedded down with and there were several! <P>In his book Michael reveals quite honestly his heartbreak and pain. Because of his ignorance and naiveté in loving a woman whom most would consider cold, manipulative, sluttish, mentally / emotionally unstable and abusive! Michael didn't see her that way, obviously the man was deeply in love and as he himself admits love is blind. I feel truly sad for Michael that he could confuse her sex and manipulation as evidence of any kind of real and true love. He was young. I hope he learns what real love is.... Michael, it is about respect and honestly, and intimacy, letting someone get to know the real you. Seems that Caroline was too insecure too ever share herself honestly with another human being. She was not mature or sophisticated or classy or any of the things the press built her up to be! Get over it fans! The person you loved as John Jr's wife did not exist! As for Michael, I wish him the best.</span>
