                <span id="Label1">Submarines handle awkwardly on the surface of the sea; airplanes are cumbersome when taxiing. Both modes of operation, however, are design requirements. Organizational computer networks have a similar requirement: they have to interface with other networks (thereby forming the Internet) in order to be useful. How network engineers manage their networks' perimeters has a lot to do with their usefulness, cost effectiveness, and--perhaps above all--security. <I>Inside Network Perimeter Security</I> concerns itself with this latter aspect of the connection to the outside world. It's carefully researched, cleverly written, and full of references to recent exploits and, more importantly, the trends they represent. The best details on emerging hack attacks will always be found online. This book takes a longer view, evaluating offensive and defensive technologies and offering well-reasoned advice on how to keep a network secure now and in the future.<p>  Readers familiar with the previous work of the authors--particularly the highly respected Stephen Northcutt--will recognize the style here. It doesn't aim to teach you how to <I>do</I> much in particular--there are a few procedures, and some Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) command listings--but rather tries to show how to think about networks and the data that comes from them. In a typical section, the authors analyze a log from Tiny Personal Firewall. They highlight the facts that are present in the log and the inferences that can be made from them. A similar style helps you master software tools and make network design decisions. This book is perfect for a network engineer wanting to improve his or her security skills for both design and administration purposes. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to design networks' borders for maximum security, and how to monitor them for unauthorized activity. After an introduction to firewalls, packet filtering, and access lists, the authors explain how to set up routers, special-purpose firewalls, and general-purpose hosts with security in mind. A large section has to do with security-conscious design, both for green field projects and existing networks that need expansion or improvement.</span>

                    <span>This is a very well written book by a group of very experienced practitioners and teachers. Each chapter reflects their experience and the SANS Institute's no-nonsense approach to teaching highly technical security subjects, making the book a worthwile read for security administrators, analysts and engineers. <P>Every chapter starts with an introduction to the subject where general aspects are being highlighted in a way that they can be grasped by non-technical people too. From there the authors quickly jump to explaining the hard, technical details. Pros and cons of individual technologies are being discussed, giving expert opinion to those looking for help in deciding about technology choices. A summary, again readable by everybody and their manager closes each chapter.<P>This is the first book I've seen that groups together and relates all subjects relevant to network perimeter defense. Well chosen diagrams and "real world stories" make it an enjoyable and entertaining read. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>must come to pass. And with the publication of Inside Network Perimeter Security, a good thing has DEFINITELY come to pass!<P> With 18 years in the IT field, I have had the "blessing" of using literally thousands of vendor manuals, after-market "self-help" books, tutorials, resource kits and the like; covering operating systems, programming languages, networking, security, applications and utilities. Until now, I've found that I can invariably stick each one into one of my three "personal" review categories.<P> 1. Idiot's Guide - information so general that the only people who could possibly derive any value from it are those who can best be evaluated on a performance review as: "Can IDENTIFY a computer 2 out of 5 times without assistance".<P> 2. Trivial Pursuits - jam-packed with obscure tricks, keyboard shortcuts, links to Easter Eggs, and advanced functions that 98% of users will never have legitimate use for. Tries to be all things to all readers, and fails miserably. You wind up kicking yourself for paying [money] for 800 pages, and only using 5 of them.<P> 3. Guru Goulash - so specific and/or technical that there are perhaps 100 people on Earth who can make sense of - and properly apply - the information it contains. You wonder why the author didn't save a boatload of paper and email a pdf to those 100 people, since he/she probably knows most of them. However, the author could have increased the value 100-fold simply by writing "cleanly" and intelligibly. IBM System 360 manuals, anyone?<P> BUT: after reading Inside Network Perimeter Security, I may have to develop a new category. The authors have hit the elusive "Sweet Spot"! A book that covers a broad range of topics within the IT Security field, is cleanly written to provide an introduction to these areas to an InfoSec novice; yet with enough "meat" to challenge a seasoned professional to dig a little deeper - and more importantly, to think a little harder.<P> Firewalls, VPN, routers, and IDS systems are all covered with just enough general information for a new practitioner, then go deeper into the concepts involved with concrete, real-world examples. How each of these components contributes to the idea of a securable "perimeter" is well explained. Most importantly, how each component interacts with, supports, supplements and complements each other as defensive measures is a crucial concept. <P> The entire tome is wrapped in the mantra of "defense in depth", undoubtedly the most valuable component of an effective IT security program, with real-life case studies to drive home the concepts. This has been done without getting to the level of specificity that limits the audience to either "Guru" or "Idiot" level. In this case, the "middle ground" and the "high ground" have found a commonality of purpose.<P> I applaud the manner in which diagrams, screen dumps, and example listings have been used. Normally, I find that these often distract from the written information. Here, they have been used judiciously, and effectively highlight the information being presented. The only thing better would be a companion disk with interactive screens to demonstrate the concepts. <P> Frequent use of "Tips" and "Notes", in conjunction with the aforementioned Case Studies, makes this an excellent long-term reference. This is my personal yardstick of the value of a book - will I come back to it repeatedly?<P> In the case of Inside Network Perimeter Security, the answer is a resounding YES. I expect to use this book as a solid reference for some time to come; and will undoubtedly use it a prime source in training my security team. <P> The SANS organization is known and respected as the premier proponent of IT Security. The authors, all members of SANS, have hit yet another home run with Inside Network Perimeter Security. The lack of a companion CD-ROM with extended examples, text version of the book, interactive screens, and perhaps some eval software; is the only thing that prevents it from being a "Grand Slam". Perhaps for the Second Edition?<P> C. Farley Howard; GSEC, CISSP</span>

                    <span>Fairly decent overview of perimeter security. If your a security professional you may learn a thing or two, if your a network administrator and your idea of security is a firewall then this book is meant for you. Its a fairly easy read, but some of the examples of the commands to enter in configuring routers and hosts could be eliminated. I felt the author was just taking up space with these examples. (not a big deal but I'm taking a star away on principal) I also felt the author could have gone into a little be more detail in the VPN chapter, especially when dealing with encryption, PKI, and authenication which I felt was glossed over. (again not a big deal, but when you call yourself the definitive guide, be more definitive and save the 'commands' for the user guides")</span>

                    <span>Excellent resource material for security professionals. Chapter 21 alone is worth the price of admission. Okay, every chapter alone is worth the price of admission.<P>Like other titles from the SANS Institute, this book is highly informative & very readable. With the exeption of writing security policies, which one should know before implementing any security solution beyond using strong passwords, this book covers every area security professionals need to know about to effectively provide layered, defense in depth, solutions. While other books go into more detail on specific areas & technologies, this book does an excellent (and rare) job of covering how the pieces fit together.<P>Thanks (again), Stephen & the folks from SANS! The rest of you should (literally) stop sitting there reading this review & buy it! Read it! Now!</span>
