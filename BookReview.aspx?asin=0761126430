                    <span>This is a book that avid fans of professional football should purchase every three or four years or so.  It is an awesome resource for statistics and facts of professional football.  There is so much information here it is hard to list it all but here some highlights.<p>First, it is a compendium of every NFL record you care to imagine.  And, has details of each Super Bowl and every Super Bowl record one could ever conceive of.  And playoff records too.<p>It has a complete breakdown of EVERY game from the previous year.<p>There is a complete mini-history of every NFL team plus, most interesting and nostalgic, the career, single season, and single game records in many categories fans will be interested in (rushing, passing, receiving, and a few others).<p>There is additional information such as scheduling formulas, a break down of the rules, an explanation of the passer rating system, and this year's schedule.<p>There's more too....<p>And it is well organized and easy to find what you need.  You want to resolve a dispute with some friend about some NFL historical fact or record?  It'll be easy with this volume.<p>I spent hours with this book this week getting ready to enjoy the season.</span>

                    <span>This book continues on the excellent yearly series with all of the same information, obviously updated for the 2002 season, of past editions.<p>However the book is no longer the 8.5 by 11 inch book that it was. I did not check the 'specifications' for the book and was surprised when it arrived to see that it has shrunk to 6 by 9 inches. It is now about 200 pages longer to accommodate the slightly increased amount of information compared to previous versions. <p>Unfortunately I think the change to a smaller size has hurt the book. One advantage is in portability. Unfortunately that seems to be the only advantage. The helmet pictures in the covers of are tiny. There is now obviously less content per page making it less satisfying to peruse and more difficult to find information. Team summaries have to be spread out over 6 smaller pages for instance. The nice rhythm of the old editions is missing.<p>There is no better source for statistics though. As usual it has a summary of every game played in 2001. The all time team vs. team results section continues to be great. I just hope they go back to the full size book for next year.</span>
