                <span id="Label1">Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver is the acknowledged master of both the psychology and the technique of making a living at the corners of the plate. <i>The Art of Pitching</i>, a product of Seaver's twenty-one years of expertise on the mound, details what it takes to get to the top -- and stay there -- in terms of conditioning, mechanics, and concentration.</p> Beginning with the absolutes of pitching preparation, Seaver describes how to get your body in shape to pitch with an exercise regimen specifically designed to prevent rotator cuff injury and to establish the full range of motion critical to pitching success. He explains the basic principles of pitching mechanics, and then analyzes specific pitches and their effectiveness in different game situations with the help of Nolan Ryan on the fastball, Steve Carlton on the slider, Steve Rogers on the sinker, and Mario Soto on the change-up. A firm believer in the pitcher's role as fifth infielder, Seaver devotes a chapter to defense that includes developing good pickoff moves. Finally, he offers a unique pitch-by-pitch analysis of a game against the St. Louis Cardinals.</p><p><i>Sport</i> magazine has said of Seaver, "Future pitching textbooks will be based on his career. He is his own best pitching coach." Now, with <i> The Art of Pitching</i>, he can be yours too.</span>

                    <span>Seaver gives a training program for an aspiring or experienced pitcher from A to Z.<p>The best parts of this book are the beginning and the end: He describes workouts at the beginning of the book, some of which I have used, but even better is his "join me" chapter at the end of the book. In this chapter, he takes the reader with him in a game against the Cards, shows how he pitched, complete with a chart, and shares with us his thought processes during the game. This last chapter was worth a star by itself. <p>However, there is one critical fatal flaw in the book: He did not describe what makes a pitch move (ball rotation and rotational direction). <p>I am a softball pitcher, and these chapters helped me as well.</span>

                    <span>Just because someone is a great pitcher does not necessarily make them a good coach. What many athletes say they are doing and what they in fact intuitively do are often quite different. Similarly what the eye thinks it is seeing and what pitchers actually do are also quite different. The ideas in this book have been largely refuted by newer scientific research using computer analysis and high speed video playback analysis. I am amazed that a book could still be in publication that continues to advocate the "dip and drive" hypothesis, and the idea that the glove arm should drive down. If followed literally this is the sort of misguided information with which coaches can ruin a good pitching talent, or even cause serious injury.<br>The book was good for its time but is now superceeded by more scientifically based ideas such as those advocated by Tom House.<p>The only interesting aspects of the book are those related to how to throw the curveball and change-up pitches. However the didactic lecture about the first and second most important pitches being the fastball was pendantic to a fault.</span>

                    <span>It was my first book on pitching many years ago. Here is my conclusion as  compared to other books. 3 points : 1) A balanced physical preparation is  emphasized. The small weight training is explained and shown even if it is  now commonplace in every pitcher program. 2) The description of fastball,  curve and grip biomechanic... is far superior to and more complete than  anything I have seen since then. More important, experiment is emphasized  with great method. 3) Tom Seaver approaches the mechanic of pitching on a  two-fold way : first it breaks classicaly the motion, giving a lot of tips  and second it fills it with piching absolutes that give a frame for players  and coaches. This principle of a limited number of biomechanical absolutes  that rules the motion is now emphasized for instance by Tom House. However,  this book remains insufficient on practice examples in term of  quantification over a season, on tools to evaluate a pitcher and its  improvement. A lot of live examples are given on pitching strategy but a  summary table depending on the count and/or the hitter weaknesses would  have been more useful. I think the same for pitching preparation (amount of  aerobic exercices, abdominal training....?) where criterias on age and  weight, on pitching volume, would have helped establish a program. A book  to read as well as a pitcher or as a manager, not a practical tool for a  pitching coach program.</span>
