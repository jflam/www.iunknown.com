                <span id="Label1">The Magic of Flight (39 min.) takes you on a technological thrill ride faster, higher, and wilder than modern science or even your imagination! Relive the historical first flight of the Wright Brothers in 1903, then soar with the world-famous Blue Angels as they defy the laws of gravity with their most breathtaking maneuvers. Narrated by Tom Selleck, "The Magic of Flight" highlights and salutes a variety of modern aircraft, the people who fly them, and the human potential of training and performance. Ever wonder "how did they do that?" "The Making of 'The Magic of Flight'" (42 min.) puts you behind the camera and provides further insights into the world of aviation and the techniques used to get some of the most amazing airborne footage ever captured on film. Shot using high-definition cameras, "The Making of 'The Magic of Flight'" captures the enthusiasm and excitement of the crew who made this groundbreaking film.</span>

                    <span>Wow! Widescreen TV is a viewing bonus. The photography on this DVD is amazing. Angles from IMAX cameras mounted on the Blue Angels planes as they fly. You see just how close to each other these people fly. Watch the main feature; then watch the "making of"; then watch the main feature again with a whole new perspective.<P>Unfortunately, even with a widescreen TV, it's not the same experience as being in an IMAX theater with a 60' screen -- you don't get the feeling of being in the pilot's seat, like you do at IMAX. But a great experience nonetheless.<P>The other great thing from this IMAX film is the pilots truly convey their joy of flying. Blue Angels, stunt pilots & pilots taking off / landing on aircraft carriers; you can feel their passion for what they do.</span>

                    <span>I saw this IMAX film the first time at the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, FL. (You'll notice in the opening credits that they helped with the film)I was entranced by the stunning video images and the "feeling" about flying that the scenery and Tom Selleck's narrative created. The score for the film is not "TOPGUN-esque" but rather a warm and inspiring score that reminded me of EVEREST. (Another Spectacular MacGillivray Freeman effort). Needless to say I saw it another 3 times while I was in flight school. To make it easy on prospective buyers I would offer this: If you don't fly or aren't particularly interested in aviation, but have ever been curious as to what makes people want to do it, this film should shed some light. If you fly or are an aviation buff...well, this film really hits the bullseye. Difficult to put in words just how but watch the film and you know what I mean</span>

                    <span>I bought this DVD cause i've found hard time to search this kind of DVD in my country. Well, i'm surely not dissapointed. I watch this DVD in my large projector TV and sure am really want to be those pilots. The picture are really crystal clear and the music is also great. The feature of the dvd about making this film will tell you how hard it is to made such a movies.</span>
