                <span id="Label1">The first thing you'll learn in this book, which details how Earl Woods raised his son, Tiger, to become probably the greatest golfer who ever lived, is that your child will never be another Tiger Woods. Tiger is a prodigy in the sense that Mozart was a prodigy. But even if your child has completely ordinary abilities, <i>Training a Tiger</i> shows how to pass on your love for a sport to your child. Most of the book is specific to golf, but the same lessons can be applied to any activity.</span>

                    <span>In Pete McDaniel's, Training a Tiger,  Tiger Woods shows you basics and in depth steps to golf. This book will show you how to start a your child in golf, equipment, putting, short game, driving, practicing, and in to mental mechanics. The authors purpose for writing this is to show young kids how to golf. It is worth reading if you want to improve your golf game or your childs.</span>

                    <span>Well, I think the fact there are only three reviews of this book before mine pretty much sums up how popular it is.<br>As I write this, there is a show on TV called "American Junior" -- a take-off on "American Idol" in which children with prodigious singing voices try to become stars. The most striking feature of the show, however, is not the kids' talents but their parents' obsessions. They are trying to achieve vicariously, through their kid's success, the fame and fortune they were never able to achieve on their own. I think you probably get my analogy to Earl Woods.<br>By the way: I have a point to make about Tiger that has nothing to do with this book, really, but that I want to get off my chest. It has to do with his wardrobe. He is in serious need of a fashion makeover. Here is his customary garb:<br>1. "Poofy" (i.e., baggy-legged) pants. The effect is a little bit odd.<br>2. A standard golf shirt -- but with the top, collar button fastened. This is a distinctly child-like feature; normally the only people with top button fastened are little boys dressed by their moms.<br>3. A cap that is more rounded than that of other players; if you removed the bill and attached blades to the top, it would be a perfect propellor beanie.<br>What I'm getting at is that his working clothes are childish. When combined with his natural baby face, the effect is comical. I predict that 20 years from now, film of Tiger in his 20s will look as silly as film of golfers in the 1970's with their tight, plaid pants, wide white belts, and super-sized lapels on their shirts. <br>So Tiger -- please come up with a new look on the course to go with your fabulous game.</span>

                    <span>Children are first introduced to a particular sport through their parents. If they show promise or enthusiasm in the sport their parents are their main supporters. Eldrick "Tiger" Woods was blessed to have parents who recognized his gifts and supported him in developing his talent as a golfer. You too, as a parent can do the same for your child as you review the lessons that Tiger's father imparted to him.<p>     Earl Woods shares with his techniques in both raising and training his son, Tiger, as one of the greatest golfers of all time. He describes how to start off your child in golf at an early age, developing drills for them in their practice and keeping them focused on their game. What I found most important about Earl Wood's presentation is his stress on building a solid relationship with your child. Once your child learns to love, trust and feel secure with their parent then there isn't anything that he or she can't handle. Golf is just one means of developing the discipline, integrity and positive behavior that one needs throughout life.<p>     This is not a detailed book on how to play golf. Earl Woods doesn't go into an analysis of his son's techniques. He gives the basics and his own methods which worked with Tiger. His voice is one of advice to parents in training your child for golf. It is up to you to accept or reject Earl Woods' pointers.<p>     After reading this book will your child turn into another Tiger Woods? Probably not because each child is unique but you and your child will develop a better relationship with one another due to your mutual love of the game. Incorporating the principles of Woods' instructions can serve as a launching point<br>in enabling your child to improve on his or her game. Woods stresses throughout the book that as a parent you can use golf to raise a child who will be a champion in life. Golf is the vehicle but the foundation is the love of the parent and child.<p>      If you are introducing golf to your child I highly recommend this book. It gives solid and practical advice in getting your child interested in the game. Earl Woods also provides a list of associations and clubs that sponsor golf lessons and tournaments in developing young players for the sport.</span>

                    <span>If you've admired Tiger as a golfer, wait til you read his father's account of how he got that way.  What a great tribute to the parent/child relationship...a powerful reminder that respect between parents and their children is earned, not given.  Also, terrific advice on how to teach your kid to golf at an early age, and wonderful pictures of Tiger and his family</span>

                    <span>This appears to be a book rushed into print by Earl Woods and a ghostwriter, written just around the time of Earl's bypass surgery.  The book is very shallow and doesn't address any of the interesting milestones of Tiger's golf development.  Nor does it deal with any interesting personal issues - i.e. how did he deal with losses, how did he relate to his peers in school, etc.  I would not recommend this boo</span>
