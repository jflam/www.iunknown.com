                    <span>Of Mice and Men is a very compelling story that illustrates the bond between two individuals.  The story starts with George and Lenny working on a farm in a town called 'weed'.  George is a very intelligent man and Lenny is a mentally challenged giant.  One day while at work, Lenny sees a woman with a red dress on and goes up to talk to her.  He gets into trouble when he goes up to her because he does something he should not but does not realize that he is doing anything wrong.  He and George then have to run to another farm because they do not want to get caught for what Lenny has done.  They need to keep working because their ultimate goal is to own a ranch of their own where Lenny can raise rabbits and they can both live off the 'fatta the lan.'  They get to the next ranch the next day and meet the people around there.  There is a very nice man, 'Slim', and poor black man and old man, and the worst character of the book, a mean, cocky man, Curley.  They work at the farm for a few weeks until Lenny gets in trouble again with an incident similar to the first.  The story ends shortly after this and is ended in a very well way.  This book is one of the greatest books I have read, not to mention it only being 107 pages long.  Steinbeck is a great author and has produced many great books including 'The Grapes of Wrath,' another great novel of his.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be able to read a story in just a short couple of hours.  This is the shortest book that I've ever read but also the most touching and realistic book that I've read.</span>

                    <span>Of Mice and men is one of the most beautiful stories about friendship. The story is about two Americans. The thoughts and actions of the two southern are made open for the reader to enjoy and judge.
<br />
<br />The favorite character in the book is Lenny. He came out in the story as and was innocent person with a mental defect. It reminded me somehow of Dostoyevsky's THE IDIOT. The amazing thing about this book is that not a lot of books are based on such unique characters. Another attractive aspect of Lenny is his physical strength and hardworking nature. Yet, despite his meek nature, he was dangerous in the sense that he even killed a woman out of fear.
<br />
<br />Steinbeck successfully created a philosophical twist to life through this story by bringing to life strong but vulnerable characters that we all can relate to.

<br />The story starts with George and Lennie running away from their previous town of occupation, where Lennie, in his childlike manner, wants to touch a girl's red dress but doesn't let go, resulting in shouts of rape, mass chaos, and the pair of them getting chased out of town (you don't learn all this immediately, though.) They find work at a nearby ranch, which is where most of the story takes place. 
<br />
<br />One of the things that immediately stuck out to me about this book is Steinbeck's writing style. Heavily focused on dialogue, the overall terseness and efficient use of words is only interrupted occasionally when Steinbeck describes a new scene, where he goes into great detail. Otherwise, all you see on paper is exactly what you need to understand the story; this prevents it from dragging too much, and it allows the story to progress more quickly without spending forever on the same topic. This results in a natural flow of events that won't leave you reading the same thing re-stated 10 times; as a result, you'll want to read more because you know good things are always around the turn of the page. To almost put it in a blatantly simple manner, this reads like a very complex bedtime story. 
<br />
<br />Probably the thing that sticks out most to me is the incredibly well portrayed characters. Steinbeck takes a very Hemingway-like approach in both quantity and quality of characters; he keeps the book very condensed in terms of plots, sub-plots, complex characters, etc ...(it's barely 100 pages), which means you won't be scratching your head after every chapter going, "What on earth just happened?" It's a testament to his writing style that each character is so individually portrayed in a span of barely 100 pages, yet I didn't feel like anything was missing; I could visualize every one of the characters in real life. He does an excellent job of fleshing out the characters simply through what they say, not having to rely on superfluous dialogue or extraneous details to get their personalities across. 
<br />
<br />Finally, the ending of Of Mice and Men is very powerful. It illustrates a theme that must have been particularly prevalent in them minds of most people during the Great Depression: "When do we draw the line on tolerance and do what has to be done?" Although the entire book is impressive in its lucidity, the ending is particularly impressive because it brings extreme tragedy to the novel without a change in style; it's perfectly believable, yet not something you really want to believe. Part of it is due to the memorable characters (I assure you you won't forget Lennie after the ending of the book), part of it is just Steinbeck's genius. Pick up a copy of this classic book! Another novel I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Steinbeck, but very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.

                    <span>Having taught at an inner city school with extremely reluctant readers, I always found joy in witnessing kids get into this book.  I have had students confess they had never before read a "chapter" book, but they actually read this one.Steinbeck's characteriztion, his timeless themes, and his crafty step into a deeper world of symbolism and realism reach to students...I highly recommend reading it with the audio tapes as well.  Gary Sinise does an outstanding read...There simply is no better George.</span>

                    <span>Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck sympathetically depicts life at the bottom of the working class, where people "never seem to give a damn about nobody."  Here it's black against white, rich against poor, and every man for himself.  George and Lennie, two itinerant ranch hands, are different: George looks after Lennie and Lennie looks after George.  They plan to pool their money and buy a small piece of land with a shack on it "an' live off the fatta the lan'."  Of course an accident stands in their way.
<br />
<br />This is a beautifully written book that can be read in a couple hours.  One special attraction for me - we just returned from a vacation in California - was the local color from California's agricultural valleys.
