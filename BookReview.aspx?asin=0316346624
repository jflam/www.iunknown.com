                <span id="Label1">"Why did crime in New York drop so suddenly in the mid-90s? How does an unknown novelist end up a bestselling author? Why is teenage smoking out of control, when everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows like Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why did Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this brilliant and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues, often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.   <P>In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics. The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure story written with an infectious enthusiasm for the power and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one imaginative person applying a well-placed lever can move the world."</span>

                    <span>I have come late to this book so have little much to add to what other reviewers have stated except to observe that why this book is such a thought provoking and enjoyable read for me (despite in several areas covering concepts that probably mean little in isolation) is due to:
<br />
<br />1. Gladwell's wide ranging and excellent choice of examples that serve to support his messages (a book that can range from why Paul Revere's ride was so effective to the simple initial steps that were critical to reducing the NY crime wave of 1980s is bound to provoke interest);
<br />
<br />2. In developing his key themes Gladwell presents his case with the making of several key "connections" to produce a very convincing case;and,
<br />
<br />3. Finally, he covers a very challenging issue of how to stop (or at least reduce) people smoking as a test of his case.
<br />
<br />A very provoking book of ideas and concepts which given I am currently involved in a major project which involves how to better develop and produce information which will have greater "stickiness" and change people's views and approach has come at just the right time!</span>

                    <span>i found the ideas in this book fascinating and intriguing. entertaining for sure, to say the least. some of the ideas in this book may not be new, but its new to me. i guess you can say it opened my eyes a bit more and perhaps broadened my horizons. reading this book was a lot better than going thru pages of research, which for me, is much too boring. i usually just read the abstracts and conclusions. if it were interesting enough i will plow thru the data as well. but that is quite seldom for me. in any case, its definitely a good book. call it twisting, repackaging, and whatever. but it served me well by being written and presented in a language most of us can understand and relate to without being too technical about everything.. what more can i say??</span>

                    <span>Mr. Gladwell book is very easy to read and it gives very good examples and descriptions of the basic of marketing. I totally enjoyed his examples. Before that I was wondering why they always show the Tele Tubbies two times. Now it is very clear to me.

                    <span>When I first heard of this book I thought it would be one of those -poor written, full of numbers- type of book. There is really nothing further from the truth.
<br />This book looks in detail into the Snowball Effect - something small at some point becomes an avalanche -. The way Gladwell presents it is clear and logical, what do we need, well connectors, mavens, sellers, context and yes a bit of luck.
<br />
<br />The context of this book is general; you will find stories and examples from the spread of syphilis to creation of  Sesame Street. But the implications are far reaching - business, health, personal life..... -.
<br />
<br />Take sometime to read this book, is short, simple and most of all quite interesting.
