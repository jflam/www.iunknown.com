                <span id="Label1">The Place Names of New Mexico is an invaluable guide to the state's geography and history. It explains more than 7,000 names of features large and small throughout the state, towns, mountains, rivers, canyons, counties, post offices, and even abandoned settlements, as well as providing relevant information about location, history, and current status. The revised edition contains more than fifty expanded and updated entries. <P>The accounts are also journeys into New Mexico's past, offering glimpses of the lives and values of the people who named the place. Humor, tragedy, mystery, and daily life they can all be found in this book.</span>

                    <span>In reading through this rather well researched volume, I noted that the author will often note, at the end of an entry, that the place whose English or Spanish name has just been discussed, also has a name in Navajo (occasionally another language), a name whose meaning is given -- but we are not told the actual word! For example, the author tells us that the name for Albuquerque, in Navajo, means "two bells in place"; but he does not tell us that actual name, Bee'aldííl Dah Sinil.<P>In the preface, the author offers an explanation for this oddity:<P>"Regarding Indian place names, with but few exceptions I've presented their meanings but not their sounds; even the best transliterations do no more than approximate the actual sounds of the Indian words, and transliterations encourage the gross corruptions from which Indian names have suffered over the years. Persons who want to hear the sound of the Indian names should consult a native speaker."<P>This is really just stupid. One could similarly argue for the exclusion of all French words from etymologies in English dictionaries -- after all, French "transliterations" do no more than approximate the actual sounds of the French words. And anyway, if you write it down, someone will just mispronounce it. So, better to just ask a French person?<P>And this is particlarly silly considering this is from University of New Mexico Press, the same press that publishes the Young & Morgan lexicons of Navajo -- which, incidentally, have thorough coverages of placenames, which is of interest to anyone who, unlike this author, considers Native names the subject of scholarship.<P>Hopefully reason will prevail, and in some future edition, the Native names will actually be listed instead of merely hinted at.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for placenames of Spanish origin in New Mexico (which is most of them), and for that reason I definitely recommend this book. But still a good number of the placenames in New Mexico have their origin in local Native American languages -- and this book bungles its dealings with those names.<P>That is, in reading through this rather well researched volume, I noted that the author will often note, at the end of an entry, that the place whose English or Spanish name has just been discussed, also has a name in Navajo (occasionally another language), a name whose meaning is given -- but we are not told the actual word!

                    <span>I grew up in New Mexico, and since moving away, I have been very interested in learning more about my home state (probably because I miss it so much). This book is an excellent reference of place names, and taught me a lot about New Mexico. I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>My roots are in Arizona and New Mexico and The Place Names of New Mexico is an outstanding reference work for those interested in place name origin and history. It is very enjoyable to read and simply browse through as well as a useful tool for research.<P>I obtained the book to assist in researching place names along the Santa Fe Railroad (obtained from old employee timetables) and it was here where I found that the author intentionally made a grave error, in my opinion. He omitted the names of railroad sidings, water stops, stations and section houses that "once were more important in the public consciousness" if they never had a post office or gave their name to another feature of the area.<P>I recognize there are many elements to consider in the history of the area such as post offices, maps, government and military records, etc. There should be no question that railroads also played a HUGE role in development of the west and leaving out some of the railroad names such as Keota, Blanchard, Paquita and McCune,a large void was unnecessarily created. While the void doesn't detract from the work as a whole, it does make it incomplete. Then again, in defense of the author, I didn't walk the mile in his shoes or confront the problems he may have faced. What I am trying to say is that if I wrote the book, I would not have knowingly excluded any railroad names.<P>On the positive side, this book is up to date and newer place names have been identified and included.<P>If you are interested in New Mexico history or various elements comprising it, this book is definitely worth having in your library. In spite of my complaint, it answered most of my questions. This book is a five star work and it is well done.</span>

                    <span>An excellent reference and history book with easy-to-read print. Anyone interested in 'treasure hunting', genealogy, or checking on marriage or death records will find this book a necessity. Town names come and go; some may have only existed for 16 years, or the name had been changed over and over. This is the book for you. The mini-history lessons are interesting and valuable without putting the reader to sleep and the directions to the locations are clear and concise.</span>
