                <span id="Label1">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the W3C-approved method for enriching the visual presentation of web pages. CSS allows web pages to become more structural, and at the same time promises that they can have a more sophisticated look than ever before. With good implementations in Internet Explorer 5.0 and Opera 3.6, and 100% CSS1 support expected in Netscapes's Mozilla browser, signs are that CSS is rapidly becoming a useful, reliable, and powerful tool for web authors.  The <i>CSS Pocket Reference</i>  briefly introduces CSS and then lists all CSS1 properties, plus the CSS1 pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. Since browser incompatibility is the biggest obstacle to CSS adoption, we've also included a comprehensive guide to how the browsers have implemented support for CSS1. For anyone who wants to correctly implement CSS, this is a handy condensed reference to all the details in the larger volume, <i>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide.</i></span>

                    <span>The first O'Reilly Pocket Reference I owned was the HTML Pocket Reference, and it's excellent. I figured since I'm starting to use CSS more & more it would be nice to have a quick handy guide, and I figured since the HTML reference was so good, why not go for the CSS reference.<P>I do not like it at all. At risk of repeating other problems already noted I'll give my biggest gripes. There is almost no mention of CSS2. Although browser support is not very extensive yet, the standard has been defined, so why not include it?<P>Compatibility charts do not have any mention of Internet Explorer 6. Granted, the book may have been published before it's release, but I have not been able to find one with a print date newer than May, 2001. Two years is a long time in the world of web design.<P>The properties for various selectors are not organized in a way that maked them easy to find. I'm not saying that I know a better way to organize them, but unless you already know the name of the property you're looking for you have to flip through the book guessing at it until you find what you're looking for.<P>If you're in the market for a cheap pocket CSS reference, stay away from this one. There has to be something better.<P>I will, however, recommend a full-fledged CSS book from O'Reilly: CSS- The Definitive Guide.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for quick information in a size that's easy to carry around, purchase this book. It's an excellent addition to the O'Reilly Pocket Reference series.<P>When I'm trying to remember the format for a particular style or how well it's supported by the various browser versions, I don't want to have to dig through a large reference manual. Instead, I reach for this book, quickly look up the style (listed alphabetically), get the information I'm looking for, and continue working. This is the reference I carry between work and home.<P>The book starts with a condensed description of how CSS1 works and how to use it. The majority of the reference describes the CSS1 properties, pseudo-elements, and pseudo-classes. Each entry includes the allowed values, a description, a few examples, and browser support for both Windows and Mac browsers. Additional notes describe any browser-specific issues. A browser support summary chart completes the book.<P>Even if you have Eric Meyer's Cascading Style Sheets, The Definitive Guide, you will still find his CSS Pocket Reference a useful addition to your bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>This book is good for the basics but it does not cover CSS2 so If your looking for an advanced css reference, this isnt it. It really needs to be updated with a new edition since this one is from 2001.</span>

                    <span>this is a great book if you are looking for a CSS1 reference. as other reviewers have mentioned here, this predates the CSS2 specification and will not be as helpful for more advanced web designers/coders. however most modern browsers now have a near-complete implementation of CSS1, so if you are just learning CSS or want your websites to have older browser compatibility, this will be very handy.</span>

                    <span>An excellent guide to CSS-1 that's starting to show its age. Browsers covered go as far as IE5.5 and NN6.0, but it can almost be taken for granted that newer variations do a better job.<P>For what it is, this book is invaluable. Support charts tell you what works and what doesn't, example code is enough to fill in questions about syntax, and the book is designed to make each CSS property easy to find with a quick flipping through the pages.<P>Meyer knows his CSS. Make sure you have this book on your desk.</span>
