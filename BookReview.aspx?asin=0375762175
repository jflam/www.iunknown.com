                    <span>I have only been reading this book for a little while now, but so far I like it.  I like how the book gives you work from different authors. This book, I think can relate to people who have grown up poor, or are growing up poor now. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about the struggles in everyday peoples' life. This book is very good so far. I am very interested this book and I am going to keep reading.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book. After reading this book I passed tests with sky-high results. This book assists the learner in most basic and deepest of writing. Completed as a reference book. Do not read it as a novel. With unparalled consturction, this book will improve advance your grades.</span>

                    <span>I think this book does not fulfil its promises. In fact, it is way beneath the level of graduates, to whom this book is also targeted at. The advice given is too shallow and general, and does not point out the specifics of good writing. Examples are too few in number and insubstantial in content,  and though they may occassionally succeed at being a little funny, are not  desirable examples that would enlighten readers on what a "smart"  piece of writing would be like. Overall, this is a disappointment, and way  below expectations. Princeton Review should be embarassed to have published  such a piece.</span>
