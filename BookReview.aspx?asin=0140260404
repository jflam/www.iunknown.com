                    <span>I read the first edition of the book a few years ago. It was also translated into Russian in 1997. And now when I'm reading "Business @ Speed of Thought" I take a look into the second edition of "The Road Ahead" and read it again. Considering that this book was written in 1995-96, the predictions he made are quite remarkable in their prophecy. The founder of Microsoft presents his vision for the future in which he sees the digital technologies of the coming years changing the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. And this man definitely knows the future.<P>"The Road Ahead" is very much primarily an easy-to-read IT textbook. This book tells you what lies ahead in the future for everyday living world of computers. Will everyone in the world have access to computers in our future? Will everyone gain access to the Internet? Will we be able to walk in a store and pick out whatever we want to, and walk out of the store without being a shoplifter? Read this amazing book and find out the answers to these questions and more. <P>It also includes CD-ROM containing the complete text of the book, a dictionary with multimedia hyperlinks and an interview with Bill Gates. It is still extraordinary. This CD-ROM illustrates the future of electronic publishing. <P>I interviewed Bill Gates in 1990 when he visited Moscow for the first time to introduce the very first Microsoft product in Russian language. It was MS-DOS 4.0. Then I wrote several books on MS-DOS and IT for beginners. <P>Bill Gates was worth "only" $2.5 billion in 1990. It is estimated that hundreds million people today have personal computers in their home. Over ninety-five percent of them are operating Windows Operating Systems. Today Microsoft really enjoys the self-made monopoly. Although many people don't like Bill Gates personally because he's so rich, I wish good luck to Microsoft Corp. and the Microsoft team. And at the same time I also wish good luck to all young entrepreneurs who will start their companies and deprive Microsoft of its reins eventually. This is the capitalism, ladies and gentlemen! This is a great system with opportunities for everyone with guts.<P>This is a must have book for anyone pursuing a career in computers, the computer hobbyist and the Mac users, too. Get this book today and have it in your library. I highly recommend it, especially to people new to computers and the digital revolution.</span>

                    <span>Bill Gates succinctly offers his vision for what's to come. He takes the opportunity to clearly point out where his dreams as a computer revolutionary meet and fall away from his goals running the most powerful technology company ever.<P>The book is set up like a bunch of speeches. This is how Gates said he thought would be his most effective writing style, and it works to minimize unnecessary blather while focusing on key points. Obviously, Gates has a lot of inside information to analyze situations and products upcoming, and the mental skill to back up his predictions, theories, and assessments.<P>Now that the book's been out quite awhile, it makes for a good read to reflect on some things and await what's to come. What sells me on the book is the undeniable level of intelligence coming from a man in charge of most aspects of our digital daily lives.</span>

                    <span>Definitely worth reading. I'd also, however, suggest that if you really are curious about the early years of computing, you use the internet to check up other opinions of Microsoft's origin. There's two sides to every story...<P>Mr. Gates is is undoubtedly a phenomenal businessman, though not perhaps quite the visionary he perceives himself to be. Would a visionary have to rewrite his book a year after completion? The internet took off - and The Road Ahead received a complete overhaul to reflect the recent developments. More like, The Road Behind. He's also not quite such an innovator - Microsoft purchased "MS-DOS", rather than created it, and incorporated many other people's ideas into Windows (without permission, of course).<P>This isn't just a Microsoft bashing session. I have the greatest respect for them. But, think twice before you believe every word in this book. There is a definite stretching of the truth in places. Having said that, buy it - it's an interesting comparison with other accounts of the dawn of personal computing. No doubt the truth is somewhere in between.</span>

                    <span>Mr Gates didn't mention anything about Java running on any platform/machine<P>He didn't mention anything about Linux being free<P>He didn't mention anything "new" about IBM their Lotus Notes products<P>Didn't mention anything "significant" about future changes in graphics and companies like Pixar and Disney<P>He didn't mention anything about Oracle and middleware<P>He didn't mention anything about the POWER of Ebay, Yahoo, Google and Amazon to get you things!!<P>What about AOL?, and what about the fact that he didn't even once mention Netscape, the superior company who revelutionized the Internet with their browser.<P>Don't get me wrong it is a very good book. However somewhat lopsided<BR>I guess I must be on a different road than the one Mr Gates is traveling on.<BR>btw: I happen to be one of the many Microsoft Certified Professionals that invested a significant amount of my own money and time supporting his products. <BR>(10 grand and 12 years) <P>I think this book is as much about what is NOT in the book as opposed to what IS in the book!!<BR>Buy it anyway! (Maybe used - it is some what dated) You will learn something just by being exposed to it.<BR>The concept of The Web as being "self publishing" was an eye opener for me. <BR>My favorite chapter and quote was from Chapter 8 Friction-Free Capitalism. "Our success in the PC world has come from working in partnership with such great companies as Intel, Compaq, HP, DEC, NEC, and dozens of others. Even IBM and Apple, with whom we have occasionally been in competition, have had an immense amount of our cooperation and support. We created a company that was dependent on partners. We bet that somebody other than us would do great chips, somebody other than us would build great PCs, somebody other than us would do great distribution and integration. We took a narrow slice and focused on that. In this new world, we want to work with companies from every industry to help them make the most of the opportunities the information revolution will bring." page 182<P>Well here are some other technology people and companies you might want to investigate as I am sure they too will have an impact on the direction of the road we will all be traveling: (unless of course, he buys them or squeezes them out)<BR>Doug Humphrey - Founder, Digex ; Chairman and Founder, Cidera<BR>Jonathan Klein - Co-founder and CEO, Getty Images<BR>Tom Stockham - President of Access and Emerging Markets, Ticketmaster<P>Chip Perry - President and CEO - AutoTrader.com, former VP, Los Angeles Times<BR>Jim McCann - Founder, Chairman and CEO - 1-800-FLOWERS<BR>Brooks Fisher - Vice President (Strategic Initiatives), Intuit; former VP, Infoseek <BR>Micheal Rubin - Founder, Chairman and CEO - Global Sports<BR>Robert Covington - Chief Technology Officer and EVP, MerchantWired<BR>Rob Burgess - Chairman and CEO - Macromedia; former SVP, Silicon Graphics<BR>Steven Snyder - founder and chairman - Net Perceptions<BR>Kenneth Cron - CEO, Flipside, Inc; former President of Publishing, CMP Media<BR>Emerick Woods - President and CEO - Vicinity<BR>Glenn Meakem - Founder, Chairman and CEO - FreeMarkets<BR>Ted Meisel - President and CEO - GoTo.com<BR>Nicholas vanDyk- President, Artisan New Media; EVP, Artisan Entertainment<BR>Glenn Meyers- Founder and CEO - Rare Medium Group <BR>Mark Goldstein - President and CEO - K-Mart's BlueLight<BR>Charles Johnson - Founder and CEO - PurchasePro<BR>David Perry- Founder, Chairman and CEO - Ventro<BR>Alan Meckler- Founder, Chairman and CEO - INTMedia Group <BR>Christopher Jenkins - former President, Ziplink; former VP, Arch Communications<BR>Michael Levy -Founder and CEO - CBS Sportsline<BR>John Schwarz - CEO - Reciprocal; former General Manager, IBM Solutions<BR>Chris MacAskill - Founder -FatBrain.com, CEO - MightyWords<BR>Harry Motro - Chairman, MotroVentures, former CEO - Infoseek <BR>Zach Nelson - CEO and President, Mcafee ASaP<BR>Joe Chung - Founder and Chairman, Art Technology Group <BR>Jeet Singh - Founder and CEO, Art Technology Group <P>Royal Farros - Chairman, CEO and Founder, iPrint Inc.<BR>Pehong Chen - Founder and CEO, BroadVision<BR>Jeffrey Smith - Founder and CEO, Tumbleweed Communications<BR>Scott Kurnit - CEO and Founder of About Inc. <BR>Bob Young - Founder and Chairman, Red Hat Software<BR>Scott Mednick - Founder, Think New Ideas; former Chairman, Worldwide Exceed<BR>Tom Rogers- President and CEO, Primedia, former President, NBC Cable<BR>Russell Horowitz - Founder and former Chairman, Go2Net Inc.<P>Naveen Jain - Founder and Chairman, InfoSpace<BR>Michael Rosenfelt - Venture Partner, Impact Venture Partners; Founder, Powered, Inc.<BR>Charles Conn - Co-founder and former Chairman, TicketmasterCitySearch.com<BR>Mark Walsh - Chairman, VerticalNet; former SVP, America Online<BR>David Goldberg - Founder and CEO, Launch Media<BR>John Holt - Founder and CEO, The Cobalt Group <BR>(From the book eFront! by Mattew W.

                    <span>On page 263 Mr. Gates writes, "If people do gravitate to their own interests and withdraw from the broader world -- if weight lifters communicate only with other weight lifters, and Latvians choose to read only Latvian newspapers -- there is a risk that common experience and values will fall away. Such xenophobia would have the effect of fragmenting societies." By this statement Bill Gates is suggesting that people who get their information about the world from Latvian newspapers will become as narrow in their outlook as people whose only interest is weight lifting. What a misguided low opinion of Latvian newspapers! This opinion -- after about 1990, when Latvia gained its freedom (including freedom of the press) for a second time -- cannot possibly be based on any real knowledge of what is contained in Latvian newspapers.<P>I regularly read the largest Latvian newspaper, Diena (Day), online (anyone can take a look at Diena by just asking Google.com to find Diena for them) and I can assure you that it is broad in scope and caters to all kinds of interests. International news, world cultural events, advances in technology, etc., are well covered. It is true that in Diena you will find more news about Latvia than you would find in the New York Times, but it is also true that the New York Times will have more news about New York City than the Seattle Post Intelligencer. So you can be sure that Latvians who choose to read Latvian newspapers exclusively, as well as those who have no choice because they only know Latvian, are no more likely to be doomed to xenophobia than readers of Finnish, Estonian, or Lithuanian newspapers. Perhaps when Mr. Gates chose Latvia for his example he really was thinking of neighboring Belarus, but maybe his finger slipped on the map.<P>The rest of the book I found very informative. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the modern world (even though it was written in 1995).<P>For not knowing the difference between a fine Latvian newspaper and a weight lifters' chat room I would like to deduct one-half star, but Amazon.com does not offer that option, so I am rounding down to an even four stars.</span>
