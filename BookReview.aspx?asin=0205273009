                    <span>I had an important ceremony coming up and I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to wow the crowd.  This book gave me enough good ideas to research, write, and deliver a great speech. I had three goals for my speech:  Establish myself as a great speaker, make the audience understand that I had written a great speech, and bring the receipient to the point of tears.<p>I did just that.  The crowd was taken aback by my speech and that speech ended up being the one thing that everyone remembered about that evening.<p>I strongly encourage anyone who has a speaking engagement coming up to read this book.  It will give you the guidance necessary to write a great speech regardless of the reason.</span>

                    <span>In architecture schools considerable time is spent on materials for building. The potential of the materials determines what can be built and how it will look and feel. How is it that other public speaking books spend so little time on choosing the right word. Perlman spends a great deal of effort on teaching how to find and select the right word. He demonstrates how the right word for speaking is different than the right word for written communication. You can be a great writer without being a good speaker, but you can't be a great speaker without being a good writer.<p>"Writing Great Speeches" is for the analytical or educated reader that can handle a fast and furious pace. A direct approach on how to research and construct well organized speeches. Should be ranked high on anybody's list of excellent books on public speaking. It is the best book in the "Essence of Public Speaking Series." Excellent guidance on how to start writing a speech where you are knowledgeable on the subject and how to research areas that are not your expertise. Excellent chapter on how to pick exactly the right word and why it is important.<p>No other book covers demonstrating legitimate creditability as well as Perlman. He focuses in on exactly how to write great speeches. Like a fast moving train you are carried down the track of learning the skills with overpowering intensity.<p>The Appendix of Aids to Quick Creditability is worth the price of the book. It is a refreshing list of reference books the provide a map to rapidly gaining knowledge on any subject.<p>If you are like me nearly every book I read is disappointing in its content and /or its clarity and hence we read many books when a subject is important to us. Extremely rare do we find books so insightful and tightly written that we read it many times. These special books are so important that they will always stand out in your memory.  This may be that book on public speaking for crafting the speech.</span>
