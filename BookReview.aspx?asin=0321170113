                <span id="Label1">A DVD/book combo--what a great idea! Think of  <I>The Macintosh iLife: An Interactive Guide to iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD</I> as "iReading." You get a 90-minute movie that allows you to peer over author Jim Heid&#146;s shoulder as he demonstrates all the essentials of the four iApps. In iTunes, he shows how to create playlists, change the info tags for a batch of songs, burn a compilation CD, and more advanced features like choosing equalizer settings for each tune. In iPhoto, he shows how easy it is to organize even the largest collection of family pictures, and even how to make minor touch ups. In iMovie, he shows how to create a home movie that won&#146;t put your friends to sleep by incorporating cross fades, an audio track of both ambient sounds and MP3s from iTunes, still images from iPhoto, and titles. He then shows how to use iDVD to create custom menus and chapter openings.<p>  You can watch the book&#146;s DVD on the computer and hit pause whenever you feel like practicing something for yourself. The book goes into even greater detail on each iApp, for example, covering cross fades in iTunes, working with multiple libraries in iPhoto, and tweaking variations of the Ken Burns effect in iMovie. In bonus chapters and sidebars, Heid goes in depth on related topics like the inner workings of an iPod, tips for taking better digital photos and movies, and how to hook up a TV for improved playback while editing in iMovie.<p>  Anyone working in OS X, even seasoned Mac users, will learn new techniques, timesaving tips, and lots of ideas on how to get the most out of everything the iLife promises. And it may even turn skeptics who thought this was just another advertising gimmick into giddy converts. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>I've been using Macintoshes since 1984, and am usually an "early adopter" of new software as it's released. Before reading this book and watching the DVD video, I'd already used all of the iLife applications and thought I knew how to use them, more or less.<P>Well, I found out that I knew how to use them less, rather than more! Jim Heid's excellent book and video is great for the novice, but it also has plenty to teach the experienced user. In this age of "no printed manual" many of us just jump into an application and figure out how to use it. In doing so, we miss out on a lot of little tricks and capabilities that really save time, improve usability, and make using these great programs even more fun! Heid brings us up-to-speed while teaching all of these small, often undocumented features that really make using the applications even smoother and easier.<P>This book/video combo is a great value and recommended for any Mac user who wants their computer to be the center of their "digital life."</span>

                    <span>I have decided to review "The Macintosh iLife" by Jim Heid <BR>in addition to the iMovie 3 Visual QuickStart Guide. This book, also distributed through Peach Pit Press, takes a more visual approach to teaching you how to use <BR>iMovie 3 (along with the iPod, iTunes 3, iDVD 2, and iPhoto 2). When I <BR>say visual I don't really mean pictures in the book. The book includes <BR>a feature-length DVD (broken up into digestible parts) literally <BR>showing you how to do the things that are written in the book.<P>Heid is a quality presenter both in writing and demonstration. It'd be <BR>VERY difficult to watch this DVD and not learn how to do some pretty <BR>sophisticated things. The pace of the DVD is well-suited to the novice <BR>user, but not tedious for those with experience. The book on it own is <BR>a decent reference for each of the products covered, but used as a <BR>follow-up reference to having watched the DVD, it is a powerful <BR>instrument making it easy to recall what you've seen without having to <BR>actually load the DVD back into a player.<P>While Heid's book focuses more on the most-commonly used features, it <BR>makes up for any gap (say, between it and the iMovie 3 VQSG) by <BR>covering the whole suite of iLife programs rather than just one. Even <BR>if you have the new version of iLife '04 (like I do), you can still <BR>benefit from this book because the material in it is geared toward <BR>utilizing functions that will exist in the new versions too. Even if <BR>the interface has changed a little, I did not find that it was <BR>difficult to follow anything that Heid demonstrated. Unless he <BR>specifically updates this book (and DVD) to match iLife '04, I can do <BR>no less than highly recommend it to all iLife users.</span>

                    <span>This book/DVD combo is simply superb. I am not technically gifted -- though I'm the son of a rocket scientist! -- but I am totally geeking out. Jim Heid is a master instructor with an utterly uncanny knack for speaking to exactly the point that you want him to address next. His sense of sequence is flawless! Apple has done a stunning job of creating an awesomely powerful, yet completely accessible, package in iLife. I'm already importing tunes, burning custom CDs and running out to buy a digital camera. I am even considering personally creating instructional DVDs for my Los Angeles based media training firm. That, in itself, is a minor miracle. I used to concede everything to IT experts; now I'm not so sure! I think Jim Heid's book -- along with David Pogue's Missing Manual series -- ought to be standard issue with any Mac.<BR>The Mac, in my obviously biased opinion, is the most elegantly intuitive computer on earth. Equally so is this book and DVD combination. You'll be amazed at how quickly you assimilate information and navigate with growing confidence. My only criticism of this set is that I wish there was more. To that end, I plan to check out what else is available from Peachpit Press and Avondale Media (they collaberated on this combo). Well, folks, I hope I've made myself clear: The Macintosh iLife book and DVD are as good as it gets. If you've been on the wrong side of the digital divide, and if you're now ready to advance exponentially in your multimedia skills, then you simply can't go wrong with this purchase. Buy it!</span>

                    <span>Jim Heid doesn't waste time about getting into doing things with the iLife suite. The DVD alone is worth the purchase price if you're a new or novice user. I use the iDVD portion of the DVD with beginning students to video editing. It's a no nonsence approach that keeps things moving.</span>
