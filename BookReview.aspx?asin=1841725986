                    <span>How did you learn to keep house? From your mother? From your maid? Well some of us didn't pay attention to our mothers. And some of us didn't have maids.<P>Finally, we have a book that tells us how to keep our house clean. It is a quality book that is well organized into simple sections for easy reference. I'll keep mine on the shelf in the kitchen next to my favorite cookbooks.<P>When my grown daughter saw my copy of "Keeping House. . .", she said, "I always wanted to know how to keep fruit fresh." And quickly found that information in the book. <P>I ordered three more copies for my three grown children. It's a "keeper".</span>

                    <span>This is a beautiful book, clearly done by someone with a great sense of esthetics. Under "Clean House Basics," it states, "A well-kept home will improve your mental wellbeing--if your home is in order, the rest of your life will feel manageable." This is certainly how I feel, even though my home is rarely totally in order. This book includes lots of good strategies for achieving and maintaining organization. The spiral binding allows the book to lay flat, for easy reference. "Keeping House" would make an excellent shower present, housewarming gift, or just a fine addition to any library.</span>

                    <span>I must say that when my girlfriend gave me this book, I thought it was a strange choice for me, but as I read through, I found tons of useful information that would help a lot of bachelors. I also think it would be a great book for married guys to score points with the wife! The book itself is very well organized, broken down into different sections detailing helpful hints for all areas of the home. This is one of those books that will stay on my bookshelf for a long time, and be referenced often. Great photos too! This would make a great gift for anyone.</span>

                    <span>Thank you Cindy Harris for coming to the rescue. This is a beautifully designed, clear and accessible book that is filled with 'rescue remedies' much needed for a disorganized slob like me. As a reference guide to all things household it is invaluable. A great gift for Mother's day and all June brides (and grooms) should be handed one at the altar.</span>

                    <span>Oh my goodness! I saw this book at a friend's house and didn't wanna let it go! It makes finding a solution to even the oddest, most idiosyncratic household dilema is solved EASY! (I guess that means I'm not as alone as I thought in terms of HOW the heck do I make MY environment as user friendly and welcoming as the homes I like to VISIT!) I only have a small one-bedroom, but it's incredible how much little "stuff" I mean to organize that exists everywhere.<P>This book is like having an ORGANIZED mother at your elbow saying, "Honey, it's easy....Just try it THIS way."<P>And it's a pretty book. (Pretty enough to give to my best girlfriend without feeling like a criticism?) Feels good to the touch. I know that shouldn't be important. But when I'm handling something often it becomes part of the decision process of whether or not to use it, for me. <BR>And now that I've cleaned my fridge, I have room on the door for those cosmetics whose life is evidently lengthened by being refrigerated. (I mean this book leaves NO mess unturned!)Go know!</span>
