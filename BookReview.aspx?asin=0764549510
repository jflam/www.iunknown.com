                    <span>After reading the first 20-30 pages of this book, I found myself<br>so distracted by all of the typos and technical errors that I<br>couldn't continue with it.  It seems to me that an expert on<br>digital photography should be able to keep mega_pixels_ and<br>mega_bytes_ straight.  I got tired of mentions of 5MB cameras and<br>such.  There are numerous other examples, but I already returned<br>the book and can't cite them all from memory.<p>If you can overlook this, then I have a feeling the other reviews<p>that say this is good for beginners are on the mark.</span>

                    <span>...I've been an amateur photographer for 15 years, and my husband bought me a Canon Powershot A40 and this book for my birthday. I'm no stranger to photography, but I'm amazed at the effects I've already been able to achieve with Adobe Elements and the use of this book. I particularly appreciated the chapter on special effects and the one on cataloging and archiving images.</span>

                    <span>I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought the book.  I'd echo the sentiment that I was too advanced for the book.  The CD wasn't anything I could use either.  It was good in spots, but what I learned was really on a few pages.  If you just bought or thinking of buying, your first digital camera and goodies, then buy this book.<p>If you've been shooting for a while and using Photoshop, you'll learn a little, but wish you'd bought something else--like a lens or something, or a different book.<p>Beginners BUY THIS</span>

                    <span>Ok I work with digital cameras, printers and scanners for about 3 years now (professional as well as private life). The concept of digital photography is not new to me and there are few things that I'm unfamiliar with but... There are some settings, details or modes that I would like to try or set but just don't have time. This book will solve those problems. It will take you from basic settings and steps in technique and bump you up. So if all you want to do is print/scan basic proofs or shoot nighttime pictures you will be instructed what to do. But if you want to be more advanced, print better photos, shoot more interesting stuff all you have to do is read on... This book really covers everything; that's probably why it is $40. There are some stuff that you won't need. And if you know basics of photography, parts of the book will bore you but at the end you will have a knowledge that will allow you to improve your digital darkroom techniques. I'm really not looking for camera recommendations since I know what I want. Buyer has to be aware that examples of equipment used for demonstration may be little outdated right now. Same thing goes for camera/scanner recommendations at the end of the book. Digital bible should be used as photo guide not as an equipment recommendation source. Also one thing about the book is that author does not try to find solutions (sometimes). Some problems are solved with minimal intellectual involvement. Example: if there is a problem, tweaking will help (time consuming) but it is recommended that you have to go out and buy a $200 printer profile (much faster/less headache)...  I would love to see more of the day to day solutions from peoples personal experiences rather than strictly theoretical solutions (which work fine but cost $). I'm very satisfied with my purchase.</span>

                    <span>The Digital Photography Bible is intended for a beginner to low-intermediate digital photographer.  The book is very complete - which for some may be the reason you buy it.   For me, it was the reason I could not give it five stars.  <p>When I say the book is complete, I mean it covers every topic imaginable.   From selecting a digital camera (or scanner or printer) to the right imaging software to how to do basic editing on those programs.  This may be what potential buyers of this book are looking for: an all in one manual that gives you a great start and that can later be used for reference.  Unfortunately, I mistook the title for being a thorough reference that went beyond the basics.   This book may get you to the intermediate level of digital photography but it does not take you one step beyond that.   My expectations were for a more detailed look at some advanced techniques in later chapters.  In my estimation the book dedicates 80% to the beginning digital photographer and 20% to the intermediate.   <p>Some of the topics covered are:<p>1) Buying guide for digital camera, scanner, printer, and imaging/editing software. 2) Elementary photo techniques. 3) Pros and cons of using an IBM or MAC platform machine. 4) Basic imaging and editing techniques (primarily in Adobe PhotoShop). 5) BONUS:  CD-ROM containing "lite" versions of popular imaging software.<p>Overall, I rated this book four stars because it is full of information and worth the purchase if you fit in the beginner or low-intermediate category of digital photographers.  If you've been using a camera (film or digital) and PhotoShop for at least six months with good results, you don't need this book.  <p>BTW, I'm still waiting/looking for a intermediate to advanced level book if anyone has any recommendations, please e-mail me.</span>
