                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>   <p>   Its power and short learning curve have made Access Microsoft&#8217;s leading consumer relational database management system for desktop applications. VBA lets you tap more of that power, responding to application level events, displaying forms and reports, manipulating toolbars, and much more.   <p>   In this book, a crack team of programmers, including two Microsoft MVPs, shows you how to take control of Access 2003 or 2002 using VBA. You&#8217;ll learn to create and name variables, use DAO and ADO to manipulate data, handle errors correctly, create classes and use APIs, and more. An entire chapter is devoted to the changes in Access 2003, including new wizards and GUI features that previously required VBA code as well as new VBA features.   <p>   You&#8217;ll receive a thorough education in system security, macro security, and the Access Developer Extensions (ADE). You will discover how to access data with VBA, execute and debug VBA code, and use VBA with Access objects. Finally, you will learn more about the relationship between Access and SQL Server, and how to use VBA in Access to control and enhance other Office applications.   <p>   <b>What does this book cover?</b>   <p>   Here are some of the things you'll discover in this book:    <ul>    <li>How to take advantage of the built-in Access object library, using Access commands and executing them from any Access toolbar    <li>What you need to know to design your own classes, implement common APIs in your code, and use SQL to access data    <li>How to configure custom menus for your Access database applications    <li>Ways to transfer information between Access and Excel, Word, Outlook, and other Office programs    <li>How to show or hide entire sections of reports based on data entered on a form, or hide form fields based on database login information    <li>Object models you can use when writing VBA code in Access, and a list of common API functions to use in your code    </ul>   <p>   <b>Who is this book for?</b>   <p>   This book is a comprehensive resource for Access users and VBA developers who want to increase the power of Access using VBA. In addition to experience with VBA, you should have read at least one tutorial covering VBA for Access.    </span>

                    <span>This book is breezy enough in tone and works well enough as a programmer's reference but the rah-rah Access! delivery grates after a while. The authors are old school in that they introduce an end of life data access model (DAO) at length and then make endless and confusing references to it while they document the current initiative, ADO. (They spend 64 pages on DAO--a legacy object model useful only for desktop databases and 46 pages on ADO, the preferred model, an evolving technology for use with everything from desktop to enterprise.) These topics should be treated in isolation from one another as a side-by-side comparison is just unnecessarily confusing, especially for users of Access 2000/XP/2003. It's almost like their only intent is to prove how long they've been Access developers instead of providing the most streamlined and useful documentation--in other words, it's more about them than it is you. They're also big on their own received wisdom as opposed to accuracy like encouraging readers to document their code as if they were writing a bible because there is no speed hit involved--this isn't necessarily true. They also have a bad habit of not declaring variables in their sample code (with annoyingly trendy scenarios like "how many lattes can I buy?"), which is a cause for concern in a book about programming. There is useful, if overenthusiastic, coverage of the new features in Access 2003. If you're comfortable with the series and need a lengthy reference to complement the Microsoft Access help files, you'll find useful information here...with large swaths of information (hundreds of pages at a time) that you'll probably never use.</span>

                    <span>As an Access Developer this is one of my most used Access VBA reference books. All of the authors present the material in a good comprehensive manner for all levels of Access development. There are many clearly presented code examples and Access information that will assist in all levels of development. <BR>There are many good chapters in the book; however don't overlook the Appendices as they are exceptional.(Note: Appendix I "Tips and Tricks") I know most Access Developers are selective in the books they buy. If you scan this book you will see how much above other VBA reference books this particular book is.</span>

Intro to Access. <P>2. Access, VBA, and Macros. <P>3. New Features in 2003 (and 2002). <P>4. VBA Basics. <P>5. Using the VBA Editor. <P>6. Using DAO to Access Data. <P>7.

                    <span>This is a very special book. The authors obviously went way out of their way to include everything that you could need to be a successful Access developer. As far as I know, this extensive reference material has never before been assembled in one place. As a result, it is just the right thing for aspiring intermediate and advanced users of Microsoft Access. Even many developers with extensive experience will be surprised at what can finally become clear to them by checking out what this reference makes available. You'd have to search the Microsoft and other sites for weeks to assemble all this on your own.<P>This well-written reference covers everything from VBA basics to using the new Access Developer Extensions, which are part of Visual Studio Tools for the Microsoft Office System. In between it also covers error handling, enhancing forms, enhancing reports, SQL coding, and even working with the Windows Registry. The appendices go all the way from A to L, or from Upgrading of Access (what other book covers this subject at all, never mind so thoroughly?) to VBA Reserved Words.<P>I have never seen such comprehensive reference material! And is it loaded with tips, tips, tips! The authors have obviously lived in the trenches with Access for some time. They know what to watch out for. They know what kind of protocols you should set up yourself to boost your success.<P>It took the experience of four co-authors and several other contributors to bring this work together. Patricia, Teresa, Graham and Armen have provided a unique Access reference that will get you up and going fast and save you scads of time that you would otherwise have wasted learning "the hard way" or, at best, wasted digging through a multitude of written and online references. This is a special, one-of-a kind reference work!</span>
