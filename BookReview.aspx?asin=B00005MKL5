                <span id="Label1">For dino lovers of all stripes, this Discovery Channel special delivers an entertaining documentary about what it was like to live in the land of giants. Combining nature photography and computer graphics, the program brings the dinosaurs--all of which lived on the North American continent of yore--to life. The 90-minute showcase explores dinosaurs with a narrative-story style similar to that used in BBC's <I>Walking with Dinosaurs</I>. The program includes quick, informative bits by paleontologists in the field, and shows nifty 3-D cross-sections of a dinosaur muscle and skeleton structures. Although it's quite fun to see what prehistoric America may have looked like (a typical opening slide: "Philadelphia, 300 million years ago"), the film doesn't have the technical expertise or fluidity of its BBC successor. Due to some dinosaur chomping, this program is not suited for children younger than 8. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>I absolutely loved "Walking With Dinosaurs." While this DVD isn't as good as that set it still is a great DVD. It has a very similar feel (like a Natural Geographic Special). The graphics are excellent but not as good as WWD. In some areas you can find imperfections. I like that they found some really interesting new locations; new woods that look like they were in the dinosaur times. <P>The naration is one of the bigger detractors from the film. John Goodman? Come on? Why? Because he was in the Flinstones? Not even close to the standard set in WWD.<P>There was some re-use of backgrounds and animations of some scenes which made me say, "hey, I saw that already, all they did was mirror the scene." <P>The pacing was perfect and the few but insightful palentologist comments were well done. The length was good. Another good thing was that there were some new dinosaurs in this DVD that we haven't previously seen.<P>Overall, the DVD is great, offered new info, showed dinos with feathers, and continued the trend started by WWD. I highly recommend it for any audience. Also the price is right.</span>

                    <span>When Dinosaurs Roamed America is a movie similar to "Walking with Dinosaurs", it shows dinosaurs made with computer animation in a documentary style (like nature shows). Since both movies are similar, a fair comparison can be made. The computer animation is excellent just as in WWD. The music is average classical stlye, but not as good as WWD. The narrator in this movie is, Mr. John Goodman, who did a pretty good job, but does not match the excellent narration of the one in WWD. A few other things kind falters in this movie, "When Dinosaurs Roamed America": it's very short, it has similar scenes to WWD, they even took similar narration lines. Overall it's a very good movie but lacks the poetic beauty of Walking with Dinosaurs DVD, but it's still a good purchase.</span>

                    <span>It is difficult to grade this 90 minute film without mentioning Walking With Dinosaurs which was fantastic (5 star effort) and runs along a comparable story line. When Dinosaurs Roamed America was clearly done with a tight budget in mind -- the graphics are clearly (or rather unclearly) computer generated, often awkward and not persuasively "real". The raptors however are done well and the overall story lines seem reasonably thought out and logical for the viewer. I dislike the moderator John Goodman who brings a Roseann-type blue collar "image" to the viewer. Almost anyone else would have been much better. Overall, I think the product was not intended to be bought for a collector's shelf. It is akin quality wise to a made-for-tv movie, intended to be watched once, and only once. A bland, average product far inferior to the "Walking With" series.</span>

                    <span>A hastily put together c-grade Walking with Dinosaurs knock-off by the Discovery Channel, obviously cannot compete in any area with the BBC's production. If you're really into dinosaurs you might want to check it out, but even then you'll be hard pressed to stay interested in this sub-par effort.</span>

                    <span>I got this video for my son when he was 3 and started really getting into dinosaurs. He's probably watched it 50 times and is still engrossed every time. I like that it not only shows the computer animated dinosaurs with narratives, but features many of today's experts on this topic sharing their thoughts. It's also helped both of us learn the pronunciations of the longer dinosaur names. Though not perfect, I'd much rather my kids watch reality-based programming like this than that ridiculous Land Before Time series. (Believe me, you can tell which kids watch the fluff and which ones watch documentaries.)</span>
