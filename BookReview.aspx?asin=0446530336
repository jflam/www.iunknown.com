                    <span>Be sure to write your name in the front of this book!  For anyone who has ever been involved in a small organization of presumably well-intentioned people, this novel strikes a chord.  Its a terrific "summer reading", with a good pace and well-thought-out story lines.  You will love the characters, each of whom seems familiar in some way.  I've lost two copies now, loaned out to family members who re-loaned to their own church friends -- but that's OK with me.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Bowen has done it again with Second Sunday!  I thought Church Folk was a comical look into the black church and Second Sunday provides yet another glimpse into what could be anyone's church.  The book touches on the political manueverings, family drama, relationship issues and more. . this book has it all.  It has the characters like Cleavon Johnson that you just love to hate, as well as the goody-two-shoes, high-rollers.  All in all, if you like a good wholesome read, look no further than Second Sunday.</span>

                    <span>This book was reccommend by a friend and according to her, it was fantastic. So When I first picked up this book at the library, I decided to give it a try, As  I started to read, it got funnier and funnier, that then I couldn't put it down. I am almost sorry that I didn't read this book sooner. <p>The book is about the lives of the people in Gesthemane Church in the outskirts of Illnois, around 1975. The 100th anniversary is slowly approaching and the pastor suddenly dies. Now it is up to the deacons to pick a new minister(they couldn't pick a good pastor, if it smacked them right between the eyes!!)  much to the women's (of the church) dismay. So to help pick out the "right" pastor, the ladies of the church enlist the help of a former party girl, Sheila Cochran. Sheila defintlely knows the difference between smooth operator and an honorable man. It is then where the "fun" begins. When the church finally gets the right minister (George Wilson)there are certain people (Cleavon Johnson to name one) who are against him from the start and want to make sure that he doesn't become "permanent."<p>The book has some very funny moments.  One example were the first two ministers that were considerd (read the book to understand what I am talking about). Another moment came when the whole church boycotted against the new minister, Earl Hamilton that was chosen (an Uncle Tom is what they called him). Any church would have responded the same way.  My favorite part was when Mozelle stood up to her no good cheat of a husband Oscar (and the former church janitor) for his philandering ways and for being such a pompous ass.  <p>I laughed and laughed as I read this book. The book will have you smiling because if anyone goes to church (especially a black church),could picture your own church being exactly like this!! Oh, and the part about the church having thier own FBI or black spy network (everybody knowing about everybody's business) within the church is sooo true.</span>

                    <span>Second Sunday, hit home for me in many ways.  My church is almost like this one, except the money issue.  This story made you want to jump back into time and attend this special church.  I loved all the women in the story, and found them to be the most intriguing.  The fact that they got their husbands to really think straight about the decisions they were going to make, really stood out.  I loved the way Michele wove in different stories about love, marriage, and hope, and referred back to the church.  If more people would depend on the Lord, instead of themseleves, they would be very surprised!!!  This is one book that I'm recommending for everyone to read.  Even my grandmother read it!!!  She found it to be hilarious.  I thought this book was a lot more realistic than "Church Folks". It just seemed more likely to happen, then pimps as preachers.  Not saying there aren't a lot of crooked preachers out there, this just didn't seem realistic.  But in Second Sunday, I could best believe most of what happened up in there.  I was very impressed.  Thanks Michele for a hilarious, and thoughtful read!</span>
