                    <span>I must admit to being mightily disappointed with this book. I have heard of the spread of this "Geo-mancy", and am rather appalled that it is gaining ground in the West, where we have spent a thousand years throwing off the shackles of primitive witch-doctoring. I thought that this book was "Feng Shui is for Dummies", but instead it is about the primitive practice instead.
<br />
<br />So, if you are a fool, and have some money you wish to be parted from buy this book.

                    <span>Why are some reviewers here so hostile that they almost seem to be venting their anger here? Feng Shui is a philosophy... it may not be a religion, but it is a philosophy, so it requires a certain amount of belief from you if you want to make use of what it has to offer. If you don't believe in it, fine... just sell your book secondhand through Amazon Marketplace.. why get frustrated??
<br />
<br />Personally I think this book is not the best out there on Feng Shui. Hanging crystals everywhere is plain silly-looking and hanging baguas around the house give me a creepy feeling, not to mention that guests might feel the same, etc.
<br />
<br />With over 300 Feng Shui titles sold in the market, it can be very tricky deciding which book to buy. Some people buy them for the beautiful colours and pictures of the examples in the books, others for the knowledge. If you're like me wanting to really get into the subject and apply it to your interior designing, there are much better Feng Shui books sold out there which give a much more proper treatment of the subject - you won't feel silly after reading them. They are "The Complete Idiot's Guide To Feng Shui" by Elizabeth Moran and "A Master Course In Feng Shui" by Eva Wong. And if you want to know more, "Flying Star Feng Shui Made Easy" by David Twicken is good and so is "The Living Earth Manual of Feng Shui : Chinese Geomancy" by Stephen Skinner are really great books geared to the Western reader with authentic Oriental knowledge.
<br />
<br />I am agnostic (I don't believe the existence of God can be proven although I don't rule it out either) but I found Feng Shui to be a deeply spiritual subject with close links to form and functionality of objects and space, and aesthetics. I have a great deal of interest in design... so I was drawn to Feng Shui initially for its value in interior design. I believe that every man's home is his temple and sacred space. Feng Shui incorporated with interior design has helped me make my modest home into a shelter which not only looks and feels aesthetically pleasing, it has a beneficial effect on my well-being as well. Its a bit common-sensical. When you walk into a house and something doesn't feel right, trust your instincts and leave. Don't buy the house. But if you already own it, you can make it a nicer place to live in. Feng Shui doesn't demand that you surround yourself with gold and expensive items in the home. You can always adapt it to suit your budget and needs. Read some good Feng Shui books, and get yourself a compass from the hiking shop... and have fun designing!</span>

                    <span>This is ridiculous!  The book is only 3x3 inches at the most and I feel it was a ripoff.  Save your money.  This was a waste of time and money for me and I feel like pitching it out.</span>

                    <span>If only I'd purchased this book sooner. Believe me, there is more clear and practical information in this book then in the many workshops I've attended, costing me hundreds of dollars. <br>In trying to learn feng shui, I have been frustrated by the lack of clarity surrounding this subject. Other books I own, review a lot of history and theory, but lack when it comes down to implementation or assume that you know more about the subject then is actually written in the book. Not this book.<br>Feng Shui for Dummies is well written, has humor and leads you step-by-step in each situation, just what a do-it-yourself book is intended to do. <br>This book does what it is suppose to do, teaches the novice how to implement basic feng shui one step at a time. HOORAH! <br>If your the kind of person that purchases a do-it-yourself book to get things done, not to be bogged down with theory then this is the book for you.</span>
