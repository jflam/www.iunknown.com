                <span id="Label1">The Pocket Consultant series has begun to earn a good name for itself,  as an increasing number of system administrators discover that the books are  generally of top quality and consistently long on detail. <I>Microsoft Exchange  2000 Server Administrator's Pocket Consultant</I> fits in with its mates,  providing concise but complete coverage of Microsoft's latest back-end product  for workplace collaboration. The goal isn't to teach about Exchange 2000 Server  or explain how it fits into an organization's computing infrastructure--instead,  the goal is to document the entire server package concisely, enough to jog the  memory of an administrator who needs to perform some task or be reminded of how  a feature works.<p>  In a typical section, the book takes on the intricacies of the Exchange 2000  Server data stores. After a speedy but accurate introduction to what each store  is for and how it works, the book outlines recommendations (several, actually,  each suited for an organization of a particular size and with specific  performance requirements) for fitting databases onto disks and protecting those  disks with RAID schemes. Coverage of the Exchange 2000 Server database  infrastructure is detailed similarly: there's background information, for  example, about the performance advantages of zeroing out deleted database pages,  and steps to follow for scheduling indexing jobs. More information on  customizing Outlook--the most popular client for Exchange 2000 Server--with  Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) would have made this book better, but it is  strong as it stands. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, from the  administrator's perspective <li>The relationship between Exchange 2000 Server  and Active Directory <li>Management of users and groups <li>Management of online  and offline address lists <li>Database design and upkeep <li>Server optimization  <li>Message routing</ul></span>

                    <span>Hats off to author William Stanek for another fine Pocket Consultant. I have 5 of these books in my library now (Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Exchange 2000, SQL Server 7 and SQL Server 2000.) Since I picked up the first Pockete Consultant a yaer ago I haven't found a daily administration question that wasn't answered. You'll find that Exchange 2000 Server Pocket Consultant is more of the same. The attention to detail and the focus on day to day administration tasks is fantastic! <P>Mr. Stanek always starts with an overview of the subject of discussion and then digs right in. I've found that this book (and the rest in the series) answer 100% of my questions quickly and meanwhile the 1,000 page luggables used by my colleagues just get them frustrasted. I've made quite a few converts in the office.<P>The nice thing about these books is the day to day focus. You get what you need to accomplish your task spelled out clearly and concisely in a style that I've found that only Mr. Stanek can deliver. It is refreshing. Now I'm not saying the books are pefrect. If you need to learn from scratch this isn't the answer. Look elsewhere. If you need to brush up and extend your skills to new stuff (like going from Exchange 5.5 to Exchange 2000), is a good choice. If you need a book to help with day to day, is a good choice. If you need a book to put in your backpack and carry with you, is a good choice.<P>Last I want to say thank you to Mr. Stanek. Thank you, I'm looking forward to more. --JW</span>

                    <span>Out of all the Exchange 2000 Server books I purchased, this one is the only one I used regularly. I have since purchased Stanek's Exchange Server 2003 book and it is equally as good if not better. For admins, it provides the essential details with clear, precise steps for implementing common features. For devs, it provides the cut to the chase info you need to get in there and get out quickly. I would recommend this very highly.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for our Exchange admin when we were moving to Exchange 2000 from 5.5. Two months later I was going to be the one implementing Exchange and this book came to the rescue in a big way. As a total Exchange newbie I learned everything I needed (and now know) about Exchange from this book. Sure there are bigger books but not better books. If you are a Exchange guru, this book will be a little on the basic side for you. However, if you are anything less than a guru or if you are a new I would highly recommend this book.</span>

As an Exchange Administrator, I have already found this book to be an invaluable asset in my reference library. Answers to many common administrative questions and "How To's" are easily found in this handy little volume. You gotta love its size.</span>

                    <span>I had a need to quickly resolve a problem with Exchange 2000 Server, having never worked with it before. This book was an excellent resource for that purpose. Not because it gave me the exact answer I needed (which I doubt many books would do) but because it clearly and concisely explained what you can do with Exchange 2000 Server and how to do it. It showed how to do things properly and from that it was fairly easy to deduce what was wrong.<P>Because the book is well structured (no excess verbage, no "chattiness") it's easy to read, clear and to the point. It gets to the point and stays on target.<P>All in all an excellent reference you'll use over and over and, I think, an excellent place to start learning Exchange 2000 Server. I find that this book tells what Exchange 2000 Server can do and how to do it. With that knowledge I think you'll be better grounded if and when you go for more in depth understanding of architecture and the like. After this book, if you want more in depth information you can move on to other (bigger) books but I think you'll get the biggest bang for the buck from this one..</span>
