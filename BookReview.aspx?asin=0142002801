                <span id="Label1">The Red Army's invasion of Berlin in January 1945 was one of the most terrifying examples of fire and sword in history. Frenzied by terrible memories of Wehrmacht and SS brutality, the Russians wreaked havoc, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and millions more fleeing westward. Drawing upon newly available material from former Soviet files, as well as from German, American, British, French, and Swedish archives, bestselling author Antony Beevor vividly recounts the experiences of the millions of civilians and soldiers caught up in the nightmare of the Third Reich's final collapse. <i>The Fall of Berlin 1945</i> is a heartrending story of pride, stupidity, fanaticism, revenge, and savagery, yet it is also one of astonishing human endurance, self-sacrifice, and survival against all odds.</span>

                    <span>Like Cornelius Ryan's "The Last Battle" and John Toland's "The last Hundred Days", this terrific new book by acclaimed British historian Antony Beevor ("Stalingrad") is both an entertaining thought piece and an incredibly well researched and infinitely detailed description of the fall of Berlin at the end of World War Two. Plagued by food and heating fuel shortages, endangered by increasingly devastating bombardment from a sky full of Allied planes, and badgered by the frantic desperation of the Nazi leadership, the people of Berlin awaited the denouement of the long raging conflict and the terrible retribution they felt certain would rage from the Russians, who had been savaged themselves at the hands of the Wehrmacht during the blitzkrieg of 1941-42. When their moment came, the Soviets ruthlessly pursued it to ensure taking the last full measure of terror.<P>With strict (but secret) orders from Hitler to quickly annihilate what he and the Nazi leadership considered to be the "subhuman Slavs" in order to make "liebenstraum" (living room) for future German colonization, the Germans had conducted a campaign of such staggering and unparalleled brutality, of such senseless slaughter during their sweep east toward Stalingrad and Moscow that afterward the Russians literally seethed with a profound bloodlust, aching for a chance at revenge. Now that the tide had turned and the Soviet army was flooding over the eastern borders of the fatherland, their chance had arrived, and the day of reckoning was fast approaching. <P>Beevor's treatment of the story of the fall of Berlin in 1945 is rich with detail and anecdotal information, which helps bring the story to life, putting a human face on the horrific specifics of life in a city under siege. While Hitler cowered deep beneath the city in his bunker, fantasizing about his imminent rescue, Zhukov's Russian shock troops were encircling the city. Yet, it never deteriorated into a situation of "every man for himself'. The author's narrative is filled with examples of individual bravery and personal sacrifice for the benefit of others. Amid the savagery and carnage that surrounded them, ordinary men and women went about their ruined lives, just trying as best they could to survive. Yet hundreds of thousands perished, succumbing to the numbing effect of shelling, bombs, fires, gun-battles and random rape, victims of a half-starved and hate-filled foe hell-bent on bloody revenge. <P>The author masterfully employs previously unavailable Soviet and German archives to thread a storyline very well told. In so doing, Beevor delivers a very compelling vision of the people and events that shaped the progressive collapse of Berlin under the constant bombardment and attacks of the Russian army, and the horror that awaited ordinary Berliners in the line of fire. What he gives us is an indelibly colored portrait of a time of great pitch and moment in the history of the modern world, a snapshot of two titans, the Germans and Russians, locked in mortal combat in one of the great cities of Europe. The aftermath of that struggle was felt for decades afterward. This is a well-written and very carefully researched book, one that added to my personal knowledge of the history of the Second World War. I heartily recommend it. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Anthony Beever's book on Stalingrad is a very, very good study of that campaign, one of the best World War Two books to come out in recent years. Compared to that book, the Fall of Berlin is a disappointment. Beever's book focuses on a number of story lines, all of which could have been books in and of themselves - the military campaign itself, Soviet strategy in the final days of the war, the plight of civilians, and the last days of the Nazi party and its principle players. Because of this, the book seems hurried and superficial. Treatment of the actual military campaign suffered because of this. I found myself constantly wishing the book would go into greater detail.<P>Still, its a well-written, interesting and informative book. I particulary enjoyed the plight of the German Civilian population. Like many other reviewers, I had never truly grasped the magnitude of the harm inflicted on them by the Red Army. While this is set forth in some detail, Beever does a good job of tying this back into the treatment of the Russian Population by the German Army after the 1941 invasion. I find it interesting that some of the reviewers below are so offended by the depiction of Soviet atrocities. While these do not lessen the horrors committed by the Nazi's, they certainly should be brought to light.</span>

                    <span>This book adds nothing to what Cornelius Ryan wrote in 1966. In fact, Ryan's book is vastly superior since Beevor had no first-hand access to participants. This hurts the book's immediacy; Beevor himself is so far removed from events that everything is reported in a rather detatched fasion. Ideed, his personal accounts are second-hand at best, typically with sparse documentation to assure us of authenticity. This concerns me greatly, as one of the main points of Beevor's book seems to be to document the suffering of German civilians at the hands of the Red Army. Therefore, as a social history, the book is sorely lacking in both immediacy and believability.<P>On the military aspects, Beevor is also lacking. It is clear he does not understand issues of command, operations, or tactics. Consequently, as a military history, the book fails.<P>I do not recommend this book; instead read Ryan's "The Last Battle" for the more social aspects, and Le Tissier's "Race for the Reichstag" for the actual battle.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to find out how an army and a nation can keep fighting when all's lost, and this book gave the facts. But I wish it offered more of the human side: the gallows humor of the Berliners was a needed, if too sporadic reminder, of the day-to-day struggle we too often forget in a dehumanized enemy. A Soviet is quoted as being amazed that, faced with the loss of their parents amidst burning buildings, the German children cried just like their Russian counterparts had done. The Soviet is amazed at this similarity, after having been indoctrinated about the savagery of their enemy on every level and at every age.<P>The forest battles outside Berlin and the clash at the Seelow escarpment are the most vivid parts of this narrative. Beevor has done his homework, and has sprinkled into his military text of this general went here and this division came there the human accounts, but still, having finished Guy Sajer's "The Forgotten Soldier" (a French-German soldier on the Eastern Front, the end of which overlaps in the East Prussia campaign with Beevor's text), I missed more of the personal vividness of a memoir. I realize Beevor sets out to give an all-encompasssing account in a few hundred pages, and he does his job well, but I wish those he quotes so often, like Vasily Grossman for the Soviets, could be heard even more so. 11-13 million fled East Prussia, but even his research doesn't make their stories come alive enough, nor those of the Soviets who pursued the Germans into defeat.<P>One element emerges clearly, however: Stalin's ability to hoodwink the Allies, especially FDR, and devour Poland and what would become the GDR. It's amazing to think how gullible the U.S. was, played for fools by the "liberating" Soviet armies. For this, Beevor deserves full credit for his analyses.</span>

                    <span>It's one ugly story indeed but it is one which must be told. January of 1945 brought a firestorm of mythic proportions onto the German Reich and effectively turned the dreams of Hitler inside out as Germany, at least half of it, became the vassal state of Russia. Anthony Beevor, in my opinion, is the strongest historian writing today. He colors this narrative with geographical fact, poignant memories, and a steady, consistent pace. I was so impressed with him after Stalingrad that I bought a signed edition of The Fall of Berlin for a few bucks more. I notice that it's available along with Stalingrad for 23 bucks, and, if you're not familiar with any of his work, it'll be the best 23 bucks you'll ever spend to buy them both.</span>
