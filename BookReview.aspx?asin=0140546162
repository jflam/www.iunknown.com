                    <span>I really love the book "Bringing The Rain to Kapiti Plain," by Verna Aardema. I have enjoyed it so much that I am planning to give it as a gift to my sister who has two young children, ages 4 and 7. This is a simple story about a cattle herdsman and his wish for rain on the African plain. The narrative structure of the story is based on a sequence of events that builds suspense and interest in children until the end of the story. This is a memorable story; it is very simple to understand and has a powerful musical quality that, as a young adult, I enjoy reading aloud. The rhymes and rhythms are so strong that all young children will be wide eyed with suspense and interest until the very end of the story. I particularly enjoyed one line where the author rhymes "fat" and "Ki-pat": "So the grass grew green/ And the cattle fat!/ And Ki-pat got a wife/ And a little Ki-pat-." This story is suitable for young children because its tone is happy. It deals with the relationship of humans with water, plants and animals. Scientifically, it is unconceivable, but 4- to 8-year-old children do not have to understand the facts of science. From this book, however, they will learn about the connection between humans and nature by enjoying the colored pictures. The pictures are so vibrant that it is easy to imagine the world of Ki-pat. As an adult, I enjoy this book because it describes the cycle of life in a very interesting way. Readers of all ages will see that human life is totally dependent upon nature, and the existence of human beings without nature is nearly impossible. Readers will also learn how the lives of humans and animals are dependent on rain; people and animals need each other and every part of nature for their perfect existence. I highly recommend Verna Aardema's "Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain" to anyone who has young children and is looking for a book that illustrates the relationship between nature and human beings. The colorful, detailed pictures will keep the children interested while they are learning about the connection between nature and human beings.</span>

                    <span>The PBS show "Reading Rainbow" featured this book; James Earl Jones read it; I fell in love with it and have been giving it as a gift to friends ever since. The gentle story unfolds line by line, with a tender rhythm that entrances: "These are the cows, all hungry and dry, Who mooed for the rain to fall from the sky..." Ultimately Ki-pat, who's watching his herd, brings rain to Kapiti Plain by launching an arrow into the sky. But the charm is in the telling. My 11-year-old still obliges me and lets me read it to him every once in a while.</span>

                    <span>The Bringing The Rain to Kapiti Plain, by Verna Aardema pictures by, Beatriz Vidal is about. The Kapiti Plain when there is no rainfall there and all the animals are dehydrated. Little boy's dad is sick and cannot shot the rain down form the big black cloud above the Kaptit Plain. So the little boy has to do the job for his sick dad. <BR>I think little kids would be interested it this book because it help to understand some or little world around you. It teaches you to care for some animals and to help people that need some help.</span>

                    <span>I was just looking for it today (unsuccessfully), even though I'm thirteen. I love looking back on all those picture/rhyme books, and this has to be one of my favorites. It's one of those books that is meant to be read aloud! The words roll off your tounge. The pictures are rather amusing, too.</span>
