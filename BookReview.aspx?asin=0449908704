                    <span>The title of Halberstam's book should clue the reader in to his focus. The Best and the Brightest's focus is on the the American Political and Military Leadership in the 1960's. The backdrop of the book is the Vietnam war and it is against this particularly tumultous backdrop that Halberstam weaves his story about the men of the American political establishment. This book should not really be counted as a history book, for the focus is less on the events than on the people who made the decisions which led to these events. Perhaps better classified as political science, the book is most valuable in providing an insight to the personalities, aspirations, fears and humanity of the leaders who are often presented in cardboard fashion by the news media.
<br />
<br />In fact I would recommend against reading this book as a first primer on Vietnam. Halberstam leaps from place to place and he casually mentions events and names that the reader must be familiar with as to not be lost. However, once a solid understanding of the history is in place, Halberstam's book provides a deeper analysis of the decisions that led to the war. Often times, history describes what has happened, but rarely is the answer of why something happened answered or even approached. We all know that America became involved in Vietnam, but why? What were the policy makers thinking when they decided to escalate the war? 
<br />
<br />Halberstam's book is a insicive look at the operation and function of the government beauracracy that runs our nation. Behind the idealism, the proclaimations, the showy patriotism, lies men with the failings of frailties of each and everyone of us. The fear of rejection, the need to please a superior drove the decisions that led to Vietnam more than policy or strategy. It is scary to know and realize that in our day of computers, technology and trillion dollar defense budgets, that the decisions made on war and peace are still up to only a few men controled by the same human tendencies as the rest of us. Even the most rational man of the Kennedy era were not beyond human fears and hopes.
<br />
<br />In summary, read this book not to understand the history of the Vietnam war, but to understand the America political system.</span>

                    <span>David Halberstam's "The Best and the Brightest" is a mostly angry, but occasionally sympathetic book about the can-do activists of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.  I think this is one of the best books written about the Vietnam War.  If you read it today, you will think about Iraq and feel very sad.  
<br />
<br />In a way, this is a book in search of a hero and there was perhaps no one in the country with more power than Kennedy to influence the way Americans saw Vietnam and Communism.  He had made a speech at American University where he asked Americans and Soviets alike to reexamine their attitude towards each other, but that kind of talk was rare, and it was a speech, Halberstam suggests, that would not have happened had Kennedy not proven his toughness during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Kennedy, of course had enormous doubts about Vietnam; they were based in large part on his reading of history and his own experiences.  But those doubts existed during a time of unreal pressures.  The culprit is the Korean War and the fall of China to Communism.  The fall of China, in particular, would have a profound effect on the American people.  It would spark a great debate about who had lost China, and while there was no consensus (some believed that China was never ours to lose and that those events were beyond our control), the State Department and the Democratic Party would take most of the blame.  According to Halberstam, the result of all of this was devastating.  From then on, U.S. Presidents would find themselves under enormous pressure to not lose any more countries.   
<br />
<br />"If there were problems", writes Halberstam "the Administration would somehow glide around them, letting time rather than political candor or courage do the healing.  It was a belief that if there were scars from the period (and both the Democratic party and the Department of State were deeply scarred), they were by now secret scars, and if there were victims, they were invisible victims.  If one looked away and did not talk about them, somehow they would go away.  Yet the truth was altogether different: the scars and victims were real and the McCarthy period had frozen American policies on China and Asia.  The Kennedy administration would in no way come to terms with the aberrations of those policies; it had not created them, as its advocates pointed out, but it did not undo them, either."

                    <span>The Best and the Brightest is an 816-page tome about the men who came to power under Kennedy and continued to serve under Johnson.  The men who were supposedly the brightest and most able men ever assembled by a President.  The men who led their country into the disastrous Vietnam war.
<br />
<br />Halberstam spent over two years interviewing people to write this book and he clearly did his research.  His writing shows a clear understanding of the region, history, politics and players.  Despite some repetitive or dry sections, most of the book is surprisingly fast-moving and well written.  
<br />
<br />In an effort to portray a complete picture of the players, there are a lot of men covered, not all of whom seem critical.  I felt I could use an organizational chart or a quick reference section at the end to remember who was who and what their role was.
<br />
<br />Though written over 30 years ago, this book's lessons are still relevant today.  Halberstam teaches readers about the restrictions on speaking up against China policy, then Vietnam.  He tells of how the officials demanded patriotism, opposing viewpoints were closed off, considered non-patriotic, their proponents excluded from access to power.  The lesson is the importance of debate, of being open to information (bad news as well as good), of the difficulty many people have in holding on to their principles when power is at stake.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the greatest lesson of the book is that "best and brightest" is a relative term.  Even the seemingly most perfect people have flaws that can have disastrous consequences, especially in situations where dissent is discouraged and problems are papered over.  And also, that best and the brightest in the 1960s was an exclusive word, limited to ambitious white men, most of whom craved power and were afraid to make mistakes.  If the definition of best and brightest had been more inclusive, if different types of intelligent and thoughtful people had been allowed access to decision-making, the results might have been different.
<br />  
<br />For those interested in how decisions were made from the American side, in how a group of smart men could make such serious mistakes, this is a book worth reading.

                    <span>Halberstam is obviously a very talented writer.  He's one of the best in the business at character and personality descriptions.  His portrayal of LBJ here is excellent.  Johnson was a hilarious man.
<br />
<br />But there are some problems here.  This book reads like a first draft, not a final one.  Halberstam didn't have a good editor to clean this up.  Some passages meander way too long, the narrative is a little disorganized, and entire sections could have been removed.  I'd say about one-third of the material here is unneccesary.
<br />
<br />Also, Halberstam's hero worship of Ho is plain wierd.  Ho was a terrible man who for example, executed over 100,000 without trial, but that's not the way he's portrayed here.  My question for Halberstam would be if Uncle Ho was such a great leader, why did two million boat people try to escape from his rule?  
<br />
<br />And for Halberstam, there are no shades of grey when comparing the North and South Vietamese armies.  The northern army is made up of heroes and patriots.  The southern army is incompetent and corrupt.  The Vietnam War was more complicated than that, but Halberstam doesn't want to hear any of that.  The North are the "good guys," and the South are the "bad guys," and that's that.
<br />
<br />Also, Halberstam's description of Westmoreland's strategy of the war is off target.  He calls Westmoreland a conventional man who used conventional stategy in an unconventional war.  Actually, Westmoreland was conventional man who used unconventional stategy.  In Vietnam, he abandoned classic military doctrine of seizing territory in favor of attrition.  Westmoreland's critics contend that a more conventional military strategy may have been more successful in Vietnam.
<br />
<br />A fascinating, but flawed book.  Basically, if you like communism and dictators, and despise freedom and democracy, this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>The problem with a book that was written as far back as this is that new events hadn't come to light and those who knew what they were talking about didn't get a chance to say it. Do you ask an American journalist living safely back in the US whether communism was bad. Or do you ask a refugee who just escaped from Vietnam whether Americans fighting in Vietnam was wortwhile. Or even better yet, how about asking an American teenager from California who lived in Vietnam from the Tet Offensive of 1968 until the pull out of troops in 1972, who later became a fledglin photojournalist who sneaked into Vietnam to find out the truth of what happened, something those well paid journalists like Halberstam would never risk doing once they got famous. Read stories about Vietnam from very unfamous journalists who were held for 11 months ONLY because they were American, and then you've got the story of what really happened in Vietnam. 
<br />
<br />It's called "The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War". Maybe Halberstam should interview Cork Graham about his memoir. Maybe many more journalist should get out of their "good old boy" network and see what the world has offered and then "The Best And Brightest" would be a lot more accurate and there wouldn't be such an avoidance of noting sources. I guess it's all perspective. One American journalist pals around with generals and officers speculatingon the communist threat and then there were those who really believed in what they were doing because they'd seen what had happened in North Vietnam, Africa, and Cuba. And then when we lost, they saw what many never saw except those who paying attention in countries like Nicaragua, Poland, El Salvador.
<br />
<br />Sure get "The Best and Brightest" if you want to know about what people guessed about Vietnam before 1975, and then IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED in Vietnam read "The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War" by Cork Graham and you'll get what was missed by us over here. You'll get an American's personal perspective of what only a Vietnamese political prisoner could know. And then you can follow along with Graham as he continues reporting in Central America and gets so disgusted with how it was turning into another Vietnam debacle through the assistance of continued inaccurate reporting that he became the second American trained by the US Navy SEALs and participated in that war as a corpsman. Sure refreshing than rehashing reason for why we lost, instead of seeing how we could have won as evidenced by the American victory in Central America--only the ignorant or those who've never left the US on anything other than a "fact finding junket" would say that there wasn't a Domino Theory. What do you call what happened Central America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia? No domino theory, then why were American weapons lost in Vietnam in 1975 turning up as arms of the communist FLMN in El Salvador, having been shipped to Nicaragua and smuggled across the Gulf of Fonseca. Cold War. . .right! How about HOT WAR!</span>
