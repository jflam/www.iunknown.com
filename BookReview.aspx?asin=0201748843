                <span id="Label1"><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 3.0//EN"><HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Untitled</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>Named after the Monty Python comedy troupe, Python is an interpreted, open-source, object-oriented programming language. It's also free and runs portably on Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and other operating systems. Python can be used for all manner of programming tasks, from CGI scripts to full-fledged applications. It is gaining popularity among programmers in part because it is easier to read (and hence, debug) than most other programming languages, and it's generally simpler to install, learn, and use. Its line structure forces consistent indentation. Its syntax and semantics make it suitable for simple scripts and large programs. Its flexible data structures and dynamic typing allow you to get a lot done in a few lines. To learn it, you'll need is some basic programming experience and a copy of Python: Visual QuickStart Guide.<P>In patented Visual QuickStart Guide fashion, the book doesn't just tell you how to use Python to develop applications, it shows you, breaking Python into easy-to-digest, step-by-step tasks and providing example code. <B>Python: Visual QuickStart Guide</B> emphasizes the core language and libraries, which are the building blocks for programs. Author Chris Fehily starts with the basics -  expressions, statements, numbers, strings - then moves on to lists, dictionaries, functions, and modules before wrapping things up with straightforward discussions of exceptions and classes. Some additional topics covered include:- Object-oriented programming- Working in multiple operating systems- Structuring large programs- Comparing Python to C, Perl, and Java- Handling errors gracefully.</P></BODY></HTML></span>

                    <span>This book lives up to it's promise of being a visual quickstart guide. The concepts are explained clearly with tons of examples - in fact, there are very few pages that don't have examples. The 'Tips' sections are pretty useful. The book is also tastefully laid out and the publishers have stuffed the pages with just the right amount of information.  If you are a programmer trying to come up to speed on Python over a weekend, then this is the book for you. Folks who send lot of time in airports or trains might also want to consider this book. Diligently reading this book and trying the examples, should give the reader a solid foundation in Python basics. The author has done an amazing job.</span>

                    <span>I purchased and read several Python books.  Python Visual Quickstart Guide made for somewhat dry reading first time through.  But when I sat down to write my first Python program, I soon found that this was the book I wanted open in front of me all the time.  The book covers all the basics.  Between the table of contents, the index, and the way the book is organized, finding what you need is almost always easy -- more so than any of the other books that I bought.  </span>

                    <span>Add this book to your bookshelf if you want to get quickly started with Python. This book succeeds in teaching you Python in its 410 pages.

                    <span>I don't usually go for "QuickStart" books, but I decided to spring for this one...<p>Honestly, it was the best investment a Python beginner like me could have made.  First, I find the author's style clear and concise.  Concepts are presented in a logical order.  His examples range from the simple "proof of concept" ones to more involved ones, but all are easy to try out.  Not only that, he covers a wide range of topics - so you get the fundamentals you need.<p>Most importantly for me, the book was easy to read.  I could pick it up and refer to it for a topic and not have to wade through pages of dense text to get to the core.  All in all, a well organized, well written and invaluable resource for any new python programmer.</span>
