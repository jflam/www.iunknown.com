                <span id="Label1">Because "there's more to Web design than Photoshop and HTML," <I>Robin Williams Web Design Workshop</I> covers everything for the working Web designer including "how to survive dealing with clients."<p>  Although Dreamweaver, GoLive, Photoshop, and other applications are mentioned (Flash even gets its own chapter), the book covers the gamut of Web design and technology issues rather than focusing on an individual application.<p>  Each chapter is divided into sections, often no more than a couple of pages long. The chapter on backgrounds, the area of a Web page that seems to attract the worst design crimes, shows you how to avoid "the heartbreak of bad background design" in no less than eight sections.<p>  In many books this subject would be lucky to get eight paragraphs; <I>Robin Williams Web Design Workshop</I> uses a clear two-column layout and plenty of real-life example screen shots to get the message across. Some pages consist only of captioned screen shots providing a great source of visual ideas.<p>  There's a good balance between purely design-related issues and the technical stuff. Subjects like search engines, embedded fonts, DHTML, and forms are given a thorough overview, highlighting the main issues, and links to sources of more in-depth information are often to be found at the end of the chapter.<p>  If you like to learn by example and see yourself more as a designer than a programmer, but want a working knowledge of current Web technologies from a book that you can read away from your computer, this is it. <I>--Ken McMahon, amazon.co.uk</I> </span>

                    <span>I'm an intermediate web designer. I have technical knowledge but not a lot of original design sense. This book, in conjunction with Robin Williams Design Workshop, has provided me with a lot of inspiration and insight. Now I KNOW how to make sophisticated, classy web pages. Some of the stuff I knew, a lot of it not in the depth covered in this book; but some of it was really new and eye-opening. I can't help but believe that most web designers, whatever their level, would benefit from this book.</span>

                    <span>The Non-Designer's Web Book is a better choice. For starters, this book is a bit Mac and PhotoShop-centric, so some of the specifics may not be helpful. (Why people still shell out hundreds for PhotoShop when Jasc's Paint Shop Pro does the same thing for 1/6 the price, I'll never understand.) <P>The design examples are good but a bit limited in creativity, variety, and possibilities. She covers all the basics about proximity, contrast, and alignment, for example, but you can get that in her other books. The designs here are fairly static and rely mainly on tables for layout. There's a little slicing-and-dicing, but no mortized sites or style-sheet driven sites like you see in 3rd-generation web design. Instead, this is something of a repeat of 2nd-generation design that came along a bit too late to be "new." <P>Instead, I'd recommend her "Non-Designer's Web Book" and her "Design Workshop." The latter covers all the concepts of THIS book in a single chapter! And then includes chapters on business cards, letterhead, brochures, and other projects, so you get all this and more in a similar book by the same author.</span>

                    <span>One big flaw in the book, and one that alot of web design books make, is the recommendation of Matt's Script Archives for CGI scripts. DON'T use Matt's scripts, and beware of any CGI scripts you find on the web. If you do want the functionality (or would like to replace the MSA scripts you have), look for the NMS scripts (google for "matt" and "nms"). Matt's scripts are not maintained, and many security and other problems have been fixed in the NMS scripts (e.g. use the old formmail script, and anyone can use your server to send spam).</span>

                    <span>If you want to design simple web pages that are functional but also look incredible, this is the book for you. I'm not a graphic designer. I used to make web pages that were functional but ugly until I got this book. It is a great mix of technical instruction and beautiful samples with layout designs, color schemes, font selections, techniques, etc. I also appreciated that it was comprehensive but short enough that you can work through the entire book without too much time/effort. Highly recommended.</span>
