                    <span>I hate to sound like a cynic, but this book contains nothing new.
<br />
<br />It is a tale of research analysts, devoid of ethical standards; driven by greedy investment bankers - I know phrase is redundant -; commanded by serial-acquiring megalomaniacs;  regulated by people who would not recognize a fraud if they stepped in it; and tripped up by a publicity-seeking politician with an eye on higher office.
<br />
<br />The latest chapter took place during the booming 1990s.  Along the way millions of individual investors made and lost billions as they were skewered in the intoxicating tale.  Gasparino, to his credit, tells the tale well.  His research and interviews, largely compiled while a Wall Street Journal reporter assigned to the story, bring fresh insights to this age-old tale of greed, arrogance and street-business-as-usual.  
<br />
<br />His access to dispositions, e-mail exchanges and documents help the reader capture the out-of-control personalities of the characters involved in this tale.
<br />
<br />If you invest with the idea that your broker is your best friend, you need to read this book.  Greed is Wall Street's only constant and the markets and brokerage firms are there only to take your money away. 
<br />
<br />If that is cynicism, so be it.  I paid for it at bloodlettings long before the Internet boom and bust.

                    <span>This is an exceptional book summarizing the 90s stock market craze and the research analysts that were primarily responsible.  The basic premise is these guys pushed stocks unmercifully and investors bought all the while the analysts knew that the valuations were inappropriate.  Clearly in retrospect this was true and even at that time anyone who was "drinking the Kool-Aid" should have seen it.  But the bubble market allowed this phenomenon to continue until the correction was painful.
<br />
<br />Gasparino does a great job researching and presenting the facts in a straight forward method.  There are plenty of books on this subject but having delayed this book till release of company emails enhanced his proof.  Of particular interest/embarrassment is the pseudo internet affair Jack Grubman has that is exposed in email files now in public records.  While I had followed this in the WSJ I had not read of this email exchange.  Sure glad my wife does not have to read about it in a book.
<br />
<br />Overall I give this book extremely high marks.  If you are a casual investor this is a must read to understand information used for investing decisions can be tainted.  If you are a sophisticated investor, this will all be old news but still presented in an enjoyable summary that won't bore you with the repeated info.  Anyone who is not an investor but wants to study this period of time or wants to learn about investing can also learn what goes on behind the curtain.  My only complaint would be there is never any discussion of what blame should be placed with investors.

                    <span>Undoubtedly many of us either lost money or knew someone who perhaps lost their entire savings during the dot com bubble of the 1990s.  
<br />
<br />Because of the depth of research put into "Blood On The Street", those new to finance and investment will understand and appreciate how legal and business environments, both qualified and unqualified players in these environments, and basic economics lead to the inevitable pop of that bubble. Those already familiar with investment will probably feel rage and exasperation at how governance seemingly dissappeared to completely dupe the public at large. 
<br />
<br />In weaving a tapestry of the events of that time, Mr. Gasparino generates a piece of non fiction that reads like heart racing fiction.  I finished it in a weekend. 
<br />
<br />For me, the biggest question remaining is: Have we learned anything since then?

                    <span>This book reports how many small investors were swindled by the near worthless stocks of Internet companies. Wall Street brokers pumped and dumped these "New Economy" stocks created for swindling. This may recall the similar scams from the 1920s where money was raised for near worthless investments. In the 1930s the Glass-Steagall Act was passed to separate investment banking from commercial banking. This was followed by company pension plans in the 1940s. The virtual repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act by the 1990s led to the scams documented in this book. This was followed by the end of pension plans for many companies. Industry cannot trust Wall Street for the investment growth needed for pension plans. Insurance companies may not be able to handle this heavy load, either. Just as gambling casinos takes money from the many to reward the few, so brokers took money to reward stock creators. Neither produced anything. One test for any stock is its book value, and, the amount of dividends it produces. Is Wall Street overdue for "creative destruction"?

                    <span>A testament to the crybabies who stayed in tech stocks too long when anyone with a brain could have done a little fundamental analysis to figure out that the market was a bit overvalued... There's an expression in trading: Feed the ducks when they're quacking.
<br />
<br />But is it any surprise that we've been transformed into a bunch of whiners with titles such as "You Got Screwed" and "Blood on the Street"? And this author is simply an opportunist who feeds into the bitterness because many investors can't come to grips with the reality that they were idiots.
<br />
<br />Look at the reviews of this book. How astonishing that Wall Street was trying to shovel their junk to the public... how scandalous. My eyes have been truly opened to the dastardly machinations of Wall Street. How dare they try to recommend stocks during a roaring bull market! Recommendation: For morons only who need to soothe the pain.</span>
