                <span id="Label1">The Domain Naming System (DNS) is a glorious thing. It takes familiar Internet network and machine names (like "amazon.com") and converts them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like "208.35.218.15") that are meaningful to routers and therefore useful for identifying the machine you want to reach. What's amazing is that DNS enables someone in Germany to refer, by name, to a computer in Mongolia even if no one in Germany has ever accessed the distant machine before. It's pretty much self-configuring, too: No human effort in Germany is necessary to make the Mongolian machine reachable by name. <I>DNS and BIND</I> explains how DNS works better for this than any other piece of documentation, printed or otherwise. The work of Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu, now in its fourth revision, has long been considered a classic among systems administrators and network architects, particularly those with a Unix bent.<p>  The fourth edition is mainly an update: The authors have added coverage of incremental and conditional zone transfer with BIND's new NOTIFY features, as well as of Transaction Signatures (TSIG), and DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). Sections on firewalling and DNS for IPv6 addresses have been expanded. Throughout, Albitz and Liu maintain their impeccable style, combining text and illustrative listings into an educational whole. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The Domain Naming System (DNS) and how it's implemented by BIND (through versions 8.2.3 and 9.1.0), how to set up BIND, how to configure MX records for mail service, parent and child domains, NOTIFY, and DNS security. </span>

                    <span>DNS and BIND, Fourth Edition makes mastering this critical service easy. As someone who is trying to increase my knowledge of server-side services and the Linux operating system, I found DNS and BIND to be extremely helpful. 
<br />
<br />The authors seem to have found the ideal mix of humor, information and tips and taken that and rolled it into a very organized title. The book's chapters proceed in a logical order, a newbie can read the title cover to cover, while a more experienced admin can start in the middle somewhere and proceed to the back cover.
<br />
<br />This reviewer was very impressed with the level of organization in this title. I have read alot of computer books, but it would appear that the authors really put the extra effort into this one.</span>

                    <span>I am a netadmin who works in NT. We are going to Linux in bits and pieces and one peice is DNS. I'm picking up where my boss left off and I needed some strong basics, clear examples and a good reference point. This book is all of those things (other than the fact they forget to mention what file they are referring to from time to time). I'm reading the book cover to cover and I'm half way through. I jump ahead when I need to, but always come back to following the  chapter outine.
<br />
<br />I have gained such a knowlege of BIND and a better understanding of DNS and I owe it to this book. O'Reilly does a great job with it's tech books and I am a fan. </span>

                    <span>If you've been afraid of diving into the depths of DNS, maybe because your readings through a few RFC documents proved fruitless, then fear no more. <p>In the first few chapter your taught how DNS servers work, sparing no detail. Concepts like negative-caching, recursive resolution, and inverse queries are explained and demonstrated with great examples and graphs. The chapters on configuring and managing BIND almost make things look too simple and easy. This is also a great book to learn how to use tools like 'nslookup' and 'dig'.<p>When it comes to the world of DNS records it's hard to find authoritative  answers to questions, besides a few sites like Mr.DNS, the authors of this book recognized that need and sought to help fill the gap of knowledge.</span>

BIND has a lot of options and there's a lot to discuss, but this book just covered a lot of basics over a lot of pages. It may be a good source for learning, but I wasn't reading it to learn from start.</span>
