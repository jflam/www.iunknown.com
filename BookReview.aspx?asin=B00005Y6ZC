                <span id="Label1">Helmut Newton is one of the 20th century's leading photographers, both outraging and fascinating the public with his startling, groundbreaking images. He built his reputation with French Vogue with his starkly luminous photos and then went on to stun the fashion world with his bold, erotically charged portraits of naked women. In this intimate look at the artist, we see how Newton changed the field of photography and get a close-up look at the artist's life and work, including insights from portrait subjects Catherine Deneuve, Charlotte Rampling, Sigourney Weaver and Karl Lagerfeld. </span>

                    <span>Helmut Newton - Frames From the Edge is a video primarily geared towards the ardent fan of photography. However, a person who is interested in the development of 20th century pop culture would certainly be more than amused by this wonderful video. The most striking aspect that shines throughout the video is Helmut's fun loving and sparkling personality. Witty, adventurous and most of all - fun loving - Helmut keeps the viewer informed and amused. Not at all like many photography videos centered in the class room, the range of locales in this video is dazzling. More importantly, the camera follows Helmut during shoots, conducting interviews with potential models, and riding with Helmut in Los Angeles. In the age where technological gadgets seem to proliferate it is telling that Helmut reveals that he uses one or two cameras to conduct his work. In summary, the photography fan would learn a great deal and the pop culture fan would learn why Helmut Newton is an important 20th Century icon. Much like Helmut's personality this video merits five stars.</span>

                    <span>I was very dissapointed when i saw this DVD. I had just seen the fantastic Richard Avedon DVD the night before.<BR>I didnt know anything about Helmut Newton, and i wish i did... because it would of saved me the time and money i spent on this dvd. Newton's work is quite flat, uninspired and for the most part sexist (...).<P>If you are interested in photography, see the Avedon video instead.</span>

                    <span>Good bio. Gives you the life and times of this man. Some nudity, but overall the whole DVD was just okay. Nothing ground breaking or earth shattering.</span>

                    <span>Seeing Helmut for the male pig that he really is or seeing those poor women lose all self respect as they posed for him. Nevertheless his work is wonderful and it was nice seeing exactly how he does it. I loved it from an artistic point of view, it really gets into his head and reveals what we may not want to see... he's just a simple guy who likes to make money and his reputation have gotten larger than life and women throw themselves at him. Or, the fact that he's just plain damned GOOD! Helmut's work is captivating, very rich in tone and contrast, and quite frankly spellbinding. You'll enjoy this DVD especially if you are a photography student or pro.</span>
