                    <span>The Civil Rights Movement has been well covered by previous writers and I have enjoyed most writings on the subject. In A Stone of Hope I see a fresh perspective, a stone that has not been turned before. The role of religion,especially the "old time religion " of southern Black people has now been elevated to its proper height in the analysis of the success of the movement for equality and freedom. God's voice was echoed by the leaders of the movement and an evil system was dismantled. Faith gave them the fire that moved a race of people to stand up for what was theirs and the world is better for their having believed that God would not allow the Oppressors to continue in their sins. It was truly a prophetic movement. I think that all who are interested in the history of the struggle for justice in America should read this book</span>

                    <span>One of the most important books in recent years on the civil rights movement by an up-and-coming historian who takes no prisoners, pulls no punches.  An absolute delight to read and  meticulously researched.  Demonstrates the crucial influence of religious ideas on the civil rights movement and the end of Jim Crow desegregation.  Must reading for students of 20th-century American history and religion.</span>
