                    <span>This is more a book for someone who has no idea at all how to get organized and is desperate for ideas. <p>I was hoping for some more contemporary ideas. I think the Ikea catalog had a lot more for me.<p>The photo's were also very dated, but you could modify the basic idea to your taste ok.<p>No real suggestions for small budgets or the beginning do it yourselfer.</span>

                    <span>As long as we are going to drag "stuff" home, we might as well learn to at least catalog, organize, and store it safety, and with style.<p>This is what you call a "perennial"--a book that you can bring out at any time, year after year, and still find it useful. Ordesky must have an "acquiring" mind.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book when it came out in '93, and have referred to it time and again each time I have faced a new organizing challenge.  The photos are wonderful, and the book is chock full of different ideas, and styles,  for storage.  Terrific to read and look through.</span>

                    <span>This book is a thoroughly comprehensive guide to providing completely functional storage spaces for every major area of your home.  This beautifully illustrated book offers the added quality of truly exceptional  photographs which serve as perfect examples of the various concepts  discussed.  <p>This book should be required reading for any interior  decorator or do-it-yourself home remodeler.  Ordesky's book is a very  creative, highly inspirational guide to home improvement and organization  which also suggests ways to create a home which fully realizes its  potential of pleasure, happiness and functionality.</span>

                    <span>After reading this book from cover to cover aproximately 1 year ago.... I was inspired to start my own professional organizing business. The tips, questions lists and reccommendations are how I conduct my eval's of a  clients home when attempting to get them organized.      On a more personal  level... I have used this book to organize my home and IT WORKS!      The  author has been so gracious on several occasions to talk with me about my  business and has generously given non-failing advice on how to improve it.        I highly reccommend this book to anyone wanting to get organized. It  also makes a great     gift to clients upon completion of their organizing  projects.</span>
