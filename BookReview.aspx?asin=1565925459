                <span id="Label1"><I>Managing Microsoft Exchange Server</I> is written for Exchange Server administrators--the people who have to make it work. Paul Robichaux tells you from the beginning that his book doesn't deal with mail connectors (PC or mainframe), doesn't cover migration planning, and doesn't tackle Exchange scripting or application development. This leaves plenty of scope since Exchange Server is larger and more complex than Windows NT, with hundreds of configuration dialogs. Robichaux starts with considerations that precede breaking the CD-ROM seals, and by chapter 4 you're ready to install it.<p> Next you learn about Exchange Administrator, the front end that enables users to access and edit Exchange Server's operation. The book usefully lists the containers--the components underlying Exchange Server--which Administrator controls. At this point, you start to get your hands dirty. The sheer wealth of practical detail that follows--particularly the sections on managing Internet mail and security--calls for careful examination.<p> Robichaux clearly knows his subject. He doesn't slavishly tow the Microsoft line and is happy to make suggestions based on real experience. For example, he recommends against using Exchange Server's automatic restart feature. If you're responsible for installing and managing Exchange Server, you should have this book on your shelf. <I>--Steve Patient, amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>I inherited an Exchange 5.5 server from a previous admin about 2 years ago. I had very limited knowledge of Exchange prior to that. This book gave me an excellent understanding of Exchange. Robichaux's writing style makes this book very readable. Paul, please come out with the Exchange 2000 book!</span>

                    <span>Earlier this year I had to deploy a set of Exchange servers.  I am not an  MCSE, but I have installed Unix boxes and even hacked sendmail entries, so  I figured, how hard should this be?  Answer: very.  <p>Exchange has a  bezillion options and you'll need an almost zen-like mastery of the  application to be successful deploying it.  I didn't have the time to build  this foundation, and relied heavily on this book to explain some of the  arcane concepts.  <p>"Managing MS Exchange Server" is very well  indexed and does a pretty good job of explaining some of the obscure  registry entries and security options in the product.  It also provide the  mental "glue" that I needed to see how my Exchange servers would  interact.<p>A few of the registry keys were different as a result of the  most recent service packs.  This is forgivable given the book's always  going to lag the product, and the differences weren't that horrible.<p>If  you're tasked with doing any amount of work with Exchange, you really need  this book.</span>

                    <span>If I had to choose but two MS Exchange books for my arsenal, this would absolutely be one of them.  The other would have to be Barry Gerber's "Mastering Exchange Server 5.5"<p>Paul Robichaux has done an  EXCELLENT job of filling in what few gaps Barry Gerber left in his book.   Where Gerber provides an excellent guide to setting up and getting to know  Exchange, Robichaux takes you deeper into more "advanced"  administrative issues such as disaster recovery, security, enabling  Exchange for remote users, etc.<p>If you manage an Exchange server or  servers for your orginzation, this book is indispensible.  Hats off to the  author!</span>
