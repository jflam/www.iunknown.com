                    <span>The content is ok, however the writing style of Karl Moore is really bad. He tries to be funny whole the time. The first few pages I thought it would be ok, however he continues until the very last page of the book. 
<br />
<br />Example: "I'm really pleased you're sticking with the tutorials. You're obviously one of the few people that truly arent't offended by my smell"  and " Well, hurrah and hujjah on coming this far" and "So a round of applause and well done once again! <cheer>". You get this type of information every second sentence. It really distracts you from the content and it gets really annoying. Otherwise, it would be a good book (with 100 pages less).</span>

                    <span>I have 50 pounds of .NET books.  This is the only one that always has the answers I need.  It explains every technique in one or two pages instead of the 50 pages that most authors seem to prefer.  The author is obviously a developer.  He cuts right to the solution every time.  I'll definitely look for his books first everytime I add to my collection.  Definitley buy this book.  </span>

                    <span>From the title and initial reviews, I was hoping for a book that explained VB.NET methods simply, without a lot of the MS techno-speak.  This book turned out to be geared more for ASP developers, particularly using SQL Server databases.  I am using Oracle with VB.NET and have found little to justify spending money on this book. Very disappointing. To compound the injury, the book is very loosely organized.</span>

                    <span>You can find great code snippets and how-to's in this book, which will save you time for sure. However, this book is not for beginners.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book. Most of the answers that I search for as a designer/developer are right here. Minor modifications are all that are needed for almost any app. Karl's examples also inspire you to find more on your own. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who uses VB.NET to program.</span>
