                <span id="Label1">Set in Manchester County, Virginia, 20 years before the Civil War began, Edward P. Jones's debut novel, <I>The Known World</I>, is a masterpiece of overlapping plot lines, time shifts, and heartbreaking details of life under slavery. Caldonia Townsend is an educated black slaveowner, the widow of a well-loved young farmer named Henry, whose parents had bought their own freedom, and then freed their son, only to watch him buy himself a slave as soon as he had saved enough money. Although a fair and gentle master by the standards of the day, Henry Townsend had learned from former master about the proper distance to keep from one's property. After his death, his slaves wonder if Caldonia will free them. When she fails to do so, but instead breaches the code that keeps them separate from her, a little piece of Manchester County begins to unravel. Impossible to rush through, <I>The Known World</I> is a complex, beautifully written novel with a large cast of characters, rewarding the patient reader with unexpected connections, some reaching into the present day.  <I>--Regina Marler</I></span>

                    <span>Edward P. Jones has succeeded - no, triumphed - in writing an epic scale novel about an aspect of American history little known to most of us. Scholars of African American history are well informed that during the 1800s, when slavery was a way of life for both whites and blacks, there were many permutations of who is master and who is slave. The fact that former slaves, granted their freedom by whatever means, purchased their own cadre of slaves may sound shocking to some readers and it seems that it is that audience of readers to whom Jones wishes to address this story. Based on facts and related in a way that, however lyrically written is the story line, makes this novel seem like historical biography, Jones has created a novel that is compelling, beautifully composed, and very smart. His characters are so vivid that they grow to inhabit our minds, engaging our empathy and disgust as well as any characters in fiction. <P>The story of Henry and Caldonia Townsend, Fern Elston, the Robbins, the Skiffingtons, mad Alice, Zeddie, Loretta, Elias, Louis, Dora et cetera has been well outlined in the other reviews of this major book. But what takes this novel a step further than just being a fascinating tale is Jones' use of language. He waxes musically in describing the boundaries and inner spaces of his Known World of the plantation (closed to the slaves by the boundaries of the land and the legacy of ownership). He manages to be so intimate with the lives of his characters that he even chances to suggest the homoerotic underpinnings between Louis and Elias without calling attention to the fact that he is doing anything more than creating complete people. His use of the vernacular goes beyond merely the very tersely studied dialogue and extends into the mindset of the character who is remembering or postulating. Some novelists would elect to find that vernacular voice and then force the entire novel into its cadence, a style choice that can make a story cumbersome. Not Jones. When the story is reportage or in the minds of the non-slaves, Jones writes in melodic and eloquent prose, not unlike an orchestra in collaboration with soloists. This is a slow read and that is a good thing: speed reading THE KNOWN WORLD would deprive the reader of the warmly langorous pace of the times in which these wholly credible people "lived." A very fine book!</span>

                    <span>Edward P. Jone's novel, The Known World, is a story about the social and moral boundaries that were woven into the fabric of those living in Virginia in the time of slavery. The author creates a clear and insightful look into the lives of individuals whose lives were bound with the reality of slavery. The focus of the story are black slave owners and black slaves. While many are familiar with this period of time and the issues involved, Edward P. Jones sheds new light on the issue of black slave owners.<BR>The perspectives of the slave owners, the slaves and as well as the freed blacks (those who accepted the fact of slavery and those who opposed it) are all explored. The thoughts of white slave owners and the whites who did not own slaves are also an integral part of this book.<BR>The story seemed to lack a fiery passion to it that I thought it would have. I have realised that this technique is a critical part of the style the author used to tell the story. The lack of passion relays the feeling that these people had accepted their KNOWN WORLD, that slavery was a part of the fabric of their lives and was an acknowledged normal aspect of life. No matter who you were, you aspired to become a slaveowner because it signified that you were successful and deserving of respect. <BR> It begs the question, what in our own KNOWN WORLD do we accept that in years to come will be viewed very differently by future generations. The story is a thought provoking, eye opening work by Edward P. Jones.</span>

                    <span>Not only is the subject matter "just what children of slave masters" ordered, it is profoundly slow and boring. I love the jacket cover, that was the reason I gave it 1 star but that alone did not prevent me from taking it back to the store for a full refund! <P>Condi Rice and Clarence Thomas will probably write the paperback version's introduction.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book and I must say that I was very pleased with the story. I enjoy reading stories about the South, of how it once was. It makes me more thankful of the things that I have now. This book can give readers a glimpse of what African American had to go through. The main character is Henry Townsend who is a free Negro that owned slaves. This was not very common in the Commonwealth of Virginia. But he came from a strong family. He had people that loved him and also people that loved him because of what he became to be. I liked how Mr. Jones connected all the characters eventually to Henry. I felt like I was actually living on the plantation with everyone. It definitely deserves all the praise it has been given. Keep up the good work, Mr. Jones.</span>

                    <span>I didn't much care for the writing style here, but the main characters hooked me into the story. In this novel of black slavery in the South, we have the rare true revelation of free black farm-owners who themselves enslaved and owned black slaves. This is the account of a white man named William Townsend who is fond of a black man named Henry. Henry was his slave in his youth, and William helps him buy his own plantation and slaves. We then later see that Henry mistreats his slaves just as a white slavemaster would. This story shows that, whether black or white, we're all human with the same capacity for good and evil. <P>David Rehak<BR>author of "Love and Madness"</span>
