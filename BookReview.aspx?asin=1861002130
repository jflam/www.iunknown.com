                <span id="Label1">The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) is the foundation behind Visual Basic 6, even if Visual Basic (VB) hides most of the inner details. To write better VB programs for the enterprise, chances are you'll need to take on at least some of the intricacies of COM. <I>VB COM: A Visual Basic Programmer's Introduction to COM</I> provides an approachable guide to today's COM and other Microsoft technologies.<p> The book begins with one of the most approachable and effective tours of COM you're likely to find anywhere. The author covers COM components along with fundamental terms (such as interfaces, globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), IUnknown, and the registry) with a minimum of hassle. In a section on OLE Automation, the author shows how to use VB to script Excel spreadsheets, while explaining the details of early and late binding, IDispatch, and dual interfaces.<p> Next the author discusses how to build components, starting with ActiveX servers (both dynamic-link libraries [DLLs] and standalone EXEs) and proceeding to ActiveX controls. (The section on building controls is particularly strong, with good coverage of Ambient and Extender objects and connection points for event handling.) Throughout, <I>VB COM</I> relies on tools-based examples, with plenty of screen shots from VB 6 tools (such as its Class Builder Wizard). Later the book moves on to the enterprise with coverage of Distributed COM (DCOM), multitiered architectures, Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), and emerging standards such as COM+.<p> In all, <I>VB COM</I> delivers a clear picture of the inner workings of COM for the VB developer with a useful mix of simplicity and essential technical detail. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Every VB programmer needs to understand COM, and VB Com by Thomas Lewis teaches you just that. It starts off with an introduction to what COM is, and its history. Subsequent chapters go in depth in COM components, such as Automation, ActiveX EXEs and DLLs, and ActiveX Controls. These chapters are very detailed and have several examples for each type of COM component. The DCOM chapter is especially interesting. It is one of few books that describe DCOM and its architecture, along with how to create VB applications that utilize DCOM.<P>The number of pages is relatively small when compared to other Visual Basic books. Nonetheless, all 320 pages are choke-full of information, without all the jargon. I don't recommend this book for the beginner programmer. It is more for the intermediate to advanced programmer. Thomas Lewis's writing style is casual, which makes it easy to read and understand.<P>Overall, it is the best book for learning COM with Visual Basic.</span>

                    <span>I stay away from books with the pharse "learn XXXX in XX days" in the title as if they are the plague. And I have always been a little leary of books with the word "Introduction" in the title. <P>I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, and former collegue, to determine if it was an appropriate publication to get about 6 of our begining VB programers, ex fox pro guys, up to speed on COM.<P>This book not only met my criteria for this application but I found myself continually shaking my head in agreement with the author while I read the book. His methodologies are VERY sound and his approach to teaching COM is EXTREMELY easy to follow. Also, the author's writing style is very easy to read. This is NOT a 2 asprin per chapter book and I read it in about 4 days.<P>This book is a PRICELESS tool to get begining and seasoned VB programmers up to speed in COM. I promise you that you will be able to converse intelligently about COM in a week.<P>Mr.Lewis... I owe you a cold one!<P>Steve<P>PS. My only minor qualm with the book would be the step by step screen shots. However, for the intended audience of this book, I can see how they would be helpful.</span>

                    <span>Although this book was written over 3 years ago, it is still a good book for Visual Basic developers to learn COM. Microsoft wants you to think that everyone will be switching to Visual Basic.Net but the reality is there are a lot of Visual Baisc 6.0 shops out there and they have to support legacy COM components (ActiveX) for some time to come. Not all of those components are going to be converted to .Net. This book is a good starting point for any Visual Basic developers who want to learn COM including ActiveX DLLs and EXEs, ActiveX Controls, and Microsoft Transaction Server. The chapter on Microsoft Transaction Server could be a good step to COM+ on Windows 2000 and XP machines. Thomas Lewis takes you step-by-step from introduction to COM thru ActiveX components and finally thru Microsoft Transaction Server. He lays a good knowledge foundation and then with each succeeding chapter builds upon that knowledge. I would recommend that after you read this book that you follow it up the Peter Vogel's "Visual Basic Object and Component Handbook".</span>

                    <span>It was a fantastic resource that explains COM very well. It's targeted towards beginning programmers, assuming very little about a programmer's foreknowledge of VB. It even walks through wizard examples.<P>I've had the book for about 2 years now and I still use it as a basic reference book whenever I have a spacey moment on a fundemental aspect of COM. <P>Excellent starter book that I've recommended to many friends along the way.</span>
