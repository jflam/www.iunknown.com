                <span id="Label1">Exotic! Exciting! Inspiring! African fabrics are sought after because of their rich histories and lavish designs, but they intimidate many sewers. Author and designer Ronke Luke-Boone helps take the mystery out of these works of art and teaches sewers of all skill levels where to buy fabrics, how to choose the right ones, and the best techniques for sewing them. Besides covering the six most popular African fabrics&#151;mudcloth, Kuba cloth, Korhogo cloth, fancy prints, wax prints, and Kente cloth&#151;this guide shows readers how they are produced and ways to incorporate them into contemporary designs for men, women, and children, as well as home d&#233;cor. As an added bonus, Luke-Boone offers 14 original projects, including a tote bag, tunic, pillows, placemats, and a child&#146;s loom, three of which have full-size patterns.  <P>- Covers the six most popular African fabrics currently available<BR> - Excellent reference for sewers or anyone who is interested in fabrics, culture, and history<BR> - 14 step-by-step projects&#151;three with full-size patterns</span>

Discussions of mudcloth, fancy prints, Kuba cloth and Kente cloth, among others, provide a unique and excellent introduction to African fabrics as a whole, making this more than just a crafts guide. A wide audience will find it important for both its historical overview of African fabrics and its artistic/crafts attractions.</span>

                    <span>Asante Sane - Danke Schon - Merci Beaucoup - Muchos Gracias: A world of THANKS for a book that meets the inspirational needs of the contemporary multiculturalist who loves stylish fashion wear, unique interior design and simple creative construction. The beautiful illustrations were quite fascinating and they served as great enhancement to the book's well written information and neat instruction. From the front cover to the back cover and all of the pages in between, author Ronke Luke-Boone takes the reader on an exciting journey that is richly infused with lessons in history, geography, fabric preservation, nifty sewing techniques, super shopping resources and much, much more. Most valuable for me is the instruction she provides for working with the popular mud cloth, Kubba cloth and Kente. Unfortunately, these hand crafted textiles defy the sewing logic that is normally associated with that of the symmetrically printed machine woven fabrics. One must be taught how to reinforce these ethnic textiles correctly and how to lay the patterns properly to prevent the completed garment from taking on a life of its own while it is being worn. Ms. Luke-Boone provided a corrective experience for me in this regard. Previously, I had not had the desired success in working with these fabrics, so I had set them aside. Reading through the book several times was the much needed source of motivation that guided me to complete two Kubba cloth pillows and a beautiful mosaic swing coat, pieced with mud cloth, denim, Korhogo, calvary twill and tea-dyed linen burlap,just as she instructed. At last, no more quality control issues with these fabrics. I recommend this publication to any one from any culture who has basic sewing skills and a great flair for exotic styling.</span>
