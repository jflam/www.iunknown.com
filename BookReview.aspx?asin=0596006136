                    <span>Who would buy or need a computer book on how to use a web search engine? Maybe a person who has ever been to Yahoo.com and is hit with a hundred or so choices of where to click to make an attempt to get what you need, but to write an entire book on how to use Google, the world's simplest and most accurate search engine. What a waste was my first thought? 
<br />
<br />I knew and use some of the features that lie in the menu above that search box like "Images" when I am looking for a certain picture or "News" for "Up to The Minute" stories but since the book was part of O'Reilly's "Missing Manual" series so I knew it would be well written and good so I figured it would be worthwhile reading. Google: The Missing Manual goes into detail about how this "magical" search engine works and some amazing (and scary) things it can do.
<br />
<br />The book opens with a bit of history about Google, which was a concept of two Stanford College grad students in 1995 that had an idea to create a search engine that would rank search results not on data that could be manipulated by web masters but would return results based on the strength of the Internet itself.
<br />
<br />The rest of the book is divided into four parts, "Search Techniques", "The Unknown Google", and "Google For Webmasters".  Almost all computer users will learn something new from the "Search Techniques" part of the book while  "The Unknown Google" goes into detail on Images, News Groups, Shopping and Directory searches. "Search Tools" is an excellent section on how to easily get the most out of your Google searches although much of the info offered relates to Windows users (not Mac) and I found "Google For Webmasters" most interesting since I dabble in webdesign as a hobby. 
<br />
<br />Overall the book is an interesting read and very informative for anyone who wants to save time and use their time online more efficiently or for a person who relies heavily on the Internet as a source of information. If you are person with a webpage or website, the book is worth the price of admission to increase your Google (and other search engine) rank.

                    <span>A 299-page manual for Google? You've got to be kidding! C'mon, how hard is it to type a word or phrase, hit a button, and get almost instantaneous and nearly always satisfactory results? But I'm a big fan of the Missing Manual series, and have several on my shelf. So I decided to check out "Google - The Missing Manual", and was won over once again after reading only the first few pages. Like every other one I've looked at, this Missing Manual is very well-written. It's logically organized, informative and at the same time entertaining to read
<br /> 
<br /> Sure, a simple Google search is easy. But as this manual says (p. 18), performing a simple search is using only 1% of Google's power (and that's as much as 99% of us ever use). If you'd rather be one of the 1% of the people that know how to use 99% of its power, this manual is for you.
<br /> 
<br /> Since I rarely read a manual cover-to-cover (and wouldn't remember everything I'd read if I did), two of the first things I check are the Table of Contents and the Index. At first blush, both appear to be complete and easy to use. But beware if you bought an early copy of this book. Due to a printer's error, the first print run went out with "an incomplete and unpleasantly weird index." If you got one of these, go to www.missingmanual.com to download a copy of the correct index.
<br /> 
<br /> The book is logically divided into four parts:
<br /> 
<br /> Part 1 deals with searches, from simple to complex. If you read this section only, you will learn much. Did you know that Google only recognizes the first ten words when you do a search? So don't bother typing any more than that (the manual has suggestions for how to maximize your use of words in a search). This manual is not just a promotion for Google-I was pleased to see suggestions for other resources to use when Google is NOT the best tool available.
<br /> 
<br /> Part 2 is called "The Unknown Google" and covers the Images, News, Directory, Groups, Answers, and Froogle sections of the web site. Images helps you to search a bank of over 880 million images. News collects articles from 4500 news sources. While we think of Google as an excellent way to search the Internet (which it is), Groups and Answers are actually services designed to help put people in touch with other people. Groups allows you to access 20,000 active newsgroups and search the archives of 100,000. Answers provides a way for you to ask questions (for a fee) if you haven't been able to find the answer elsewhere. Froogle is not a store but it searches for products available online and compares them by price. (A subset of Froogle is Catalogs which allows you to search through 6500 conventional catalogs.) 
<br /> 
<br /> Part 3 "Search Tools" discusses in depth the Google Toolbar and other "Cool Google Tools". Did you know that you can perform Google searches and actually browse the web from your PDA or wireless phone? As the manual says "This feature is serious magic."
<br /> 
<br /> Part 4 is titled "Google for Webmasters". Since I'm not one, and don't have a business or website of my own, I did not spend much time reviewing this part. But it appears this section would be especially useful for someone who wants to get their site higher in Google's ranking, or who wants to have Google put advertisements on their website.
<br /> 
<br /> A short appendix lists a number of third-party sites that build on Google. Check out the one that lets you type in a list of ingredients, select a food genre, and then spits out a bunch of recipes. For those who are "Google-obsessed" there are links to a number of Google-themed blogs, including one for "those who believe....that Google is evil."</span>

                    <span>	Who would think a mere "search engine" would need a manual, especially one 289 pages long (including index)? Well, the Google website is indeed a web-based application that is sophisticated and complex enough to justify a full-fledged volume such as "Google: The Missing Manual".
<br />
<br />	This book is yet another of the well-received "Missing Manual" series by Pogue Press/O'Reilly Media Inc. It covers some of the same ground as O'Reilly's 2003 book, "Google Hacks: 100 Industrial Strength Tips and Tools". That book emphasized the mechanics of searching, especially power-searching, often using script-driven and programming techniques and tools to improve and fine-tune search results. This volume covers a much broader range of elements involving the Google web site.
<br />
<br />	The introduction briefly describes the newest Google element, GMail, which is Google's entry to web-based email services, but which more  importantly incorporates its keyword-based search algorythms with email text to link sponsored ads to individual email transmissions. This promises to be a major new business model. That dovetails well with Google's recent IPO - a new investment opportunity projected to be worth multi-billions of dollars.
<br />
<br />	The book has five parts including sections on search techniques, Google's image, news, and directory databases, search tools, a special section for webmasters, and an appendix. The search sections describe basic and advanced searching and how to interpret results. A later section covers Google Groups which are databases of newsgroup entries, modeled after the defunct DejaNews site, which Google acquired. A little known component of Google is the Answers Site where Google-administered experts answer user-submitted questions, for a fee.
<br />
<br />	Customizing Google via preferences, installation of the Google toolbar, bookmarklets, and other settings are covered in full.
<br />
<br />	For webmasters, the  authors describe briefly site optimization for the Google crawlers, how to hide a site from the crawlers, and how to add Google searching to your site. The most interesting sections for webmasters likely are those on the advertising elements, Adsense and Adword. The book describes how the programs work and how webmasters can profit from their use.
<br />
<br />	There are  times when Google is NOT the right search tool. The authors describe the limitations of Google and where else one can turn to for information.
<br />
<br />	Like the rest of the volumes in the "Missing Manual" series, this book provides comprehensive and coherently-written material for helping users obtain the fullest benefit from their applications.</span>

                    <span>This missing manual is O'Reilly version of Google Hacks for normal people. Where Google Hacks gives Perl scripts for bending and twisting the Google API at the code level, the Missing Manual covers how to use Google from the web site to find the information, news or images you are looking for. if you don't know that the word Perl is spelled correctly, and you are having trouble finding what you are looking for on Google, this is the book for you.
<br />
<br />That's not to say that there isn't some high end stuff. Part four has useful information for web professionals looking to optimize their presence on Google and even to make money from it.
<br />
<br />So if all you know about Google is what you see on your browser, and you think you could be getting more out of Google, this book is worth the look. I gave this book five stars because the overall construction of the book is focused, and the content is useful and well written.</span>
