                <span id="Label1">Black Mold Your Health and Your Home is a comprehensive introduction to mold, the problems it can cause and how to properly deal with it. Through two hundred pages and five sections, author and mold expert Richard F. Progovitz explains the facts about mold toxicity and systematically demystifies the abundance of molds we encounter in our daily lives.  Approximately one hundred species of mold are toxic and about fifteen are known to cause negative health effects in humans, including allergic reactions, asthma and other chronic conditions. Recent media reports about mold infestations in schools and colleges across the country as well as in the homes of famous personalities Ed McMahon, Melinda Ballard and Erin Brockovich have begun to alert the public to the potential health risks of toxic molds. Each of these incidents involve what has become known as "Sick Building Syndrome."   <P>Is mold silently affecting the health of your loved ones or slowly deteriorating your home? Black Mold Your Health and Your Home was written to help you answer these important questions.</span>

                    <span>This is more towards my liking for a book that describes the problem of mold from an inspector point of view. We need some color diagrams, but the black and white photos were a good start. The book was well organized with titles and subtitles. There was very little sensational type writing. More science like. I feel informed when reading this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is an easy read, and I finished it in a few days. Part One - Introduction to Molds explains fungi groups; fungi reproduction; common molds found in buildings; and 'the enemies of mold'. Along the way, Richard Progovitz adds interesting historical facts about mold, such as the discovery of penicillin. I would compare this to an introductory text book, but it's certainly livelier than anything I read in college. <P>Part Two talks about the health symptoms associated with mold and has a good description of allergic reactions to mold. The book has a good, but general, description of problem molds and some reactions.<P>Section Three is Molds and the Home. Among the usual culprits for mold, did you know mold can enter your house attached to a pet? I particularly liked Mr. Progovitz' discussion of mold and recreational vehicles, an issue I never considered.<P>Section Four discussed Mold Remediation Issues. There are plenty of photos showing collection techniques and laboratory testing methods. Mr. Progovitz clearly explains the difference between viable and non-viable testing. He is a strong proponent of borate for mold remediation.</span>

                    <span>I was expecting this book to be very technical and difficult to understand. To my surprise it wasn't. I was amazed at the useful information given about mold and the levels one must take to eliminate it. The author presents his topic in a very concise, logical format, and uses pictures and illustrations to aid the reader's understanding. The book is quick and easy and everyone will find it informative. It is obvious that the author is very knowledgeable about mold and has researched the topic extensively. I definitely recommend this book.</span>
