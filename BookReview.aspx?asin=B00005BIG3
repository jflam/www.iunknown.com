                    <span>Patrick Stewart takes us on a fascinating journey on our Earth's evolution from the compression of "space junk" to the ultimate end of the planet as we know it. I first watched this on the Discovery Channel about a year ago and had taped it (alas it was taped over unknowingly) so that I could digest all of the information presented. It will take several times of viewing before I will be able to take in all of the facts. Don't suppose that this DVD is dry and boring though. All of the information is presented in layman's terms, with any technical terms being fully explained as far as I can tell. <P>The DVD presents it all in beautiful scenes of our planet as few have ever seen it, by taking us to exotic locales and making us look a little closer at things we may see every day. There is one scene along the San Andreas fault line that shows a tortured cross section of rock by a freeway that is literally just down the street from my house.<P>I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has more than a passing interest in how our planet came to be as we know it today. The future of the planet may be grim, but hey, I won't be around to complain about it in a couple million years ;)</span>
