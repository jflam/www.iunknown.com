                    <span>I just recently went on a 2 week safari in Kenya. I bought multiple books prior to my trip and this was the only one I truly used. It is paperback and lightweight and has all the information you could possibly need on a safari in Africa. I used the Swahili translation page, the journal pages and maps of the national parks we visited. Most importantly I was able to look up any mammal or bird or tree we saw very quickly and find just the right amount of information. 
<br />I only wish the bird pages were in color as it was hard to identify birds looking at black and white pictures in the book.
<br />But, other than that, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is going on a safari in Africa.

                    <span>African Safari Journal is an excellent companion to appreciate and record the once-in-a-lifetime experiences offered by an exciting African safari as it combines a wildlife/botany guide; a simple language phrase book with phonetics in Swahili, Shona, Tswana, Zulu, and French; a trip organizer; a map directory; a journal for writing personal thoughts and observations, and so much more. A first-rate, extremely useful, "user friendly" resource, consulting guide, and souvenir for lasting memories, African Safari Journal is enthusiastically recommended for anyone planning a trip to the Dark Continent!</span>

                    <span>My wife and I went on our first safari to Northern Tanzania National Parks with a very experienced leader (over 100 safaries). He recommended this book and that we keep a journal--something I have not done in 35 years. HE WAS RIGHT! We carried this book with us on every game drive and refered to it often. At camp we entered journal entries. These proved very valuable after our return to organize and present video and photos. This book has almost everything you want to look up. In addition the packing checklists were 100% right on for our experience. 
<br />
<br />If you take only one book on safari, I strongly recommend this one. If you can take more, I recommend Estes's Safari Companion and a good field guide with color pictures like the Audubon.</span>

                    <span>I just got back from Africa where I climbed Kilamanjaro and went on a safari. This book is an awesome way to organize ahead of time. On my trip I used the journal to organize my thoughts on the trip and to keep track of my film and what I had on each roll. If you are going on a safari in Africa this is a must. Take my word for it. I took 24 rolls of film on my trip and was able to keep track of all my info with this book. Enough said.</span>
