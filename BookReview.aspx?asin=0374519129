                    <span>I came across this book quite randomly and decided to read it (as i often read any book that i can get my hands on), and i am extremely glad I did. It is a wonderful novel in the way that you feel as if you are living the main characters life. <P>Katherine is a young girl who is struggling to become a musician while trying to live up to her deceased mother's memory. It is a bit weak in plot but makes up for with the raw emotion. I found it rather different from L'engles other books such as A Wind in the Door or A Swiftly Tilted Planet , but then again A Small Rain is an adult book while the others are not. It is undoubtedly my favorite of her books and i definetly recommend it to anyone at all.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book made me feel real. The depth that L'Engle creates with Katherine overwhelms the reader, and brings you into it. It was so realistic and I felt like I had so much in common with Katherine. It's hard to put into words exactly how wonderful this book really is. The emotions I felt as I read it are undescribable. But anytime I read L'Engle she puts my life back into perspective. She makes me feel like everything will be alright again. I really recommend this book to anyone who feels confused and like the world just keeps spinning around them and they still don't get it. And anyone who gets angry at God sometimes when life doesn't make sense. It's consoling and reassuring. Anyway, I loved it.</span>

                    <span>this ranks as one of my favorite books of all time and definitely something i'd recommend to any females out there. basically it's a coming of age book, sans your typical judy bloom-like horror stories. katherine, the main character, is being raised by her composer-father who is neglectful if not anything else, and her step-mother-actress. the book chronicles the different phases she goes through as she reaches her adulthood. i thought it was very well written (as tends to be my opinion about most l'engle books) and i immediately liked the character. the only drawback that i found to this book is that l'engle later wrote a sequel to it (a severed wasp) which excited me greatly when i finished this book as i didn't want the story to end. but instead of finding the same katherine that i had enjoyed in the first book, i found a much older version that liked to solve mysteries and was a little full of herself. at any rate, the small rain is definitely a must-read.....especially for females in their teenage years.</span>

                    <span>There really is no plot to this book. Readers who are fans of Ms. L'Engle's youth fiction, like me, should exercise some caution before reading this book. Upon opening the pages, you will not escape into worlds of fantasy where your imagination is challenged with every word. Here, a more realistic story is presented. It is one of Madeleine L'Engle's "adult" books, and it is quite good, if you approach it with the right mindset. The story centers around Katherine Forrester, who has lived her entire life surrounded by artists. Now, these are not necessarily artists in the sense that Monet or Picasso was an artist; they are artistic in the "arts"- music, acting, etc. Of course, artists live in a world that most of us left-brained people cannot quite understand. This novel excellently depicts the life that true artists live. We are given unique insight into Katherine's soul, something rarely found in today's literature. Most times, characterization is ignored for a riveting plot. Katherine Forrester stirs up remembrances of Jane Austen heroines- the girls you actually knew and understood. Katherine is a fabulously flawed character that I completely loved. I felt after I read this book that I had made a new friend and discovered a new world. The book made me think. It's about time I could say that again.</span>
