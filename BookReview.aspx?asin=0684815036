                    <span>A more nearly accurate title would have been "A History of the western Christian church."  Johnson writes as though the Orthodox church had never developed.  This is not a fault, but readers should be warned at the beginning.
<br />
<br />On the positive side, he describes in some detail the pre-Latin churches, whose existence has been glossed over by the modern  establishment, e.g. the Montanists and the clashing sects of North Africa.  Some of their views compare quite favorably with the stodgy Latin dogmas.  These chapters are some of the most enthralling.
<br />
<br />The book is indeed written for the literate layman such as myself, but it contains a treasure trove of information; Johnson is no one's toady, in spite of the ad hominem attacks on his personal life.
<br />
<br />It does not begin exactly where his "History of the Jews" ends, and the latter is considerably more interesting than the former.
<br />
<br />I need say no more; the previous, excellent reviewer has said it well. </span>

                    <span>Although I am a Christian--or perhaps because I am a Christian--I did not find this historical compendium quite as interesting as the author's History of the Jews. Nevertheless, much of it was fascinating, and Paul Johnson certainly put a great deal of research into this tome, which spans the period of the New Testament through 20th century America. For a Catholic, Johnson does not seem the least bit ashamed of depicting all of the dark, sinful actions of the institutional church.  He approaches Christianity as a historian, and as a Christian he pursues the truth, unafraid of where it will lead him.   His opinions infiltrate the work, but I always find them interesting and worthy of respect, even when I disagree with them.  
<br />
<br />Any party-Christian will find something to be offended by when he or she reads this book, as all aspects of the lives of religious founders and the works of Christian institutions are discussed, both the good and the bad.   I wish that the author had delved more into the historical origin of the many American sects; he focuses primarily on Catholicism (which, granted, was the history of Christianity for many centuries), but his book seems to speed up when it reaches Protestantism.

                    <span>Of all the history of Christianity (or related books) I've read, which are not that much (maybe 20 or so), this is definitely the best of all. Paul Johnson has written (as always) an erudite History, not a flawless one, but if you want more "before Christ" history, you can always read his "History of the Jews"; if you want a strictly unbiased history... well, I really don't now a less unbiased one than Johnson's.<p>The book is dense, plagued with data, and has a writing style of the intellectual Johnson is. If you are not intimidated with all of this (not that you should), this is definitely "the book for you". I totally recommend it as a non-specialist-history of religion lover.</span>

                    <span>"The History of Christianity", written in 1975 by the British scholar Paul Johnson, tries to convince the reader about what in the author's (biased) view are the deeply corrupted foundations of Christianity since the time of Saint John the Baptist and Jesus himself, given the influence and recurrence of Jewish traditions prevalent at the time, and later on and most specially in the periods of Catholic persecution in the first A.D centuries of the Roman Empire, at the time of Saints Paul and Peter who survived the martyrdom of Christ, and many others martyrs who were to follow and were persecuted ignominously by the pagan Empire; notwhitstanding the author efforts, in the end, the reader has the impression that all the massive historic evidence grouped by him against a pure formative basis of Catholic thinking and practice, is as unconvincing as any prejudiced effort made by any Church antagonist as him. Saint Augustine, for instance, one of the doctors of Christianity, is pillored as a forerunner of the Holy Inquisition in Spain and all his positive personal traits are read upside down by Paul Johnson, who sees everything in him with a tainted sight, portraying Augustine as a devilish person with no morals whatsoever.       <br>A file of martyrs and saints is defiled due to this distorted vision and the reader is almost convinced that nothing is left out of the catholic church tradition which deserves praise, being the catholic institution just the natural heiress of an opressive and bureaucratic (Roman) empire only intent on controlling human beings and their properties for the sake of attaining material wealth and indiscriminate power. But all the prejudiced efforts of the author crumble  to the ground when one has the feeling  that the bias with which he treats all religious matters is only the sheer inheritance of someone with a puritanical view intent on demolishing the liturgy of the catholic church, thus sacrificing the ceremonial aspects inherited by modernity and leaving nothing on its place. The absence of a complete bio of the author is conspicuous (who is him?, what is his personal creed?, in what he believes in?) and demonstrates that the author's goal is the sheer destruction of the catholic building, leaving nothing in its place.</span>

                    <span>To be entertaining sometimes you have to be provocative and simplistic and this book is rarely boring. To those who like their history to be balanced, however, this book will disappoint. In his History of America, Johnson tries to stir the pot with his lavish praise of Nixon and utter condemnation of Kennedy. Here, Johnson will again condemn a movement based on a couple of stupid  if entertaining, letters written by some of the less intelligent adherents but rarely takes a serious, balanced look. I've always believed that to defeat an opposing argument you have to put it in the strongest possible form. Otherwise you are just preaching to the choir. However, to entertain you make the other view look foolish and poke fun. Johnson is an entertainer.</span>
