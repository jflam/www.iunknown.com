                <span id="Label1">Change can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. The message of <I>Who Moved My Cheese?</I> is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives. <I>Who Moved My Cheese?</I> is a parable that takes place in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice--nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are "littlepeople," mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image. Their lives and belief systems are built around the cheese they've found. Most of us reading the story will see the cheese as something related to our livelihoods--our jobs, our career paths, the industries we work in--although it can stand for anything, from health to relationships. The point of the story is that we have to be alert to changes in the cheese, and be prepared to go running off in search of new sources of cheese when the cheese we have runs out.<p>  Dr.&nbsp;Johnson, coauthor of  <I>The One Minute Manager</I> and many other books, presents this parable to business, church groups, schools, military organizations--anyplace where you find people who may fear or resist change. And although more analytical and skeptical readers may find the tale a little too simplistic, its beauty is that it sums up all natural history in just 94 pages: Things change. They always have changed and always will change. And while there's no single way to deal with change, the consequence of pretending change won't happen is always the same: The cheese runs out. <I>--Lou Schuler</I></span>

                    <span>I read the book at the conclusion of my first-year in college; one of the times most filled with change in a young person's life.  I found Spencer Johnson to have a message that enabled me to modify how I anticipate and manage change.  The important thing to remember is not to take the book too literally or seriously, but simply as a suggestion.  He is simply inviting you to become more self-aware in your own life and develop effective strategies to achieve your goals.  I recommend this book, but would remind readers that there is more than one method of managing change in your life.  </span>

                    <span>Johnson wrote a simple allegory which has only one message:  Workers just need to deal with downsizing.  It is true that a market will throw us all curve balls, but the story does not go into that fact of life.  Rather, it  tells us of two guys (ie, employees) and two rats (!) who just sit around in a maze eating free cheese that was not produced by anyone.  Then--for no  reason, mind you--the cheese disappears.  The RATS have the pluck to get up off their butts to find more cheese, but the stupid, parasitical MEN are reduced to abject hunger before they wander around the maze  to find food. That wealth is made by thinking and working people is beyond  the shrink who wrote this book;  that "cheese" is moved by those  who serve the wants of consumers in not considered.  The only thing  "amazing" about this book is that such an insulting,  simpleminded, and stupid tale is considered "motivational". 
<br />
<br />If you are in management and see your employees not as producers working  toward a common goal, but  rather as sponges who parasitically soak up your  Christmas Bonus, this book is for you.  If, however, you are in the real  world of production and trade, any other story would better motivate your  employees. 
<br />
<br />The only significance of CHEESE is as an indication of just how empty and unintelligent American management is these days.  Co-author Blanchard wrote THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER--and that is the time horizon of the modern corporation.  When compared to Social Darwinism's sophisticated rendition in the days of Theodore Roosevelt, CHEESE and the Enron culture it represents, is obviously decaying, unintelligent, and unevolved.</span>

                    <span>Change is inescapable.
<br />
<br />Regardless of where it occurs, individuals must choose how to respond to change. Change can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective.
<br />
<br />The message of Who Moved My Cheese? is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives.
<br />
<br />Who Moved My Cheese? is a fun book told in a parable about life in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice - nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are "littlepeople," mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image.
<br />
<br />Overall it is short, concise and very easy to read. Told in story form enables all readers to understand and benefit from the book. Most people can easily relate to some of the situations that were described (I know I can). On more than a few occasions, when the handwriting was on the wall, I acted as Hem did, thinking things would return to normal. 
<br />
<br />On one such occasion, about ten years ago, my employer was involved in a merger with another company. Reluctant to change, I procrastinated. Suddenly, jolted to my senses by a 45 days notice, I got my act together and made things happen. Although, in the end I did find a better, and higher paying, job, I engaged in a risk that caused much stress for nearly two months.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book because it is essential for people to understand more about change and how they can deal with it. Change is not necessary a bad thing. It is just a matter of how you approach it.

                    <span>Spencer Johnson has addressed so much more than change in this remarkable little book.  I have found in Who Moved My Cheese? principles of goal setting, positive mental attitude, entrepreneurialism, courage, persistence, being action-oriented, not getting caught in over analysis.  A real practical storybook for young people to learn what it takes to have a fulfilling career and life.  A Brilliant and Simple book.</span>
