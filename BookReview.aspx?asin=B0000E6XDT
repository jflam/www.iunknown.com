                    <span>The information value of this so called documentary approaches 0.<P>No info on organisation, units, equipment or vehicles.<BR>No maps of the places they supposedly are operating in.<BR>No coherent story line for this documentary.<P>The people they interview, except Gen. Boykin, might just as well<BR>be members of some militia, by the way they dress, act and talk. <P>The takes of the people are not very convincing, <BR>the people may be dressed in military garb and have<BR>all the latest M4 mods and Blackhawk webbing <BR>but their stance and bearing is not befitting a war zone. <BR>They lounge around and pose on their Hummers <BR>like in a cheap war flic. <BR>Either the locations were totally devoid of enemy or <BR>the people are actually members of your local paintball club and<BR>the scenes were shot in Texas.<P>The interviews are bad and have no informational value.<BR>The scenes with the "operatives" are boring and have 0 action.<P>All in all very disappointing, I'm afraid.<P>Better purchase a military documantary from Discovery.com.<P>The one on US Navy SEAL BUD/S training is quite good and <BR>would serve as a fine example how a documentary may be produced.</span>

                    <span>Forget the fiction you've seen. The men in this film are the real deal. This graphic documentary is first-rate. You meet these Special Ops characters up close and personal. You go with these guys and follow their story from the streets of Iraq and the deserts of Afghanistan to their secret headquarters. What's particularly great is that they are often far from what you'd expect. But it makes you feel better to know they're there. This film also traces the history of Special Forces. If I had one complaint, I would have liked to have seen more interviews with the individual troops. But overall this film delivers big time.</span>

                    <span>Goddamn this dvd is the best military documentary footage ive seen so far. it goes deep inside of the US Special Ops and great actions of the Green Beret in Afghanistan and Irag. The most 2 exciting parts in this dvd are when US Special Ops fight against the uprising prisoners in Afghanistan and the hunt for Saddam and and weapons in Irag during the recent Gulf War. I highly recommended.</span>
