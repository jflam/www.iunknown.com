                <span id="Label1">What should we think when on the one hand Buddhism tells us that life is suffering and on the other we are told to enjoy life's every moment? Loved around the world for his simple, straightforward explanations of Buddhism, Thich Nhat Hanh has finally turned his hand to the very core of Buddhism and conundrums such as this. In the traditional way, Thich Nhat Hanh takes up the core teachings one by one--the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Twelve Links of Interdependent Co-Arising--but his approach is as fresh as a soft breeze through a plum orchard. For illustration, he dips into the vast stores of Buddhist literature right alongside contemporary anecdotes, pointing out subtleties that can get glossed over in other popular introductions. He also includes three short but key sutras, essential source teachings from which all Buddhism flows. Studying the basics of Buddhism under Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh is like learning basketball from Michael Jordan. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>This book is great for people who are just beginning to study Buddhism, like myself. This book discusses the basic principles of Buddhisms, and although it does get a little confusing what with all the teachings (i.e. the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Three Doors of Liberation, the Three Dharma Seals ect.) it is very informative, and makes me very excited to continue to learn more about this religion/type of living!

                    <span>Many people like Thich Nhat Hanh's works for his uncandid simplicity. This book I feel is for both the initiated practitioners and uninitiated practitioners alike. Thay covers so very much in this book, it is a bit baffling to figure where the review should begin. When I originally purchased this book, I was looking for someone to expound a bit on all the "dogma" I believed I saw in Buddhism. I had read a few of Thich Nhat Hanh's earlier works and had always been impressed by his "unscholarly" approach to the Buddha Dharma.<p>Nhat Hanh truly delivered to me what I came looking for, the book is so very thorough. He literally covers just about everything one needs to know about the "ritualistic or discipline oriented" side of practice here. Thich Nhat Hanh's Zen is a bit playful often, and although we see glimpses of that here, I have to say it almost IS a bit scholarly. It's truly a very exceptional book, sure to bring you more growth to personal practice.<p>Please enjoy the book:)</span>

                    <span>This is a good book - I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars - and 3 and a half is not available - as I write this I'm still not sure if it's getting 3 or 4 stars.<p>Before I bought this book I (like you) wanted to read the reviews of others who have read the book. Trinity's review for some reason caught my attention and kept popping into my head as I read the book. Really just one theme - "Buddhism For A Generation Weaned On Mr. Rogers" specifically Trinity's view of the language.<p>There were times where the language was too flowery. I know I'm reading about and am in the space of Buddhism and that this type of criticism goes against my preconceived notions of Buddhism, but it just bugged me here or there and I got distracted.<p>My Wondering Monkey Brain aside I thought this book was a good next step. A good exploration into Buddhism that goes beyond the introductory level. That's what I was looking for - a next step onto the eightfold path or Buddhism 102.<p>There are some very good things in this book. Very good detail into other avenues of Buddhism that I was not aware of. See the table of content. Part 1 and 2 I found excellent and familiar. Parts 3 and 4 were new and hard to follow, but all in all contained very good detail and specific areas and information.<p>Again - this is a good 2nd step. If you're looking for a little more than you're used to or a little more in-depth view into Buddhism this is a good book. <p>Good - not great. I'm still torn between giving a 3 or 4 star rating. Reluctantly I'm giving it a 3.<p>Thich Nhat Hanh sounds like a fantastic man and you could feel his goodness and love coming through each chapter.</span>

                    <span>This book requires the reader to explore the interelatedness of all the Buddhist doctrines. I read this at the same time as Bhante Gunaratana's *Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness* and found that it provided a depth and meaning that Gunaratana's simpler exposition did not. That's not to say that I was not confused at various points! But Thich Nhat Hanh's warmth and loving-kindness reaches right off the page to express the inner meaning of the Buddha's teaching in daily life. Well worth digging into.</span>
