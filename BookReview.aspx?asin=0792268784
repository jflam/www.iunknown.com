                <span id="Label1"><p>In a single year, 25 million people will travel specifically to observe and photograph wild birds, spending 18.1 billion dollars on trips, equipment, and publications. And this dedicated population continues to grow each year.</p> <p>Now, National Geographic offers novice to advanced birders and photographers a sturdy, easy-to-carry guide packed with the information they will need to take their best wild bird photographs. Author Rulon Simmons, a 30-year birder and award-winning photographer, joins Bates Littlehales, a 40-year National Geographic photographer specializing in birds, to offer specifics on finding and photographing birds, whether in the backyard or in the nation&#146;s stunning national parks. Includes comprehensive information with full-color images on the right films and lenses to use; the best time of day to shoot; stalking, luring, and &#147;posing&#148; birds; range maps and birding hotspots; and a complete index. This excellent companion to National Geographic&#146;s &#35;1 selling <i>National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America</i> is the only book photographers will need to capture stunning images of wild birds.</p></span>

                    <span>As if teaching children with challenging behaviors isn't enough, I spend much of my time off birding with my camera. Some might argue the two activities are one and the same, and anyone who has tried to capture a great blue heron lifting off the wetlands, only to turn tail and fly behind rushes would agree...speaking from experience. Whenever I set off to capture the feathered members of our planet, I get a few shots, but always think I could do better. If only I'd not moved so fast, if only I could afford a 600mm lens, if only...<P>Mr. Simmons's book has helped me to look at bird photography a bit differently, and given me permission to be happy with the good shots I do get. Although he covers many of the basic tenets of bird photography, such as knowing your subject, having the right equipment, and shooting techniques, the true gift of this guide is his concept of showing the birds in their environmental setting. Most of his photos are those wonderful bird portraits in larger than life detail we would all love to take, but he makes a good case for showing birds in their habitat, providing enough detail to identify the bird. Most of my photos are of this type, because although I am fairly good at stalking and being patient, my longest lens is still only 420mm with a tele-extender.<P>He gives information on how to shoot various aspects of bird behavior, such as courtship, nesting and flight, and this information is all helpful. He also gives ideas for various categories of birds, such as shorebirds. The book is guidebook sized, so it can travel into the field with you. If you wish to become more serious in your efforts to take photos of birds, whether in the field or at your backyard feeder, this is a great resource.</span>
