                    <span>Fischer does a good job chronicling the events around Washington's early campaigns in the Revolution.  But it was
<br />truly painful to slog through his dry, dry prose.

                    <span>Many historians have in recent years picked up on the idea of so-called social history or what David Donald has called, "The intense study of the unexceptional." Since I tend to agree with Donald's opinion of this new movement among historians I was dismayed to find that the Editor's Note promised (or warned) that this book was that kind of study.  Therefore I started this book with much trepidation and with the idea that I was not going to be impressed at all. I didn't have to read to many pages however before I found that my premonition of doom was very much a mistake, for there is very little in this book that I didn't find to be very enlightening and enjoyable. 
<br />
<br />The author does spend a good deal of time writing about what the common soldiers of both armies were suffering through but he does it in such a way that it only adds flavor to the bigger story he is telling. One gets a real feel for the miseries of the night marches through mud, ice, snow and rain with inadequate shoes and clothing. As the story unfolds one has to wonder how the men of either army managed to survive the weather, let alone combat. The author also tells of the infamous treatment suffered by the civilian population of New Jersey at the hands of British and German troops. This behavior turned a fairly docile population into angry patriots and this contributed mightily to the success of later American efforts. 
<br />
<br />Throughout most of this book Professor Fischer is very kind to George Washington and in the case of the disaster at New York perhaps too kind. On the whole though the author offers what seems to be a very credible picture of Washington the general and the trials he faced. In the modern age of instant communications it is hard to imagine that in 1776 Americans from different states had little in common except language and sometimes not even that. Washington faced a difficult task in fusing this disjointed group into an American Army but he did it and Fischer explains how. The author also clearly shows how Washington and his lieutenants learned from their mistakes and grew into their roles. The lessons learned in this campaign by Nathaniel Greene would become very important as the war wore on. It would also turn out to be very important that Lord Cornwallis failed to learn much at all from his Jersey experiences. 
<br />
<br />Most important of all however is that the American cause that was about to collapse in mid December 1776 was on the offensive by the following spring. The thesis of this book is that the campaigns that started with "Washington's Crossing" were a turning point in American history and the author makes a very compelling argument for his thesis. The campaigns of the winter of 1776-77 are not often given the credit they deserve in deciding the outcome of the American Revolution, an error I have been guilty of myself. Reading this extremely informative, well-written and thoroughly researched book has made a believer of me and hopefully it will influence generations of historians yet to come. </span>

                    <span>Anyone who has tried to arrange photos in an album knows what a pain it is to put history in order, even when you were part of  it. What you have done for your photos, David Hackett Fischer has done to the New York and New Jersey campaigns of 1776-1777. Fischer has brought order to the diaries, dispatches and reminiscences of many of the actors who played roles in the Trenton-Princeton campaign -- a campaign that gave new hope to a revolution that was faltering and on the verge of failure.
<br />
<br />Fischer masterfully lays out his tale, using a trove of evidence about the players, describing how their competence and worldview played into the way events turned on December 26, 1776. Fischer describes the British way of fighting, rightly considered the most professional and feared of its day. His chapter on the Hessians makes it clear that Washington was not fighting a band of drunks at Trenton, but a regiment of proud, able professionals who had withstood a wearying week of harassment by American raiding parties. Americans are described in their varied rambunctiousness, anxious enough to fight, but loathe to be led. Washington is portrayed as an eminent aristocratic Virginian, initially at a loss to lead the fractious rebels under his command. 
<br />
<br />Fischer brilliantly evokes the battles leading up to Trenton and those that followed. He makes it easy to imagine oneself on the fields of battle. Along the way, one shares the miseries of the Americans revolutionaries -- trudging barefoot over icy ground, sleeping without the tents they had to abandon when New York fell, enduring bitterly cold night marches in blinding snow. The crossing of the Delaware is depicted as enormously difficult: 2 of 3 crossings failed entirely due to the impossibility of maneuvering around house-size ice floes barreling down the river. Fischer shows great respect for the fighting style and bravery of all armies. He does not shrink from detailing the atrocities that lost the British whatever public support they might have had. Neither does he shrink from expressing his deep admiration of George Washington, the commander of towering determination, flexibility and action, who brilliantly out-generaled the British and Hessians and managed to forge his undisciplined troops into a potent fighting force.
<br />
<br />Nelson Runger, who read the book for the audio CD, was excellent, adopting light accents (British, German, Celtic, Yankee, Virginian) for different characters. Keeping this up over 15 CDs was an amazing feat, and helped to bring the story alive.
<br />
<br />"Washington's Crossing" is an awesome work. It ably illustrates Fischer's thesis that decisions by individuals can have enormous effects on history. Washington's crossing of the Delaware, and the succeeding victories in Trenton, Princeton, and the New Jersey "Forage War" succeeded in large part because of the unsummoned contributions of men and women to the Cause. Whether as militia, spies, pamphleteers or soldiers under arms, each heeded the call in the fight for liberty. Fischer's work is a fitting tribute to their efforts.</span>

                    <span>Most Americans can recall the image of Washington crossing the Delaware from the famous 19th century painting. Fewer (myself included prior to this book), however, know the true significance of the Battle of Trenton. In Washington's Crossing, historian David Hackett Fischer places the Battle of Trenton in its historical context. The result is a fascinating history that is a work of masterful storytelling. 
<br />
<br />One of the things that I really like about this book is that it is so complete and well organized. Fischer begins by discussing the three armies that were in the American colonies in 1776: the English regulars, the Hessian mercenaries, and the American patriots. The cultural and military differences between these forces are not only interesting but they were to have a major impact on the way the war was waged. Next, the fall of New York, with its dire implications for the American cause, is described. Even though we all know how the story eventually ends, Fischer was able to get me on the edge of my chair as if I was reading a thriller. The effects of the works of Thomas Paine, the British campaign through New Jersey, the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and the Forage War of 1777 comprise the remainder of the body of the book. Throughout, Fischer introduces people and events often forgotten by the average history textbook. As a former art history student, I remember scoffing about Washington standing up in the boat. As Fischer explains, all the soldiers crossing the Delaware that day had to stand because the water covered the bottom of the boats! That is just one of the many instances where history comes to life in this remarkable book. 
<br />
<br />Fischer wraps up his book with a conclusion that brings all of the threads together. Washington's crossing is proved to be an historical turning-point, not just an iconic painting. One of the most powerful ideas I was left with was the American "policy of humanity". As conceived by these men of the Enlightenment, patriots treated their British and Hessian prisoners as if they deserved the same rights that the Americans were fighting for. I found that incredibly inspiring and applicable to modern day events. 
<br />
<br />You will also be left with awe for Washington and the Americans of the time. I have never been a hero-worshipper of Washington's, but you have to have enormous respect for a man who created victory out of seemingly inevitable defeat.  
<br />
<br />The closing line of the book says it all: "The story of Washington's Crossing tells us that Americans in an earlier generation were capable of acting in a higher spirit - and so are we."

                    <span>As 1776 drew to a close, the Revolutionary War in America was in dire straits. Having landed over 30,000 British and Hessian troops on American soil, it appeared the King would successfully quell the rebellion. British forces had expelled the Colonial Army from New York and across New Jersey and the Delaware River. Meanwhile they had regained Rhode Island. Their strategy of retaking and pacifying one colony at a time seemed to be working. If the British could wrangle a major defeat of Washington and the Continental Army an end to the Revolution was certain. Even so, many thought that unless Washington acted quickly, the Red Coats would simply win by default, whether or not General Washington were captured. 
<br />
<br />But then the British forces made a fatal miscalculation.  Abiding by the long established rules of "civility" in warfare, they wintered over, awaiting fairer battle weather in the spring of 1777.
<br /> 
<br />Fisher tells the fascinating and dramatic story of the events of the 1776 winter campaign that turned the tide from an inevitable British victory to an inevitable American victory. Washington's Crossing in the pre-dawn hours on the day after Christmas of 1776 back into New Jersey was a tremendous ordeal for his troops which were ill-shod, ill-clothed and weary. But the story of the Battles of Trenton and Princeton are more than a blow-by-blow record of struggle and heroism. These battles had great meaning for the participants, the people of that generation as well as every generation down to Americans today. 
<br />The reader is treated to an exciting account of an historical event coupled with a fascinating analysis of its importance in nearly 400 pages of pointed prose. The extensive appendices serve not only to back David Hackett Fischer's cogent analysis, but also adds interesting perspectives on historiography, art and statistics.
<br /> 
<br />No doubt that "Washington's Crossing" benefits from voluminous sources that describe every facet of the battles, from the perspective of command and control down to acts of individual heroism and what the individual soldiers were doing and thinking. This is a fun and informative read any lover of American history will not want to miss.
