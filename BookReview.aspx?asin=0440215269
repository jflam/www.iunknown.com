                    <span>Soldat is one of the best books I've ever read about the human side of WWII. Knappe takes us from his graduation from gymnasium (high school?) where we meet several of his friends. He describes his entry into the workers corps, and from there, his entry into the army. We see that Knappe is simply a soldier who is proud of his country and is excited to do his duty. Knappe describes his first taste of battle and the death that comes with battle. He is no longer a carefree young man, but now a battle-proven soldier. We follow Knappe through the invasions of France, and later, his descent into the frozen steppes of Russia. Soldat describes the horror and the futility of fighting in Russia. As the war nears the end, Knappe then feels the futility of war - the loss of his brother; the fear of dying; his realization that German refugees are now a reality. Finally, he describes his years as a prisoner of war - held by the Russians for 4 years. <P>At the end of the book, you ask yourself, "What was the whole point of war?" The human loss - the suffering. This is a fantastic book, and it would make one heck of a movie!</span>

                    <span>I read this book in 1995, and was struck by the brutal honesty with which Siegfried Knappe addressed the issues he was faced with, which come down to one word, survival. In reading this book the reader comes away realizing the average German soldier was not moved by thoughts of grand world conquest or heroic deeds, he was moved by the thoughts of his family left behind, by the fear of letting his comrades down, by the desire to live another day to see his unborn child. Above all else, I found this book to be a very moving love story, for Knappe explains what kept him going during his brutal years in Soviet POW camps, namely the love and desire to see his wife, Lilo. I was fortunate to speak with Siegfried Knappe after reading this book, and he generously offered to autograph my copy, which I gladly took him up on. However, I was most happy to hear that his lovely wife Lilo was still with him and that they had lived a wonderful life together since the war. I highly recommend this book to anyone struggling in today's world....it will offer insight in how one man and woman survived against all the odds of a world at war</span>

                    <span>Siegfried Knappe is one of the Wehrmacht's better officers. He is conscientious, ambitious, hard-working, a good student, and an able leader. Soldat follows Knappe throughout his experiences in the German Army, starting before the war. Knappe starts as an artillery officer, where he is dismayed to learn that the supposedly high-tech German military still uses horses to tow its cannons and howitzers around. Still, he is an intelligent officer, and eventually makes his way up the career ladder,winning promotions and medals, and eventually securing a staff position in Hitler's own bunker toward the end of the war. After the fall of Berlin, Knappe is taken prisoner and sent to Siberia, where he tells of Soviet attempts to brainwash him and his comrades. He is finally released and makes his way back to his family in Germany, and eventually emigrates to America.<P>For all his wealth of experience (He fought in almost every major theater of the European War) however, Knappe tells the story with such a dearth of feeling and emotion that the story feels like a historical research paper, and not the wartime memoirs and recollections of a combat veteran. While Knappe is undoubtedly a combat soldier (he was wounded several times) he never relates the sense of terror, exhilaration, heartbreak and fatigue associated with combat. The death of his own brother is related as though he were a distant relative or neighbor's son. <P>If you're looking for an insider's view of the WW2 German military by a real up-and-coming officer, this is your book. If, however, you're looking for a true combat memoir, there are none better than Guy Sajer's "Forgotten Soldier."</span>

                    <span>I'm writing this to say I like Soldat for all the reasons most other reviewers don't. I like the fact that Knappe focuses his narrative on his own interests and motivations during the war and not the war aims, troop movements, numbers and battle sequences that the other reviewers can't get enough of. The photo section included in the paperback edition is made up of Knappe's personal photos taken while on vacation, dating, or in uniform through the years. His decisions throughout the war are guided by two things; his career path as an army officer and the time he spends with his young wife. I was fascinated by the twists of fate that kept him moving from place to place attached to different commands. Clearly, Knappe's war experiences qualified him to write revealing, detailed and highly technical war novels from the German viewpoint. He chose, however, to fill his novel with the rare human touch of things and people he most valued during the war. If you remember and like 'Samurai!' by Saburo Sakai, Soldat has a similar tone.</span>

                    <span>Knappe gives the reader a great insight on the day to day running of the German Army as his role as an officer in the horse drawn artillery and then as he moved up the ranks, ending up being one the defenders of Berlin serving under General Weidling.<P>He fought in a number of campaigns that included France, Russia, Italy & finally defending Germany as the end drew near.<P>He was a very lucky man to have survived the war and its aftermath in a variety of harsh Russian prison camps. Knappe comes across as a decent sort of fellow and like most other German soldiers was appalled when the truth of what the Nazis had been doing in the concentration camps was finally revealed.<P>The writing style is fairly straight forward and as someone else stated has a rather cold style about it, but it is totally absorbing and I highly recommed it to anyone interested in military history.</span>
