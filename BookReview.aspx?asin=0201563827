                    <span>This was the original book of C++ "idioms and traps", full of practical details such as where to use virtual destructors and the correct way to write the copy constructor and assignment operators. Then Scott Meyer's book came along with such sparkle and wit that I put this book aside, even though they pretty much covered the same ground. The second edition of Meyers' book covers the new ANSI standard - and while this was needed, it has a fair amount of "code lawyering" and is no longer a breeze to read. I'm glad I held onto the Murray book to cover the basic concepts, even though it's slightly out of date.</span>

                    <span>Once you have good knowledge of the basics and know basic OOP, you should start reading this book. This book has lots of good information reguarding design and loop holes all new programer can commit. But its best feature is that its so easy to understand.</span>

                    <span>For the reviewer below that stated that this book is dated because it does not cover templates could not be farther from reality, as apparently he has not read the book nor has he looked at the table of contents. If my eyes are still functional, this book has two chapters consectutive dedicated to to templates, chapter 7 [Templates] and 8[Advanced Templates]. This book is easy to read and for the novice wanting to get up to speed on the syxtax of the language and more importantly when and how to use each contruct of the language, this book has no equal except two other books. The books are Kayshav Dattatri's C++ Effective Object Oriented Software Construction and James O. Copliens Advanced C++: Styles and Idioms from Prentice Hall and Addison Wesley respectively. This book is not even 300 pages which allows you to read it again and bolster what you vacumed on the first pass and ready for instinctive mastery for the second and third passes if you are really ambitious. The discussion on smart pointers is informative and will assist you in your way to patternizing COM code. This book is for all experience types and serves as a perfect desktop reference guide for C++ masters alike. With this book and the two mentioned above, plus the C++ IO Streams Handbook by Beale, there are no other books you should refer to, probably including Stroustrup's.</span>

                    <span>This is a clearly written introduction to some of the subtleties of C++, discussing topics which you otherwise might not think about until they came back to bite you. I would recommend it for the C programmer migrating to C++, and possibly for the junior programmer who is just starting professional work. Note that it is slightly dated; for example, templates and namespaces are not mentioned.</span>

                    <span>Robert Murray's book is fantastic. It is very useful to help a programmer progress from being a beginner to at least an intermediate level C++ programmer. After having read 2 introductory books, I was having trouble finding a book that would help me progress as a C++ programmer. All the books were too elementary or too esoteric (like design patterns). Then I found "C++ Strategies and Tactics" and my prayers were answered. It's so good that I read it twice. I strongly recommend this book. I wish a 2nd edition would come out, now that we have an ANSI Standard C++.</span>
