                    <span>What a fabulous insight into the Architecture firm of Delano & Adrich. This book with its beautiful photographs and engaging essay provide an invaluable tool for all architectural enthusiasts: from the average architecture buff to those involved in scholarly research. <P>I'm most impressed that the authors not only sought to perform research on the buildings themselves, but moreover, examined the partners and the social influences of the times. I feel we gain so much from the writers thru their experience of having read Delano's letters in archive at Yale!<P>This book should stand as a model for future chronologist of architectural history. It is truly a wonderful presentation - the best that I've seen published to date.<P>Congratulations.</span>

                    <span>This book on Delano & Aldrich is a beautiful and well-researched monograph of an important early 20th century New York City architectural firm. Not only is it worth buying to look through, but I found the book very well written, thorough, and engaging. I would say it is a must-have for the architectural historian and enthusiast, as well as for anyone with an interest in the changing face of New York City in the early 20th century. Thoroughly researched and beautifully photographed, it covers the work of Delano & Aldrich from elegant club-houses to town and country houses, institutional buildings and LaGuardia Airport. The book presents the work of this important American architectural firm in a formal yet highly readable format - drawing on a vast amount of research, historical documentation including photographs and drawings, and rich contemporary color photographs. The text offers analytical description and historical context; the photographs speak for themselves of D&A's fascinating and varied body of work. Congratulations to its authors Peter Pennoyer and Anne Walker!</span>
