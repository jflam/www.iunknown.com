                    <span>Reading the Nine Steps To Financial Freedom is one thing, but using the workbook companion along with it makes implementing the steps much easier. For exaample, finding the root of your money issues that are based in childhood, with only the reading book, and without the workbook might be a bit difficult. Sure, there are example stories, but books like this were written for those of us who need a little hand holding when we're attempting to change our understanding of finances and how it all works. <p>I am not one to want extra books around that I don't love and use, and though I was lucky and found my own copy of this book used, and in pristine condition, had I known it existed before then, I would have ordered it with the reading book, it's that helpful. If you can follow directions, and be honest with yourself, with this book it would be very hard not to implement the Nine Steps in your life.</span>

                    <span>As a self proclaimed "artsy, spiritual, mushy" type, I absolutely hate left brained detail oriented personal budgets.  However, my lack of attention to detail was reflected in my personal financial situation.  This booked helped me to look at the details of my finances through a psychological framework that included specific exercises to walk me through those details that I dread.  It helped me to get very clear on my financial motivations, dreams and blocks.  I loved it!</span>
