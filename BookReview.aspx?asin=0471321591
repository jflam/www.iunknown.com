                    <span>Yes, the 7 steps can teach people in all types of careers and lifestyles to improve their oral communications skills but some of her methods are a bit "out there".  For example: learning to focus on your voice as an instrument. The CD includes examples and anecdotes from Wilder's own work, and a number of exercises to help the reader implement the ideas set forth.  If you're looking to overcome your fear of public speaking, join Toastmasters and skip this CD.</span>

                    <span>As part of my Lotusphere preparation, I've been reading 7 Steps To Fearless Speaking by Lilyan Wilder.  She's a communication consultant who has coached a number of broadcast correspondents.  In this book, she outlines seven steps to take in order to become a more effective public speaker.  The seven steps are:  Experience Your Voice; Get A Response And Structure Your Thoughts; Establish A Dialogue; Tap Your Creativity; Learn To Persuade; Achieve Your Higher Objective; and Give The Gift Of Your Conviction.  <p>It's not a "short-cut" or "quick fix" book, in that she has exercises that you need to work through to get the most benefit from the program.  However, if you're willing to work at it and follow the path she lays out, you will emerge as a more confident and composed speaker when you find yourself called upon to speak in front of a group.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book expecting a book that would ease my anxiety of public speaking, and Ms Wilder certainly "claims" in her introduction that this book is to help you become less fearful, but the tips actually are for speakers who are ALREADY fearless but just need to improve their speech skills: For example: Get immediate response from audience. You know, the last thing I want to do in a presentation is further prolong it by asking what they think of it.  My plain goal, Ms Wilder, is just to complete a mediocre if dull presentation WITHOUT anxiety, not get responses from my audience and so forth. I can hardly find any good books on stage fright. They either don't help at all or are off the subject.</span>

                    <span>I recommend this book as one of your first books to read on public speaking along with Simply Speaking  by Peggy Noonan. 7 Steps is more complete and more like a text book to read. Wilder is a writer that uplifts you and encourages you rather than talking down to you like some other speach books by well known authors.  Interestingly, the book begins and ends with your voice as an instrument of vocal production.  Most other speech book writers don't address how to make your voice sound better. They take the: "Live with it approach."  Great singers practice and practice on the sound itself. Why not speakers.  May be they don't know any better or their publisher says: "too complicated." This author knows but does not overwhelm you.  One speaking book was so hard to follow on vocal production I had to set it aside for a while. Wilder made the exercises so easy to follow that I was not overwhelmed. Most of the book is about developing a content filled speech and then how to deliver it.  This book will build your confidence in speaking.</span>
