                    <span>I actually bought this book for a specific database I'm doing and after perusing it in the bookstore, thought it was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, some of the examples I tried were so bad that, although they worked, if the end-user did one little thing wrong, it would crash. And there was no explanation for what to do if there was a problem. The website was useless. They don't even have the Access 2003 Bible posted so that you can ask questions. The book suggested that they'd have updates and solutions if there were any problems, but I didn't see anything for Access 2003. The message boards seem to have been completed vacated, so that was no help either. Sadly, this book wasn't very much help to me. The CD is worthless to me, as well. The book referenced a database (AccessAutoAuctions.mdb) that I never did find. There was an AccessAutoAuctions, but I couldn't run it because it was looking for a server that I don't have access to. Too bad because part of my problem was supposed to be covered in that database. I feel that I wasted my money on this book. </span>

                    <span>As a newbie to Access, I found this title to be an utter waste of money. The index is abysmal--so much for the "Bible" concept. Very simply put, when I have a problem, I need to find the answer on Google groups because the book simply has no answers for me. Change a list box to a combo box? Create a multiple field index? Tough luck. The natural response would be to assume that this is a book for more advanced users. Trouble with that assumption is that the title of Chapter 1 is "Understanding Data."  Disgusting.</span>

                    <span>For the most part this book is very through on teaching you Access, however there is a lot of fluf in some of the instructions it walks you through. For example, everytime it walks you through steps on going to the properties screen of any object it will tell you step by step how to right click, how to scroll down to the properties and then left click on 'properties'. Anyone who needs this level of detail should probably be reading a 'Windows for dummies' book instead.
<br />
<br />The actual content of the book has so far been fairly thorough as far as understanding Access. The information regarding database design is more or less satisfactory for getting you started working with access, but for a complete understanding of databases in general it leaves a bit to be desired.
<br />
<br />For the Access content of the book I give it a 4/5 but looking at the book as a whole i have to take a whole point away because of the volumes of fluf i have to sift through to get to the meat and potatoes.</span>

                    <span>If you really want &#62;1000 pages that literally tell you the three ways to save a table/query/form every time you finish a task, then this book is for you.  (Besides, when hasn't Access prompted you to save a table?)  The instructions are fluff and filled with useless information, and as far as I can tell they don't approach the real theory of database design.  Don't expect to learn the tools necessary to build your own database, rather you learn how to construct their one example without the theory to apply it elsewhere.  This is bang your head against the table stupid, folks.</span>

                    <span>Microsoft Office Access 2003 Bible by Cary Prague, Michael Irwin and Jennifer Reardon is targeted at reader levels beginner to advanced.  I consider myself on the high end of that spectrum with 8 years experience in Access & VB development plus many more years of dBASE and FoxBase/FoxPro experience.  For its 1300+ pages it's fairly complete as a single-volume treatment of Access.   <p>Since Access 2000, the most comprehensive treatments of Access have been via 2-book sets (two of my favorites are Alison Balter and Getz/Litwin/Gilbert).  Book 1 addresses "desktop" issues (single user and a small number of networked users); Book 2 addresses "enterprise" issues.  As of this time there are no 2-book sets published for Access 2003.  I selected the 2003 Bible believing it was as good a single volume reference as is available to describe what's new in the 2003 version and on the balance it's OK.<p>For true novice users who haven't done any database work and/or have very little experience using Access, I'd recommend an entry level book - Access 2003 for Dummies, Access 2003 in 24 Hours, etc. before trying to tackle this book.  Those with some experience should do OK with the book.<p>The first 900 pages address the standard "bread & butter" issues of Access highlighting the few items that are new or different.  I was a little disappointed in the very brief treatment of ADO - more complete books sometimes devote several chapters; it's part of 1 chapter here.  The following few chapters cover what's really new & different - much more robust handling of Web interfaces including Data Access Pages, XML and InfoPath, but in very little detail (only 16 pages for InfoPath which is the one totally new technology).  The book is continues with a discussion of security which fairly thorough as is the following section on creating help systems.  The Advanced Access Database Chapter covers more advanced queries and improving performance but nothing one wouldn't expect in a book of this scope. <p>The CD included with the book is good - the full text of the actual book in PDF format as well as selected chapters from other Office 2003 Bible books covering Word, Excel, etc. - it's nice to have these as a reference on my laptop so I don't actually have to lug the book(s) to a client's office.  All the chapter exercises are there too..  Also included are several dozen demo programs, about half from Database Creations, Prague's company.</span>
