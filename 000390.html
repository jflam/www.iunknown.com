<p>I highly recommend reading this book before tackling Bernstein's book. It's a good mix of personal finance guidance with practical portfolio balancing advice. He also presents a much more simplified view of an investment portfolio than Bernstein's book. For example, in the equity portion of your portfolio, Malkiel advocates using extremely broad market index tracking funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund that tracks the Wilshire 5,000 index. Contrast that with Bernstein's recommendation for a mix of large-cap, small-cap and foreign stocks (and that's his Level 1 (a.k.a. simplest) Asset Palette)!</p>

<p>Two books that I would recommend which suggest a different tack from the "diversify, diversify, diversify" asset allocation bromides are The Warren Buffet Way[1] and the classic The Intelligent Investor[2]. These two books (and the practice of the second-richest man in America, Warren Buffet) argue that value investing is the best way because you're looking at the fundamentals of your investments instead of just whether they're bonds, tech stocks, or foreign stocks. Asset allocation doesn't tell you much more than "you need 30% equity, 20% government securities, and 50% bonds if you're over 45 and have a short time horizon."</p>

<p>The problem is that diversification isn't about building your wealth as much as it's about protecting yourself from bad investments. If you do your homework and invest intelligently, there's no reason why you need such aggressive protection. In other words, it stems from a worldview that assumes that you're going to lose your shirt as opposed to one that says you can make a lot of money if you just do your homework.</p>

<p>Much of Warren Buffet's investment advice is also available in his annual letters as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.[3]</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointers, Bill. The Intelligent Investor is one that's on my short list of books to read in this area.</p>

<p>My problem is that I don't have a much time to vet potential investments. Personally, I believe that my time is best spent working on things that I *am* good at, and spending time with my family. </p>

<p>The problem with picking stocks is that nobody has been able to do it consistently. If one believes in the Efficient Market Theory, then the argument is that in the long run that you can't do better than the market. I have some acquiantances who believe that they can exploit inefficiences in the market and certainly have had some short-term successes (and spectacularly so in one case). But in the end, I don't think that's a good game for me to play.</p>

<p>I agree with you about your best use of time. But you can also think of investing as an important hobby&mdash;you probably spend some amount of time on hobbies, right? It's also a wise use of time if you're managing investments that will materially benefit your children's future and yours as well.</p>

<p>One of the things I learned from The Millionaire Next Door (or was it The Millionaire Mind) is that investment advisors, while quite skilled and knowledgeable, don't necessarily have your best interests at heart. In other words, letting them do what they're ostensibly best at is sometimes contrary to your self-interest.</p>

<p>I just had twin daughters in October, so I'm speaking from a very hypothetical perspective. But it's one I hope to migrate towards when my girls are a bit older. In the meantime, I've got all my investments in index funds because they're as good as any other and often better in the long run.</p>
