                    <span>any of the examples worked!! I was so relieved to find the book when I scanned its index in the book before buying in the store.  <p>When I attempted to apply ANY of the examples; as others have mentioned, some examples were missing from the downloads for the book, and when I spent lengthy time typing the actionscript, checking and double checking, none of the examples worked 100% like they said they would.  <p>It was very frustrating to have read a chapter, apply the examples, and flip the page to read something to the effect of "Well, that's it!. After what we have just covered, Flash and Coldfusion integration doesn't get much harder than that".<p>I really wish the authors would have taken the time to ensure the examples, both printed and on their website actually worked before publishing the book!</span>

                    <span>I found this to be the most practical book for those who are 'getting started'.  The book does not assume too much about what the reader knows and makes no claim at being a complete reference; however, as a complete overview, it works fairly well and I couldn't find too many books that did this.  I am a ColdFusion user and wish to create richer applications with Flash Remoting.  I know almost nothing about ActionScript, and the book does a great job of explaining each of the components and how they all fit together.  If the book presumes anything, it might expect you to already be familiar with Flash MX</span>

                    <span>Even as an experianced Java programmer, I had hard time following the examples using Java in this book.<p>Some example codes in the book are missing in the download.<br>So I had to type them in myself only to find the examples in the book are not working.<p>This book is so poorly organized that I can't help but to suspect that it might have been written by more than one author in a hurry.<p>As an example, at one point the book was dicussing accessing the servlet in JRun and then ran the demo in Resin.</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure what the other reviewers were thinking. <br>The coldfusion examples were horrible and full of errors.<br>In the recordSet section we are told. "Instead of setting up a database and returning records we'll create a recordset and pretend it came from a database" so the actual returning of a recordset doesn't happen. There are not many books on remoting yet, I'd wait for a good one and use the Flash remoting tutorials on macromedia's site.</span>

                    <span>I was very impressed with this book, it gives a solid foundation to flash remoting, it doesn't matter if you use CF , J2EE, or .net it is all covered nicely.<p>I am very happy that it is not just a do this then this then this and you get this, but it goes into the why you did that to get that, not many books I have do that.<p>It even includes 3 of the most sought after applications involving online presence, the message board the email client as well as teh ecommerce solution.<p>This book is a '+' if you are wanting to get into flash remoting then this is the difinitive guide.</span>
