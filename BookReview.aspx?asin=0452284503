                <span id="Label1">Al Franken, or Dr. Al Franken as he prefers to be called, has written the first truly indispensable book of the new millennium. Filled with wisdom, observations, and practical tips you can put to work right away, <i>Oh, the Things I Know!</i> is a cradle-to-grave guide to living, an easy-to-follow user's manual for human existence. <br><br> What does a megasuccess like Al Franken-bestselling author, Emmy-award winning television star, and honorary Ph.D.-have to say to ordinary people like you? Well, as Dr. Al himself says, "There's no point in getting advice from hopeless failures." <br><br> Join Mr. Franken-sorry, Dr. Franken-on a journey that will take you from your first job ("Oh, Are You Going to Hate Your First Job!"), through the perils and pitfalls of your twenties and thirties ("Oh, the Person of Your Dreams vs. the Person You Can Actually Attract!"), into the joys of marriage and parenthood ("Oh, Just Looking at Your Spouse Will Make Your Skin Crawl!"), all the way to the golden years of senior citizenship ("Oh, the Nursing Home You'll Wind Up In!"). Don't travel life's lonesome highway by yourself. Take Al Franken along, if not as an infallible guide, then at least as a friend who will make you laugh.</span>

                    <span>Some good advice:  Always get the audio version of Al Franken's works - spoken/performed by Al himself.  It's so much better.    Franken is intelligent and hilarious.  You might even learn something.  Also: check out his show on air america radio (on the internet & radio).  
<br />
<br />P.S.  I listened to this on a long road-trip.  Not only did I laugh my *** off, I didn't want the drive to end for fear I might not finish the book.   </span>

                    <span>Oh, I've been a fan of Al's ever since the dawn of the Al Franken Decade. (For you younger kids who haven't learned about it yet in your History classes, the Al Franken Decade was the 1980s.)
<br />
<br />This book is probably my favorite of all of Al's books. Besides being hilarious, it's full of a lot of great advice.
<br />
<br />Oh, the fun I had reading it!

                    <span>When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken.</span>

                    <span>Pundit/comedian Al Franken serves up an extremely witty and wry slice of social criticism. After slogging through a certain John Simon book, this read was quite the breath of fresh air for me. Be warned, though. A lot of the advice Mr. (I mean Dr.) Franken offers is to be taken with a grain of salt, hilarious though it may be. Highly recommended for everyone, as is his book "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them".</span>

                    <span>This is quite possibly the worst guide to success ever written; however, it is by far one of the funniest! Full of all kinds of twisted information, the trick is realizing that there is truth in there; it's just not spoonfed to you. The ideas are fairly sound - it's just that the examples are so off the wall, you'd have to be crazy to believe them.
<br />
<br />If you read this for the humor and not the advice (as I'm almost positive it was intended), then you're in for a treat. If not, well, you've been warned.</span>
