                    <span>A 600+ pages tour of Flash MX buttons and menus... with just a couple ridiculously elementary  "tutorials" thrown in. Makes me think of somone who had to write a flash book and has never done anything with it but figure out how the user interface works.  You won't find anything useful in here, that is about CREATING something with Flash. As for me I am never gonna buy a book from this author again, and I am probably also ditching the whole "savvy" line as well. </span>

                    <span>The actual rating is MINUS 5 stars. This book sucks. The stupid CD DOES NOT WORK on PC. Finally I copied it from my Mac. More surprises. Some chapters, IMPORTANT ONES, ARE MISSING. Without completing these chapters, you can't move on. I am throwing my book away in disgust. I'm heading out to buy a book that actually works.
<br />People who can't even program their own CDs shoudn't write "How to" manuals.</span>

                    <span>If you would like to learn flash then this is a good book to start. With all the different titles out there, I believe that this comes clostest to being 'savvy'. It covers a lot of important concepts that you would need to get started like simple drawing, amimation, sounds, and a good intro to action script (if you don't know much about scripting then this maybe a hard concept to understand, MX has a simple interface of click and drag, but on the 2004 verison, the option was taken out).  <br>Like all complex program, flash is a 'bottoms up' program where you need to learn the simple concept first, then from it build up a more complex movie.<p>I brought this book with a Flash class I'm taking at my college of env design. It really helps when there is an instructor to help with the common questions. But, since I missed most of the class, I found this book to be very helpful. Nevertheless, I wish there were more 'hands on' chapters.</span>

                    <span>Congratulations!<p>You've made learning Flash about as difficult and tedious as possible. This book is hard to read and hard to follow.<p>PS: 10 color pages in a book about Flash is a little ironic isn't it?</span>

                    <span>I know Macromedia has announced that new versions of Flash are going to be coming out soon, but that doesn't mean people should turn away from Flash MX Savvy...lets face it, its easily one of the best Flash books out there.  Just look at the reviews!  Its rare to see a book with so many positive reviews (and so few negative ones).  So, it isn't just me, other people have benefited from this book also.<p>So, now for the review.  First off, the book is beautifully put together.  Its printed on super high quality paper - which is definitely a plus over some compuer books that seem to be printed on the cheapest paper in the world so that the publisher can make an extra buck.  The content is extremely well organized.  The autors seem like they put in a heck of a lot of time coming up with the best progression of content for those who might not have had previous flash expereince before.<p>Not only does the book cover the basics and intermediate topis, but it also covers a slew of other topics that you migt not normally find in other books: Flash and audio (there is a whole section of the book dedicated to this), Flash and Director, Flash and Freehand, etc.<p>Each section of the book is topped off by what the authors call a Hands On project, in which you get to take the stuff you've leanred during the previous chapters and apply it to a project of some sort.  This is somehting I definitely like...the babalnce between instructions and practical application.  Many other computer books are either all instruction or all practical application.  The balance tha is acheived int hsi book is just perfect.<p>The bottom line is that Flash MX Savvy is a great book.</span>
