                <span id="Label1">FAMILY FEUD  <P>A real estate lawyer in Connecticut's moneyed seaside communities, Beth Carpenter, 30, had beauty, brains and success. But she wanted more&#151;namely guardianship of her two-year-old niece, Rebecca, daughter of Beth's estranged sister, Kim. When Kim married Anson "Buzz" Clinton, 28, a former male exotic dancer deemed an unsuitable guardian by the Carpenter family, Beth became obsessed with the idea that only his death could ensure that she and her parents would get custody of the child. On March 10, 1994, on a lonely stretch of road, Clinton was shot five times.   <P>MISFIT MURDERERS  <P>Behind Clinton's death lay a bizarre murder-for-hire conspiracy that found privileged professionals and local misfits joined in a cold-blooded plot against an innocent man. This homicidal group included attorney Haiman Clein, 52. A husband, father, and successful businessman, Clein was Beth Carpenter&#146;s boss&#151;and also her sexually obsessed, cocaine-snorting, murderously obedient lover. The paid killers were two buddies, organizer Joe Fremut and triggerman Mark Despres, who brought his 15-year-old son Christopher along for the hit. The aftermath of this brutal crime would set investigators and prosecutors on a long and twisted path strewn with lies, treachery, and deceit that would cross the Atlantic Ocean before finally bringing justice home.</span>

                    <span>It is taught in Law Schools that the two most trying times for otherwise sane, rational clients is during divorce/custody and probate. M. William Phelps has painstakingly documented a True Crime tome encompassing both of the Bad Times. It is said that this toxic child custody case was featured on Court TV. I don't know. My local rinky-dink East Ottertail Can & String Telephone & Cable Company does not see fit to give me my Court TV! Nor have I caught this case on A&E's excellent *City Confidential.* So Phelps' chronicle is all I know. <P>Owen's Ann Rule rule definitely applies here. Do not peek at the pictures in the center unless/until Law Enforcement has "got their guy - or gal" unless you are one of those readers who cannot stand suspense and read the end first. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer</span>

                    <span>To Anson "Buzz" Clinton, wife Kim's family must have seemed more like "outlaws" than "in laws." Never allowing Kim and Buzz a moment's peace, Mr. & Mrs. Carpenter and eldest daughter Beth Ann were hell bent on gaining custody of Kim's daughter, Rebecca. They were equally obsessed in their desire to prevent Kim from marrying Buzz, a former exotic-dancer-turned-nurse's aide who was desperately trying to turn his life around and become a responsible man his family could be proud of. <P>Clinton's parents and siblings loved him dearly, and had no doubt Buzz would succeed in making something special of his life. Kim Carpenter's family, however, begged to disagree. Deeming Kim an unfit mother and Buzz an unsuitable mate, Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter and daughter Beth Ann insisted to anyone who would listen that Rebecca would be far better off with them. <P>Manipulating circumstances, shamelessly using (and hurting!) people who might assist them in their cause, and very often turning the truth into "anything but," the Carpenter's plotted and schemed to no avail. Ultimately, the courts disagreed with attorney Beth Ann's arguments for custody, and sent Rebecca home to Kim and Buzz. <P>Unable to accept the thought of Rebecca living in a happy family unit that didn't include HER, Beth Ann took matters into her own hands. Utilizing her good looks, legal talents, and some positively lethal feminine wiles, Beth Ann coerced married-with-four-children lover/boss Haiman Clein into doing the unthinkable. Convincing Clein the only way Rebecca would be "safe" from "abusive" Buzz and "incompetent" Kim was Buzz's untimely death, Clein set out in search of a hit man to make this dream come true for the legal protege he had fallen head over heels for. The end result is a terrible tragedy for so many--all to ensure that Beth Ann and family met their selfish desires at others expense.<BR> <BR>Phelps should be credited for digging far deeper into a complex story than many an author would have. It would have been only too easy for Phelps to brand "hitman" Mark Depres and his misfit coterie of friends, or attorney Haiman Clein, as the villains here and be done with it. Instead, Phelps painstakingly researched the intricacies of this case and discovered "wheels within wheels" to expose the true villain--Beth Ann herself (and more than likely her parents, though they have not been prosecuted to date). <P>I highly recommend this true crime tour de force--you will find that putting this book down will no doubt prove as much of a challenge as it had to have been to research it. Five stars to Phelps!</span>

                    <span>Hi<BR>I happened to pick up your book, "Lethal Guardian" the other day. You did a fabulous job with the telling of this story. The details and the depth of your book pulled me into the story right away. In fact, I liked it so much I went to the store today and bought your first book, "Perfect Poison." I usually only read Anne Rule's books as far as true crime goes. I was delighted to discover another worthy writer, like yourself, in this genre. <BR>I just wanted to encourage you to continue with your writing. You have been given a gift! Now, go take on the day.... :-)</span>

                    <span>Lethal Guardian is one of those books you can't put down. It starts by pulling you into the crime and compelling you to want to know every detail. Thanks to M. William Phelps I felt like I had talked to each witness myself. The vivid descriptions and details of this book make it a great read.<BR>After reading this book I feel as though I knew what each person in this horrible tragedy had felt and thought.</span>
