                <span id="Label1">Plum Sykes&#146;s beguiling debut welcomes readers to the glamorous world of Park Avenue Princesses, the girls who careen through Manhattan in search of the perfect Fake Bake (tan acquired from Portofino Tanning Salon), a ride on a PJ (private jet) with the ATM (rich boyfriend), and the ever-elusive fianc&#233;.   <P>With invitations to high-profile baby showers and benefits, more Marc Jacobs clothes than is decent, and a department store heiress for a best friend, our heroine known only as Moi is living at the peak of New York society. But what is Moi to do when her engagement falls apart? Can she ever find happiness in a city filled with the distractions of Front Row Girls, dermatologists, premieres, and eyebrow waxes? Is it possible to find love in a town where her friends think that the secret to happiness is getting invited to the Van Cleef and Arpels &#252;ber-private sample sale? And how is she going to deal with the endless phone calls from her mother in England demanding that she get married to the Earl next door?  <P>With enormous wit and an insider&#146;s eye, Sykes captures the nuances of the rich and spoiled in a heartwarming social satire, featuring a loveable "champagne bubble of a girl" who&#146;s just looking for love (and maybe the perfect pair of Chlo&#233; jeans).</span>

                    <span>I'm giving this book 1 1/2 stars with and extra 1/2 star because I didn't buy, but checked it out of the library. I understand that this is SUPPOSED to be satirical but it's just boring, dumb and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed were the bits about fashion and perhaps Julie Bergdorf's character. But the narrator known only as moi was a character I neither liked nor cared about. I was quite dissapointed that she ends up with a good guy in the end (come on, you couldn't have been surprised). If you must read this book (like some must watch Gigli or a train wreck), then don't buy it. But if you're smart, read Sophie Kinsella's shopaholic series. Now there is a main character with heart,brains and good fashion sense.</span>

                    <span>Bergdorf Blondes is a frightening funny novel about a pack of predatory Park Avenue Princesses in search of a PH (Potential Husband). Set in post 9/11 New York City and authentically complete with devilish details about sample sales, botox injections and Brazilian bikini waxes, this book offers readers the rare opportunity to observe celebutantes in their natural habitat: charity balls, private jets and 4-star restaurants.<P>Rather than take easy sucker punches at Manhattan's privileged party girls, first time novelist, Plum Sykes, instead lovingly explores the experiences and exploits of a group of twenty and thirty-something women, who will one day rise to the status of Ladies Who Lunch, provided they can find the kind of fiance who they believe will make a girl's complexion glow, as no dermatologist can.<P>Does it matter at all that these women see their fiances as stepping stones to a better life and better invitations, rather than true life partners? Not in the slightest. These heiresses eye eligible men as any successful predator would: as fair game in the hunt for sustenance, provided of course, the camouflage is of the haute couture variety, the meal is strictly low-carb, and the transportation to and fro is on a PJ (allegedly New York society-ese for a private jet.)<P>Rather than express their horror that this is the way some chose to live their lives, readers should instead sit back, turn the pages and observe as newcomer Plum Sykes exposes the city's charity circuit for what it is: a nervous group of strangely ambitious women who would rather work like ditch diggers to remain forever young, rather than develop the strength of character that will keep them interested and interesting long after they've traded in their Manolos for sadly sensible flats.</span>

                    <span>this book is one of the worst that i have read in quite some time. the narrator is completely detestable and you get the sense that the author is unaware of this (particularly because it seems that ms. sykes has based the annoyingly named character, moi, after herself). one of the numerous irritating plots attempts to recreate pride and prejudice (a la bridget jones's diary) yet turns the tale into a predictable and unrealistic pile of crap. at least jones, which i also found trite, provided the reader with a protagonist who was somewhat appealing. i wonder if anna wintour actually read her protege's ridiculous novel before so generously providing the compliment on its jacket. if so, her skills as an arbiter of taste are grossly overrated. even more preposterous is the fact that sykes fancies her book is on par with such great novelists as wharton, capote and fitzgerald. i highly doubt that history will regard bergdorf blondes on this level of literature or even remember it. let's hope the inevitable movie fails at the box office.</span>

                    <span>Plum Sykes' first novel, Bergdorf Blondes, displays very little plot or character development. Although the novel itself is a quick and easy read, its ending is quite predictable and the reader will often find him/herself speed-reading simply to get through parts that appear in every romance book under the sun. I have yet to find anything that makes the novel unique, for even the diction is quite mundane. Bergdorf Blondes seems to be targeted mostly for teenagers and women in their early twenties who are still searching for that Hollywood romance that can only occur on the big screen. To summarize, the plot is far from complicated: boy meets girl, girl falls in love with the wrong boy only to realize that the one she wants has been right in front of her all along. Though the setting involves the Manhattan elite, Sykes does a poor job at developing the characters' personalities and leaves some ends untied. Few parts of the novel are quite amusing; however, the negatives far outweigh the positives in what can only translate to be a C class romance novel. I would advise to read only if you desire something light to get your mind off work, school, or all the nonfiction work circulating around the bookstore.</span>
