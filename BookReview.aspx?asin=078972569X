                    <span>This won't necessarily be a book you look at much once you've digested its contents.  What it does is outline basic database concepts using Access in its examples.  You can use the book to get a basic Access database started, but don't rely on it if you're looking to create databases.  Get an Access or database design book if that's your primary goal - IF, that is, IF you can make heads or tails out of most of what those books are talking about.
<br />
<br />What I love about the book is its dedication to simplicity: I looked all over the place for a book that outlined basic database concepts in an easy to understand manner, and found book after book that promised to be 0-60, and spent about, oh, 2 pages on the 0-10.  Where's the core basics, guys?  Answer: in this book.  It'll getcha up to 10 MPH, and then you can move on to bigger and better stuff.
<br />
<br />After reading this book (and I had it bookmarked twelve ways come Sunday for about two months), I am finally ready to consider those more advanced books.  I'm not a dummy, but sometimes a simple book is needed to bridge the gap between being a novice and being experienced.  This was the book for me, and I highly recommend it to anybody who needs more than 2 pages of core database theory explanation.  It's also easy to read and very user-friendly, by the way.  </span>

                    <span>This may be a good book, but after 50 pages and finding that I need Microsoft Access, as well as Visio to follow along, and then my Visio version doesn't have the required template...it is just a very frustrating book to get anywhere with. I'll keep trying, but this book just isn't for the beginner...sorry.</span>

                    <span>The book does contain SOME good information. That is as far as I will go. Every review failed to mention that the diagrams require a magnifying glass to read. I would assume that every reviewer had 20/20 vision but I know my wife does and she needed a magnifying glass to read the diagrams as well. It is littered with errors. One such is on page 63 "Did you notice relationship 5 is marked with an asterisk". I would like to know where the asterisk is, magnifying glass or not on any page. The book and reviews fail to spell out you better have Visio 2000 and Access 2000 to follow along. That aside from everything else the book never states that Visio 2000 and Access 2000 are what are used, it is assumed. You know what they say about assume. For a begginers book and the lack of editing I give it a "D". For general information about databases I give it a "C". I would say better luck next time but I would not drop another dime on a book written by this author. I hope he makes a better Attorney than an author.</span>

                    <span>I had no experience with databases before I read this book. I didn't even understand the basic concepts. This book includes basic definitions, detailed database design, SQL statements, how to use Microsoft Access (creating tables, relationships, queries, forms and reports). If you have little or no experience with databases, you will definitely take advantage of this book. It's very easy to read.</span>

                    <span>Now here is a book that really DOES live up to its title!  Even for those of us who have built databases before, it contains surprises and would hold a worthy place on your shelf for review purposes if nothing else.  As another review said, the additional info on the use of Visio is a nice touch.  I personally had a few problems using it, but I was using Visio 2002 and Access 2002, and not version 2000, as the book used.  This could have been the source of my problems, (that or an inability for me to follow instructions!)  Either way though, the book really does have good, usable information under its covers, and is a worthy read for neophytes as well as the more experienced database mechanics and architects.</span>
