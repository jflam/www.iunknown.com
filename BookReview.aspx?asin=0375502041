                    <span>If there ever was doubt as to the negative effect of too powerful authors and "underweening" editors, this book resolves that once and for all.  You might think that a book that consumes over 500 pages of text to cover the development of the Spanish Empire in the New World from Columbus to Magellan, a period of less than 30 years (1492 to 1521), would contain a wealth of information on the European setting, Spanish and Portuguese precedents, the nature and role of Spain's Mediterranean interests and the reasons for and effects of Charles V' Hapsburg connections.  
<br />
<br />You might think that, but unfortunately, in this case, you would be wrong.  Mr. Thomas clearly enjoys his material.  We are treated to detailed, even overwhelming, information on the personalities, personal histories, family background and actions of virtually everyone involved at virtually every level in the exploration and exploitation of the "Indies" during the period.  The only exception is the conquest of Mexico under Cortes, which Mr. Thomas has covered in another work.  When the author comments that Cortes' memoirs of the conquest are the only memoirs out of over 300 surviving accounts that are worth reading, he is entirely to be believed.  
<br />
<br />On the other hand, it is not readily apparent that Mr. Thomas' deep erudition has a point or purpose.  500 pages of this kind of detail without significant context does not appear tailored to the average reader, yet the pictures and maps seem to indicate a wider target audience than the specialist or expert.  For example, does even the specialist really need to know the full name and family origin of each banker that loaned money to fund not just Columbus' voyages, but every voyage undertaken in the Caribbean?  And what kind of audience would need or want an appendix listing the bribes spent on each Elector to secure Charles' election as Holy Roman Emperor, but which yields no information on how much of the total was funded by New World gold?  As other reviewers have commented, where was the editor?
<br />
<br />For a much better discussion of Spain' Empire in the New World, that does address the wider European setting, Spanish and Portuguese precedents, Spain's Mediterranean interests and the Habsburg connections, the Cambridge Modern History chapters on Spain and the New World, though dated and sometimes hard to find, are still a much better choice for even the average reader.

                    <span>I held great hopes for this book.  I'd long been looking for a well written history of the Spanish conquest of the New World, and was sucked in by the review in the New York Times.  Well, this book isn't what I was seeking.  In this tome Thomas is riding on his reputation; or better stated perhaps, his reputation seems to have intimidated good editing.  The cast of characters is overwhelming, even bewildering; and Thomas' arcane writing style only makes matters worse.  There must be something better somewhere.  </span>

                    <span>Rivers of Gold is thoroughly researched and documented, but at times the author loses sight of the forest for the trees.  Several chapters are written in an engaging style, particularly those focusing on Columbus' arrival in the New World and the sections on Mesoamerican cultures.  However (as is pointed out in other reviews), the author seems to dwell on accounting for everyone who had even the most minor role in the exploration of the Americas.  It takes a while to navigate all these names, many of which merit one mention with no connection to later events or consequences.  That said, Rivers of Gold is a useful text for serious students of this key historical period.</span>

                    <span>The NY Times review (by the estimable Paul Kennedy) was such a rave that I rushed out and plunked down 35 large for this tome, having so loved Thomas's _The Conquest Of Mexico_.  What I got was an occasionally interesting but mostly dull meander through useless minutiae of the early Spanish conquest (all those names!) without a sense of drama, of a story being told or even a point of view.  Especially disappointing are Thomas's characterizations of the conquistadors.  These courageous and villainous ruffians are among the most interesting figures in history and yet here they come off as inept one dimensional politicos.  The final chapter, where one expects an author to pull everything together, is an off-topic historical portrait of Seville.  It left me asking, what?  This book would have been better at half the length.  </span>

                    <span>Problems With The Book:
<br />1) Way too much detail about minor characters, places, and customs which lead nowhere; where was the editor on this project?
<br />2) Minor errors. For example on page 283 compare the text and map illustrating where Ponce de Leon first made landfall in Florida (hint: it wasn't near modern day Palm Beach). Also, on page 529, hurricanes being included among the disasters afflicting Seville; this has never happened.
<br />3) Most egregiously, an incredibly hazy story line told dully with almost zero context.
<br />I came away frustrated and extremely disappointed. I can't understand the rave reviews; this is a vastly overrated book.</span>
