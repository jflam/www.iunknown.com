                <span id="Label1">Tom Berenger leads an outstanding cast in this bone-crunching dramatization of legendary college football coach Paul "Bear" Bryant's debut at Texas A&M in the summer of 1954. The often unnerving story finds Bryant ducking the school's good ol' boy network of rich, influential alumni by spiriting his new team away to a makeshift training base in a tiny town called Junction. There, Bryant runs the equivalent of a POW camp, brutalizing an oversized, underdeveloped bunch of rowdy young men and tormenting those who seek medical attention for cracked spines and deadly heat exhaustion. Berenger delivers a warts-and-all performance as the vulgar, monstrous, yet much-respected Bryant, and the direction by seasoned television vet Mike Robe (<I>Son of the Morning Star</I>) is brisk and almost explosively charged. Whatever one thinks of Bryant's punishing methods, the film does not flinch from telling its powerful tale. <I>--Tom Keogh</I></span>

                    <span>I LOVED THIS MOVIE!<P>I have been a fan of Bear Bryant ever since I can remember. He was without a doubt one of the toughest college coaches in the history of football. The Junction Boys is about Coach Bryants tenure at Texas A&M. Sure some critics say that this movie focused more on the brutal treatment of player rather than football, but thats is what set coach Bryant apart from other coachs. His practices were brutal, maybe to the point of torture. But maybe his long hard practices are part of what made him one of the winningest coaches in college football history! If your going to cry about this not being a football film, go watch Remember The Titans instead. But if you want a true insite on the icon that is Paul Bear Bryant, and what he was like as a man, this movie is a must have! Roll Tide!</span>

                    <span>Thanks a bunch, filmmakers: You've taken a terrific book, brimming with potential for cinematic presentation, and turned it into a stale old formula rendering of a boot-camp movie. You might as well have hired R. Lee Ermey to be the coach, or perhaps Frank Sutton as Sgt. Carter.<P>This story should have been told as it was in the book, beginning with the spirit of a college unlike any other in the world, a devotion to a campus with a theme which exists nowhere else: The vision of Texas A&M was the foundation of this tale.<P>Paul "Bear" Bryant, focused only on football, thought he was taking a mere little coaching job at a small school as just a step on the ladder of his career. Upon arrival, though, he found himself part of a richly woven society, the Fighting Texas Aggies. The place exuded spirit, and Bryant was astounded by the student and community enthusiasm. A complete stranger, he was welcomed to the team, to the family. The magnificent Aggie Band drummed him into the fold, and he realized he had arrived in a marvelously unique setting. Accordingly, Bryant set about to do his job and build a football team.<P>The film explored none of this -- it simply launched right into boot-camp maltreatment that bordered on criminal, with Sgt. Barnes from Platoon calling the cadence. We saw nothing of the spirit behind the endeavor, the reason for all that work, the motivation to bring honor to the Maroon and White. We just got another bland boot-camp flick, a smattering of awkward jokes, and very little of the complete story.<P>I wish I could win the state lottery -- I would use the funds to finance a remake of this film and I would do it correctly the second time. Read the book, it's a great book, but don't waste your time watching this insipid version of the tale. It was nothing but the waste of a terrific opportunity to tell a great story.</span>
