She teams up with Robin Roberts, a great college player and successful sportscaster for ABC and ESPN, to share her insights and help women use physical drills, mental techniques and plain old basketball strategy to hone their skills to the sharpest.</span>

                    <span>A really good book for a select audience. For younger players or those not motivated enough to focus their energy and effort at this level, I highly recommend the two companion VHS tapes on offense and defense/rebounding. However, if you are a middle or high-school player who really wants to raise your game, you can't go wrong here.</span>

                    <span>I have been coaching girls basketball for the last several<br>years and am often looking for suitable books to give my<br>players to help them work on their own to further develop<br>their skills.  This is the best book I have seen for a junior<br>high or high school player.  I covers every aspect of the game,<br>not just skills, but also physical training.</span>

                    <span>When I started coaching girls basketball (3rd-9th graders) 3 years ago this was the second book I picked up.  Now I have about 35 books and 20 videos but I use this as the central reference for my playbook and training  manual in coaching fundamentals.  Some of the skills may be too advanced  for younger kids but they will grow up and adapt to it when they return to  you a little older and better skilled thanks to this reference.  It should  be used in conjunction with the videos by the author (available also from  Amazon).  If Nancy Lieberman-Cline ever sponsors a clinic I will be on the  first plane to get there.  As a player-coach-teacher she is the best for  girls basketball!</span>

                    <span>Being a girls basketball coach, this book is a very beneficial tool for helping young women understand the game more completely. The variety of drills make it easy to design an off season workout schedule. This book is  a must buy for anyone serious about the game, whether coach, player, or a  serious fan!</span>
