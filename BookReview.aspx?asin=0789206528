                <span id="Label1">Few parents can resist the urge to photograph every adorable stage of their children's lives, but most do it more lovingly than well. No matter how doting they are, too often the results are blurry, overexposed, and uninspired snapshots. Guide to Photographing Children offers practical, detailed unintimidating advice to help transform parents' enthusiasm into memorable photographs that capture the child's own distinctive spirit (and involve the child in the process). After gently guiding the amateur photographer through such technical basics as which camera, film and exposure to use, the authors offer specific suggestions for shooting indoors and out, as well as invaluable advice on working with children at each age (useful words of wisdom: respect the child's moods and don't always demand a smile).  <P>The book concludes with handy information about how to get the best work out of the photofinisher, even if it's just the local one-hour mini-lab, plus ideas for scrapbooks and other projects geared to putting the photos to good use. Throughout, sidebars offer additional help on everything from film speeds to "smile getters," and the 200 photographs provide clear examples of what --and what not-- to do when photographing children of every age and temperament.  <P>Includes over 200 photographs.</span>

                    <span>As an amateur/hobbyist photographer for 20+ years as well as an avid reader I have read a lot of books on the subject, but none as fun to read as this. It contains lots of practical advice about composition and lighting as well as basics about film and equipment selection. The authors also tell how they got a particular shot, and give very clear examples and advice about technique. I recommended this book to several friends and relatives who wanted a basic book about photography, and, although the focus is on children's photography, this advice is translatable to other areas as well.<BR> I was very impressed by the conversational tone and humorous approach which is often evident. What was great was that they encourage a lot of experimentation and they are not camera snobs - they actually acknowledge that such things as point & shoot & single use cameras are in use and tell you how to get the best of them, without making you feel like you're somewhat inferior if you're not using an SLR or medium format.<BR>All in all, I highly recommend this book. Did I mention that the photos are great and the feeling is that they are actually attainable by the average amateur photographer?</span>

                    <span>I think this book was wonderful. It stated the basics to get you going then added more detail when needed. The camera jargon was not overwhelming in any way, and the lighting suggestions were great. I read through the whole book then went back and highlighted the most needed parts. I would recommend this book to any parent wanting to take more memorable pictures of their children. Deserves 5 stars without a doubt.</span>

                    <span>If you are interested in taking beautiful and meaningful photos of your little angel, you should definitely order this book. I have also bought a few other books of the same nature but this book is by far the best one. It has excellent photographs and many useful tips for amateur photographers like myself in improving our skills. The layout is well thought out and the content is also well researched. This book is highly recommended. Well Done.</span>

                    <span>After Rick Staudt took portraits of our 4-month old son, I fell in love with his work and was excited for his new book, co-authored with Lisa Jane. I was not disappointed -- the book is fantastic. It is very easy to follow and understand even though I have no photography experience, yet it isn't condescending at all. While I look forward to having our son's annual portraits done by Rick in the future, I am also looking forward to using some of his simple advice for better pictures year round. Enjoy!</span>
