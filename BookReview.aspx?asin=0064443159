                    <span>The book Biscuit Wants to Play is about a puppy named Biscuit and two kittens.  Biscuit wants to play with them, but they won't play with him.  The kittens always want to play with something else.  They run around and get stuck on a tree. Biscuit barks and barks until the girls come out and rescue the kittens from the tree 
<br />
<br />The author's purpose is to entertain the reader.  When I was reading the book I was entertained by what the kittens and Biscuit did.  Some parts in the story were funny.  Another purpose is that the author taught me
<br />that friend's are important.  The author really entertained me I think the story was very cool and entertaining. 
<br />
<br />I think this author is a good author.  I would recommend this story to my friend.  I would read more stories from this author Alyssa Satin Capuclli.

                    <span>Biscuit meets a pair of kittens and decides he wants to play with them.  But try as he might, the kittens pay no attention to him as they play and explore on their own.<p>But this changes when the kittens follow a butterfly up a tree and can not get down.  Biscuit barks and gets the attention of The Girl In The Purple Sneakers and The Girl With Puddles and the little cats are rescued.  We then see them playing with their helpful new friend Biscuit.<p>Another fine story.  This one shows that while you may not always get your own way, things usually work out in the end.  Filled with more adorable illustrations.</span>
