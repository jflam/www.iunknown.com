                    <span>Luther's Ninety-Five Theses were written in direct response to the practice of selling indulgences in the 1500s. This book begins with an introduction explaining the circumstances under which Luther posted his theses. It does a good job of quickly explaining the main points one needs to know before reading the theses. There are sporadic footnotes in the text to clarify some points. I have a protestant background and found Luther's topics to be techincally Catholic. However, I did not feel lost in my reading. It would be of a great advantange to have some knowledge of the Catholicism of the time. The theses mark the start of the Reformation, and a read-through would be beneficial for any student of history or Protestantism. The book itself is very short (18 pages). Luther's Ninety-Five Theses are readily found from any internet search, and this may be a much more cost-effective option. The introduction may be the only benefit of actually buying this edition.</span>

                    <span>Luther's 95 Theses is without question a very important historical document.  However, I don't think most of us would buy, say the Gettysburg Address, as a stand-alone book.  First, you can never find it on the shelf.  Second, you can get it as part of many almanacs, encyclopedias, etc.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">GREAT and important work, but this volume is too pricey</div>

                    <span>First off, let me say that I rate the 95 Theses 5 Stars all the way...the rating above is not about Luther's work, but this volume, which is only 18 pages but costs 4 dollars.  That's a little steep.   As for the 95 Theses  themselves, let me say, "Smashing!"  I wish I had been there for  the discussion that followed.  However, I think it best to have grown up  with the benefit of the teaching of justification by faith alone being as  common as it is today.  <p>The topic of the theses is the selling of  indulgences - they do not really get into justification by faith alone.   This was a surprise to me.  Luther brings into question both the selling of  indulgences and the manner in which they were sold.  While reflecting on  the book, words like "excellent" and "fascinating" come  to mind.  Definitely not to be missed.<p>Still, the price for this itty  bitty "book" is too steep; I would recommend getting another  volume of Luther that contained this piece, or simply looking the 95 Theses  up on the internet.</span>

                    <span>This is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of the reformation.  Luther really hits the nail on the head as to what needed to be discussed in the Catholic church at the time.</span>
