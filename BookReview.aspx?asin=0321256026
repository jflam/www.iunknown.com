                    <span>If you're looking to learn Flash then this book is NOT for you. 
<br />
<br />As the book description says "this STUDY GUIDE offers comprehensive coverage of the features of Flash" - and this is exactly what it delivers.
<br />
<br />Does it give you the answers to the exam questions - of course not. And if you think that by reading this book and doing the online quiz's you'll pick up some of the actual answers in the exam then you're only kidding yourself.
<br />
<br />Sure there are a few typo's but they hardly detract from the main point of the book i.e. to ensure that as a Flash developer you have all the "broad" bases covered in preparation for the certification exam. 
<br />
<br />As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned. This book does have both AS1.0 and AS2.0 examples which makes sense as AS2.0 was introduced with Flash MX 2004. I actually found this helpful in making comparisons between the two languages.
<br />
<br />I took (and passed) the exam and whilst I have been using Flash for a few years, I certainly didn't buy this book expecting to learn anything new. If I wanted to learn something new I would have bought one of the other great Flash reference books out there. I bought this book to make sure that I had "some" degree of knowledge about what "might" be in the exam and have all my bases covered. It did exactly that !
<br />
<br />Great light-weight refresher for some of my weaker points - 5 stars!</span>

                    <span>The book is full of typo's and will not help you pass the test. Even if you memorize the book. And getting numerous 100% on Ben Forta's website - Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Certified Developer Study Guide "TEST" will only give you a false sense of confidence. Ben Forta's tests are direct questions out of the Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Certified Developer Study Guide. The book has lots of Flash A.S. 1.0, like proto and the old school object/class stuff which has very little to with the REAL ceritifaction test. Dont waste your $ buying this book, just start learning how to write A.S. classes and spend a few years working with Flash. I've heard that the 1st group of people to pass the certification test took a different test then the test's that are out now. I've heard that the 1st group to take  the test got to see the "incorrect answers" if they failed. You will not get to see the actual test questions that you missed weather you pass or fail. I have yet to find anything helpful in passing the test except years of Flash work. Some of the online practiced test that are provided by 3rd parties will get your brain working but will not be of much help. I failed the test by a couple of points and was so discussed at the content in the book , not at it's inaccuracy but lack of any helpful content to pass the test. I'm able to recite 90% of the books content and answer all the books questions acurately but that wont help me pass the test, its a waste of time and money. </span>

                    <span>Due to the author participating in the writing of the Flash developer exam questions he is the obvious candidate to write this book, and as such I think does a good job.
<br />
<br />Having taken (and passed) the exam (after reading the book) I found that the majority of the questions I encountered in the exam were covered in broad (not specific) detail in the book.
<br />
<br />The main thing I found difficult to study for was ActionScript 2.0 and this book doesn't cover it in huge detail (although the updated terminology is used eg: Class Vs Prototype Object). I did note that a few of the other reviewers found the lack of ActionScript 2.0 a problem. I think the main reason for this is probably because the author had to cater for both the ActionScript 1.0 and ActionScript 2.0 camps and couldn't be seen to ignore one or the other. This is obvious by the way he swaps between the two during some of the chapters (which can be slightly confusing for an ActionScript 2.0 newbie like me). 
<br />
<br />Bottom line though, this book is not a reference or learning book (like Colin Moocks ActionScript 2.0) its a Study Guide for the Flash Developer exam and as such I think it works well.

                    <span>Executive Summary:
<br />Overall the book helped me prepare for the exam, and I'm glad I had it for that purpose.
<br />It is good for giving a broad overview of exam topics, but read it with caution and be prepared to research the content if it doesn't seem to make sense -- otherwise the occasional unclear writing and bugs in example code listings will give you grief.
<br />
<br />Positive:
<br />Since the author was one of the subject-matter experts for the test, he presumably knows the range of topics which will be covered on the exam.  This book gives a good idea of what those topics will be, and provides a good introduction/overview to most of them.
<br />Some other reviewers have mentioned that the practice questions don't match well with the actual exam questions.  This was one of my biggest concerns going into the exam.  I personally found that the practice questions match very well with the real exam questions, specifically in terms of how question style and difficulty.  What doesn't match is that there are too few practice questions (even including the extra ones on the book's web site) to adequately cover the breadth of each chapter.  So there are many areas that don't have any practice questions, but which are still tested on the exam.
<br />
<br />Negative:
<br />This book is in great need of editing for technical details and, in a few cases, clarity of writing.  Here are my gripes:
<br />- The book was apparently just adapted from the previous (Flash MX) edition of the book.  There are numerous references to Flash MX which should have said Flash MX 2004.  (There are also some legitimate references to Flash MX.)  Most of these are benign, but it still makes me question the quality of the book.  I found at least one case where the information was correct for Flash MX but is wrong with MX 2004.
<br />- There have been a handful of places where the writing was unclear and gave a strong impression that the author was just skimming over the content and had difficulty explaining it clearly.  In two such cases, I thought the writing was really confusing so I looked up the topic in the Flash help, only to find that (in both cases) the confusing text is word-for-word out of the Flash help!
<br />- The book is plagued with bugs in the example code (most commonly changing variable names mid-way through the example).
<br />- There are several examples of the (somewhat deprecated) ActionScript 1.0 Object-Oriented Programming. Some of these appear in early chapters which are talking about much simpler topics, which would have been very confusing had I not already read a book on OOP in AS1.  I don't remember seeing anything using the AS1 style OOP on the actual exam.
<br />- The code and content in the chapters on how to write ActionScript 2.0 classes are all very wrong and will not compile (and give misinformation and don't give important details).  I honestly don't think that they tested the code on even an early Beta of Flash MX 2004 or they presumably would have found these things out.  Admittedly this is a particular sore point for me, since I am a big fan of the new AS2 OOP model; it didn't seem to make a difference from what I saw on the exam.  Don't expect to learn any valid AS2 from this book.  (See Colin Moock's Essential ActionScript 2.0 for stellar coverage of that topic).
<br />
<br />Note: I originally wrote this review before taking the exam.  After taking the exam, I came back and made some changes based on how I think it really compares to the exam.  So if you read it before, that is why it may look different now!</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a very good resource for preparation of the exam. It provides a broad range of topics, and although it doesn't go heavily deep into each topic, it gives you an idea of what will be on the exam. 
<br />
<br />I think anyone who decides to take the exam must not only rely on this book but other resource as well. I found Moock's Essential Actionscript 2.0 and the flash documentation to be pretty helpful as well. 
<br />
<br />My score on the exam was a 78%, and although I expected it to be higher, it just goes to show the difficulty of the exam. But all in all, I was pleased with this book.
