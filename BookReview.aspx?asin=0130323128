                    <span>Yukl uses his expertise and credibility to write an outstanding book focusing on managerial leadership rather than social or parliamentary leadership. He attempts to include information on both the theory and practice of leadership in modern organizations. This valuable text also includes many recommendations and guidelines for improving the effectiveness of managers and leaders. The book includes a number of cases in an attempt to help the reader understand real world organizational problems and applications. This is a book that is primarily written and mostly reads like a college text book and is indeed used by a number of universities in their managerial or leadership programs. However, it is easy to read and does an excellent job of including the most informative and relative literature, studies and theories available today. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the study of organizational leadership, leading teams, leading change or studying follower-based approaches toward leadership.</span>

                    <span>Not worth curling up to a fire with? ...<p>For me, after a year or more I still read some portion or another of this book nearly every week for the rich survey of ideas and theories it provides, often finding something that fits what I'm concerned about, and then springboarding into buying another book or digging out original research articles and papers to dig deeper.<p>If you want to be widely informed about the full continuum of theory and research in leadership and organizations, this book will become a familiar resource, and a top choice for curling up to a fire one evening when alone and just paging through and finding something new or old you just have to read and think about some more.<p>Okay, perhaps Marc is more of a fun guy than me, but everything about leadership, and this book is full and pressed down overflowing with the material, interests me deeply.</span>

                    <span>Yukl's text on leadership brings together the vast amount of research that's been done on the subject. His volume is and readable--although not the type of book you'd want to curl up by the fire with. <p>I really appreciate that Yukl always finds something good about to say about any theory he's critiquing!</span>

                    <span>Gary Yukl hits dead center of the leadership target.  His work begins with the issue of defining leadership and tackling the difference between management and leadership.   Laced throughout with extensive reference and  research material the book clearly moves from definition of leadership  through different levels of leadership to top strategic leadership  practices.  His lessons and practices are both valuable and  usable.<p>Readers will be treated to detailed, relevant discussions of the  each leadership issue discussed within the book.  Within each issue, Mr.  Yukl, glides through the basis of the theories and then details realities  of how to achieve the results suggested by those theories.  Within several  topics, he provides cases studies and questions about those case studies  for the reader's consideration.  The result is a practical, working manual  about leadership. <p>Between the discussions of the leadership issues and  the practices there is something here for all readers.  More importantly,  there is plenty or information within the covers of this book that truly  matters.  Anyone with a leadership role of any type should read this book.</span>
