                    <span>We used this and while, yes, last year's hurricane did make some of the information less relevant, this was still the most up-to-date guide in our party. I particularly enjoyed the cultural focus, which is really why I travel, anyway.<P>The book is colorful, contains lots of interesting details, and was actually easier to read than some of the others we had. I had no trouble with the hotel listings.</span>

                    <span>For those people planning on traveling to the southern parts of Belize, be forewarned that the Lonely Planet guidebook has not been updated since the hurricane destroyed much of Placencia a year and a half ago. <P>We stayed in Placencia for a week using the Lonely Planet guide, and some of the restaurants and accommidations listed no longer exist. The places that do still exist have been totally rebuilt since the reviews were written. <P>Finally, the activities listings were generally accurate but the reccommended guides no longer offered the services described in the book. We went out of our way to find the reccommended guide only to discover he no longer gave tours!</span>

                    <span>I booked and prepaid Ruby's in Ambergris Quay on their recommendation, and found it to be an absolute dump, full of cockroaches, grimy throughout. There were many better choices for the same price which were not in the book. But a hotel they criticised, La Casa de Don David near Tikal, we found to be spotless, reasonably priced, good food and very convenient for visiting the ruins. This definitely brings into question the integrity of their hotel ratings and the independence of their recommendations.</span>

                    <span>The information on crossing the border into Guatemala was sparse, but the book provided most of the information I needed to get around. It was clear about how to get from Belize City to just about anywhere else in Belize. This book did forget to mention about 1/2 a dozen cool spots to stay in San Ignacio, and left out a couple local restaurants in the area that are far superior to Sol, but other than that I found the book to be very helpful... besides, if it listed everything, everything would be overrun by us tourists!!<P>I spent most of my time in and around the Mayan ruins, so I didn't need the Cayes' chapters much... the background information the book provides on the Mayan ruins at Xunantunich, Caracol, Cahal Pech and others was good enough to get me started... the rest I found once at the sites from the tourist booths... I also appreciated the fact that the last chapter of this book gives info on Tikal in Guatemala... The ride from the border into Guatemala and on to Tikal was just as the book described... dusty and bumpy and lonely! It does warn of the dangers in and around the Tikal area, but I found these spots to be safe and friendly. Overall, a good guide book with lot's of maps!</span>
