                    <span>This was a great book to read for all baseball fans to get a look behind the scenes into the business aspect of each and every game.  The level of detail in this book was remarkable, really accentuating Fred Claire's passion for baseball.  He writes very honestly, conveying emotions beyond the words on the page. He describes his experience with the Dodger's team but moreso in detail of every singly person who makes it work on a daily basis, who sweat and cry and laugh for the "family members" in this family culture that they've developed.  Claire is not only talking about the last 30 years of his professional experiences but of the last 30 years of his life in general, ending with life beyond the Dodgers. Even to someone as clueless about the world of baseball, I was emotionally captivated by this book and the pages just flew by.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in baseball,  his objective story-telling makes it very easy to read.  </span>

                    <span>Fred's book offers an excellent first-hand account into the world of a baseball GM.  His stories and experiences help to shed some light on what it takes to become a successful sport executive.  I don't think there is any better way to learn how to become successful in this business than through someonee who did it himself.  This book is excellent for sport management classes as it shows students what skills are necessary in different situations.  A MUST READ, I will put this book in my baseball library as one of the most useful books on the business of baseball.  </span>

                    <span>If you are a Dodger fan, this book is definitely the book to read! It will give you many insight stories of Dodger's history. I personally have been inspiried by Fred's great dedication to sports. Also, it is a interesting book for those of you who want to be part of the baseball organization. His experience is absoultely helpful! </span>

                    <span>Althought I must admit that I am not really a baseball fan, this book really caught my attention- as I was unaware of the corporate politics floating around the Dodger Stadium.  With the first and last chapters discussing his last night in the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, Fred Claire really gives you a peak inside his management career- though not in an obtrusive way.  Although one may assume his bitterness or resentment in his firing, Claire never lets that get through in the story, really allowing the reader to get the full picture.  His objective writing style and love of baseball really come through in this read.</span>

                    <span>I am an avid baseball fan and have read many related books including the best-selling "Moneyball" and even the infamous "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big". But Fred Claire's "My 30 Years in Dodger Blue" is defintitely one of the best ones I've read. It may even rival "Moneyball". In the book, Claire gives his honest opinion and story of the Dodgers and its personnel and owner. Although many blame him for the trades of Pedro Martinez and Mike Piazza, one must not forget that he built a championship team in 1988.</span>
