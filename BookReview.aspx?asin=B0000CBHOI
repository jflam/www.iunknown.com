                <span id="Label1">It may have been underrated when first broadcast on PBS on consecutive nights in the fall of '03, but executive producer Martin Scorsese's homage to the blues is a truly significant, if imperfect, achievement. "Musical journey" is an apt description, as Scorsese and the six other directors responsible for these seven approximately 90-minute films follow the blues--the foundation of jazz, soul, R&B, and rock & roll--from its African roots to its Mississippi Delta origins, up the river to Memphis and Chicago, then to New York, the United Kingdom, and beyond. Some of the films (like Wim Wenders's <I>The Soul of a Man</I> and Charles Burnett's <I>Warming by the Devil's Fire</I>) use extensive fictional film sequences, generally to good effect. There's also plenty of documentary footage, interviews, and contemporary studio performances recorded especially for these films. <p>  The last are among the best aspects of the DVDs, as the bonus material features the set's only complete tunes. Lou Reed's "See That My Grave Is Kept Clean" and the ElektriK Mud Kats' (with Chuck D. of Public Enemy) hip-hop-cum-traditional updating of Muddy Waters's "Mannish Boy" are among the best of them; on the other hand, a rendition of "Cry Me a River" by Lulu (?!) is a curious choice, even with Jeff Beck on hand. The absence of lengthier vintage clips, meanwhile, is the principal drawback. For that reason alone, Clint Eastwood's <I>Piano Blues</I> is the best of the lot; a musician himself, Eastwood simply lets the players play, which means we get extensive file footage of the likes of Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, and Nat "King" Cole, as well as new performances by Ray Charles, Dr. John, and others. Overall, this is a set to savor, a worthwhile investment guaranteed to grow on you over the course of repeated viewings. <I>--Sam Graham</I></span>

                    <span>I`am a big blues fan!! I have been since i was 8 yrs old. I was very excited when i first heard there was going to be a seris on the blues. However, I was very dissopointed in it. Martin was all over the place in the first show. He was talking about Africa Music and then started talking about delta music. He did not go in order of how blues was orginated. If they ever do a blues seris again they need Ken Burns to do it.</span>

                    <span>Seven discs were not enough.  Martin Scorsese did a magnificent job.  Having been a big blues fan for many years, studied music and also played music for many years, I wish this information had been available to me when I was growing up.  Some of them I knew by name and music but not the face.  It was great to be able to put a name to the faces.  My girlfriend was amazed to hear music that she thought was original music by other artists, ie Rock N Roll types.  Also, a lot of people were not aware of Clint Eastwoods involvement with the blues and his talents as well.
<br />  The only down side was the fifth disc, the Marc Levin film.  I admit, I am by no means a fan of hip-hop.  It's not, in my opinion, music.  They have no talent of their own so they use other people's music.  And it was a shame that Chuck D and his cronies, Common and Kyle Jason couldn't manage to get throuh the movie without the over excessive use of the "F" word.  It truly showed how ignorant they are that they couldn't carry on an intelegent conversation without it.  The only disc out of 7, very sad.  It was also obvious that he didn't have a clue of what he was talking about most of the time.  It truly detracted from the movie to the point that you just couldn't ignore it, but when your music has that garbage in the lyrics, I guess you have to talk that way too.  You didn't hear the old guys using it, except for Chess, who would have been very impressive otherwise.  Otherwise, the "blues" information given was very interesting and informative.  Some really good footage, Koko, Wolf, and some good blues music.  I just hope that the blues and hip-hop mix doesn't catch on.
<br />  I am sure that there must be much more that found it's way to the cutting room floor that could be compliated into another set.  There are so many other blues artists that should have been mentioned, there must be another one in the works.</span>

                    <span>Conceived and produced by Martin Scorsese this Seven DVD set should be taken as a modern oral history told by seven different voices - each a director in his own right and each coming to a specific form, expression or development of the blues. The story often seems too catholic in its choice of 'Blusemen' but that is subjective for my personal taste but neither Scorsese or the other directors, which include Clint Eastwood and Wim Wenders, attempt to present a complete history but different entrances into a world which traces American history - reminding us that it is a history of contrasts - The American Dream Vs The Escalation of American Imperialism and its accompanying enslavement of Afro/ Americans. But more than that this series is a primer for anyone who wants to trace the history of popular music, its subversiveness, immediacy and power. This is not a series for anyone with an attention span of three minutes nor for anyone who wants to avoid paying attention to personal reflections, telling detail or anecdotal evidence. It is a good place to start for anyone who can take time out and bring sufficient commitment to a a culture and an art form which has shaped more of our present day consciousness than many of us are aware of. Now what we be really interesting would be for a black historian and film director to make an even more personal and in-depth study of The Blues. Its hard to think who might meet that criteria - which shows that there are still many reasons to get The Blues, Save the blues and learn from The Blues.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big blues fan but was very disappointed with this series.
<br /> 
<br /> The problem, to me, is the concept: have movie directors make films about the blues. This leads to trying to come up with some "plot" to carry each installment. 
<br /> 
<br /> In striving to come up with a storyline, most of the directors came up with the same one: a contemporary musician (blues guitarist Corey Harris, rapper Chuck D) travels someplace to find his musical roots in some form of the blues (Delta blues, Chicago blues).
<br /> 
<br /> This repetitive storyline leaves no room for the history of the blues.
<br /> 
<br /> Another problem is that not only are the storylines repeated, but so are many of the film clips and songs.
<br /> 
<br /> I do have to single out the episode Clint Eastwood directed about piano players. It was excellent, and the concept (have piano player Eastwood interview and play with legendary pianists) sets it apart from the other episodes.
<br /> 
<br /> My advice: buy the CDs from the series and skip the video.
