                <span id="Label1">In this third installment in the popular <I>Fish!</I> series, the authors examine change as a necessary, ongoing process that should never stop--at least not if one wants to keep the workplace vital and fully alive. Using a fictitious sushi restaurant as an example, this fable examines the three principles that Lundin, Christensen, and Paul believe are necessary for continuing success: Find It ("it" being each employee's personal vision of the business), Live It, and Coach It. Readers of the authors' previous books--<I>Fish! A Remarkable Way to Boost Morale and Improve Results</I> and <I>Fish! Tales</I>--should find its familiarity comforting. For those new to the series, this standalone volume is easy to read and highly valuable. <I>--David Bombeck</I></span>

                    <span>As a manager in a government agency, I utilized the first Fish! book with our team as a part of our Manager's meeting last year this time. It was widely regarded as the best meeting we've ever had. Everyone loved it. Everything that the first book indicated would happen did. It was really pretty awesome. We are now widely regarded as the the best shops in the state, largely because of the practices we put in place with the first book.
<br />
<br />We are in the planning stages of this year's manager meeting, and I was looking for a topic for the meeting. Fish! Sticks fits the bill perfectly. Ironically, we were at a point where we were just going to cob some boring presentation together because we had reached exactely the point that this book talks about where we have sorta gotten back to our own ways, prior to the change. 
<br />
<br />This one evening read was just what the Dr. ordered! I strongly recommend the entire set for folks in managerial positions.</span>

                    <span>The well known FISH! philosophy can be applied to the health care setting. In this series, the 6th floor of a local hospital is transformed by the FISH! philosophy started by a nurse manager. After she leaves, the health care administrators are concerned that the FISH! philosophy was just a gimick. They plan to ensure a lasting change. This is achieved by helping employees make an internal change of heart rather than only an external or pep rally type of change. The application to health care is very timely and may be very helpful to nurse managers and nursing staff, especially those who work on units with low morale.</span>

                    <span>Chirpy ideas, bad writing.  I feel sorry for the poor saps who get stuck being slaves under this motivational trash.  In your job, to "make their day" is best made by giving them a paycheck, or better yet a raise.  That's why people work.  You have to "be there" otherwise you get fired.  As for "play"?  Heh.  Who feels like "playing" when they feel like they're going to puke when they are force-fed this garbage at the office?
<br />
<br />Choose your attitude...yeah.  Most people who work go because they have to.  Their boss chooses their attitude.  "Smile no matter how you feel or your butt hits the sidewalk."
<br />
<br />Fish are among the dumbest creatures alive today...near the very bottom of the evolutionary scale and have nothing for brains...hmm...I guess a fish wrote this book.</span>

                    <span>You're back in the fishing boat with the crew that brought you the successful Fish! and Fish! Tales. Offering another finny fable, Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen and Harry Paul present a business parable based on creating and sustaining successful change. The book uses the same fictitious approach as the other two Fish!ing trips, but this time the story is set at a hospital's nursing station. The agent-of-change head nurse has departed and the new head nurse feels that the group is losing its vision. Then, she discovers that a local sushi restaurant is a model of excellence, and all goes swimmingly after that. Although the advice offered isn't particularly unique, some may find a certain charm in the story. Given that this is round three, the format may seem a little repetitive to those who have already Fish!ed. If you want to catch the core of the message on your first cast, look for the highlights on the occasional pages in whale-size type. We recommend the basic common sense of these messages, even if the storytelling is a little fishy.</span>
