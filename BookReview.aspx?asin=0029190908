                    <span>Though it was first released in 1983, I still do not believe there is a better book on marketing that The Marketing Imagination. It's not a "marketing fad of the week" kind of book, but rather a practically worded treatise on basic concepts that are more often than not overlooked or ignored by those who chase fads and wonder why they're not more successful. Chapter 4, "Differentiation---of Anything" should be tatooed on the forehead of every marketer.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based one some of the reviews on this site.  Unfortunately, this time they failed me.  The book is outdated (as it was published 20 years ago) and lacks substance.  If you have little or no knowledge of marketing, this might be a decent intro for you.  It is relatively easy to read and dwells on few main concepts.  However, if you have taken a marketing course in college or have read much on marketing, you will likely find this book dull and uninformative, as I did.  Many of the big revelations in the book seem to me to be common sense.  Maybe 20 years ago it was revolutionary, but somehow I doubt it.  Also, some of the arguments he makes early in the book have been proven wrong by history...All in all, I would probably avoid this book.  I was hoping to get some new insights, but this book sure didn't help.  If you must buy it, buy a used copy as it certainly isn't worth [the money].</span>

                    <span>I first learnt the ¡§Intangible¡¨ when I was in secondary school.  Then, I have learnt more about ¡§Tangible Product¡¨ and ¡§Intangible Product¡¨ in marketing course in the university.  The course also taught me the strategies of promoting the ¡§Intangible Product¡¨ with its special characteristics.  <p>This book also taught me about ¡§Intangible¡¨.  For example, it would teach you the intangibles of the tangible products, such as the quality of salesman, delivery.  <p>But it¡¦s really new for me that, the book explained the marketing intangible products.  That is the ¡§promises¡¨.  The first thing come to my mind is the ¡§Service Guarantees¡¨.  The ¡§Service Guarantees¡¨ have done what is mentioned by the author, to tangibilize the intangible product.  It is really important that the ¡§Service Guarantees¡¨ on one hand, gave the customers confidence that they will be satisfied from the service.  On the other hand, the ¡§Service Guarantees¡¨ would also remind the customers how they benefit from our product or service.  Since people would trend to form the habits after repeat the same behavior for several times.  After that, they do continue to do that without pay attention to details.  So, I think that it is very important for the marketer to promote benefit that customers receive from our product or service.</span>
