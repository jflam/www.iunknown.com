                    <span>This book is a good resource type book for me. I have done web design before. The book has a pretty good Hex/RGB Conversion Chart in the back. It has a nice glossary. It even has a good chart on understanding style sheet attributes. It is not one of my favorites mainly because it was not the kind of book i was looking for. It's good for those who are just beginning and have some knowledge of how to use Photoshop, illustrator, golive, and Livemotion. If you have never touched these programs this is not the book to get. If you have you might find out some things you didn't know. It's a great book for the right price. i would not spend a lot of money on it, I'm cheap like that. However i am keeping mine for the Hex/RGB chart and maybe some later references.</span>

                    <span>I am a print and web designer and I found that this book was really helpful. I liked how the chapters were divided in a logical progression, and how the tips within each chapter were ordered from simplest to most difficult. The tips on LiveMotion were a bit challenging for me, however...I think there could have been some finessing of that section. Nonetheless, the book is lovely to peruse with its colorful and diverse styles of artwork. The layout was clean and I was able to follow along with the tips pretty easily. I agree with the previous reviewers that this book might not be for a beginner, but as an intermediate to power-user, I think the tips, and the book as a whole, were quite worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>I have been in the web design feild for about a year and thought i could add to my abilities to use Adobe products by buying this book.  WHAT A JOKE!!  It is ridiculously fragmented, the screen shots do not match what you see (I have the current versions and older versions of adobe products), and they dont explain anything.  they just list what to do.  not WHY you are doing it, or WHAT you are doing, just lists.  IT IS TERRIBLE.  I spent several hours wasting my time trying to get something useful out of this book before I threw it in the garbage.  Unfortunately, I was unable to take anything positive from this book.  $... down the drain.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased the Adobe web package that includes GoLive, Photoshop, Illustrator, and LiveMotion.  I happened across this book and though by the title, "Web Design Essentials", that it would be a good introduction to how these four software titles integrate.  However, I think a better title for this book would be "Tips & Tricks for Very Experienced Users of Photoshop, Illustrator, etc..."  The book is directed at Web Design professionals that perhaps don't understand everything about the software they are using every day.  The reason is, I believe, put very well in the introduction in this book that I will transcribe here:<p><p>"Now that we've told you what this book has to offer, it's also important to share what it doesn't.  This book won't teach you:  how to design - what makes a good layout, how to compose color, and so on - and it's not a tutorial for the various applications we cover.  Rather, [this book] will teach you how to use Adobe's tools to implement your creative vision..."<p><p>So the book doesn't help you to get familar with the software at all.  It assumes that you are very well familar with these products already and are looking to optimize your work style.  And to be truthful, it doesn't even do *that* very well in my opinion.  The book is full of a bunch of disjoined lessons on various topics that are covered in Adobe's help files or in the User Guides that came with the software.  It seems that if you are not familiar with industry terms (what is a 'comp' anyway?) then this book might provide a good glossary for you, but the lessons, well, I can't see them helping TOO much.<p><p>So, in closing, if you are looking for a book that shows you how the four software titles are connected, if you are looking for a book that will take you through the web site creation project using specifically Adobe software titles, then this is not the book for you.<p><p>To the author (if you all read this):  I believe that you will find a wider audience if you created a sample web site (download Macromedia's Dreamweaver and check out the tutorial, it's amazing!) from start to finish using all the common, and perhaps a few not so common, elements present in mainstream websites today.  In this manner, you'll show your readers how to use the software and from chapter to chapter, lesson to lesson, it will make SENSE.  Disjoined non-related lesson after lesson won't help people learn the software.  I realize you didn't aim this book at newbies such as myself, but unfortunately there was no review for me to see before I bought the book.  I gave the book two stars instead of one because while I found the content to be not applicable to me, the book itself is quite beautiful, although oddly sized.<p><p>Here is a list of the major topics and most of the chapters that follow them:<p><p>1.  Creating Web Graphics<br> Tiling a Background<br> Selecting and Replacing Colors<br> Using Select Color Range<br> Dithering Part of an Image<br> Expanding on the Web-safe Palette<br> Managing Page Elements with Layer Styles<br> Mapping Made Easy<br> Previewing Rasterized Graphics<br> Creating Artwork with Transparency<br> Background Transparency in Web Grpahics<br> Drawing a Navigational System<br> Creating Flexible Drop Shadows<p><p>2.  Managing Type<br> Formatting Type for Comps<br> Previewing HTML Text in Comps<br> Designing Images with Type<br> Transforming Type Using Vectors<br> Preserving Type in Bitmaps<br> Enhancing Type wtih Layer Effects<br> Spedifying Fonts for Web Sites<br> Understanding System Fonts<p><p>3.  Web Page Layout<br> Slicing Images for HTML Tables<br> Optimizing Slices<br> Making Image Maps<br> Creating Image maps in GoLive<br> Designing Forms<br> Creating Framed Web Pages<br> etc...<p> 4.  Active Elements<br> Animating GIFs<br> Creating Complex Animations<br> Importing Artwork for Animation<br> Creating Animation Styles<br> Animating with DHTML<br><p>Animating Rollovers<br> etc.<p><p>5.

                    <span>As anyone in the Internet industry knows, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Image Ready and Adobe Illustrator form part of the essential tools that anyone who is serious about a web site design has to know how to use. Complementing these are others such as Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Flash, and a handful of Open Source tools. <p> This book focuses on VERY practical tips on how to fully exploit Photoshop's Photoshop, Image Ready and Illustrator to do some very common tasks which are required from a Web designer on a regular basis. These are complemented by Adobe's Go Live and Live Motion, which -in all honesty, in my opinion- have been displaced by Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Flash, in their respective fields (makes you wonder how would a merge between Adobe and Macromedia look like!) <p> Anyway, back to the point: the book (although not too clearly stated) is mostly useful for the beginner-to-intermediate audience, as the accomplished designer will find most tips hereby included something he/she already knows. <p> The book is extremely well laid out and broken into sections, which makes it easy to follow, and it clearly signals levels of difficulty of the different tasks explained. Sections which (for the reasons already mentioned) I did not find as useful, were related to active images, which is not the area where Adobe stands out most. Other than that, I'd say it's a must have.</span>
