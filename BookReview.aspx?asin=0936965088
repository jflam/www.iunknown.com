                    <span>The author Fred Gleeck does a great job covering seminars and integrates this with the marketing of information (books, video, audio, etc.).  He also covers Back Of The Room sales and even documents how he catalogs and presents his sales pitch for these.
<br />
<br />The book is easy to read and the author's experience seeps into all major topics.  There's lots of detail here on each of the topics.
<br />
<br />Highly recommended for consultants and should be required reading for anyone putting on seminars and anyone selling information.

                    <span>I bought this book, hoping to improve attendance at some workshops I teach for my employer.  Our clients pay a nominal fee for the class, so it is important that we market the class effectively to gain participants.  I currently have a very successful "following", and gain new clients all the time.  Still, it is important to seek new clients actively.  I hoped Mr. Gleeck's book would help me to do that.<p>Mr. Gleeck's advice may work in a hard-core sales environment, but in the real world of adult training and consulting his advice would put me out of business!  I am speaking particularly of his advice regarding delivery of the workshop.    For example, he advises us to use self-depreciating humor to gain clients and win over our audience.  I fail to see how telling the client I'm a schmuck will make him/her trust my knowledge enough to take my class!<p>The book was actually painful to read.  Mr. Gleeck had an arrogant tone throughout the book.  I'm glad he thinks he's wonderful because his advice was useless to me.  Honestly, I am extremely sorry I wasted the money, and the time, on this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm an experienced seminar leader (I've trained over 30,000 people in my career) and still got plenty of great tips from Fred's superb resource.    Handling difficult people, how to sell better from the podium, as well as a lot of new tips that will help me do even better.  Thanks Fred - nice work!   Get this book if you do seminars.</span>
