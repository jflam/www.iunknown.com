                    <span>Wine Report 2004 by Tom Stevenson is an exceptional reference for both the expert and the beginner. I'm in the wine business and have dozens of wine books which each have their merits. Mr. Stevenson's New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia is one of the benchmarks of the business and is respected world over. The Wine Report 2004 is a much smaller book in comparison, but it's chock full of information. Relying on local experts to cover the various regions of the world is a well chosen strategy. The Grapevine section at the beginning of each chapter provides juicy (no pun intended) gossip for wine insiders. It's also great to read the opinions of the experts and their predictions/hopes for the future of wine in their part of the world. The information inside is as current as it gets. Simply a great pocket reference for the wine insider. Well done!</span>

                    <span>Finally a comprehensive review of the world of wines with current information. Tom's cadre of wine experts detail the latest trends & news for each region of the world. They also cover the quality of recent vintages and the reasons behind it. They even pick out top producers, up & comers as well as top notch selections for your consumption. I was especially interested in the variety of topics. To mention a few: Wine & Health, Classic Wine Vintage Guide, Wine on the Web & The 100 Most Exciting Wine Finds.<BR>For those of us looking for current, up to date information in the world of wine this is your bible.</span>

I find the book easy to navigate through and highly informative. This book is definitely great for wine novices as well as advanced students of the vine. Thanks Tom! Well done.</span>
