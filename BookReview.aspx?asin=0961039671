                <span id="Label1">Building the Six-Hour Canoe contains scale plans, specifications, a tool list, step-by-step instructions, and even a helpful explanation of how to paddle the canoe.  All the building operations are clearly illustrated with photos and sketches.  The canoe is constructed from a single 4'x16' sheet (or 2 4'x8' sheets) of marine plywood and a few pieces of dimensional lumber and, with epoxy glued seams, is watertight from the moment it hits the water.  When completed, the canoe is 15'3" in length with a 311/2" beam.  <P>Tiller Publishing, of St. Michaels, MD, announces the - fifth printing of Building the Six-Hour Canoe.  The demand for this book, first published in 1994, has been so great that Tiller has gone back to the presses for a fifth time.  Inexpensive to build using ordinary tools and materials, the canoe gives everybody access to boatbuilding and a boat.   Light, easy to carry and handle, it can be a personal favorite.  Or it can be the ideal boat for introductory boatbuilding courses and for community and/or school based building experiences.  Many of these boats have been built by fifth and sixth graders.</span>

                    <span>Although the six hours refers to someone with experience and possessing all the tools and wood, the design is perfect for people (me, for example) with no woodworking experience. Because I had little experience, I had to refer to Tom Hill's extraordinary Ultralight Boatbuilding, which though written for a skilled woodworker includes important details left out of Six-Hour. There are only a few things I would want to change to Six-Hour: <BR>There are two lists of materials, one on p. 11, one on p. 58. They do not match. The one on 11 has a frame bottom, but this is not in 58, and 58 does not list the keel. They mention a "full sized pattern" for the gussets on p. 18, but no such pattern exists. They also might as well include the butt block procedure for two 4x8 pieces of plywood in the main part of the book because most places on the planet do not have 4x16 pieces of marine grade plywood. Also, readers should work hard to find a source of cheap bronze screws before they start (the project requires about 120 of them--not the 50 given in the text--and they are expensive!) It would also have been nice if they had photographs showning the canoe at main stages in the process. The above minor points did not detract from the 30 hours or so of pure enjoyment I had in using this book to build a canoe. I hope the authors come out with the sailboat version they promise.</span>

                    <span>We have made these as part of youth programmes in Western Australia. They take us about 30 hours to build with groups of 4 to 5 working on them. These people have never made anything before so progress is slower than you would first think. They are a great project, we use cheap ply and paint them well seems to work fine. The group gets a great deal for the building process. I keep meaning to build one for myself, perhaps this time round I will</span>

                    <span>I have taken a class a Buffalo State College with John Montague, the author. In the class I built the weekend skiff, a row boat/sail boat. I have also built the 6-hour canoe with high school age kids in the Adirondack Mountains at a summer camp. It took a group of 6 kids to build 2 canoes and approximately 4 days working about 4 hours per day, this includes painting the canoe which is not part of the 6 hours of building the canoe. The directions are easy to follow and the cost is very inexpensive. The canoes have lasted 2 summers so far and look to withstand many more. They are made of marine grade plywood. Have fun building one yourself.</span>

                    <span>A neat idea, I am not sure how my canoe will turn out because it is presently incomplete. As one friend said - "just for interest's sake, keep track of your time." One would have to be superhuman to finish this canoe in six hours, but the book is good and the plans are inspiring. The book is a bit less complete in its discussion of materials and techniques than I might have hoped, but it does include a big section on using the canoe as a learning project with groups and such. Altogether, a neat book, if incorrectly titled.</span>
