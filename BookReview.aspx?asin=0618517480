                    <span>Give it up folks--the book is on Boston's best-seller list.  It's a waste of time to bash Dan.  He loves getting readers riled up, doesn't care what you think of his writing nor his overlong ride the Curse money train--just as long as you keep his name circulating.  He loves being hated because it means you are paying attention. He truly cannot help that his mean-spirited bitterness about an unhappy personal life seep into his Red Sox coverage.  Just ignore him and he will go away eventually.</span>

                    <span>Now with the so-called "Curse" now (thankfully) gone, this tripe of a book must be Dan's swan song - his whole career at the Boston Globe has revolved around the "Curse" and his shameless coverage of it.
<br />Dan is a whining wanna-be baseball player who can't put two complete sentences together without mentioning Babe Ruth or Bucky Dent.
<br />If you want to read a good review of the Red Sox' World Series victory, check out Stewart O'Nan & Stephen King's "Faithful".</span>

                    <span>DAN IS A LOUSY WRITER WHO HAS MADE HIS ENTIRE CAREER DEPICTING THE NEVERENDING TORTURE OF BEING A RED SOX FAN AND PLAYER, ALWAYS BEING BRIDESMAIDS AND NEVER BRIDES BECAUSE THE BETTER TEAM, THE NEW YORK YANKEES WAS ALWAYS IN THEIR WAY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW, DAN? OH, WRITE ABOUT HOW IT'S ALL OVER? HE ADDS NO POSSIBLE INSIGHT TO HISTORY, AS IT ALREADY HAPPENED AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT IT. WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE TOLD US? NOTHING, THAT'S WHAT. AND HE'S NOT EVEN A REAL FAN! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!</span>

                    <span>Shaughnessy's gravy train has finally left the station and this book is one last desperate attempt to milk the cash cow of the supposed "curse." Maybe Shaughnessy will now turn his attention to his long-anticipated autobiography "The Curse of the Talentless Hack," in which he explains to the reader how to write the same newspaper column over and over again for 20 years and still get paid for it. Now that the Sox and Patriots are champions, Shaughnessy will probably cook up the "Curse of John Havlicek" for the Celtics or the "Curse of Phil Esposito," for the Bruins" so he will have an excuse to write another lame book.</span>
