                    <span>I couldn't stop listening until I finished the tapes.  It has changed the way I view myself.  As a physicist I can feel her frustration in having experiences which can not be explained by our current reductionist approach.  The first step in understanding is having the imagination to reach and the courage to share one's visions.  This is why so many physicists ultimately turn into mystics.  Compare this audio tape to the "Molecules of Emotion" tape which she made only 3 years ago to see just how far she has evolved personally from her insights.  What stronger validation would anyone need?  Perhaps you will share in this benefit.  Science, too, must evolve in the coming millenium and I believe she is at the forefront...</span>
