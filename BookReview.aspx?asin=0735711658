                <span id="Label1">With his first book, <I>Flash Web Design</I>, Hillman Curtis quickly earned Flash guru status, and deservedly so. Like the coolest mentor one could ever hope to find, he struck a chord with his audience by sharing not just the nuts and bolts behind his Flash creations, but his ideas on good design methodology.<p>  <I>MTIV</I> expands on that. Here he shares his respect and excitement for new media, gives a blueprint for design challenges of all types, taps into the myriad visual and literary inspirations that fuel his imagination, and shows readers how to get past their own moments of "designer&#146;s block."<p>  Curtis is a fine storyteller. He takes anecdotes of coffee breaks, book tour lectures, work, life, and art, and weaves them around design maxims. For every morsel of advice, there are three or four personal stories that illustrate how he arrived at it and puts it to use. He shows how books, movies, print ads--just about anything--can be used in the search for creative solutions.<p>  The seven steps in "Process" compose the bulk of the book. These are the exact steps Curtis&#146;s design team applies to each project. Without giving too much away, they are Listen, Unite, Theme, Concept, Filter, Justify, and Eat the Audience. (Well, you&#146;ll just have to get the book to find out about that last one.)<p>  In "Inspiration," we learn that Curtis draws from Hemingway, Mies van der Rohe, Sidney Lumet, David Mamet, Leonard Cohen, Mark Rothko, and Joseph M&#252;ller-Brockman, among others. And the book finishes with a bang in the third chapter, "Practice," a collection of helpful tips in typography, color theory, XML, grids, and much more, from experts like Joseph Lowery  (author of the <I>Dreamweaver Bible</I>) and usability authority Steve Krug.<p>  MTIV is not just an easy read, it&#146;s fun, warm, encouraging, and, yes, inspiring. A self-taught artist, Curtis has made <I>MTIV</I> the perfect Boy Scout manual for those who have stumbled on design as a new career or just languished through too many uninspired afternoons in front of the computer. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>As a design student, I was recommended to read this book by numerous friends of mine who have graduated from the program. I am a second-year student without a lot of real-world design experience, and reading this book still hit very close to home. 
<br />
<br />This book is divided into three sections: process, inspiration and practice. The first section, process, outlines the way that Curtis has learned to relate to clients. His writing style is well organized and his voice is easy to follow. He uses personal stories as a way to connect to the reader rather than using "design-speak". 
<br />
<br />The second section, inspiration, is a visual showcase of some of the people who inspire the author, and some of their strongest works. Many of these are motion pieces, so translating them to print poses a slight challenge. Curtis selects multiple frames from each piece that are representative of the story being told, and lays them out in a way that still conveys the meaning of the piece, making sure to describe the action that occurs so that the reader is as informed as possible without actually being able to view the piece. 
<br />
<br />The final section, practice, is more of a tool to the new designer than to those with more experience. It is a guide to the ins and outs of design from a basic html overview to the usage of a grid in print design. For this section, Curtis invites other professionals that he considers experts in their respective fields to write individual essays. He provides this as a response to the lack of basic design literature that he ran into when he started designing many years ago. 
<br />
<br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The third section in particular seems geared toward younger designers, but anyone in a creative field would be able to gain from the client interaction guidelines listed in the process section or the imagery and ideas in the inspiration section. I highly recommend it to anyone.</span>

                    <span>This book was recommended to me as I first began studying web design.  It really inspired me then, and it continues to inspire me everytime I read it.<p>This book is written like a friendly conversation, and you can't help but feel encouraged.  Because Mr. Curtis lets you know that someone else has had the same problems and issues that you have, and he shows you how he's worked them out.<p>It isn't so much a "how-to" book as it is a "how-to-be" book.  He illustrates how you can be a more effective new media designer in all areas: client relationships, innovation, production. <p>A wonderful book.  Buy it today, and you won't be sorry!</span>

                    <span>Hillman encapsulates what is seemingly basic. As we move ahead in design or any field, experience often tells us what is basic. These are the very principals that need review-refinement.  Hillman at times seems to harp on that which is obvious, but with good reason. Doing the simple expertly makes the difficult simple.  The contributors insight into technologies that seem esoteric (XML,XSLT), are prophecy indeed. If in doubt take a look at some of the files in MAC O/S 10 or at XML.com.  An insightful read but not for those looking for a cookbook. Inspiration, which I value more than how-to, at a great value.</span>
