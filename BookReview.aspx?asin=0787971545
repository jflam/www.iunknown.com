                    <span>This book is about why big, established companies should aim to be "Fast Second" rather than pioneers of radically new markets.
<br />
<br />The authors challenge the new hypothesis that big firms need to be "ambidextrous" (i.e. able to use either hand with equal skill). An ambidextrous organization has successfully put in place multiple, contradictory structures, processes, and cultures within the same organizational infrastructure. By developing strong shared values and by putting in charge managers capable of managing variety and ambiguity, ambidextrous organizations can successfully balance the conflicting demands that the simultaneous pursuit of being First Mover (or colonizer) and being Fast Second (or consolidator) would place on them. 
<br />
<br />The skills, competencies, mindsets, and attitudes needed to succeed as a First Mover versus a Fast Second are like chalk and cheese. From First Mover to Fast Second, these are the 16 differences according to the authors:
<br />1. From engineering or technology skills TO marketing, customer segmentation, and retailing skills
<br />2. From emphasis on novelty, quality, and focus on lead users TO understanding of average user needs, good at spotting consensus
<br />3. From young, restless, fascinated with science, technology, and the leading edge TO more interested in making money than in developing the latest technological wonder
<br />4. From roots in science TO commercial roots
<br />5. From focus on technological achievements and creating the best-performing product TO focus on price and quality and willing to settle for a product that is "good enough"
<br />6. From manage information network in science community TO manage network of feeder entrepreneurial firms
<br />7. From entrepreneurs who prefer autonomy and freedom and do not want to work in a big company TO organization people, happy within the structures and constraints of a large organization
<br />8. From fast, agile, risk-taking experiments TO people who defend the existing business and don't take unnecessary risks
<br />9. From entrepreneurial culture TO functional organization, formal management control systems
<br />10. From first, fast mover TO judicious mover
<br />11. From small is beautiful TO need resources to build the brand and distribution
<br />12. From good at management of product design TO mastery of process engineering, procurement expertise, and mass-market management
<br />13. From a culture of innovation and experimentation TO a culture of discipline and cost-control
<br />14. From flexible TO disciplined
<br />15. From short-term oriented TO long-term oriented
<br />16. From fluid structures that allow easy flow of ideas and learning from mistakes TO managed hierarchy, focusing on mass marketing, customer segmentation, and manufacturing excellence
<br />
<br />Not only are the necessary skills for each activity different, they also CONFLICT with each other. This means that firms that are good at being First Mover are unlikely to be good at being Fast Second. Looking at the list above, it's obvious that big firms have the skills and mindsets to be good Fast Second market players. Trying to teach them the skills of a First Mover will not usually work because their existing skills conflict with many of the skills they need to develop. Big firms should focus on what they are good at - the consolidation of radical markets into mass markets (Fast Second). They can achieve this by adopting an acquisition or network strategy with young start-up firms.
<br />
<br />I got the book from Amazon the other day and finished it last night. It usually takes longer to read a strategy book, but this one is slim with only 170 pages. Being a business development manager, the topic of strategic innovation is very familiar and the arguments are surprisingly clear ... and very thought provoking, indeed. I'll highly recommend this book. It's a bold challenge to the conventional wisdom of the need to build radical innovation competence for big firms. It makes you rethink what you aim for ...
<br />
<br />If you're interested in strategic innovation, do also consider Kim & Mauborgne's "Blue Ocean Strategy", Slywotzky's "How to Grow When Markets Don't", and Markides' "All the Right Moves".

                    <span>This brilliant book argues that big companies should not waste time and resources trying to discover new products and markets. Their sheer size, embedded culture and traditional mindsets are prohibitive factors. Radical innovation is much more likely to emerge from the efforts of all those small companies, start-ups and entrepreneurs that dream of becoming the next Microsoft. They are flexible and can afford to take risks without being burdened by rules and bureaucracy. What they lack, however, is the ability to turn a niche market into a mass market. This is when big companies should step in. If they are "smart" enough to spot the markets of the future early on they should leverage their brand name, pricing power, distribution network and marketing muscle to turn these niche markets into profitable mass markets.
<br />
<br />Markides and Geroski use brilliant and highly accessible language to convey their message. They support their thesis by providing a whole range of examples of companies that succeeded in creating new markets by being "Fast Second" rather than "First". They also offer detailed recommendations on how to scale up and dominate a new market.
<br />
<br />The book's thesis is very credible in a world where companies are increasingly outsourcing innovation and relying on others for ideas. And by being so specific in terms of what it recommends, "Fast Second" is superior to Gary Hamel's "Leading the Revolution" and Kim & Mauborgne's "Blue Ocean Strategy". These authors recommend that big companies should aim to grow by being open to new ideas and by attempting to create new markets themselves. But they fail to say how to do this.</span>

                    <span>While the authors come up with some suggestions that challenge the conventional wisdom in strategy making - innovations are the only way to be truly successful in times of change - the book is still disappointing. This is due to two shortcomings: first, the authors' main argument only applies to radical innovations (such as the invention/development of cars, TV, or the Internet), which by their very nature create a new industry in which established firms hardly ever compete. Consequently, radical innovation is not the type of innovation that established firms (should) care about in real life anyway. Second, the authors keep repeating the same arguments over and over again, and even use the exact same sentences several times throughout the book. This is very frustrating for the reader who is curious to find out about the real implications and recommendations for established firms that emerge from the authors' prime insight that established firms should focus on scaling up the innovations that others have pioneered. 
<br />In summary, the book discusses an interesting new idea, but fails to provide enough detail and examples to truly underpin this idea.</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating new book on innovation with a provocative thesis. It is easy to read and keeps the reader's attention from start to finish. The book proposes that there is one type of innovation (namely radical innovation) that is beyond the reach of big established firms.  As a result the authors suggest that big firms should leave the task of creating radical new products to smaller firms. The book is full of advice for managers of small and big companies alike.  It is a must read for senior managers as well as policy makers.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a fantastic read.  Based on solid academic research, the book proposes a provocative thesis--that big established firms cannot create radical new products.  They should, therefore, "subcontract" the creation of radical products to start-up firms and focus instead on scaling up these products into big, mass markets.  The authors have done their homework.  This is not a thesis that emerges out of thin air.  Rather, chapters 2 and 3 provide a fascinating summary of the available academic evidence that shows that radical new products get created in a supply-push process that creates markets with certain characteristics.  It is exactly these underlying structural features of radical new markets that makes it difficult for big established firms to create these kinds of products.
<br />
<br />The book is full of examples that highlight its arguments and thesis.  It is also easy to read and avoids academic jargon.  It has a truly provocative thesis that should make managers and policy makers sit up and think.  Chapter 8 by itself is worth the price of this excellent book!
