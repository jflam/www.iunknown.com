                    <span>The Restless Earth Collection by National Geographic explores aspects of natural disasters, space phenomena (asteroids), and weather systems that affect our world throughout our lives. Spread out over 3 discs, the material is presented in a well narrated, matter of fact approach that keeps your interest throughout the programs.<P>'Asteroids: Deadly Impact' explores the history of asteroid and comet strikes on our planet and speculates on what future consequences we might experience when (the law of averages are we will be hit again someday) that impact occurs. Interviews with experts on heavenly bodies and our solar system reveal interesting information regarding our ever changing galaxy.<P>'Volcano: Nature's Inferno' is an excellent documentary on the massive and awesome display of incredible power harnessed by the earth. Volcanologists are followed to various areas of the globe where they research, report on, and study some of the earth's most active volcanoes. There is really impressive footage of lava flows, eruptions, landslides, and avalanches. A bonus feature on this disc is 'Into the Volcano' where a seasoned photographer and his crew venture close to active volcanoes and craters and record amazing footage.<P>The last and most interesting disc in this collection, in my opinion, is 'Nature's Fury'. Here is a no holds barred look at earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. The overwhelming power and devastation of these natural disasters have to be seen to be believed and it is truly astonshing in almost all cases. This disc documents Mother Nature releasing her fury in locations throughout the globe and how science is working today to better understand what causes these disasters to happen and how we can better prepare for it. Two bonus programs on this disc are 'Tornado Hunters' and 'Lightning Strikes', both are interesting and offer decent material.<P>All in all, National Geographic has produced a nice collection here that doesn't disappoint. The DVD footage is very clear and impressive and each disc offers Dolby 5.1 Surround which sounds really good. If there is any down side at all, it may be that more footage would have been nice of the natural disasters (tornadoes, hurricanes) and that is my reason for only 4 stars. Still, for the asking price, this is a worthwhile purchase if you enjoy this subject material. Recommended.</span>
