                <span id="Label1">Laurie R. King&#8217;s bestselling mystery series featuring Mary Russell and her husband and partner, Sherlock Holmes, is beloved by readers and acclaimed by critics the world over.  Now the illustrious duo returns for their most dangerous exploit yet, in a rich and atmospheric tale that takes them to India to save the life of one of literature&#8217;s most fabled heroes.It&#8217;s the second day of the new year, 1924, and Mary Russell is settling in for a much-needed rest with her husband, Sherlock Holmes.  But the fragile peace will be fleeting&#8212;for a visit with Holmes&#8217;s gravely ill brother, Mycroft, brings news of an intrigue that is sure to halt their respite.  Mycroft, who has ties to the highest levels of the government, has just received a strange package.  The oilskin-wrapped packet contains the papers of a missing English spy named Kimball O&#8217;Hara&#8212;indeed, the same Kimball who served as the inspiration for Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s famed Kim.  An orphaned English boy turned loose in India, Kim long used his cunning to spy for the Crown.  But after inexplicably withdrawing from the &#8220;Great Game&#8221; of border espionage, he&#8217;s gone missing and is feared taken hostage&#8212;or even killed.When Russell learns of Holmes&#8217;s own secret friendship with Kim some thirty years before, she knows the die is cast: she will accompany her husband to India to search for the missing operative. But even before they arrive, danger will show its face in everything from a suspicious passenger on board their steamer to an &#8220;accident&#8221; that very nearly claims their lives. Once in India, Russell and Holmes must travel incognito&#8212;no small task for the English lady and her lanky companion. But after a twist of fate forces the couple to part ways, Russell learns that in this faraway place it&#8217;s often impossible to tell friend from foe&#8212;and that some games must be played out until their deadly end.Showcasing King&#8217;s masterful plotting and skill at making history leap from the page, <i>The Game</i> brings alive an India fraught with unrest and poised for change&#8212;and an unpredictable mystery with brilliance and character to match.</span>

                    <span>Mary Russell, the much younger, part jewish and equal on all terms, wife of Sherlock Holmes is on another exciting case. This one takes them to India via cruise ship in search of Kimball O'Hara, the now grown up Kim of Kipling fame. On the way, the meet a suspicious American, with mother and sister in tow; a precocious youth who joins them in their quest and an Indian Price who is more than meets the eye. <P>The games afoot!<P>I love these books for their adventure, the history and the characters. Ms. King remains as true to the original Holmes as I would ever want and creates new stories with the fabulous character of Mary Russell.<P>If you are new to this series, I'd start at the beginning with The Bee Keeper's Apprentice. If not, I would get this book as quickly as possible.</span>

                    <span>Laurie R. King's latest Mary Russell novel is marketed as " a novel of suspense," and that is a very accurate description. This is by no means a whodunnit, but it is an exciting story with a couple of flaws that keep it from being first-rate.<P>This story takes Mary Russell and her illustrious husband, Sherlock Holmes, to India in 1924. They are searching for a missing British agent named Kimball O'Hara, the adult version of Rudyard Kipling's Kim. O'Hara has disappeared somewhere in northern India and the trail is cold. Nevertheless, Russell and Holmes set out to find him, and of course they do. <P>One of the great strengths of this series is that it is NOT a Sherlock Holmes knock-off. These are stories about Mary Russell, and Sherlock Holmes appears at appropriate moments. Mary begins by learning another exotic language in record time-- this time it is Hindi-- and the couple wander through northern India as itinerant performers, magicians and jugglers. Eventually they split up, and Mary resumes her real identity (without giving away that she is Mrs. Holmes) to visit a maharaja with his own zoo, a collection of dwarves, and a love for the sport of pig-sticking. Mary starts out with a low opinion of this "sport," but her introduction to pig-sticking is one of the best parts of the story.<P>Mary is sure that the maharaja is up to no good, but she has to make a hasty exit before she gets enough proof. She and Holmes join up again, then Holmes is dragged off by the maharaja's minions. Of course, it's up to Mary to get him back and find Kimball O'Hara, which she does. And yes, the maharaja really is up to no good and gets his comeuppance, as well.<P>After a rather slow start (an overdose of history and politics to get everyone up to speed), the story moves along quickly and is fun to read. As usual, the part that has the couple masquerading as performers is very entertaining, and along the way one learns much about Indian culture and customs. <P>The weaknesses are an overabundance of characters, most of whom are underdeveloped and turn out to be superfluous anyway, and too great a reliance on coincidence to provide information and solve problems. Everything in the story happens just too easily. No obstacle is too difficult to be overcome in a couple of pages. That cost the book one star, in my opinion, but if you aren't very picky about things like that, you may find the book better than I have rated it.</span>

                    <span>This is an improvement over the previous "Justice Hall," but it's still a disappointment compared to the first couple of King's Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes stories. It almost reads like two different authors wrote the first 80% and final 20% of the book respectively. The front 80% groans under the weight of enervatingly lavish, detailed descriptions of places, events, and politics in India: nothing much happens, and we get introduced to some amusing characters whom you know Will Assume Unexpected Importance Later. This part of the book is impressive in terms of the research that must have gone into it, but for those who like *mysteries*, it's a long slog, very much like "Justice Hall." <P>In the second part of the book, after Russell and Holmes meet up again in the context of the Maharajah's castle, plot details get neatly resolved with the same handiness and speediness with which the action suddenly moves along. Too many coincidences here, and too many telling details from earlier in the book unresolved. Do we suspect a rush job on the ending to meet a publication schedule?</span>

                    <span>I liked this book very much. The details of life in a prince's palace were fascinating, particularly the pig sticking. The book moves right along for one so richly detailed. I enjoyed the first portion somwhat more than the end; I had the feeling it was wrapped up to fit into a specific page count and could have been much more detailed; a slightly too "pat" resolution. However, several story lines were left unfinished and I look forward to seeing them carried forward in the next intallment. I recommend this book, but would start as a new reader of Laurie King with the Beekeeper's Apprentice.</span>
