                    <span>I truly enjoyed the biography of Tiger Woods by Bill Gutman. I thought it gave good insight into what makes him the champion that he is. It is the story of one family's search for the American dream and the glory of finding it. It details how the dreams of Tiger's faher became his own. All the sacfrifice that he and his family made are detailed and makes his accomplishments all the more spectacular. I think this is a great read for all those who are fans of drive and determination and not just for those who love golf.</span>

                    <span>This is an exciting, and compelling biography about the hottest player on the PGA Tour. This biography begins from when Tiger was two years old, and already hitting plastic golf balls in his front-yard. From not being allowed to play on certain golf courses, to being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to play in tournaments, Tiger Woods is the jump-start that the PGA Tour needed. The bond between Tiger and his father grows from when Tiger won his first tournament as a youngster to his record setting performance at The Masters Tournament. This bond is seen throughout the entire biography. This biography is thilling, and threaded with compassion. Definetly for the avid golfer.</span>
