                    <span>There are many, many book for the amateur or beginning game programmer around, but most of them stink, and for some reason the Java game programming ones stink even more! This book is an exception to the rule, and it is way over the average, especially compared with the other books in this very sloppy and superficial New Riders's game programming series. No tome fattening explaining the fundamentals of Java, just the raw meat of useful game programming techniques. Threading, full screen, Swing, double buffering, animation, a little 2D scroller, up to date NIO game networking, fundamentals of 3D graphics, BSP trees, AI, scripting...you will find all these cookies inside the book! The "level of detail" of course varies from subject to subject, do not expect a through , complete, super-extensive treatment, but all the subjects are covered in more than decent depth. I have only one  critique: The author's code doesn't use any form of 3D acceleration. I understand that this way the code can be more interesting.. as you are forced to learn more about what it takes to put a 3D object on the screen, but still software rendering is history now. The author is definitely too young and inexperienced to be a game programming guru, and sometimes his explanations are a bit vague and too "code-oriented", but he is definitely a very talented programmer and a good technical writer... on his way to gurudom! ;) </span>

                    <span>Java is a tough choice as a programming language for certain types of games. Commonly known as twitch or reflex games. The difficulty is in the loss of a performance edge, unless the bytecode has been transformed into native code.
<br />
<br />But Brackeen shows that writing java games also has its attractions. An elegant and easy to learn object oriented language. Arguably, more robust than C++. Java also has a relatively simply threading model. Threading is essential in most games, but can be very difficult to write robustly and to debug. 
<br />
<br />He goes through the essentials of gaming, and shows what can be done with the standard java libraries, that come with the normal java distribution. Like a useful sound API that can play the common audio encoding formats of wav, au and aiff. 
<br />
<br />For animation, well there is 2 dimensional material shown. For 3d, the issues are much harder. We see quick examples of coding 3d objects and putting a texture map on their surfaces and illuminating them with a light source. 
<br />
<br />Overall, the author presents a solid introduction to his subject. With the clear proviso that many topics are barely gone into, out of sheer necessity. </span>

                    <span>This guy is a true Game Programmer Guru. He is also very clear with his words and code. I don't think there is any other Java Game Programming book that comes even close to this one. The book makes complex topics like multi-player games over the Internet look simple !!! "Let's make a framework for a game server using NIO." Wow !!! If you want to show us that, so let's do it. I don't trust any other book that is not from O'Reilly, but this one is a CLASSIC. O'Reilly should hire this guy to write more game programming books for them.</span>

                    <span>I agree with a previous reviewer about this book. It is a great book, covering a gamut of topics on developing games. The problem is what the other reviewer mentioned: the huge amount of code. It seems that the author is simply handing you his development toolkit to use rather than helping you develop your own.<br>Also, given that there is so much code and as the length of the classes gets longer, UML diagrams or some sort of visual representation of the interaction of the classes would make things much MUCH clearer. I've had to constantly refer back to such-and-such a class described pages before simply to grasp some trivial portion of a new class the author introduces.<br>The book is geared towards those that have worked with java before. This doesn't necessarily mean that the reader would have dealt very much (if at all) with graphics, animation, etc. As such, it would have been much better if the topics were delved into more thoroughly, referring to the code. As it is, the code itself is used to explain much of what is being discussed leaving the tedious reverse-engineering to the reader.<br>I've focused on the negative, but despite all this the book is still really very good. However, someone deciding to pick it up should come with a grounded understanding of java as well as a lot of patience.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I have to admit that this book is a very good java game programming book.  Probably the best book on the matter out there, perhaps until the new crop of 2004 java game programming books start showing up on the bookshelves.  I was able to take the source code provided and get "most" of the projects running smoothly.  Most importantly, the side scroller example worked great.  Basically, the book does a great job of providing almost everything you'll need to know about getting a fullscreen java game running on your system.  I have to agree with most things  everyone has said about the book in their reviews.  However, that doesn't mean the book warrants 5 stars...<p>What I don't like about the book is the pages and pages and pages of code plastered in the book.  I simply cannot give a book a high rating when so much of the book contains cut-and-paste code.  If you want to learn game programming, you should be sitting in front of you computer with code on your screen.  I'm fine with some code snippets here and there, but when you're provided with a great downloadable source (which the book has), you don't need the overkill in the text.  The book would be much more conducive to focusing on game framework explanations if you weren't flipping through pages of code but rather referencing the book and looking at your screen.<p>Just my two cents on programming books.  Otherwise, the book does  contain very good content that all java game programmers will want to know.</span>
