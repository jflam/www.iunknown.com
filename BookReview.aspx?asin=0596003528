                <span id="Label1">For people who create and modify text files, sed and awk are power tools for editing. sed, awk, and regular expressions allow programmers and system administrators to automate editing tasks that need to be performed on one or more files, to simplify the task of performing the same edits on multiple files, and to write conversion programs.  The <i>sed & awk Pocket Reference</i> is a companion volume to <i>sed & awk, Second Edition, Unix in a Nutshell, Third Edition</i>, and <i>Effective awk Programming, Third Edition</i>. This new edition has expanded coverage of gawk (GNU awk), and includes sections on:<ul><li type="disc">An overview of sed and awk?s command line syntax</li><li type="disc">Alphabetical summaries of commands, including nawk and gawk</li><li type="disc">Profiling with pgawk</li><li type="disc">Coprocesses and sockets with gawk</li><li type="disc">Internationalization with gawk</li><li type="disc">A listing of resources for sed and awk users</li></ul>This small book is a handy reference guide to the information presented in the larger volumes. It presents a concise summary of regular expressions and pattern matching, and summaries of sed and awk.  Arnold Robbins, an Atlanta native now happily living in Israel, is a professional programmer and technical author and coauthor of various O'Reilly Unix titles. He has been working with Unix systems since 1980, and currently maintains gawk and its documentation.</span>

                    <span>This little book is great.  I've only had it for about a week.  I needed to match some text today with a pattern that was a little bit more involved than my usual simple needs.  I flipped through a few pages and found some examples that quickly helped me derive the search pattern I needed in a few minutes.  <p>I have the full "sed & awk" second edition book, but I went to the pocket reference instead.  I would not have been able to find what I needed in the larger book as quickly.  <p>Some have complained about some of the pocket references lacking indexes.  This one doesn't have one, but it's so easy to use that it doesn't need one.  Just flip and few pages and you'll find what you need.  As far as I'm concerned time is money.  This little book has paid for itself in one weeks use.</span>

                    <span>Sed and awk are the mainstay for those of you who write shell scripts on unix/linux machines that manipulate text files. It is difficult to overstate the usefulness of these two programs.<p>So O'Reilly and Robbins decided to help you by providing this pocketbook reference that encapsulates the online help for the programs. The book is aimed at someone who programs, but still prefers a traditional hardcopy reference as an aid to human memory. It assumes that you basically already know how to use the programs, but just need some reminder as to the exact syntax and all the possible options.</span>

                    <span>I use this pocket reference more then any other reference for sed and awk. This is mostly a syntax guide for folks who already know sed and awk. If you don't know sed and awk, get the Ellen Quigleys 'Unix Shells'(for beginners) followed by O'Reillies 'Sed and Awk' reference. (Big book.) I tend to forget exactly how to do something, so I will just quickly look at my bookmarked pocket reference, and flip quickly to an example of syntax to get that bash code going correctly. If your desk has as many papers and books on it as mine, this is nice for freeing up some elbow room, while keeping the big books on the bookshelf most of the time.</span>

                    <span>I bought this "book" because I am writing a program that deals  extensively with strings and text (natural language parsing). I was having  some difficulty mastering sed, and understanding how it works. For example,  "s/[^A-Za-z]//" was not working (to remove non alpha chars).  After five pages in this little gem, I knew what I needed. A trailing  "g". <p>The book is rich with examples, explanations, and really  just cuts straight to the chase. <p>This is not a book for the casual user.  It is, after all, a reference, not a tutorial. Unix users (and  administrators) who already have a basic grasp of regular expressions and  just what sed and awk are (and grep/egrep too) will find this most  rewarding.<p>While I have a hard time paying this much for what amounts to  less than toaster oven instructions, it is absolutely invaluable to me, and  it doesnt take up space on my desk or bookshelf.</span>
