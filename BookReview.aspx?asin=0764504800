                    <span>There are too many mistakes in this book. You have to read fairly carefully to not get caught by them. For example, one of the "Prep Test" questions for chapter 14 is, "How do you create a temporary backup device?". In the answers it refers the reader to the "Performing Backups" section, which does not contain the specific answer that they're looking for. This is one example out of many where the text does not prepare you at all for a question.<p>There are also quite a few outright errors in the Prep Tests and Answers sections.<p>The book in general is quite informative, I'm only rating it this low because of the poor quality of the questions and answers -- it's as if they were added as an afterthought. I'm using this to prepare for 70-228, and now I wish I had a better book.</span>

                    <span>This book is the first I've read from the "Dummies" series and  it provided a solid foundation for exam 70-228.  It's a practical guide for working through and understanding the objectives for the exam.  If you have little or no experience with  SQL Server, the hands-on exercises will quickly get you on track with SQL administration.  I read this book, worked through the exercises and studied the Transcenders to pass the exam.</span>

                    <span>I have never worked with SQL Server and had no previous knowledge of it until I started studying for this test.  Because of that, I read several books (5) in preparation, including the Exam Cram, the one by Joyjit Mukherjee, and the Readiness Review from Microsoft Press.  I thought this book was invaluable and taught me by far the most.  Unless you are experienced with SQL Server, I would still recommend reading other books, especially the Readiness Review, but I can't say enough about the easy to understand, easy to read, but yet comprehensive coverage I found in this book.  My good friend studied for the same test at the same time and felt the same.</span>

Also little info on auditing and troubleshooting, since this is an important part of the exam.</span>
