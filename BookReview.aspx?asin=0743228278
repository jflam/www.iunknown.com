                    <span>Dylan has written a tremendous number of poor and idiotic lines in his life. He has also written many arresting , beautiful and striking lines, lines which stay in the memory because they have been heard in the songs over and over again as songs are heard over and over again.
<br /> " How does feel to be out on your own, a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone?" 
<br /> Or " I ain't sayin you treated me unkind , you could have done better, but I don't mind, You just sort of wasted my precious time, Don't think twice, it's alright' , 
<br />Or  " If you go to the north country town where the wind gets heavy on the border - line, remember me to the one who lives there , she once was a true love of mine/ True love of mine. 
<br />Or. " John Wesley Hardin was a friend of the poor/ He traveled with a gun in every hand/ 
<br />   There is a lot of awkwardness and cornyness in Dylan's lyrics. But there is also a lot of great stuff which was made especially good by the music. 
<br />   For me the lyrics don't stand by themselves alone as powerful enough to be great poetry - but with the melodies the songs they have a  real power to move. 
<br />   I recommend reading the lyrics and knowing them not so much in themselves but as a way of hearing the music with greater joy. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I just received this pretty good-looking book of Bob Dylan's lyrics, a volume which I had been waiting for for many years, ever since I became a Dylan fan in 1998 when I was just 16 years old. After the excitement of receiving the book and giving it a few quick but careful glimpses in the past couple of days, I felt it was appropiate to review the book for the fellow customers.
<br />
<br />Some good things to say about this book:
<br />
<br />First, the book is beautifully presented in a high quality hardcover. It is not a cheap-looking book by any means. Lyrics are sorted chronologically by LP (contemporary non-album tracks from each LP's timeframe are put as if they were "bonus tracks", at the end of the respective albums), respecting the running order of the albums, rather than putting the songs in the order they were written. That's a plus when you're reading the lyrics book while playing the respective record, especially if you are one of those -like myself- who usually have a hard time trying to decipher what Mr. D is singing. Another reviewer complains that this volume is not presenting the songs individually instead of album-by-album, but to me that is definitely not a problem.
<br />
<br />Second, this is a lyrics collection, not a description of them or anything like that. If you're looking for any kind of analysis or lyrics dissection, look elsewhere. This is "just" a lyrics book, and I'm pretty happy for that. Some people have argued that this book is not necessary, because anybody can download the lyrics from the internet. That statement is as reasonable as saying that there's no need to buy Bob's albums because you can download the albums in mp3 format for free. Absurd.
<br />
<br />Third, the lyrics are many times different from the lyrics you hear on the records. That's pretty logical, considering Dylan has rewritten his songs many times throughout his career, even before they appear on the record. That's why they appear here as they were published, and not necessarily as they were recorded. If one version was to be chosen, many of us would go for the songs "as recorded", but maybe Bob thought otherwise. It's not a problem, in my opinion, as the differences are -in most cases- not substantial at all.
<br />
<br />Now, I'll point out a few flaws I found in this set:
<br />
<br />First, the book is very big sized, so it's hard to transport it without damaging the paper that wraps up the hard covers. Even if you take out that wrap, the book is not one you could bring to the bus to read while you are listening to Dylan on your stereo. It's not a big deal after all, since I couldn't think of any alternative solution to this that satisfied me. 
<br />
<br />Second, the albums are supposedly put chronologically by recording date. But the album "Basement Tapes", which was recorded between "Blonde On Blonde" (1966) and "John Wesley Harding" (1967) and released between "Blood On The Tracks" (1975) and "Desire" (1976), is included -unexplainedly- between the albums "New Morning" (1970) and "Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid" (1973). I don't have a clue for this decision. I think this was simply a mistake.
<br />
<br />But, the biggest flaw I saw was that this Lyrics book is criminally incomplete. While it has most of the songs Bob put his name on as a songwriter -alone or with others-, the omissions are unforgivable. To name a few:
<br />--"Got My Mind Made Up", from Bob's album "Knocked Out Loaded", had music from Tom Petty and lyrics written by Dylan and Petty. This song is nowhere to be found on this book. 
<br />--"I Don't Want To Do It", written by Bob and given to George Harrison, was released on the "Porky's Revenge" film soundtrack, as well as on the A-side of a single by Harrison in 1985. However, it was omitted.
<br />--"Jammin' Me", was written by Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Mike Campbell, and it was released on Petty's 1987 album "Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)". It was a hit single, by the way. But it's not here.
<br />--"Walk Out In The Rain", was written by Bob Dylan and Helena Springs, and released on Eric Clapton's "Backless". Where is it? Not on this book.
<br />While these omissions might not seem relevant, I was looking for a COMPLETE BOB DYLAN LYRICS book. That's what I paid for, but many songs were simply omitted, for no particular reason. I could go on with at least half a dozen Dylan-signed compositions with lyrics that are not included. Sad, especially when you can find non-Dylan compositions included on the book, like "Corrina, Corrina". Why would anybody include a Traditional folk song like "Corrina..." in this book? Oh, because it was ARRANGED BY DYLAN. If that made this song eligible for this book, why all the traditional folk songs arranged by Bob from "Good As I Been To You" and "World Gone Wrong" were omitted? Simply because Bob didn't write them. I think that "Corrina, Corrina" was included by mistake, just as all those other Dylan compositions listed above (as well as others) were omitted.
<br />
<br />My veredict: While this release takes many steps forward to become the ultimate edition of this book, by largely updating the 1985 edition, I find it sad to say that this is far from its goal of being the definitive edition of the complete Dylan lyrics, and mainly that's because of a negligent (or lazy) compiler. If you really need to have (almost) all of Bob's written songs printed in one place, elengantly presented, then you will be glad to purchase this. But, when you find that a certain Bob Dylan song you know is missing, remember I warned you about this.</span>

                    <span>While I am very happy to have this book, I am also disappointed.  Reading songs while listening to them I find frequent small differences in the printed lyrics from those on the studio recordings.  For example, in the song "Senor" from Street Legal, the first line goes "Can you tell me where we're headin'" but the printed lyric is "Do you know where we're headin'". One of Dylan's finest lines from the song "Man in the Long Black Coat" is "People don't live or die, people just float." The printed version is "I went down to the river, but I just missed the boat." One could argue that orinal notes or frequent performance better define the songs than the studio recordings, but there should be some introductory note that tells us this.  This book does not identify an editor and has not introductory note. Other than these complaints, I love it!</span>

                    <span>This book contains tons of translated lyrics, from Dylan-speak to common English. If you were as confused as me when you heard the song, "MMrrr Yewwww Kaa Kaaa" or perhaps Dylan's hit song from 1973, "Veelaa Maaa Foo Laa," check out this book. It goes through great lengths to transcribe and convert the fragmented muffled nasal wheezes of Dylan's singing into coherent and easy-to-read prose.  </span>

                    <span>I'm not a native English speaker (moved to the US 20+ years ago) and one of the annoying things of Bob Dylan albums is that, for whatever reason, they don't come with the lyrics to the songs. I'm a big Dylan fan, and as much as I enjoy listening to the albums, I've always wanted to better understand the lyrics. Well, consider that problem solved with this book.
<br />
<br />"Lyrics 1962-2001" is the solution to my problem, a 600 page (hard cover) book, containing the lyrics to all Bob Dylan's songs. The book is arranged album-by-album, and song-by-song within those albums, and contains in addition the words to other songs that were not originally on any album. 
<br />
<br />Bob Dylan towers over the music scene like few others, and his word-crafting has no equal. This book is essential, not just for Bob Dylan fans, but for any serious music lover. I bought this book from Amazon.com, for a mere $27 (S/H included), 40% off the cover price, one of the best bargains ever. "Strongly recommended" doesn't do justice, this is simply essential. </span>
