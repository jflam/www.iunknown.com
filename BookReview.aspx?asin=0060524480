                    <span>Great book.  The thing I really like about this book is that it helps the reader identify all the reasons for why we all get nervous and gives us a blueprint for getting past them and/or working through them.  The nervousness profiles are terrific - I had a presentation a few weeks ago and normally I just "wing it" but this time I realized I didn't know the material as deeply as usual and it was pretty technical. I had a bad experience presenting a few years ago under similar circumstances so I started getting nervous and dreading it. I used the profiles to narrow down my type, followed the recommendations and it worked!  The methods for preparing and organizing are first rate and there's a gold mine of tips of all kinds. The author's real world experiences are often amusing and those of her clients are insightful. The book has a delightful tone that keeps it light and easy even when uncomfortable topics are discussed.  As a senior manager, my responsibility is to guide others to improve and I'm recommending it to my team.  I think just about anyone who speaks or gives presentations could benefit greatly by reading this.</span>

                    <span>This is a very strong tool for those looking to improve their public speaking skills.  The author is evidently very experienced in this area, and she offers very valuable insights into the tools, tricks and methods of success in her profession.<p>One thing I did not like about this book, is that the author continually tries to connect a speaker's anxiety or poor performance to some traumatic episode that occurred in their childhood.  For example, a business executive who, as a child had his parents continually remind him that kids "are to be seen and not heard" had trouble being confident and articulate in front of an audience.  This is great for those who have such experiences, but leaves many of us out in the cold.<p>I have had no such traumatic experiences, but still get anxious before and during a presentation.  Although this "natural anxiety" is not covered in much detail, the author does do a good job explaining how to channel the anxiety into a productive energy, and she does well explaining the importance of rehearsing before presenting.</span>

                    <span>This book is valuable not only for those who have a fear of public speaking, but also for those who wish to come across in a way that is professional and interesting.  In the world of continuing professional education in my own field, dentistry, I often find speakers that know their material, but are boring in terms of their delivery or in the way organize their material.  Also as a speaker myself, I have experienced the challenges of putting together a well crafted presentation. Speak Without Fear addresses the issues of stage presence and performance in terms of how they apply to making presentations.  I highly recommend it for professionals who are interested in taking their skills up several notches.</span>

                    <span>This book is right on.  When you read it you connect with it, no matter what type of speaking or presentations you do or what size groups you are in front of I believe this will help.  I will be giving this book as a gift to a number of people I know who can use the suggestions Ivy makes.  I have read many other business self-help books but this is the first that is so clear and concise and actually fun that you feel you can change what you're doing immediately.  Ivy's friendly style and personal examples makes you think you've known her for many years.</span>

                    <span>They say that we teach what we want to learn but in the case of this book by Ivy Naistadt, the author is obviously teaching what she has already learned. Nothing is more difficult than putting a practical program into plain words that guide a reader step by step from identifying the key blocks to speaking effectively through doing the basic things that remove the blocks. This book is no feel-good bromide. It consists of jazzy anecdotes based on Naistadt's interesting life of acting, speaking professionally, and coaching executives and presents a detailed useful program for translating her experience and insights into action. This book is well written and incredibly helpful, and it actually does what it says it will do, present a total system for becoming a natural confident communicator. If that's what the reader wants, this book is a good place to find it.</span>
