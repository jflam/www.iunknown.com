                    <span>This book really helped me get off the ground with Flash.
<br />It's clearly written and gives you step-by-steps.  Without it, I would have still been at nothing.
<br />The best part is that you can email the author, so it's like having your personal tutor on call.
<br />
<br />One criticism is that Chapter 16 was very confusing, since it seemed to make a quantum leap in difficulty.  But that one shortcoming didn't taint the book's overall value.  I recommend it.</span>

                    <span>This is definitely the best book for getting familiar with Flash. It is well written and easy to follow. Even better, the author is great and responsive. I had a question and he got back with a working answer within an hour!</span>

                    <span>This book is great!  Steps are laid out in a methodical, simple, straight-forward manner.  Easy to follow.  You can tell from the start that the lessons are well planned.  Each section ends with a summary, and question / answer time.
<br />
<br />Do you want to be using Flash right away?  Buy the book.</span>

                    <span>I was always intrested in animation, I realy wanted to make some but unfortunatly I had no programs to make some. Until I saw a program in shop named 'Flash MX', I bought it (the program isnt very expensive for what its worth). But when I runned Flash on my pc I didnt know how to make an animation with it (I had no expierience with working with programs like Flash).
<br />But I bought the book 'Flash MX', and the next 15 minutes I maked already nice animations.
<br />But Flash got some more then only 'animations' it got also a programming language and these language gives you the whole control over the 'movie'.
<br />
<br />you can realy learn Flash MX in minutes with the book from Phillip Kerman (he is the author from this fantastic book).

I highly reccommend this book to anyone, also because of its great price used even when you buy the actionscript one as well!
