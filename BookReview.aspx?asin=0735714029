                    <span>Best layed-out computer book i've ever seen! Beautiful, glossy heavy wieght paper, also. There are about 2 tips for each page. Illustrations look EXACTLY how they look on screen (mac osx). the simplisity of this book is perfect for people like me who are so far jammed up the creative side of their brains that they even walk with a limp! Expert users might complain about some of the tips not being "killer"...
<br />
<br />But, if you're an expert already, why are you reading the book anyhow?! Let the subject learn how to get into the castle from the back door!
<br />
<br />You might need another book if you're learning InDesign CS, but, this one is a keeper! get this one without a dout!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I bought this book in a quick fix attempt to learn Indesign 2.0 at the last minute for a 150 page book layout, with cover.   I only had very short deadline and no time to read big books. While I was still in the bookstore, it answered a question I had about importing excell documents (which I'd consider worth the cost of the book right there).   While developing my layout, I would flip though the book find a great tip and then try it right out.  
<br />
<br />Much of the book still applied to 2.0. The parts that didn't,  really just made me want to upgrade to CS even faster.
<br />
<br />I paid full price for the book at Borders and I would do it again.  I feel it save me about 10-15 hours worth of work on this one project alone.    That's alot of money or free time, depending on how you look at it!

                    <span>I bought this book thinking I would find some shortcuts for ID CS. If you have no idea what you're doing in ID you might have some use from it. However, if you've bought the Visual Quickstart by Sandee Cohen or practically any other book on ID you will bu lucky if you find 4 or 5 undocumented shortcuts. A real ripoff in my opinion. I promptly sent it back for a refund. A lot of pictures; not a lot of information.</span>

                    <span>This was a great buy! I've recently switched from Quark to InDesign (with no official training!) and this book helped a lot. It isn't the most detailed, it's not a bible, but it does deliver the "killer tips" that are so very necessary to working with this program day in & out! Yes, a lot of them are common knowledge, but it was worth the money for the dozen or so that are not to be found anywhere in the help menus, you know the ones that make you giggle as you realize how much time you're gonna save!</span>
