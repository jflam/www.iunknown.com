                <span id="Label1">In 1886 a shy, middle-aged piano tuner named Edgar Drake receives an unusual commission from the British War Office: to travel to the remote jungles of northeast Burma and there repair a rare piano belonging to an eccentric army surgeon who has proven mysteriously indispensable to the imperial design. From this irresistible beginning, <b>The Piano Tuner</b><i> </i>launches its protagonist into a world of seductive loveliness and nightmarish intrigue. And as he follows Drake&#8217;s journey, Mason dazzles readers with his erudition, moves them with his vibrantly rendered characters, and enmeshes them in the unbreakable spell of his storytelling.</span>

                    <span>Please read this book slowly, take your time. Savour every minute of reading and every single page of the book!<P>In 1886 the piano tuner Edgar Drake is summoned to a remote military outpost in the Shan States to tune an 1840 Erard piano. The piano to be tuned belongs to the somewhat eccentric Surgeon-Major Anthony Carroll. Carroll was granted the piano itself as well as to have it tuned by a specialist by the British War Office, because his efforts of bringing peace to that region have proven invaluable to the British Crown.<P>During this fabulously narrated tale the reader is taken on Drake's journey to Burma, via France, the coasts of Africa, Bombay, Allahabad and Benares to the Bay of Bengal and finally to the fictional place of Mae Lwin.<P>The author has found a marvellous way to depict Drake's 5,000 mile-journey to Mae Lwin, the wonders of nature, the way of life in the colonies as well as the mysteries of human nature.<P>Besides dwelling on beauty he points out the differences between Burman and English culture and in a subtle, yet very impressive way the intrusion of the colonial masters into the spirits and lives of their colonial subjects (e.g. setting up military headquarters right next to a pagoda).<P>The coaction between the characters of Edgar Drake, Dr. Anthony Carroll and Khin Myo is stunning and exceptional.<P>The story of the "Man with one story" as well as the little poem about the lotus-eaters have captivated me. I didn't want to finish this book. If I had been in Mae Lwin, I wouldn't have wanted to leave it either.<P>I can nearly guarantee you that you will become a lotus-eater too, once you have started reading this book (you will understand this reference then as well).<P>Result: 5 stars are more than justified for this astonishing debut-novel of such a young man!</span>

                    <span>Halfway through this book it dawned on me: The Piano Tuner is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness through rose-colored glasses. I immediately went to the trade reviews to see who else had caught on, but not one mentioned it. In fact Mason's writing is quite nice, almost poetic, but you'd best like it because the story unfolds slowly. And the tale is so strange it must be true. The author treats us to an unlikely protagnist, Edgar Drake, piano tuner, commissioned by the British War Office to tune a very special piano in the heart of the Burmese jungle. Unlike Conrad's Kurtz, the goal of Drake's journey up the atmospheric Salween river, Doctor Anthony Carrol (a piano-lover and medical doctor in the British Army), wins his natives with kindness rather than horror. Mason gives us a surprising twist for an ending, but I'm not sure it fits his story all that well.</span>

                    <span>Take Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" throw in the movie "The Piano" and add a few other exotic touches, and you've got THE PIANO TUNER. Oh, and also some "Frizcaraldo" (remember that movie?)I'm not knocking this book, but rather trying to get you to understand what it's about. The author treats us to an unlikely protagnist, Edgar Drake, piano tuner, commissioned by the British War Office to tune a very special piano in the heart of the Burmese jungle. Unlike Conrad's Kurtz, the goal of Drake's journey up the atmospheric Salween river, Doctor Anthony Carrol (a piano-lover and medical doctor in the British Army), wins his natives with kindness rather than horror. Mason gives us a surprising twist for an ending. At times I was reminded of either Boyle or perhaps McCrae in the writing style (think BARK OF THE DOGWOOD for the McCrae or perhaps WATER MUSIC for the Boyle). The themes are vastly different, but the words flow like the style of those two writers. I highly recommend this exotic tale, told by a master storyteller.</span>

                    <span>.. it aint one. I was shocked by how poorly written this book was. Maybe I'm missing something. I admit that I abandoned it somewhere just past the halfway point, but it was a bit like leaving a baseball game when a team is up 15 to nil. There wasn't a lot of chance for redemption here. This book read to me exactly like a puppet show, where each voice, and each emotion was just a undisguised projection of the voice of the author. Its as if the characters open their mouths and the exact same voice comes out of each one. Where there is a need for back-story, mysterious story-tellers pop out of the woodwork to expound as neeeded. The protaganist is by turns snide and arrogant or submissive and quiet, without explanation of either. And throughout, the language is so heavy, so full of big, cumbersome words that even the scenes in the daylight seem to be covered with a sort of sticky dark fog. In all, forced and pretentious, randomly detailed, showing very little editorial restraint.</span>

                    <span>I found myself totally drawn into the world of the rather introverted Edgar. Mason's descriptive passages are exquisite--he really takes you to the forgotten London and Burma. At times I had the same feeling I had when watching APOCALYPSE NOW; although this wasn't a "war story" per se, it had the same pull of the overpowering exotic that makes you understand how an outsider can get caught up in an unfamiliar world. Highly recommended.<P>P.S. I wish reviewers didn't feel obligated to reveal every detail of a novel! A review should not be a mini-Cliff's Notes--that really spoils the pleasure for other readers.</span>
