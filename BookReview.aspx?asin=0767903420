                    <span>After reading and enjoying Pitino's "Succeess Is A Choice," I was anxious to read the next installment, "Lead to Succeed." I was surprised at the timing of the publishing of this book considering that it was published shortly after Mr. Pitino's third year of failing to lead the Boston Celtics to the NBA playoffs. As president and coach of the team, Pitino is responsible for choosing and coaching the Celtics players. Therefore, he is to blame for the fact that the team has had a losing season in each of the three seasons that he has been in Boston. It is interesting that Pitino would write a book on successful leadership qualities when he himself has failed in trying to lead the Celtics. This, however, is what makes the book very interesting to read. While Pitino freely admits some, but not all, of the mistakes he has made since joining the Celtics, the solutions he gives to try to amend for his errors do not carry any weight because his solutions have not cured any of the problems he has created. For example, he constantly preaches the power of positive thinking when facing tough times. While it is true that being positive can help a person succeed, no person will succeed if he constantly makes terrible decisions in regards to his/her profession. Making terrible decisions is exactly what Pitino has done with the Celtics and he refuses to admit it. A note to Mr. Pitino: Trying to outwork everybody in sight and keeping a positive attitude will never overcome the negative results form making mistake after mistake in regards to your job.</span>

                    <span>I didn't know much about Rick Pitino until reading his book, now I can see why he's been so successful in his profession. It isn't just accomplishing goals, it's the winning lifestyle that makes results happen that cause this to be a "quality of life" book. Pitino is passionate about what he does and the people with whom he works. He writes of the maturation process he had to endure himself before arriving at a more holistic view of genuine leadership. Such a person views the success of others in their organization as a mark of personal leadership. <P>This book is packed with "behind the scenes" insights on Patino paying his dues. The coach is so right about there being no substitute for experience. Pitino is a highly ethical man also. That theme is consistent throughout the book as well. This one will charge your battery. I give it my "a-ok" endorsement.</span>

I've read several books over the years on business, motivation, and leadership. This book is by far one of the top reads. I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to improve themselves as well as those around them.</span>

                    <span>I just finished Lead to Succeed this a.m and I'm back at amazon to order 3 more for my key employees. This book had common sense ideas that can be related to any business in the growth mode. I'm not a big basketball fan, but I certainly am a fan of the wisdom of Mr. Pitino. The book was a wealth of knowledge and information,very entertaining and a book that I could not put down till I finished. Pass it on, it will encourage anyone to strive to become the best.</span>

                    <span>Coach Pitino's latest book does a good job combining his ideas on leadership and his realities as a basketball coach. While his tenure in Boston was not as successful as he (or the loyal Celtics fans) wished it to be, his thoughts on coaching there are a good read (too bad this book was published before he decided to leave, I would like to know what his current thoughts are). Of course most of this book repeats much of the motivational talk of business gurus, but how much new material has been there every been in this field? I just felt good reading it and in the end that is really what matters (it has been a long time since any boss has inspired me). Good luck in Louisville, Coach.</span>
