                <span id="Label1">In the vast and varied universe of computer books, only a few stand out  as the best in their subject areas. <I>Building Internet Firewalls</I> is one of  those. It's deep, yet carefully focused, so that almost anything you might want  to know about firewall strategies for protecting networks is here. In addition,  there's lots of information on the reasons that we build firewalls in the first  place, which is to say the security risks that come with Internet connectivity.  You'll learn a great deal about Internet services and the protocols that provide  them as you follow this book's recommendations for stifling attacks. <p>  If there's a shortcoming to this book, it's its lack of coverage of the turnkey  firewall products that are becoming popular among home and small-office users.  Emphasis here is on more complicated network defenses that require careful  design and setup--both design and implementation are the order of the day here.  The authors carefully enumerate the threats they see in various situations, go  into some detail on how those threats manifest themselves, and explain what  configuration changes you can make to your perimeter defenses to repulse those  threats. Plenty of illustrations make points about good and bad security  strategies (you want to put the routers <I>here</I> and <I>here</I>, not  <I>here</I> or <I>here</I>). You'll learn a lot by reading this book from cover  to cover, no matter how much experience you have. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Means of protecting private networks from external  security threats. The authors go into detail on attackers' means of exploiting  security holes in common Internet services, and show how to plug those holes or  at least limit the damage that can be done through them. With coverage of Unix,  Linux, and Windows NT, the authors detail their philosophies of firewall design  and general security policy.</span>

                    <span>Every cell in the human body changes completely every seven years, but the underlying essence of the person remains. Similarly, information security has changed dramatically in the same time period, when the authors of this book were writing the first edition, but its essence has remained the same.<P>Topics such as ActiveX, RealVideo, IP version 6, and instant messaging were not even on the horizon when the first edition of this book was released. Now in its overdue second edition, the book covers these important topics and more.<P>Among the many fine security books available-several of which have been reviewed in this column-Building Internet Firewalls is one of the best. It is not just a comprehensive tome on firewalls; the authors take the many aspects of a firewall (for example, policies, protocols, and varied networks) and integrate them into a common framework. This is necessary, since management often equates security with firewalls.<P>Divided into four sections (network security, building firewalls, Internet services, and site security), the bulk of the book is built around the sections on Internet services and building firewalls. In these 20 chapters, the authors detail the many aspects of a firewall. Critical concepts such as firewall technologies, architectures, intermediary protocols, and directory services are discussed in detail. The authors do a splendid job of defining the various types of firewalls and exploring their advantages and weaknesses.<P>This book is remarkable for detailing the components of an effective information security system that are conferred via a firewall. Anyone needing a grasp on the often-confusing topic of firewalls need look no further.<P>This review originally appeared in the June issue of Security Management magazine</span>

                    <span>This second edition goes into great detail on how to build and maintain a firewall. It briefly discusses the attacks earlier this year on various well-known web sites and notes that one effective way of (if not toally stopping) slowing down these types of attacks is by use of a firewall.<P>In the first section, it talks about the reasons for having a firewall and security strategies. The second section (Building Firewalls) consists of several chapters and describes topics like packet filtering, firewall architectures and design, proxy systems and bastion hosts. I gleaned a lot of good information from this section alone.<P>The next section contains chapters describeing how to protect against attackers invading any Internet services (World Wide Web, email & netnews, FTP, IRC, DNS, games, etc). The last section describes methods to keep your network secure, such as settinp up security policies, how to maintain your firewall once it's up and running, and how to deal with a "break-in." There's also three appendices containing various information about firewall tools, mailing lists and newsgroups.<P>All in all, an excellent book on building and maintaining a firewall.</span>

                    <span>Okay for discussing general ideas, but not much real world use. There's not a lot to be had from this book. They cover too much and discuss too much generalized topics and never really touch on any real-world working, intelligent firewall fules and uses. Just too much generalized fluff. You'll get more from a 'man page' on iptables and be able to put it to use, at least, compared to this. It is interesting, but there's too much generalization and fluff and not much someone can *use* from it.</span>

                    <span>bought this book after I brought up my own internet facing servers. coming from a networking background, the internet was an open space for me not until I read this book. This book tells you what kinds of security threats are out there, why and how you can protect your sites while still running all the services.<BR>very interesting and humorous too.

                    <span>I purchased this book in hopes to have a reference guide for Iptables/Netfilter or even CheckPoint, but was sadly misled. The book covers only theory of how to build a firewall, while sighting no practical examples. It covers protocols, ports, and common types of security threats, but again gives no practical examples of how to write chains, tables or rules to prevent these attacks. If your a newbie to system administration you will learn quite a bit from this book, but if your a system admin such as I am looking for a reference guide THIS IS NOT IT</span>
