                <span id="Label1">For Web developers, one of the most exciting features of Microsoft(r) Internet Explorer 4.0 is Dynamic HTML, a powerful Microsoft extension of standard HTML that brings a new level of interactivity to content developers' Web sites. And INSIDE DYNAMIC HTML is the technical bible on this important new innovation. It's for Web developers, sophisticated content providers, users of JavaScript and other scripting tools, and anyone else who wants the lowdown on this widely embraced approach to a livelier Web. The book assumes proficiency with a scripting language and supplies an abundance of examples.</span>

                    <span>Inside Dynamic HTML provides great insight on all the nuances of the language/object model. Only someone that had been involved in the drafting of the DHTML specification could write about each topic with such an in-depth understanding of the subject matter. Copius Javascript examples of major language features are found in each chapter. The CD-ROM contains an HTML Help searchable reference of the book's text. The insideDHTML web site has lots of working examples and code to download to complement the book. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is serious about learning Microsoft's implementation of DHTML.</span>

                    <span>Great how to's, demo's and explanations. Covers new html extentions, new browser object, dynamic content, dynamic positioning, and cascading style sheets. Most examples are done with JavaScript rather than VBScript and include variations and tips to make code degradable to older browsers. The CD rom, included, is worth the price of the book with tons of great working examples and sample code.</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for quite some time know and I still refer to it often. Scott Isaacs, one of the men representing Microsoft for the W3C at the time of the books writing and one of the creators of DHTML, does an outstanding job of introducing you to DHTML in a very easy to understand way. If you are familiar with JavaScript and HTML and need a better understanding of how to combine the two to produce interactive webpages this book is for you. While this book is a bit dated it does an excellent job of laying the foundation for the current state of DHTML. The lessons you learn from this book can be extended by visiting the authors website, probably one of THE best websites available today on cross-browser DHTML! This book is a definite buy!</span>

                    <span>This book has a lot of fancy Java Script, but to those of us who refuse to write anything compatible with Netscrape (in other words, us VB Scripters), this book is difficult to read. You have to translate the miles of JScript into VB Script. Not much fun. VI Web Technologies reference is a useful daily reference, as well as MSDN Scripting Technologies web site.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The only word I wanna say is that this book is definitively useful. For those Netscape browsers, the DHTML will not affect the layout of the page at all. If your browser doesn't like DHTML, that's your problem, not our technology's problem. Think about this: If you have no feet, there is no use for shoes. But we cannot deny the fact that shoes are useful.</span>
