                <span id="Label1">In this tenth-anniversary edition of the much-loved Biblioholism: The Literary Addiction, author Tom Raabe takes a humorous look at the all-consuming love of books and has updated the information within by discussing the ever-mutating new E-landscape and its effects on fellow biblioholics everywhere. Have you ever awakened the morning after a book-buying spree and been unable to remember how many volumes you bought or how much you spent? Have you ever been reprimanded or fired for reading on the job? Have you ever purchased or rented additional living space just for your books? If you answer "yes" to any or all of these questions, don't worry. You are not alone. Your complete recovery awaits you-just buy one more book!</span>

                    <span>This book is not for the novice. Not only is it for book owners, but also for friends and love ones who cannot comprehend why someone would want to own hundreds, even thousands of books. This book is funny and true-to-life, and offers sage advice to book owners on how to deal with their passion. I knew my fiance and I were compatible when his booklist rivaled mine, AND did not include too many duplicates for when the time comes when we will eventually combine our collections. Wedding gifts...well...books are always nice!</span>

                    <span>I am 23 years old and must confess I am a Biblioholic. I have a 10 page list of books I would love to own. My college friends think I'm weird because I'd rather spend a night with a book than to go out drinking. I'm so very glad to find out I'm not alone anymore!! Oh, my mom actually has had to sit me down to discuss my book buying habits. My reply??--At least I'm not a drug addict! (She couldn't say much to that) Amazon.com does not help my addiction with their horrendous ONE-CLICK ordering! AGGGHHH! For those of you who have been in similar situations, this book is most definitely for you.</span>

                    <span>...about this book from the head of my English department at college a year ago. She's a book addict. I'm a worse one. I lost count of my library after hitting 10,000. I buy books far, far faster than I can read them (last count: 823). I keep a master list on MS Excel of all the books I want to buy 'some day'. Current total: 1714. I have no shelf space left. No closet space left. No room in the basement or attic. And there's no 12-step group for biblioholics.<P>This book was the perfect thing to make my husband read to show him I wasn't the only book addict in the world. The fact that it was hiliarious didn't hurt, either.</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I recommend to friends who already have "too many books" (as if that were possible!). While humorous, Raabe's book also gives historical insight into people who make most current avid collectors pale by comparison. And he shows the range of reasons why people acquire volumes, whether to boost one's social standing, to admire, to eat, or even to read. Amazingly, while I've lent my copy several times, it's always come back (maybe the chapter about sticky-fingered borrowers tweaks consciences).</span>
