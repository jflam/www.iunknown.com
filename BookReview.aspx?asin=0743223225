                    <span>Lots of good, practical information in here. The author offers an alternate to the USDA food pyramid, one that emphasizes whole-grain foods, healthy oils, lots of veggies; and de-emphasizes the convenience foods we've come to love -- refined and processed carbs, hydrogenated oils, etc. He also stresses daily exercise and weight control, of course.<P>I enjoyed learning about the differences between the types of oils and how they affect the body. After reading the book, I felt challenged to do better (NOT guilt-ridden into the false solace found in snack food). I've switched over to brown rice, which is sooo much healthier, and whole-grain breads. That last one is tricky, by the way: the book points out that we need to carefully read labels to be sure the first ingredient is whole-grain flour (wheat, rye, whatever). A lot of the wheat breads out there are not as healthful as they'd like us to believe...<P>The book is a wealth of information and also offers sample menus and recipes, as well as suggestions for further reading. Some of the charts were eye-openers and can help for when planning future grocery lists.<P>At 185 pages (not counting recipes and other extras), this was a fast and easy read, but I took my time because there was so much ground covered. I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>This Harvard / Willett book redresses some of the major errors in the USDA food pyramid which failed to actually promote people's health. <P>STEP 1 FORWARD: This book steers you away from the high "glycemic index" sugar and starch foundation of the old pyramid which helped promote adult diabetes, blood circulation problems and heart disease. Instead, vegetables, fruits, whole grain foods and some oils become part of the new foundations of the proposed food pyramid.<P>STEP 2 FORWARD: The new pyramid includes "Multiple Vitamins for Most" and Alcohol in Moderation (unless contraindicated). <P>STEP 3 FORWARD: Harvard's new pyramid rehabilitates an oil based diet by making mono-unsaturates (olive and canola) and OMEGA-3 poly-unsaturates keys to good heath. ALL scientists having studied OMEGA-3 oils (of which fish, canola, flax and unhydrogenated soybean are main sources) DO AGREE with the need to increase this healthy oil which appears, at the very least, to lower sudden heart deaths and that may well reduce inflammation (arthritis, etc.) and possibly cancers.<P>BACKWARD 1 STEP, and this is extremely unfortunate since most fat-scientists also agree about this point: an excessive intake of the other poly-unsaturate, OMEGA-6 linoleic (found in corn, cottonseed, sunflower, safflower and again in soy) may well promote inflammatory (arthritis, heart) diseases, and cancer. I'd refer the reader to the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids, ISSFAL ... recommending a maximum intake of omega-6 linoleic of only 6.7 grams -as the average American and most Europeans already get twice that much. <P>While Willett (and the President and Fellows of Harvard College, to whom copyright) report on this potential danger of omega-6 (page 77), they nevertheless include corn and sunflower, some main offenders, in the very base of their new pyramid. Not only that, they propose that reducing omega-6 oils from current amounts "is likely to wipe out many of the gains" in preventing heart disease... This omega-6 position has Harvard relatively isolated since it is without the support of clinical trials. The blanket recommendation of all polyunsaturated oils, if ISSFAL is correct, may well violate the medical principle of "first not to do harm". This, and the continued blaming of saturated fat and cholesterol [also without clinical evidence in support] is truly a superb opportunity missed to incorporate the important last decade of research about fats.<P>This is one problem with statistics and not biology based nutritional advice. With those comments in mind and considering that a high intake of omega-6 poly-unsaturates like corn and sunflower oils may be dangerous [and don't raise good cholesterol; HDL, page 61], this book is a worthwhile read that makes an important contribution to healthy eating and to the battle against diabetes and industrial hydrogenation [trans fats]. ...</span>

                    <span>About a year ago, I decided to try Dr. Willett's sensible advice. I needed to lose weight, but I was especially concerned with improving my cardiovascular health, and Dr. Willett's credentials in that regard are excellent. <P>At first, I was dismayed that the pounds were not melting away, as other diets promise (and other reviewers are right: this is NOT a diet book). But I was surprised to note that my mood improved; no more highs and lows from refined food. And I was getting to eat all kinds of delicious stuff, including (gasp!) lots and lots of whole-grain carbohydrates. Then, several weeks in, the weight started coming off--ultimately, over thirty pounds of it. Over the last year, my weight has also been more stable than ever in my adult life. When I depart from the Way of Willett (as I do often--fruitcake at Christmas, chocolates at Valentine's, Peeps at Easter, you get the idea), my weight does not spike as it would've in the past. The weight has very easily stayed off. Of course, my cardiovascular health has improved more than I could've hoped (LDL=59, HDL=53).<P>Several reviewers have used the phrase "life-changing" to describe this book. That's a tall order, but in my case, it fits: although I am amazed to find myself writing it (I'm highly skeptical of books in this category), this book changed my life.</span>

                    <span>This is one book I would recommend to anyone who aspire to eat better. The author does not in any way prescribes a specific diet, but rather gives solid advice on which foods to embrace and which foods to minimize based on scientific reasoning. This way after reading this book, you have the choice of making either drastic changes to your diet or easy ones, as per your own discretion. <BR><BR>Would have given this book five stars, had it touched more upon the everyday processed food we eat/drink and elaborated on their nutritional content.</span>
