                <span id="Label1">In 1981, Marilynne Robinson wrote <I>Housekeeping</I>, which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and became a modern classic.  Since then, she has written two pieces of nonfiction: <I>Mother Country</I> and <I>The Death of Adam</I>. With <I>Gilead</I>, we have, at last, another work of fiction.  As with <I>The Great Fire</I>, Shirley Hazzards's return, 22 years after <I>The Transit of Venus</I>, it was worth the long wait. Books such as these take time, and thought, and a certain kind of genius. There are no invidious comparisons to be made.  Robinson's books are unalike in every way but one: the same incisive thought and careful prose illuminate both.<p>  The narrator, John Ames, is 76, a preacher who has lived almost all of his life in Gilead, Iowa. He is writing a letter to his almost seven-year-old son, the blessing of his second marriage. It is a summing-up, an apologia, a consideration of his life.  Robinson takes the story away from being simply the reminiscences of one man and moves it into the realm of a meditation on fathers and children, particularly sons, on faith, and on the imperfectability of man. <p>  The reason for the letter is Ames's failing health. He wants to leave an account of himself for this son who will never really know him. His greatest regret is that he hasn't much to leave them, in worldly terms. "Your mother told you I'm writing your begats, and you seemed very pleased with the idea. Well, then. What should I record for you?" In the course of the narrative, John Ames records himself, inside and out, in a meditative style. Robinson's prose asks the reader to slow down to the pace of an old man in Gilead, Iowa, in 1956. Ames writes of his father and grandfather, estranged over his grandfather's departure for Kansas to march for abolition and his father's lifelong pacifism. The tension between them, their love for each other and their inability to bridge the chasm of their beliefs is a constant source of rumination for John Ames.  Fathers and sons.  <p>  The other constant in the book is Ames's friendship since childhood with "old Boughton," a Presbyterian minister. Boughton, father of many children, favors his son, named John Ames Boughton, above all others. Ames must constantly monitor his tendency to be envious of Boughton's bounteous family; his first wife died in childbirth and the baby died almost immediately after her. Jack Boughton is a ne'er-do-well, Ames knows it and strives to love him as he knows he should.  Jack arrives in Gilead after a long absence, full of charm and mischief, causing Ames to wonder what influence he might have on Ames's young wife and son when Ames dies.  <p>  These are the things that Ames tells his son about: his ancestors, the nature of love and friendship, the part that faith and prayer play in every life and an awareness of one's own culpability. There is also reconciliation without resignation, self-awareness without deprecation, abundant good humor, philosophical queries--Jack asks, "'Do you ever wonder why American Christianity seems to wait for the real thinking to be done elsewhere?'"--and an ongoing sense of childlike wonder at the beauty and variety of God's world.<p>  In Marilynne Robinson's hands, there <I>is</I> a balm in Gilead, as the old spiritual tells us. <I>--Valerie Ryan</I></span>

                    <span>for myself anyway. This book takes some time to get into, but once you are, it is impossible to put down. Forgiveness seems to be at the top of the list for this book. I agree, although deep in thought and reflection, at times there were amusing parts. 
<br />
<br />I could see the grandfather with his one eye. This book painted such a beautiful picture this reader found myself lost in images for several hours. This book makes you reflect on yourself and brought me to think for hours, and probably will stay with me for quite awhile.
<br />
<br />I thought the book was going in one direction, but turned out to be something else completely different and I could hear our narrator breathe a sigh of relieve at the same time.

<br />You won't want to miss out on this amazing book!</span>

                    <span>I was eager to read "Gilead" based on the positive reviews and the Pulitizer Prize.  Admittedly, the writing is beautiful, and there are some profound thoughts the author shares.  But the book is boring, lacks plot, and for all the writing, lacks important characterization.  For example, it is obvious that Ames' wife is younger and uneducated.  But we don't know where she is from, or how she got to Gilead.  Rather than leaving the reader hungry for more, the slo-o-ow pace and lack of pertinent information about the characters just left me frustrated.  The author also over-used some of the better images, such as the "communion" that Ames received from his father.  The image was interesting the first time, but Ames then references it again-and again-and again.  It was less a novel than the musings of the character.  A disappointment from what is obviously a good writer.  </span>

                    <span>Last January, I read Time Magazine's endorsement of this novel, and I couldn't wait to read it. I immediately went out and bought it even though my semester was about to begin, and I knew I wouldn't be able to read it right away. It just seemed like the perfect book for me to read though. I'm currently in graduate school for English and am leaning toward jumping fields into the seminary. A literary novel by such a wonderful writer about a clergyman just seemed awfully compelling for me. Robinson was going to be combining the my two areas of interest--literature and theology. Of course, I didn't get to read the novel throughout the busy semester, and in the meantime, it picked up the Pulitzer. Needless to say, my expectations for the novel were extraordinarily high by the time I god around to reading it; I feared they would be too high. I read the novel last week, though, and those expectations weren't nearly too high. They really couldn't be; Gilead is a perfect novel. 
<br />
<br />The prose is lovely; there's not a word out of place. And the images are so beautiful. This isn't a long novel, but I read it slowly because I wanted to allow these images to soak in. I reread passage after passage. The characterizations are also splendid. I've been sick of the anti-hero for a long time now, and it is wonderful to read about a character who is a good man, struggling to be better. John Ames is a truly authentic character and certainly one of my favorites in literature. There is even an enormous emotional tug at the end of the novel. Some of the other reviewers have complained about a lack of plot. In ways, that's true. The book, until the end, is primarily John Ames's daily observations. It's just not focused on the plot. I don't, however, see how this is a problem. If you're looking for Michael Crichton, this probably isn't the book to read. Gilead is the book the read, however, if you're interested in compassionate characters, lucid prose, and some truly wise observations on life. There are even a few emotional moments as well if you keep going. Lastly, there are a number of moments of theological insight in the book if one is looking for them. It's, by no means, essential for the reading experience, but I do think that a little knowledge of narrative theology and liberation theology does enhance the reading of the novel.
<br />
<br />Overall, Gilead was a superb novel. I already rank it among my all-time favorites, and I plan to read it again soon.</span>

                    <span>I'd read several reviews and one excerpt before receiving the novel for Christmas. I came to it, therefore, with high expectations. They were not disappointed. Gilead is a beautiful novel in every way, writing, character development, plot development, and wisdom. Robinson knows her characters and loves them. Being a Christian clergyperson I am aware that people like me are often depicted as being hypocrites or wolves or otherwise deeply troubled and ineffective. In addition to its other merits, which are significant, Gilead offers a glimpse into the life of a Christian pastor. He is not perfect. He does not offer cheap grace or wisdom, but struggles with knowing what to say when he must say something. His faith does not protect him from the world, but gives him a sense of orientation which helps make sense of that world. Gilead can likewise serve to orient the reader, reminding her that good, faithful people do exist. Even among the clergy.</span>

                    <span>     I initially read this work before the Pulitzer was announced. It was one of the selections in one of the book groups I belong to (see our Listmania list here at Amazon!) and I had no idea of its author or her previous works. I just sat down and read it. 
<br />
<br />One thing I will say is that there is such a totality of depiction of character, presence in dialogue that it's near perfection. The first 100 pages are gorgeous but--- then it all limps along for about 80 pages (what is it about many books out there today that sag in the middle section?) Anyway--I got through that middle part, trusting that this author would pick up again and I was right. The last 100 pages are amazing. The fine perceptions, the vivid descriptions are masterful. 
<br />
<br />Some in our group gave up in that mid-section and felt the story would fall apart--I say: I'm glad I read it all the way through because Ms. Robinson redeems this story, and yes, beautifully. So some reluctant readers may try hanging in there. So good, but also recommend: "The Autobigraphy of God", "Empire Falls", among others.
