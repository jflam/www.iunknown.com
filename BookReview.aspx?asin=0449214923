                    <span>Simply a classic that will stand the test of time. I learnt a great deal about success principles especially "master mind alliance" and "organized knowledge".
<br />
<br />It was after reading this book that I started to venture out of my comfort zone to pursue my dreams and goals. One of successes I've had was in creating my own info-product and marketing it online.

                    </div>
                    <span>I'm not sure how I was ever so blessed, but Dr. Napoleon Hill worked for me the last two years of his life - or, more accurately - he was "given to me" for that special period of time.
<br />
<br />Here's how it happened:
<br />
<br />My boss at the time, William Penn Patrick, had been named by Dr. Hill as one of the six most important people in the 20th Century. Bill, in turn, paid Dr. Hill some amount of money(?) to be my personal advisor. Thank God!
<br />
<br />Although Dr. Hill was, by that time, physically frail, he was still as mentally sharp as ever. And, as a result, of immeasurable help to me - - who was, at that time, just an immature 28 year-old kid.
<br />
<br />To this day - 40 years after the first time I read it - I still start reading "Think and Grow Rich" on Jaunuary 1st of every year. And, whenever someone asks me how/why I've been so successful in selling/life, Napoleon Hill and his classic book, "Think and Grow Rich," are still among the first reasons I give.
<br />
<br />Even now, after all these years, rarely do I conduct a sales training seminar for "The Closers" series, or do a coaching/ consulting sales training session, without refering to Dr. Hill and what he taught me. Translation: Buy the book! 
<br />
<br />Note: You may have noticed that all of my book reviews carry "5 Star" ratings (*****). But that's not the sign of a "soft reviewer." I only review books to which I can honestly give a "5 Star" rating. You may assume, therefore, that any sales training/self-improvement book without my "5 Star" rating is either something less that "5 Star," or I simply haven't gotten to it yet . . . and there are certainly plenty of those!

                    <span>I'm referring to the audio here.... It's awesome! Just to hear the guy's shrill voice carrying on like that is a huge treat. I was delighted to hear Mr. Hill's stories, told in first person singular, by a man who met commercial giants like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford and the like in person.

                    <span>This book will give you almost everything you need to think and be someone who is rich short of an actually business plan. It works with changing the inner game of wealth with in you. 
<br />
<br />The inner game of "you" is the biggest obstacle that keeps people from having the wealth and life they want. This book does a great job freeing you from the constraints and limitations of your self.
<br />
<br />With one catch. What is your purpose? If you are not fulfilling your purpose you will probably never be wealthy. All you will have is struggle and effort with no real results. When you find what your purpose in life is and make money in a way that helps fulfill your purpose, it will be much easier to be wealthy.
<br />
<br />How do you find your purpose? The simplest way is, what are you most passionate about? What really lights you up and "makes" you happy? That is a huge clue as to what your purpose is. You can also ask your inner knowing, God, your higher self or whatever you want to call "it". Ask it for signs, for clear definitive, there is no doubt signals of what your purpose is. Then watch for those signals. 
<br />
<br />Once you know your purpose apply what you learn in this book and wealth will more than likely follow.
<br />
<br />Don't also fall into the biggest trap of wealth. Many people spend their time and health to get wealth only to then spend all the rest of the time and wealth to get health. A great book to help you easily keep your health as you are building your wealth is The Creator's Manual for Your Body. </span>
