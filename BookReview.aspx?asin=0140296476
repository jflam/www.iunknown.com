                    <span>This book is about the history of zero, from ancient times to modern concepts.  It's quite interesting and encompasses a lot of mathematics and philosophy as well as a bit of physics.  
<br />
<br />Although the book reads well, is nicely documented, and extensively researched, the author has a style that I found aggravating; his frequent use of poetic hyperbole.  This limits the book's value for someone unfamiliar with basic concepts in mathematics and physics. 
<br />
<br />I'm not sure why Seife choose this style.  There seems to be a movement (hopefully short lived) among science writers to dress up science and mathematics in poetic, flowery language.  Whatever the reason, science has good reason to use strict meanings for words and a disciplined approach to scientific concepts.  When authors poetically use words in technically incorrect ways they can make the prose pretty, but they often create confusion.
<br />
<br />For example, Saif says "Zero and infinity are eternally locked in a struggle to engulf all the numbers.  Like a Manichaean nightmare, the two sit on opposite poles of the number sphere, sucking numbers in like tiny black holes." [p. 145]
<br />
<br />From a mathematical point of view this is pure gibberish.  If one's intent is to educate others about mathematics, such poetic hyperbole is not only useless, but counter productive as well.  For folks who don't already know a bit about mathematics, Seife's book is as likely to confuse as to educate.  For those who already understand the concepts, the poetry might be pleasing, but from an educational point of view the hyperbole found throughout this book is a definite stumbling block.
<br />
<br />Another problem I had with this book is the way Seife misstates some key aspects in modern science.  For example, on page 171 he asserts the classical definition of a vacuum: "The vacuum, by definition, has nothing in it - no particles, no light, nothing."  He then describes the quantum mechanical view of the vacuum, and the zero-point energy.  Part of this explanation includes a nice description of the Casimir effect [p. 172], which is a measurement of the literal existence of the "virtual" particles predicted by Quantum Mechanics.  What these experiments show is that these "virtual" particles actually exist, and can be detected by the force they exert on closely spaced metal plates.  This is actually a beautiful example of how science changed our concept of the vacuum.  Classically, we thought of the vacuum as having "nothing in it," but Quantum Mechanics tells us that the classical vacuum cannot exist.  But even after his nice explanation of the Casimir effect, Seife goes and spoils it with this absurd statement:
<br />
<br />"Casimir realized that he had felt the force of nothing." [p. 172] "This is the force of the vacuum, a force produced by nothing at all.  This is the Casimir effect."
<br />
<br />It's as if someone asserted that the space around us has "nothing in it," and then rejoices when the wind touches his face, and runs off spouting "I've felt the force of nothing."  What the Casimir effect teaches us is that what we thought was "nothing at all" really is something, and that calling them "virtual" particles is just as silly as early mathematicians who called the square root of negative numbers "imaginary."  
<br />
<br />There are other mistakes as well.  For example, on page 178 he says: "The speed of light is the ultimate speed limit; you cannot reach it, much less exceed it.  Nature has defended itself from an unruly zero."  
<br />
<br />But this simply isn't true.  Even a casual reader knows that the statement "you cannot reach it" is wrong.  After all, photons travel at the speed of light all the time.  Furthermore, scientists have known for years that, given the right materials, both the phase velocity and the group velocity of light can exceed the speed of light in a vacuum [Optics and Photonics News, June 2002].  All this is consistent within the framework of relativity, but Seife's hyperbole is likely to mislead the novice.  Indeed, recent experiments showing these phenomena have resulted in all sorts of pundits on the Internet claiming that relativity had been falsified.  
<br />
<br />By getting all wound up with poetic hyperbole about nature "[defending] itself from an unruly zero" the author has, I fear, unwittingly contributed to the confusion of non-scientists about the science of relativity.
<br />
<br />I don't mean to give the impression that this is a bad book.  I actually found most of it readable and pleasant.  I enjoyed the historical aspects and appreciated how the author illustrates the influence of philosophy, and especially religion, in either advancing or retarding cultural acceptance of the concept of zero.  I thought he did a particularly nice job of explaining the development of the calculus, and how the concept of zero played its part.  As usual, the primary distractions were related to his use of poetic hyperbole, as well as careless analogies.  For example, on page 126 he writes:
<br />
<br />"... using calculus was as much an act of faith as declaring a belief in god."
<br />
<br />This absurd statement was almost certainly made without thinking.  After all, even though early mathematicians could not explain why the calculus worked - at least not with rigorous logic - they could demonstrate that it *did* work.  Furthermore, anyone could use it.  A person didn't have to believe in calculus or work themselves into an emotional frenzy to calculate the volume of a sphere.  The same cannot, of course, be said of god.
<br />
<br />This could have been a really great book.  The subject matter and story of zero are fascinating.  Unfortunately, Seife uses too many analogies that are either poor, extreme, or misleading.  And his persistent tendency toward exaggeration was a real distraction for me.  For these reasons I'd not recommend the book to someone not already somewhat knowledgeable about mathematics and physics - I think it would be too confusing.  For those who can read between the lines of poetic hyperbole, though, I think the book is worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>In fact, the author goes on so many fanciful tangents, I was actually surprised that he didn't mention that zero stars are not allowed in the Amazon rating scheme, because it would crash the whole system. And that's pretty much the tone of this breezy math/science/history book: The number zero or the concept of zero or the acknowledgment of zero challenges, frightens, destroys, and generally wreaks havoc wherever it appears, and, at the same time, the number zero is necessary and important, both in math and in the real world. Frankly, I was disappointed in this little book, though at times it can be charming and there is some interesting history. The book just didn't live up to the hype about the "danger" of zero. I wanted excitement and adventure; I got the history of an interesting number. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had "zero" expectations. </span>

                    <span>If you think Zero is nothing then you might be right till you understand that nothing took centuries for man to discover and more centuries will go before we completly understand it. This book is a great work from Charles which goes from 300 BC to big bang and "Black Holes". I believe his great work could have been extended to ohter sides of zero like why is zero written as "O' ... why are heavenly bodies round and why mathematically area of circle is greater than Square which is greater than a triangle  while the circumfrence of circle could be equal to parameter of Square which could be equal to parameter of a triangle.... as we know this is because the figure with highest number of sides will have maximum area and in case of circle the number of sides is infinite ... nothing has infinity inside !! The spiritual aspect too of zero needs more investigation ... All the best to the readers of this book for it has so many thought provoking information.. enjoy "Zero" and you might discover nothing with infinite hue of colors...</span>

                    <span>ZERO: THE BIOGRAPHY OF A DANGEROUS IDEA is a book about literally nothing (thankfully, no Seinfeld references).  It's a non-fiction book dealing with some concepts that the layman may find difficult.  However, it's told with enough clarity and wit that the reader should never feel overwhelmed by the mathematical and scientific terminology.  Charles Seife does a fine job of balancing the explanations with the investigations.  
<br />
<br />I really enjoyed reading this book, though I should point out that I already liked mathematical topics beforehand.  Not that I was particularly gifted in mathematics in school, but the fun thing about reading books like this is that one can still think about and ponder the concepts without having to spend several hours a day doing repetitive busywork.  
<br />
<br />Seife delves deep into the origins of zero.  I found it fascinating to see exactly how some cultures simply had no need of zero and how others came to the idea with much resistance.  The religious, philosophical, mathematical and scientific ramifications of this discovery are discussed and never fail to be intriguing.  
<br />
<br />Although zero is what got on the cover and in the title, infinity plays a large part too.  The book goes on a short history of major paradigm changes in philosophy, math and physics, pointing out where zero and infinity played major roles in tearing down old schools of thought and building new ones.  Zero and infinity complement each other, and the history of zero would be incomplete without demonstrating how contemporaneous theories of infinity influenced it.
<br />
<br />I should also mention the book's tone.  Although most people wouldn't think of a math text as a jolly read, this one would defy those expectations.  You have to admire any book that includes the sentence: "See appendix A for a proof that Winston Churchill was a carrot."
<br />
<br />Of course, humor and the whimsical flavor are only the icing.  I'll remember a lot of the pure information presented.  Some of it is meticulously analyzed, while some facts are just casually offered.  Although this is a relatively small book, it feels very dense (in the best possible way).  There's a lot here.
<br />
<br />I applaud Seife's research and presentation.  While it would probably be difficult to make such interesting concepts boring, the writing here is anything but dry.  This is the perfect gift for those of us with an interest in math, but without the intense background needed to survive a more mathematician-focused tome.</span>

                    <span>Charles Seife has written an excellent book on the concept of zero.  An idea that had been taken for granted for years.  No one really understand the meaning of the value of the concept of zero at first, but once contemplated, the concept is quite ingenious.  
<br />
<br />I thought Seife did a very admirable job introducing the concept, following along on the chronology and explaining why it was such a devious and subversive concept to the church and to philosophy in general.  I found his explanations lucid and clear and the history is quite interesting.  The chapter on projective geometry was particularly enlightening.
<br />
<br />Where he really shines is when he coupled zero with infinity.  I have always had a real problem with the relativity concept, even when I was studying physics.  But Seife does an excellent job explaining all of the ideas.  Where he falters is where he tries to make the connection between the numbers with the theories of modern physics, perhaps it is the problem with the concept of superstrings that bogs the narrative down into the morass of incomprehention, but the narrative does bog down when it enters this section.  Since Brian Green has written a much bigger and thicker book on the subject of superstrings, I would hazard to guess that the fault does not lie with Seife but with the subject, which is, by the way, a sub-area of the book, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Even if no one understands the connection between modern physics and zero, the book is a rewarding read.</span>
