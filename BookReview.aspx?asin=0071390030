                    <span>Geez, what a great, great book. What a great story and what a great life. Don Zimmer is the last of the best generation of ball players, the ones who played because they loved the game and focused on it all the time. It is a major loss that he's still not on a bench somewhere imparting his wisdom. This is by far my favorite baseball book and made me feel young again. I mean, who doesn't love the Zim? One thing though, while reading it. Major League Baseball should give the wives a pension too for all the support they give their husbands over the years. Just buy the book, I promise you, you won't be sorry.</span>

                    <span>A summary of my book is about Don Zimmer's life.  Don zimmer was a professional baseball player.  Don Zimmer is now the bench coach for the new York Yankees.  People consider Don Zimmer a Baseball mastermind, but he disagrees he quoted in his book that if he was a baseball mastermind he wouldn't have hit a 257 batting average.  But I think he is because you can tell that he knows what he is talking about from reading the book.  Bill madden (author) Wrote about all the important things that happened in his life from he was born to now.  He considers himself as an average baseball player only because he had a 257 career batting average, but he is an a lot better player then average.  He played with Jackie Robinson (the first African American player to enter the Major leagues.  He played in the pros for a long time and he had excellent experience so when he tells a big leaguer something they better listen because he knows what hes talking about.<br>	I enjoyed reading "ZIM" He gave the readers good tips and I know he gives the Yankees great tips.  This book was probably my favorite book that I ever have read because it was really interesting when he told stories about times in his life.  I also like the book because he loves baseball and so do I.<br>	By,<br>            K.C</span>

                    <span>After reading Zim: A Baseball Life, I was not surprised by the things that happened with Don Zimmer in the 2003 post-season. He's a tough old guy who knows what he thinks, and he has his own reasons to be upset at a pitcher who throws at people's heads (Zimmer was once nearly killed by a pitched ball). Zimmer is willing to own up to his mistakes, and he is the one guy who made a public apology after the incident with Pedro Martinez. It's also not surprising that he threatened to quit because of Steinbrenner's treatment of the coaching staff - the book has several examples of Zimmer leaving jobs when he felt he wasn't being treated right.<p>Zimmer finds something nice to say about most of the people he's worked with, except for Bill Lee. He hates Bill Lee, who named him The Gerbil. Lee is a counterculture type, the sort I would expect to get under Zimmer's skin. I was disappointed but not surprised to learn that Zimmer finds Bill Lee to be not just insufferable, but almost sub-human.</span>

                    <span>I never was a big Don Zimmer fan until I saw the event that led to the caption of this book. I watched the game where he got hit in the head with a ball, and then came back out in a pith helmet. From that moment on, I was a Zimmer fan (as I am a Torre fan, even if I'm not a "Yankee" fan). Anyway, this book is a good read - Of course, I skipped to the chapter on his year or so as a Texas Rangers manager, which was my primary interest in reading the book. However, it's a lot more than that. If you get a chance, pick it up. It's good stuff.</span>
