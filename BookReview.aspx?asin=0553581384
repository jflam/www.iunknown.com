                <span id="Label1"><b>Berlin, January 1945.</b><br><br>The war draws to a close, but the fight for a vanquished city -- and for history -- is just beginning.<br><br>In the final months of the war in Europe, the last act of a five-year conflagration is about to be played out. As Allied generals surround the mortally wounded Nazi military machine, strategies are being formed on a greater scale than even generals can imagine.<br><br>While Churchill fumes helplessly, Roosevelt makes crucial decisions that will cede Berlin to Stalin and the Russians. The stakes are no less critical for ordinary men and women, fighting to live another day....<br><br>From the chaos of the eastern front, to the desperation of a single Jewish man hidden in a Berlin basement, to the burning ambition of an American photojournalist, Robbins animates the giants who shaped history and breathes life into the heartbreaking struggles of those who merely lived it.</span>

                    <span>I'm a World War 11 buff, an avid reader of both fiction and non fiction about "The Good War." <P>	I don't give five star ratings in this genre easily. They're almost always saved for James Jones, author of "From Here to Eternity," "The Thin Red Line" and "Whistle."<P>	But Mr. Robbins' "The End of War" is a remarkable novel. It's not literary, it's just a helluva good story, very well told. It moves at a lightning pace. It beautifully intertwines history with the stories of three very different people, an American war photographer, a Russian soldier, and a teenage girl trapped in Berlin. <P>	For historical perspective, Mr. Robbins uses the perspectives of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin to chronicle the rush to Berlin during the last five months of the war. <P>	These World Leader chapters are informative and entertaining. But they serve to provide only a framework for the personal sagas of the photographer, the Russian and the girl. <P>	Surprisingly, perhaps - because Mr. Robbins is an American and a scholar of history - the two stories that pack an unforgettable punch are of Ilya, the battered soldier and Lottie, the helpless German girl. <P>	Particularly, the latter. The terror and hopelessness depicted in the Berlin narrative is some of the best writing of war ever penned. And the ending is perfect. That's all I can say - Absolutely and Artistically Perfect. <P>	I hope Hollywood discovers this book. It's a classic mini-series waiting to happen.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Robbins has once again written a great novel that while fictional is built around a core of History. I commented on historical fiction and its thresholds for accuracy when I posted my thoughts on his book, "War Of The Rats", so I will not repeat it all here. As I have read a number of books on each of, "The Big Three", I know this book portrays the primary historical characters with absolute dead on accuracy. The Author knows the type of cigarettes Stalin dismantled to smoke in his Dunhill Pipe, and even more noteworthy he knows the nickname that Churchill's Family had given to the pocket watch he carried. The latter detail I have only come across when reading Sir Martin Gilbert's Official Biography Of Sir Winston Spencer Churchill.<P>The, "Big Three", and Mr. Truman have to appear in any book about the closing events of World War II, however what I very much enjoyed were the people that did not replace the familiar leaders as much as they at times reflected their ideas in well conceived ways. The people, through whom we experience the final stages of World War II, range from a photographer for Life magazine who understands the importance of Berlin better than both General Eisenhower and a terminally ill Roosevelt. The President who's arrogance prevented him from including Truman, when he was as ill as he was, thus leaving Truman with virtually no knowledge handed down, or experience to equip him to deal with Stalin.<P>A Russian Soldier who leads us from Stalingrad to Berlin. He has been stripped of rank and is serving in a penal company, however he embodies the perfect infantryman that Stalin would have made divisions of had he the chance. When this same soldier reaches Berlin his Humanity is regained like his rank has risen, and were Stalin to know he would remove him from the living with the infamous checkmark.<P>A young German Woman, a classical musician enjoys the privileges her talents secure for her, and that keep some distance between her and the reality of Berlin. As the War comes to a close her world deteriorates until she is forced to live with her Mother, a woman who takes the most dangerous risk for reasons that are hers, and is rewarded with her Daughter's condemnation. Her cello ensures her a better albeit temporary security. For when Berlin falls she is there to be victimized at will. She fights to reconcile the opportunities her position presents for her, and the obligations she feels toward her Mother, as well as what the Nazis' have ingrained in her versus the reality of their crimes.<P>This is the second work by a very talented writer who to date has brought stories involving the Second World War. It will be interesting to see whether he continues with this genre, or directs a deftly held pen toward other events in History.<P>Reading time very well spent, recommended without condition.</span>

                    <span>The book was riveting from start to finish. Even though the outcomes were fairly predictable (as we are all well familiar with the tradgedy that it was), the information of the progress of the war, the comparisson of all of the 4 cultures through the personalities through the worst times of human nature, cannot be taught any easier.<P>I recommend this book to any parent that has a child like myself, who is not enthused about history. This is the way to teach it. Mine is now addicted. Next? Maybe "Berlin" by Antony Beevor, or "To Hell and Back" by the most decorated of all US soldiers: Audie Murphy. Inspirational!!<P>Don't miss it!</span>

                    <span>I think I used that title once before in a review of an Alan Furst novel but it matters not, it fits here as well. When Trotsky wrote that he spoke of the whirlpool attraction of war that sucked people in, and he referred to the fact that 'you may not be interested in war but war may be interested in you!'<P>And certainly in the case of the three civilians in "The End of the War," Lottie the cellist, Charley Bandy the Life photographer and Ilya the Russian decommisioned officer-now foot soldier, all are caught in the whirlpool of this horrible chapter of our world history.<P>David Robbins' brilliant novel is the last of a trilogy beginning with Stalingrad ("War of the Rats"), followed by Kursk ("The Last Citadel") and ending here in Berlin. I say trilogy but there really is no connection except the chronology of historical events. The coherence of the three novels is in the relentless cause and effect of the World at War on millions of lives in the war as well as those bystanders and families.<P>Robbins has been criticized for the splintering effect of all of the individual stories, for included in "The End of the War" are representations of/from Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt. I feel such criticisms are subjective at best because what we have here is an epic about something of epic proportions. When you have technology combined with will so advanced that 10,000 men can die in a single six-hour battle, perhaps what we need is to have multiple views to help us understand in the larger sense of the word, what happened.<P>For those of us reluctant to bick up a treatise by Barbara Tuchman, Cornelius Ryan, Doris Kearns or Max Hastings, David Robbins offers a compromise. Good stuff. Impossible to put down. Larry Scantlebury</span>
