                <span id="Label1">In a true marriage of minds, Christopher Hitchens takes on George Orwell and the value of one of the twentieth century's great independent thinkers. <P>In this brilliant and contemplative biographical essay, Christopher Hitchens assesses the life, the achievement, and the myth of the great political writer and participant George Orwell. The result is the perfect convergence of two kindred spirits. Hitchens has long regarded Orwell as a mentor and model, and in true emulative and contrarian style, he is both adulatory and aggressive, sympathetic yet critical, taking true measure of his subject as hero and as problem. <P>Combining the best of Hitchens's polemical punch and intellectual elegance in a tightly woven and subtle argument, <I>Why Orwell Matters</I> tears down the fa&#231;ade of sainthood erected by hagiographers and probes deeper to find the true George Orwell: gifted, flawed, and human. With lyrical and allusive prose, Hitchens examines Orwell and his perspectives on fascism, empire, feminism, and Englishness, as well as his outlook on America, a country and culture toward which he exhibited little curiosity but much ambivalence. <P>With his characteristic wit, Christopher Hitchens has written a book that addresses not only why Orwell matters today but how he will continue to matter in a future, uncertain world. <P>Hitchens on Orwell: <BR>This is not a biography, but I sometimes feel as if George Orwell requires extricating from a pile of saccharine tablets and moist hankies; an object of sickly veneration and sentimental overpraise, employed to stultify schoolchildren with his insufferable rightness and purity. <P>This kind of tribute is often of the Rochefoucauldian type; suggestive of the payoff made by vice to virtue, and also of the tricks played by an uneasy conscience. What [Orwell] illustrates, by his commitment to language as the partner of truth, is that "views" do not really count; that it matters not what you think, but how you think, and that politics are relatively unimportant, while principles have a way of enduring, as do the few irreducible individuals who maintain allegiance to them. <P>Others on Hitchens: <P>"I have been asked whether I wish to nominate a successor, an inheritor, a dauphin or delphino. I have decided to name Christopher Hitchens." -Gore Vidal <P>"Christopher Hitchens's writing has sweep and flair. He is accurate where others are merely dutiful, unpredictable where the tendency is to go for the clich&#233;. In short, brilliant." -Edward W. Said <P>"May his targets cower." -Susan Sontag</span>

                    <span>...or almost always right. Welcome to Christopher Hitchens' paean to his hero. Let's look at the virtues of this polemic in praise of everybody's favorite Socialist. Hitchens is his usual sharp and amusing self, and he covers a wide number of areas in his defense of Orwell. He claims for Orwell a special prescience in three areas, in opposing imperialism, fascism and communism. He challenges Orwell's leftist critics, such as Edward Said, Salman Rushdie, Isaac Deutscher, while reserving special animus against Raymond Williams. At the same time he criticizes those who would claim Orwell for the COMMENTARY right, most especially the egregious Norman Podheretz, but also noting Orwell's difficulties with T.S. Eliot in the publication of "Animal Farm", and the way he criticized James Burnham for power worship. Then we're off to looking at Orwell's views on America and the UK, where Hitchens seeks to show that Orwell was not a simple minded British patriot. Then we get a chapter of Orwell's views on women, the controversial list of fellow travellers he gave to the British government, and the quality of his novels. Finally Hitchens praises Orwell for the clarity of his writing, in contrast to Adorno and Claude Simon, and ends with a coda about Auden.<P>Hitchens provides much in defense of his hero. He quotes a pompously obtuse attack by John Major that must be read to be believed. He quotes the best passage from "Keep the Aspidistra Flying" where the protagonist bookseller gushes insincerely about the "Englishness" of Galsworthy and Priestly. Hitchens does admit his hero a few flaws. Orwell did have a prejudice against homosexuals, and he was willfully obtuse about Auden's "Spain", where it is obvious that Auden is using "necessary murder" in irony. The early novels all have serious flaws, and Orwell was not entirely comfortable in his attitude towards women. However, Hitchens points out that Orwell was so fair minded that he sought to change a passage in "Animal Farm" that he thought was unfair to Stalin.<P>Reservations? Oh yes. At one point Hitchens says that while he is defending Orwell from his critics he also seeks to save Orwell from his saccharine admirers. He objects to calling Orwell a saint for two reasons. First, Hitchens is a very vehement atheist. Second, and more important, Orwell, in his essay on Gandhi, famously said that saints should be considered guilty until proven innocent, and Hitchens would prefer a more lenient standard of judgement. For a start, Hitchens is extremely unfair to Claude Simon, who appears as a deceitful fellow traveller, on the basis of a few uncomplimentary passages of one chapter of one novel, The Georgics, an extremely complex and difficult novel that should not be judged this way. He sneers at Simon's style (based on Faulkner's) and makes the witless comment that Simon is trying to describe the thought processes of a man he never met (someone call the National Guard! Tolstoy and Joyce and practicing telepathy without a licence!) He describes Simon's admirers as "pseudo-intellectuals" which does not seem to me a fair way of describing Roger Shattuck or Martin Seymour-Smith.<P>Another problem. At one point Hitchens notes Orwell occasionally made callous and insensitive comments about Jews, but he doesn't quote any. Compare this in contrast to the insinuations he made against Richard Crossman in "For the Sake of Argument." It is hard to believe that if Crossman had made the obtusely misogynist comment Orwell made in his essay on George Gissing, Hitchens would let it go unmentioned. Nor does it appear to me that if Crossman had made the list Orwell did, Hitchens would assume it was done out of the highest of motives. About Orwell's prescience, Hitchens himself admits that Orwell himself was so disgusted with the Popular Front, that he opposed fighting Hitler up to the Nazi-Soviet pact. And in praising Orwell as a brave anti-communist of the left, in the tradition of Serge and Souvarine, Hitchens emphasises his marginality and unpopularity. But what about the anti-communism of Ebert and Noske, Faure and Bevin? This would not make Orwell look so brave, or so heroic. And one wonders whether the mainstream press will give Helen Graham's upcoming book on the Spanish Republic the same attention that they give this book. Hitchens praises Orwell for his support of European Union, but would he have been so enthusiastic about the EEC in the fifties when the three main countries, France, Italy and Germany were dominated by political Catholicism?<P>I can't help adding that the essay Hitchens mentions about Mark Twain was not as long, or as complimentary, or as insightful as Hitchens suggests. Nor do I believe that Orwell's statement that he could never hate Hitler was as perceptive as Hitchens claims. Among the admirers of Orwell one often encounters a double standard: your (feminist, ethnic) objections are petty and sectarian and should be ignored for the good of the common struggle; while my objections (against vegetarians and sandal wearers) reflect my high moral tone and the strength and purity of my convictions. They are not subject to compromise. Against those who criticize Orwell for encouraging apathy, Hitchens portrays him a matchless figure of unquestionable independence. Yet in Hitchens' writing one finds little discussion of strategic and tactical questions. What one does find is a tendency to fixate on certain figures: Paine, Marx, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Debs, Serge, Mandela, Orwell himself. This is not a politics: it is an atheist's martyrology. And it is not enough, especially in praise of someone who was most things to most people.</span>

                    <span>Remarkably, as the 21st century opens George Orwell's shadow looms larger than ever over the world, undiminished by the end of the Cold War (a phrase which he probably invented). He is increasingly claimed by both Left and Right as one of their own. Two Englishmen now living in America, Andrew Sullivan and Christopher Hitchens, can best claim the mantle of Orwell by virtue of their clearsightedness and ability to cut through cant. Hitchens has written a short, bracing book on why "Animal Farm", "1984", and the collected essays are still essential reading. Orwell was a divided man. He was emotionally a conservative and intellectually a socialist. He was able to live out the contradiction and thus was blessed (or cursed) with the ability to see the big picture. Most of us in our own little lives are opportunists; our social and political views are shaped by what seems to us will allow us to rise in the world. Because of his awareness of his contradictions (and an unusual strength of will or character) Orwell could more closely approach "objectivity" (that noble dream) than most of us.<P>Hitchens claims that Orwell was right about the three big issues of the 20th century--imperialism, Fascism, and Communism: something almost no other of his contemporaries can claim. In the chapter "Orwell and the Left" Hitchens swiftly eviscerates those critics who see Orwell as a sellout (Including Edward Said, whose blurb approving of Hitchens' earlier work appears prominently on the dust jacket of this one.) In "Orwell and the Right" he establishes that Orwell did not advocate mindless aggression against the Communists. Orwell attacked James Burnham for his pessimism and Hitchens says that Orwell didn't want a nuclear first-strike against the Soviets as so many did--it would have killed many of the people who made the successful peaceful revolution against Communism 40 years later. Perhaps the most important chapter in this book is "Deconstructing the Post-Modernist: Orwell and Transparency" in which Hitchens explains Orwell's abiding concern with "objective truth" and exposes the bad faith of the deconstructionists. (A disbelief in demonstratable truth can cover an awful lot of sins.)<P>Hitchens has made a lot of news the past few years with his arguments with his friends on the Left. He detests Bill and Hillary Clinton; and he has broken with the anti-war movement because of what he says is its solipsism and anti-Americanism. In these things he is merely following the lead of his mentor Orwell, who angered many on the left with "Animal Farm" and "1984." But these books have been proved correct over the years as any books could be. I'm betting time will be kind to Hitchens, too.</span>

                    <span>George Orwell is now remembered for his brilliant portrayals of the evils of Stalinism a system which has pretty much ceased to exist except in North Korea. It is ironic that Orwell who became one of communism's most effective critics was in fact a person who was a committed socialist for all his life. <P>This book is really a collection of essays by Hitchen's looking at different aspects of Orwell and his legacy. With the collapse of communism one wonders how long 1984 and Animal Farm will continue to be put on school syllabuses and for how long Orwell's books will be read.<P>Never the less Hitchen's essays are readable and they catch the basic decency of Orwell and the man and his one or two rather minor character flaws. The best essay is the discussion of the empire and Orwell's loathing for it. Even now the dreams of past majesty can blind us to what a squalid little affair the empire on the whole was. Its racism and how much the degradation of millions of subject peoples was bound up in its very nature was so clearly illustrated in Burmese days.<P>Other parts of the book deal with Orwell and his attitude to women, his preparation of a black list of fellow travellers and a number of those issues which have been used to attack his memory in recent years. All in all an entertaining book about an important figure in his time but one wonders for how much longer that will be so.</span>

                    <span>You can always judge a book by who hates it. Liberals say Hitchens is a liar, I say this is a must read. Orwell was a good communist, he had the dream in his heart for a better world. Like some sort of phantom Bobby Kennedy he saw the way the world could be and asked 'why not'. Orwell then watched as COmmunism became a viscious hideos monstrosity. Everywhere communism went it became more brutal then what it was replacing. In RUssia the communists took peasants(who had simply been suppressed under the Tsar) and murdered millions of them for no reason whatsoever. Orwell eventually migrated his views and wrote 'Animal Farm' thus opening the glass on the evils of totalitarian leadership and the blind ideals of the foolish followers Orwell matters because he opened his mind and stopped following a false ideology, an ideology that became as bad as fascism. Hitchens is a great writer and wonderful poetic author.</span>

                    <span>George Orwell is a worthy topic. This is an era that begs for reminders of his ethics and values. However, it's also typical of this era of decadent and deceitful journalism that the book on Why Orwell Matters is written by Christopher Hitchens, a purported journalist whose McCarthyite abuse of slander and biased and misleading language to malign his opponents would be soundly condemned by Orwell. Of course, Hitchens may be indulging in the same error that lead Orwell to spy on and inform on his friends and colleagues -- turning them in to military intelligence. That is the one and only place where Hitchens and Orwell overlap in values, ethics and behavior. Of course, Orwell recanted and regretted his sins -- but Hitchens revels in them.<P>That's the problem with this book. It's impossible to separate what is a relatively well-written book from the knowledge that the author is a liar, a propagandist and a practicioner of the worst sort of commentary -- calling it journalism is ignoring its utter lack of truth and balance.</span>
