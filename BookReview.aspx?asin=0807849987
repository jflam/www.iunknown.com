                    <span>   Richard Newman's, The Transformation of American Abolitionism: Fighting Slavery in the Early Republic, traces the grassroots of the American abolitionist movement, and its radical transformation during the early 19th century. 
<br />
<br />    Newman begins his monograph by examining the creation of the American abolitionist movement.  In 1775, a small group of Quakers met at Philadelphia's Sun Tavern and formed the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society.  The society consisted of only elite members, mainly lawyers, that possessed the ability to manipulate government politicians and members of the courts.  American abolitionism was no longer a "religious or philosophical trend", but rather an official society, aimed at gradual emancipation through legislative reform.
<br />
<br />   Newman argues the PAS was radical in the sense that it pushed abolitionism into the political/social sphere, but it was ideologically conservative in its entirety.  Its reform agenda was rooted on gradual emancipation, achieved strictly through conservative legislative procedure.  
<br />
<br />   The Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society achieved moderate reform predominantly through petitioning and manipulating "constitutional loopholes and technicalities".  It successfully terminated the overseas slave trade, purified Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey of slavery, and placed abolition on a conservative-political platform.  Newman dedicates much attention to the PAS's mediocre success in Pennsylvania court cases.  Working strictly pro-bono, abolitionist lawyers fought on behalf of fugitive slaves, advocated blacks' legal and constitutional rights, and battled black freedom cases.  Although the PAS achieved significant success in respect to initiating the American abolitionist movement and achieving moderate success, it failed to attack the nucleus of slavery, the south, and neglected to include to the most logical activists, the black population. 
<br />
<br />   In the middle half of his monograph, Newman begins to introduce the gradual transformation of the American abolitionist movement.  Founded in 1817, the American Colonization Society introduced a new strategy for abolitionism: emancipation with deportation.  The ACS argued that blacks and whites could never peacefully coexist.  Despite this new radical approach to abolition, mass criticism arose.  Blacks demanded they had the constitutional right to live peacefully in the country they helped create, and white abolitionists argued the ACS was combating southern racism with bigotry. 
<br />
<br />   The third phase in the transformation of American abolitionism began in 1832 with the establishment of the New England Anti-Slavery Society.  The NEASS introduced a new approach in fighting slavery know as: immediate abolitionism.  It abandoned the PAS's approach of conservative-gradual emancipation and rejected the ACS's agenda of deportation.  Most significantly however, it advocated a society in which both blacks and whites would coexist.   
<br />
<br />   Initially created in Massachusetts, the NEASS rapidly expanded, instituting a radical and immediate emancipation agenda.  Newman argues the most significant aspect of the NEASS was its incorporation of blacks and women.  NEASS leaders such as William Loyd Garrison and Charles Burleigh, argued the necessity of including blacks because they were the victims of racism and bondage.  Both blacks and women participated in petitioning, recruiting, publishing, organizing, public speaking, etc.  
<br />
<br />   Newman dedicates much of his monograph to the NEASS's three central strategies: ideology, literature, and traveling agents.  The NEASS argued slavery was above all, a sin against god and a sin against the revolution, and all that it symbolically represented.  Newman describes this strategy as combating slavery through the "weapon of public sympathy".  By combining the underlying symbolism of antebellum American culture, religion and independence, the NEASS recruited the masses.  Another strategy used by the NEASS to promote its cause was through literature.  Newspapers, public and private, nationally diffused the abolitionist cause with persuasive-personal articles from both whites and blacks.  Lastly, the NEASS spread in cause through traveling agents.  Charismatic speakers such as Garrison, Burleigh, and Phelps, traveled throughout New England preaching the cause of abolition to the masses.
<br />
<br />   When the NEASS entered the decade of the 1840s, its members were numbered in the hundred-thousands with over 1200 independent societies.  Through the radical transformation of the American abolitionist movement, America entered the second half of the 19th century divided over slavery, and the antebellum period would soon become history.    	
<br />
<br />   Richard Newman illustrates why he a leading historian of American abolitionism.  It is a clearly written narrative, well organized, and very informative.  I strongly recommended this monograph.

                    <span>America's first, and perhaps most important, reform movement was the fight to end slavery, commonly called abolitionism.  Dozens, if not hundreds, of scholarly and popular books have been written on this subject.  Rich Newman's excellent new study synthesizes much of that scholarship by giving us a rare glimpse into abolitionism's earliest phases.  This book should be required reading for anyone interested in early American history, slavery, or social reform.<p>Newman makes two important contributions to the subject he has examined so thoroughly.  First, he identifies the ways in which the abolitionist movement changed over time.  These changes were a function of broader social and political currents affecting the early American republic.  Second, Newman continually pulls back to emphasize how abolitionism was similar to, or differed from, other mass movements in U.S. history (indeed, the "transformation" Newman identifies is abolitionism's evolution into a mass, not elite, political movement).  In this respect, the book transcends its immediate chronological limits to address wider questions about the strategy and tactics of American reform and reformers.<p>Professor Newman's book, while based on meticulous research, is NOT a dry monograph intended for a narrow, academic audience.  Newman writes beautifully, eschews jargon, and avoids tedious discussions of historiographic debates.  Undergraduates, graduate students, and well-read members of the public will all benefit enormously from Newman's book.  It is a VERY significant addition to the literature on reform, and will quickly become the definitive work on early abolitionism.  It will certainly provoke many stimulating discussions about a fascinating, if also troubling, chapter in our nation's past.</span>
