                <span id="Label1">The "riveting and endlessly fascinating story" (The Boston Globe) of the complex and often tormented relationship between the U.S. and China--a finalist for the Helen now in paperback.  <P>Hailed as "absorbing" by the New York Times and "suspense-filled" by Foreign Affairs, Patrick Tyler's A Great Wall became an instant classic; a must-read for anyone concerned with the complicated and combative relationship between the world's biggest and the world's most powerful nations.  <P>And no one could tell this story better than Patrick Tyler, veteran journalist and former Beijing bureau chief of the New York Times. Using brilliant original reporting from his years in China; interviews with presidents, secretaries of state, Chinese officials, and other key leaders; and 15,000 pages of newly declassified documents, Tyler illuminates a relationship usually shrouded in secrecy, miscommunication, rivalry, fascination, and fear. A Great Wall is essential reading for anyone interested in China and anyone concerned with the shifting dynamics of post-Cold War geopolitics.</span>

                    <span>I heard Patrick Tyler participate in New York at a luncheon discussion and was so impressed that I went out and got his book. Not being a "China hand," I expected to have difficulty with the subject matter. But Tyler writes in a lucid, entertaining style, and his book is filled with revealing anecdotes and cogent analysis. There's meaty historical data as well, and a lot of contemporaneous material not publicly revealed until now. I'm awed by Tyler's research, and by his ability to synthesize the sheer volume and expanse of the subject matter.</span>

                    <span>I had mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, Tyler's attmepts to punch up the book by including details he could not possibly know about(see his blow by blow description of the fighting on the Sino/Soviet as seen from the perspective of a hapless Soviet lieutenant) recalls some of the worst excesses of Bob Woodward. On the other hand, Tyler does a great job of showing how internal forces within the various administrations combined to form China policy. The descriptions of Kissinger Vs Rojers and Vance Vs Berezinski are well worth reading. On the whole, however, I feel that James Mann's About Face is a better book, and covers much of the same material. If you have time read both, if not go with the Mann book.</span>

                    <span>For the casual China reader, this book is a fun read, with lots of entertaining antecdotes. It gives a good basic background on Sino-American relations. For those looking for a more thorough treatment (but still a relatively entertaining read), or for those who have a more in-depth knowledge of China, I recommend "America's Response to China" by Cohen.</span>

                    <span><BR>Spasmodically researched, abominably written, and distastefully biased, Tyler's "Great Wall" is a slog of a read. Its deeply cynical portrayal of every public figure, its boorish recounting of each private squabble, together with its complete lack of historical proportionality, all make it well worth missing. Profoundly disappointing.<BR>--Of Special Note: Kissinger fans, beware!---<BR>Tyler's malignant portrayal of Kissinger easily rises to the level of vendetta, dominating the largest portion of the book. The statesman "weasles" and snakes his way across the pages, ending finally as the author's own epithet. Offensive.</span>

                    <span>While much of the material discussed in "A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China" is questionable in nature, one comment from the book's jacket lining puts everything into focus: "A Great Wall is an epic that reads more like a novel than an investigative history." And this is precisely the main structural defect that causes "A Great Wall" to crumble under its own weight. "A Great Wall" is the kind of instant journalism that inside-the-beltway types love, reveling in extended descriptions of questionable motives, personality clashes, bureaucratic warfare, and Washington-specific gossip and name-dropping. Instead of digging deep into the history of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China, Patrick Tyler opted for ad nauseam descriptions of Henry Kissinger's megalomania, paranoia, and penchant for excessive secrecy. Tyler also finds it efficacious to extrapolate on Zbigniew Brzezinski's attempts to direct U.S.-China policy by himself, embarrass Cyrus Vance and Richard Holbrooke, hoodwink President Carter, and desire to elevate his public persona on par with Henry Kissinger's. Tyler's choice in emphasizing personalities as the chief determinant of U.S. policy toward China, relayed to the reader in a "fly on the wall" manner, seriously detracts from Tyler's overall scholarship and ability to tell an informative and convincing story. Tyler's "A Great Wall" has also faced the embarrassment of being publically denounced by President Carter as "grossly biased" and by Dr. Brzezinski as a "complete fabrication." This reader expected a better effort from someone who should have a firmer grip of the subject matter, having served Beijing Bureau Chief for The New York Times. A reader looking for an informative overview of the normalization of U.S.-China relations is better off with James Mann's "About Face." "A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China" is a big disappointment.</span>
