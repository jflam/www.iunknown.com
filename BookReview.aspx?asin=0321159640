                    <span>Back in 80's when unix network programming was a black art, Stevens book on Unix Network Programming showed the way to common programmers about how to write something magical in unix/c/sockets. I can only compare this book with the same spirit. <p>By reading the book and practicing the exercises in the accompanying CD, it is almost guaranteed someone will not only become a good java programmer but it will also help to extend and share the knowledge of creating tools. Writing good code in java is not simple. This book clearly explains what is really needed from a user perspective to become a good programmer and team-oriented productive resource using eclipse. <p>The first part explains what a freely available Eclipse can do for you. This is the most comprehensive introduction I have seen so far. It will teach you the smartest way to deal with java projects from a life cycle perspective - create, test, debug and maintain. Each chapter is clear and concise. Tips and tricks are every where.<p>The second part explain that extending and customizing eclipse is no rocket science. It is hard in a way but definitely manageable even for a starter. Referencing eclipse api is a must while reading this part. I wish some concise reference (like O'Reilly's "...nutshell" book style) would have helped the programmer a lot. <p>The third part is a gem. Added to the explanation of materials of each chapter, it went far beyond. Just by practicing the examples will take the user to a commanding position. This part also makes the book a handy desk reference on using eclipse tools. I'd also recommend the reader to take a look at the eclipse.org site to check the plug-ins. A lot of them are very useful and free too.<p>Overall, this book is excellent. In my opinion, this book is one of the major contributors to the community in the increasing the popularity of using eclispe tools, customizing and enhancing it.</span>

                    <span>Target Audience<br>Java developers who want to learn how to use the Eclipse IDE or how to develop enhancements for the Eclipse framework.<p>Contents<br>This book is a comprehensive coverage of the Eclipse framework, both from the perspective of using the tool and writing extensions to Eclipse.<p>The book is divided into 3 parts:<p>Part 1 - Running Eclipse - Getting Started; Using Eclipse; Using Java Development Tools; Debugging Java; Teaming Up With Eclipse; Eclipse Configuration Management<p>Part 2 - Extending Eclipse - Overview Of The Eclipse Architecture; Getting Started: Plug-in Development; Action Contributions: The Integration Fast Track; The Standard Widget Toolkit: A Lean, Mean Widget Machine; Dialogs And Wizards; Views; Editors; Perspectives; Workspace Resource Programming; Managing Resources With Natures And Builders; Resource Tagging Using Markers; Contributions Revisited; Advanced Plug-in Development; Creating New Extension Points: How Others Can Extend Your Plug-ins; Serviceability; Developing Features; Providing Help; OLE and ActiveX Interoperability; Swing Interoperability; Extending The Java Development Tools; Building A Custom Text Editor With JFace Text<p>Part 3 - Exercises - Using Eclipse; Using The Java Development Tools; Debugging Java; Using CVS With Eclipse; Modifying Your Configuration With Update Manager; Using The Plug-in Development Environment; Feature Development And Deployment<p>Review<br>As an IBM software developer using Domino and Notes, I'm hearing more and more about WebSphere Studio Application Developer.  That's the IBM WebSphere Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is built upon the Eclipse framework.  But just what is Eclipse, and why is it so important to you as a developer?  This book will help you answer those questions.<p>The book serves two purposes.  Part 1 of the book will allow you, as a Java developer, to understand how to use the tool to code and test your programs.  They also devote coverage to how CVS, the open source version control tool.  Even if you're not interested in extending the Eclipse tool for your own use, this first part of the book would be worth the purchase.<p>Part 2 gets into how the Eclipse framework can be used to write your own tools to integrate into the environment.  Granted, this part of the book won't necessarily appeal to everyone, as some of you will only want to use the core functionality of Eclipse as an IDE.  But you can think of this section as a lesson on the internal architecture of Eclipse.  The more you understand about the tool, the more effective you can be with it.<p>And finally, you have the third part of the book that consists of a number of exercises to bridge the gap from theoretical to practical.  Taken as a whole, working through this entire book will give you a solid foundation in Eclipse.<p>And for Notes/Domino professionals...  I think a case could be made that you should seriously consider buying this book to prepare for your future.  ND8 is projected to be a rich client built on this platform.  By reading up on it now, you'll be prepared for what's coming.  And if you're a business partner who builds tools for the Notes/Domino client, you'll need this information to start to figure out how you can transition your business in the future.  Don't let it sneak up on you.<p>Conclusion<br>If you're thinking about diving into the Eclipse world, get this book.  And if you're already an Eclipse user but want to make changes to your environment, this book will give you the information you need to start down that path.</span>

                    <span>This helpful and extremely well-written book is really many books in one. The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse provides a coherent, organized, and well-written reference for using the Eclipse platform and developing plugins.  In addition to the basics, the book covers such advanced topics as Eclipse Configuration Management and Providing Help.  One section of the book provides a comprehensive set of exercises that enable you to get hands-on experience working with Eclipse.<p>The book is organized into three sections, each geared towards a different level of experience with Eclipse.  While you may make use of all three sections, the organization of the book helps you to quickly find and focus on the material that you need.<p>The information provided with Eclipse and the Web sites that support it is considerable.  The great aspect of this book is that it offers so much usable content in one convenient source, while providing additional information to supplement the online help already provided with Eclipse.</span>

                    <span>I was initially disappointed that this book did not cover JUnit and that it was based on Eclipse 2.0; however those issues aside this book is a great resource on Eclipse written by folks on the development team. I am using Eclipse 2.1.1 and there are some differences for some things, but most are minor. The book is divided into three parts with Part Two having two sections. Part One focuses on the Eclipse development environment. In this section, there some very good tips about using Eclipse. I particularly liked the chapter on using CVS with Eclipse. There was some practical advice given about how to deal with issues one would encounter in projects while using Eclipse and CVS.<p>In chapter one, the authors challenge Eclipse veterans to read it with "bet you didn't know how to ...". There are some great keyboard shortcuts and other features of Eclipse that surprised me. There is a blind programmer on our staff that will get great mileage out the keyboard shortcuts.<p>Part Two is about creating plug-ins for Eclipse. At first, I was moderately interested in some plug-ins, but after digging into this section, I already have a couple of plug-in ideas that I want to pursue. The authors make it seems like a very natural thing to do. Part Three is composed of exercises on using Eclipse for Java development, with CVS, for debugging, for updating your Eclipse, for Plug-in Development Environment (PDE), and for feature development. The exercises are step-by-step instructions relating to certain chapters in the previous parts. Read the chapters first, but do these exercises!<p>If you are using Eclipse for development, this book has a wealth of information from those in the know. After all, WSAD is basically a bunch of Eclipse plug-ins.</span>

                    <span>Learning Eclipse, the open-source IDE and tool platform, can be a<br>daunting task.  While a plethora of on-line resources exist for<br>learning.... knowing where to start, and<br>remembering what you've read, can be challenging.  Finally a book<br>with much of this in one place: The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse.<p>As a long-time lover of books, expecially Java books, I find that<br>learning from online resources on the web can be sufficient, but<br>often it's hard to know what you've read, where you stopped, where to<br>find something, etc.  Especially when you're learning something very<br>new, or very complex, having it all in your hands can be comforting.<br>(And you don't have to close the book during takeoff and landing.)<p>Written by Eclipse experts with experience using *and teaching* other<br>developers in its use, the chapters and exercises are well thought<br>out.  The authors are instructors with experience in teaching Eclipse<br>to software developers, so have a good knowledge of Eclipse and how<br>to present and explain it. <p>This book contains three parts:  Using Eclipse as an IDE for<br>Java developement, Extending Eclipse with plug-ins, and exercises<br>for all of the above.  While a few other books are available on using<br>Eclipse as an IDE, this is by far the most comprehensive<br>book on extending it by developing plug-ins.<p>This book is unique in its thorough coverage of plug-ins (extending<br>Eclipse: want a new popup menu? code reformatter? Write it yourself!) <br>but don't overlook its good introduction to using the<br>Eclipse IDE itself for developing Java code, as well as a great<br>chapter on using CVS and the Eclipse interface to CVS <br>code respository that is part of the standard download.<p>The exercises on using Eclipse and building plug-ins are great, and often walking through the exercise<br>(resources included on the CD with the book) reinforces or sheds<br>additional light on what is covered in a chapter. At times <br>I jumped directly to the exercise after only briefly reading<br>the associated chapter information, and the hands-on learning<br>accomplished in this manner was great for this impatient Java<br>developer.<p>I took the IBM class with the same name as the book, and found<br>the exercises in the book similar, if less extensive than, those<br>included with the course.  But the basics are there, including<br>the exercise that introduces action sets etc. that I referred<br>to several times in my first plug-in development.  A lot of my<br>code started with the exercise code and grew from there.  As I worked<br>through subsequent chapters and exercises, I came to a clearer<br>understanding of what had been done in the previous code imported<br>in the exercises, yet I was already up and running in terms of<br>developing my plug-in.<p>The book is written to Eclipse 2.0, with a few comments regarding<br>changes for version 2.1.  While it would be nice to have the minor<br>2.1 changes reflected in the book, I know the authors had to stop<br>somewhere to get published.  This was the first Eclipse book <br>published, I understand.<p>Excellent, and highly recommended for all Java developers wanting<br>to use Eclipse, and especially for those wanting to develop<br>plug-ins for extending Eclipse to their own applications.</span>
