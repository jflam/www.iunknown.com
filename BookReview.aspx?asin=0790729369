                <span id="Label1">Some called it a snooze-fest, while others tearfully clutched their Kleenex. In any case, Clint Eastwood was an unusual and (as it turned out) perceptive choice to direct and costar in this lush adaptation of Robert James Waller's phenomenally bestselling novel. Meryl Streep costars as Francesca, the lonely Iowa farmer's wife who is instantly attracted to Robert (Eastwood), the photographer from <i>National Geographic</i> who is in the area to photograph the bridges along Iowa's rural roadways. The two fall in love while Francesca's husband and children are away at a county fair, but the story's passion and lasting appeal derive from their decision to part forever after just a few brief days of intimate connection. Superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation, the film builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions. Like David Lean's <i>Brief Encounter</I> (to which it bears marked similarities), <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i> is destined to become one of the classic movie love stories. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i> </span>

                    <span>"The Bridges of Madison County" is a stellar 1995 adaptation of a truly terrible book. Director/star Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Richard LaGravanese are miracle workers in transforming Robert James Waller's treacly and laughable romantic potboiler into a classic romantic tearjerker about mature people falling in love over a four-day period and making some tough decisions that cost themselves happiness in order to make life better for those around them. <P>"Bridges" stars the glorious Meryl Streep as Francesca Johnson, an Italian war bride turned unhappy '60's Iowa farm wife, who falls deeply into romantic love with National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) while her husband and teenage children are away for four days at an out-of-state fair. She must then decide whether or not to abandon her family in order to spend the rest of her days with the love of her life. The story is really as simple as that, as the true joy of this film is not in surprising and witty plot machinations but in watching two mature and interesting people TALK and RELATE to each other in a realistic manner, something you just don't see in American films any more.<BR>Add to the main plot a much-maligned framing device, set in the present-day with Annie Corley and Victor Slezak as Francesca's grown children. (They're going through their recently-deceased mother's papers and find her diary which contains their mother's story of the affair.) It adds an extra dimension as the pair are forced to confront the problems in their own marriages by reflecting on their mother's infidelity and sacrifice. While some viewers evidently find the present-day story to be an unnecessary conceit, I feel it works just fine and leads to a final shot which is hauntingly memorable.<P>Actually, everything in this film is hauntingly memorable, from the amazing Streep's Oscar-nominated performance and Eastwood's nuanced and vanity-free work as Kincaid (Witness the nasty, ageist, and unnecessary comments about Eastwood's nude scenes in some of the previous comments and you'll know what I mean about "vanity-free"), to Corley's wonderful work as the daughter and Jim Haynie's nearly silent, though equally memorable turn as Francesca's dull, taciturn but unfailingly decent lump of a husband. Only Slezak overplays his hand as Francesca's son, making him overbearing, unlikeable and unsympathetic.<P>The film is beautifully shot and stunningly edited by Eastwood regulars Jack N. Green and Joel Cox, making the Iowa landscape and the title bridges vital characters in the film. In fact, Eastwood and company create an indelible sense of time and place; after viewing this film you may actually feel you've been transported to 1960's Winterset, Iowa. Even Lennie Niehaus' obligatory jazz score works incredibly well, even though I would bet jazz wasn't exactly a radio stalwart in the midwest at that particular time. In fact, it's a testament to how good the film is that an interlude at a black jazz nightclub doesn't come across as implausible until later, when you may wonder where exactly in Iowa such a place would exist.<P>My only disappointment with "The Bridges of Madison County" was that it faired so poorly during awards season. Eastwood, LaGravanese, Green and the film all deserved Oscar nominations, but when the nominations came, only Streep received one. This in spite of the fact that 1995 was a weak year for Hollywood films, with two authentic classics ("Apollo 13" and "Babe") duking in out with three incredibly overrated pictures (Mel Gibson's eventual Oscar winner "Braveheart," "Sense and Sensibility" and the already forgotten Italian treacle "Il Postino"). LaGravanese in particular was shamelessly snubbed for Adapted Screenplay, since his adaption was a substantial improvement over the source material while eventual winner Emma Thompson's "Sense..." script added little to Jane Austen's masterpiece. My guess is Waller's original novel was so horrible that the Academy didn't want to be associated with it in spite of the masterful work that went into this adaptation. Oh, well--<P>So, considering this glowing review, you may wonder why it only ranks a *** rating? Simple. I'm rating the DVD, and it is a true disappointment: the only Eastwood directorial effort not available in a widescreen transfer, which is puzzling considering Warner Home Video has released all other titles in its Eastwood catalog exclusively in widescreen. My guess is they're waiting for next year's tenth anniversary to release a special edition with making-of features, interviews and widescreen presentation. One can only hope. Until then, this print will have to do. So enjoy, and grab a hanky. You'll need it.</span>

                    <span>I too am a heterosexual man who loves this movie. I didn't see it for the first time until years after it left theaters. It never appealed to me before then. I thought "Oh my. A very old Clint Eastwood and tear jerking Meryl Streep are doing the film version of a very over publicized book." Ok, so it happend to be on cable one early morning and I came across it. I started watching the first 5 minutes and by the end I cried so many tears that I couldn't believe it... and I don't cry much at all. <P>This movie is beautiful.. from the way it's shot, to the genuine and heartfelt performances of Clint and Streep. This movie blew me away. This movie is about love, hope, and sacrifice. Unbelievable. Ignore those who cast bad opinions of this flick. This movie is not for the lover of fast paced, action movies. They won't "get it." By the way, 'ol Dirty Harry's work with the musical score is sensational. Listen to "Doe Eyes" and tell me it doesn't fill you up!<P>Yes, on paper this movie is about a married woman's affair with another man. However, this is not the heart of the story. Meryl's character came to America in the hopes of a new and exciting life only to find herself on a farm in East Bumbleland, Iowa doing nothing but household chores day in and day out, married to a husband who isn't even remotely in tune with his emotions.. not to mention her kids who weren't exactly the most loving people in the world either. This movie is about hope and that the dream of finding that special someone still exists, even years later. This movie does not justify extra-marital affairs. Anyone who thinks so is simply narrow minded. I won't give away the ending to those who haven't seen it but I can tell you that if the movie had a different outcome, some of the "affair" arguments may have been able to hold water... alas.. they don't.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who calls this a snooze fest is scared to death of themselves. This is a true love story. Its about a romance that keep people alive whether they dream of it or in this case actually get to live it. I hope someday to meet Mr Eastwood and Ms. Streep and thank them for doing this movie.<BR>Watch the movie, read the book and dont be ashamed to cry and to dream and cry some more. It's ok. It's a beautiful story of something so special that few us ever get to feel. I am a deep romatic and love to write love songs and play them on my guitar.<BR>I have been married to my wife for 25 yrs. I admit I am too scared myself to go out and find someone who really cares about me and appreciates me and doesnt take me for granted. I have spent my marriage trying with all my heart to get my dear wife to believe that romance is beautiful. Too many bad things happened to her as a child. Some people are threatened by those who can openly share there dreams and secrets. They are ahsamed of being. I dream of true love and romance. Maybe someday. Maybe someday I'll find someone to slow dance with again under the stars to the music of each others hearts. Someone to hold hands with, and feel so damn happy you pray to God it will never end. Thats what this movie and story does for me. Cheers.</span>

                    <span>"The Bridges of Madison County" is an extraordinarily mature film dealing with the complexity and dilemma of the crossroads we sometimes come to in our lives: do we pursue what we truly desire in our hearts or do we do what society would consider to be the right thing - that is, to continue to meet our responsibilities, whether parental or familial. Such is the dilemma facing Francesca Johnson, played magnificently by the gifted and brilliant Meryl Streep. Clint Eastwood, although at times rather stiff in his role as Francesca's romantic interest, Robert Kincaid, gives his character an unusual masculinity and sympathy. Critic Roger Ebert notes that a younger couple would simply have ran away together, abandoning everything behind. BUT...Francesca already has a decent, hard-working husband as well as two children. With Francesca being 45 and Robert being 52, these are two adults who are mature enough to realize not only the intensity of the romantic passion they share but that to continue such passion would come at a price too high to pay for Francesca. In that sense, this film is not so much about simply an affair, but rather it is a mature depiction of inner struggles with unexpected romance and the realization of the importance of putting responsibility before desire. A+.</span>

                    <span>One can only continue to marvel at the incredible range Meryl Streep has shown over her many years; she's going to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute later this month, and what a deserved honor that is.<BR>This love story doesn't really offer anything new in the lines of romance, but it does offer us mature adults facing a heartbreaking decision...a choice. Meryl's hand on the door of her husband's truck while trying to decide whether to run off with Clint Eastwood is one of those moments that only an actress like Streep could pull off so convincingly.<BR>Streep and Eastwood pair well, and they have some powerful scenes, some without dialogue. The addition of the modern day segment featuring Streep's grown children could have been left out, but Annie Corley did a nice job; Victor Slezak was so-so. Jim Haynie in his brief role as Meryl's husband is a sharp contrast to the outgoing, masculine Clint. As he has shown in such powerful movies as MYSTIC RIVER and UNFORGIVEN, Clint has become a director of incredible vision and sensibility. His direction and Meryl's performance elevate this standard fare to classic heights.</span>
