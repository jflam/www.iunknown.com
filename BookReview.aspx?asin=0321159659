                    <span>I bought this book thinking that the case study will help to learn more but at several place there are errors in the code. On top of that you can not down load the code from web www.aspnet-solutions.com to check and correct your code. Sent several emails to author but no reply. DO NOT BUY this book</span>

                    <span>This a great book for transitioning knowledge without a drastic paradigm shift, as it doesn't rely heavily on data binding. (not like EVERY other ASP.NET & ADO.NET book I've picked up.)  Great alternatives presented (and performance-wise, they probably run more efficiently). Also a great learn-by-doing book, instead of a language reference.  Made the connection for me.</span>

                    <span>I'm about half way through this book and its poor. The idea is good but the examples are full of security holes and the companion website still has "coming soon" messages for some of the source code.Some examples are supposed to be written in C# but switch to VB half way through. These are not best practices. It appears the author cares more about getting the next version out than supporting this version.  DONT BUY THIS BOOK.</span>

                    <span>I just wanted to comment because I noticed this book being knocked for not having complete source code and for having missing links on the website. The problems seem to have been rectified. Thumbing through the book for over an hour at the bookstore gave me the strong impression that this is a very good book to aid any self taught programmer in improving their techniques, following better practices than they may have developed on their own and/or through clipping ideas off the internet. It also seems to include many/most of the types if things that a real-world web programmer would want to know how to accomplish.</span>

                    <span>I was a 10+ year Windows programmer w/ fairly minimal Web development.  This book suited me well in some ways and poorly in others.<p>As the name implies, each chapter jumps right into a situation and most do a pretty good job of stepping through topical pieces of technology then tying it all together into a small application.  There were a few chapters in particular that gave me an immediate jump into a real-world function I needed.  For that reason alone, it was probably worth the purchase.<p>The topics covered are fairly broad.  I, personally, found myself not seeing much use for some chapters but think that many would feel differently.<p>The language of choice alternates every other chapter between C# and VB, with the earlier sections discussing snippets in both, but the main application at the end is only covered in one.  This makes it harder to follow if you're only focused on one.<p>The biggest problem is that the source code is generally only snippets in the chapters and not available on the website in many cases.  Having gone to print nearly a year ago, it is very frustrating to still find the same "source code coming soon" placeholders for roughly 1/3 of the chapters.  This made many of the chapters all but unusable to me.<p>Overall, the approach is more real world than most books, and the techniques can give interesting ideas or even be put into the site you're working on as you read, but without the source code, much of the book goes to waste.  Check the book's site (www.aspnet-solutions.com) before you buy!</span>
