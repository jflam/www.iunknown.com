                <span id="Label1">Multiplayer Game Programming is the first technical guide to enable you to write a complete Internet-ready video game using DirectX 8. The first part of the book covers the history of online gaming, the architecture of multiplayer games, basic networking, and an introduction to Visual C++ and Windows programming. After you cover the basics, you'll move on to sockets, DirectPlay, Direct3D, DirectAudio, and DirectInput programming, as well as multiplayer game design. Whether you are new to game programming, or you have extensive game programming experience but want to break into the multiplayer phenomenon, this book is for you. Multiplayer Game Programming teaches you the skills necessary to create interactive, online games!</span>

                    <span>I have been working on my own game projects for a couple of years now and was always confused when it came to implementing network communication within my games. I tried to understand the DirectX SDK documentation but the examples are too confusing. After little more than a couple of hours with this book, everything started to make sense! I love the fact that the writer walks you through each piece of code, step-by-step, without assuming anything. <P>It is true, some of the code is duplicated throughout the book, but I would have been confused otherwise. I would rather have too much code than too little. The sections on Direct3D, DirectInput, and DirectSound are some of my favorites from any book as well. I have read other books dedicated to these subjects but none of them made the subject matter as clear as this book does. Sure, the book is about network communication, but graphics and sound are part of gaming too. <P>Did I mention the book includes a couple of working games as well? Its amazing how many gaming books fail to include working games; thankfully, this book does not let you down. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how to incorporate multiplayer support into their games or projects.</span>

                    <span>My position was, I had done some C++ for a few weeks, and wanted to move onto bigger things.<P>Windows programs, networking, multiplayer games all interested me. This book helped me understand all the above.<P>I like the amusing comments, cartoons and the way the book is styled. It keeps me interested and never bores me.<P>Overall a fantastic read and I personally, learned a lot without the pain, maybe not for the super-advanced programmer, but great if you havn't been doing C++ for 20 years.</span>

                    <span>I only have 1 semester of C programming under my belt, with no previous exposure to COM or WINAPI programming, but this book has done a great job of helping understand some of these concepts, as well as DirectX and what it is capable of...<P>I am currently about 2/3 of the way through the book and I have been typing out every program example... This has done wonders for my comprehension and understanding of the material. I would recommend this book for anyone who is new to programming and may not understand some of the more advanced concepts (such as operator overloading), but I think it would be good even for intermediate level as well... A great book all-around...</span>

                    <span>While the title of this book is somewhat deceiving, this is perhaps one of the greatest programming books I have ever read. It was exactly what I was looking for. Here is a checklist to determine if this book is right for you.<P>BUY THIS BOOK IF:<BR>-If you have basic knowledge of at least one other programming language (preferably C/C++ or JAVA).<BR>-If you want to begin programming games with DirectX but do not know where to start (this book only focuses on DirectX).<BR>-If you like the theory of an example explained first, and THEN the fully commented and explained source code.<BR>-If you want to learn the basics of Winsock.<BR>-If you want to learn more about Windows programming (primarily without MFC).<BR>-If you like having two complete games to work towards and loads of source code that actually compiles!<BR>-If you like your books written in a very informal tone with plenty of humorous one-liners and the occational off-topic rant (which I finds makes the reading of this book extremely enjoyable and rarely dry).<P>Being a senior in college with basic VB & JAVA programming experience, this was exactly the book I was looking for. It helped me make the transition to VC++, learn more about Windows Programming, learn DirectX, learn Winsock, and learn Multiplayer Game Programming all in one shot! If you're looking for complex specifics on multiplayer gaming, this is NOT your book. If you're looking for an intro on the COMPLETE PACKAGE then buy this book NOW!</span>
