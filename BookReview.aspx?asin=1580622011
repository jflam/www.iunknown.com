                    <span>As a person who is on the verge of retirement, this is one of many investment and retirements books I've read recently.  If you take the author's advice in your retirement strategy many of the authorities on retirement planning would tell you that you will run out of money in a very untimely way!  Written near the end of the boom cyle of the 1990's the book suggests that you can safely withdraw 8% or more of your investments a year for living expenses.  This is an extremely optimistic approach.  Most current experts recommend a 4% or so withdrawal rate is much more realistic considering the long term analysis of the various markets.  This was proposed by the landbreaking research in the Trinity study, written several years before the publication of this book and has become the predominent thinking of modern investment advisors.  
<br />
<br />I especially was miffed at a short discussion suggesting that managing and reducing your living expenses was much less important than your investment strategy.  These two items go hand-in-hand and each has a vital place in retirement considerations.  
<br />
<br />You may wish to buy this book for it's decent discussion of the various investment markets, but there are far better out there.  This discussion was only fair.  I've found the books by Boggle and Berstein to be among the best.  
<br />
<br />If you should have the temptation of following the author's advice regarding spending habits and safe withdrawal rates from your investments, I would stongly recommend that you weight this against other expert advice on the subject.  </span>

                    <span>Far and away the most useful of many books on reitirement I've read. Unlike 98% of the other books on retirement out there, the author has actually been retired for 2 decades, lived through market crashes and personal tragedies, and yet managed to be enormously successful. The stragegies presented here are proven, and will work for you whether you're bent on retiring rich or just want to live simply and well decades earlier than your peers.</span>

                    <span>I think this was a good book but I did not learn anything new compared to other books I've read on savings for retirement. It would be a good book for those who are still early in the learning process but could probably be skipped by those with a solid financial investment foundation.</span>

                    <span>This book should have been titled _How to Invest in Three to Five Non-Correllated Asset classes_. There is very little information on how to actually retire early. The information on asset classes, however, is solid.<p>One area which I feel he could have done more with is options and derivatives. He completely avoids - or should I say, tries to scare people off of  - them (he basically says, "Don't do it, you will lose...").<p>Also, several times in the book he kept dinging on his recent divorce. It rarely had anything to do with the current topic and I found it quite distracting.<p>The epilogue is strange. He tries to get very personal and share some of his feelings about loss, which is admirable, but I found it a little too sappy for my tastes.</span>
