                    <span>This may be one of the very rare times when the movie is actually better then the book!  Don't get me wrong, the book is exceptionally enjoyable and informative, but the mini series, because it is so long, can afford to delve into more detail then most 90 minute movies, and even offers some insights that the quick, 336 page book does not.
<br />
<br />I watched the mini series first and then read Ambrose's written account, and I was pleased to find that the two were remarkable compatible.  Hanks and Spielberg took very little literary license in creating the script, and the two together, book and movie, combine to be a power-house of education on the European theater of WWII.  I would love to see ten other mini series and read ten other books on ten other companies.
<br />
<br />I don't doubt, as one of the reviews stated, that the book has errors.  It's true that the research Ambrose did was largely oral interviews.  But I guess I'm willing to forgive him for the errors, however, because he has presented the stories in a livelier and more vivid manner then most other accounts of WWII that I've encountered.  The bulk of what we read and watch is all true, even if some of the details are sketchy or exaggerated.  
<br />
<br />All in all, a fantastic book that will survive the test of time.  If you have seen the mini series, you owe it to yourself to read the book.  If you haven't seen the series, read the book first and then watch it.  It will leave you a changed and better person.
<br />
<br />Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>This book gives an excellent description Easy Company's jumps at Normandy on D-Day, at Holland near the Rhine River, and at Bastogne where they fought on the front lines of the Battle of the Bulge. It then goes on to describe their journey to Hitler's Eagle's nest, a mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden. After occupation duty in Austria, the company and battalion were sent back to a small town near Paris where they were deactivated in late 1945. Ambrose describes those eventful three years in such detail as to make the readers feel like  they were on the front lines too.</span>

                    <span>The book that I read for this quarter was entitled Band of Brothers it was written by Stephen E. Ambrose. It was quite possibly the best World War Two book that I have every read. The HBO movie was also very well made and acted but I would recommend reading it as well, to get the behind the scenes information and detail that was not in the movie.
<br />It was about the basic training and the heroic battles of the paratroopers from the 101st airborne division. It mainly had to do with the first group of people that went through basic training together. They went through basic training at Toccoa, and had battles in Normandy, Bastogne, and many others throughout the entire European Campaign. Almost every member of the group in the beginning of the book recieved over two medals for various different reasons such as, the purple heart, the bronze star, the silver star, and they all got there wings for completing the paratroopers basic training.
<br />I enjoyed this book very much because it was quick to read and it taught me a lot about the ranks of military men and what each rank does for a job. Once you pick this book up it will be very hard to put down. I am inspired to start reading some of Stephen Ambrose's other books shortly because I enjoyed the style of writing and the way he describes all of the battles. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about war stories and battles.

                    <span>This book is one of those that once you get into it, you just fly through it.  It is a very interesting story that just flows from chapter to chapter.  I am sure this could have been much longer, but it really hits highlights, except for Bastogne which it went into some detail about.  A couple reviews criticize this book for glorifying Easy company, but how can you say that--the book is about them and they were a great company.  The book is  not the whole US army. If it were...well that is another story.</span>

                    <span>In World War II, as Hitler and The Third Reich rose up against Europe, America's brave young soldiers were deployed into an event the world will never forget. In the Army, many fine soldiers gave their lives to defend our freedom, and, to this day, no battalion was as decorated and remembered as well as the 101st Airborne Division. As good as any rifle company in the world, Easy Company, part of the 101st Airborne Division, was responsible for parachuting into Normandy on D-Day, freezing in the Battle of the Bulge, and liberating Hitler's Eagle Nest at Berchtesgaden. Although they suffered causalities of over 125%, Easy Company remained intact, a band of brothers until the end. With all the heroic and legendary tales about Easy Company, it's no surprise that Stephen E. Ambrose, recounted the history of Easy Company. From hours of research and interviews, Ambrose recounted the stories of these American heroes, and his effort turned into a New York Times Bestseller and a very successful HBO miniseries.</span>
