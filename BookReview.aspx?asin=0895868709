                    <span>Ought to be must reading not only for car guys but aircraft maintenance students, homebuilders, and for electronics hobbyists as well. Even if you aren't going to become as skilled as Mr. Fournier it helps to know what can and can't be done and what is involved, so you can intelligently talk to fabricators.</span>

                    <span>This is an excelent book for anyone who wants to get started or just looking for general info on metal fabrication. However I have to agree with some of the previous posts regarding it's lack of specific details. The book offers readers a good deal of information on the tools of the trade and the basics of metal fabrication. It is a great reference to point you in the right direction but you will have to go elsewhere for the more specific information.</span>

                    <span>While the Metal Fabricator's Handbook provided some insight into working with metal, it didn't provide as much information as I had expected.<p>Ron does a good job of detailing the tools you will need to work with metal, but does not spend much time actually showing you what to do.  <p>Most of the projects were presented in a general way, he didn't touch much on the specifics of how to do complete the tasks.  It was more like watching a 30 minute show on how to fabricate many parts associated with a race car.  Surely you cannot expect to be able to take this information and build a race car.<p>All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the trade.  Even if you manage to learn one thing from this book, it's one thing you didn't know prior to reading it.</span>

                    <span>This book is great!  It's written in a very accessible manner.  The author doesn't try to prove how much smarter or more skilled he is at metal work than the reader. Case-in-point: this book contains the best explanation I've found anywhere of the properties of different series (i.e. 2000, 6000) of aluminum.  Not some tome lifted out of some mechanical engineering textbook, just a straightforward explanation.  Don't know what in the world a "cleco" is or what it means to "cleco" something?  Don't worry, unlike some other titles that simply tell you, "cleco the parts together and tack-weld," this book actually explains what a "cleco" is for those of us who might not know.</span>
