                    <span>After reading this book, I understand why Chris Matthews' show is on at 6:30 a.m. instead of 9:30 or even 10:30.  His glory days of "hardball' are over, thank God.  He's over the hill, so to speak, and too rude with so much interrupting and inserting his own opinions.
<br />
<br />Using this book to elaborate on his opinions to the extent of tearing the politician down to "prove his point" seems to be a San Francisco attitude.  Note the book on Mike Savage (Weiner).  To blame it on growing up in a family of five brothers in the town of brotherly love, is no excuse; and his opinions are just that -- and not the truth of the matter.
<br />
<br />I must be still half asleep when I watch his early morning t.v. show on Sundays (after a delightful half hour preceding that listening to Don Thompson play old movie music on WHO, Des Moines), because I thought he was okay.  That is -- until he criticized Al Gore just because Chris himself was born into a Republican family.  How, I'd like to know did they decide to use him as a speechwriter for a Democrat president, Jimmy Carter!  Being a Catholic and Carter a Southern Baptist, now we know why the president came across as not being cultured.  Here in the South we thought perhaps it could be the Northern education and not the Southern gentility he should have displayed.
<br />
<br />Granted, Gore was educated and grew up around the Washington, D.C. area, not at his dad's home in the South.  He's not the typical Southerner, either.  He may have roots in Tennessee (and this state embraced him after the presidency was stolen from him by incompetent officials in Florida), but he is not "of Tennessee or the South."   He did garner more votes than any Democrat running for U.S. President, in 2000, 51 million.  He was trained by his father, our beloved Senator, to prepare for that high office, but the time has past.  He's gotten pudgy and rebuffs the press in our state.  I felt he "lost" because he backed Clinton in his outright lies about his indiscretion.  But, he's not at all like Loretta Young (or Lynn) with her flouncy dresses.
<br />
<br />After a while, I decided I really don't want to know "what he really thinks."  At least, he's not trying to start a revolution like his fellow San Francisco complainer who calls politicians names.  Chris tries to tear them apart to make himself look good.
<br />
<br />In 1987, he started working for the San Francisco Examiner and is still a syndicated columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle.  There must be something in the air out there to produce two mavericks,  C. M. and Mike Weiner.  His wife was news anchor on ABC in D.C. in 2001.
<br />
<br />He's written HARDBALL about his t.v. show and a book about KENNEDY AND NIXON.  He wasn't old enough to vote (neither was I) when the JFK charm worked for him.  His being Catholic goes far with Matthews, I'm sure.  Being a journalist gives him no right to tread on the other person's turf.  Before tearing another person down before the world, you should "walk a mile in the other man's shoes."   He has no humility to even consider such.</span>

                    <span>Chris is such a highly intelligent and enthusiastic democrat. His is the kind of spirit it will take to win the White House some day.  Chris have you ever considered running for president??<br>I like his ability to judge the person, not the party. <p>His praise of JFK is right on the money and his look at the Clinton presidency and other issues shows excellent insight I think.  <p>Thumbs up for this one.  :)</span>

                    <span>I love Chris Matthews.  I love Hardball.  I didn't particularly care for this book.  Sadly I was really disappointed with his words. I had put this book on my wish list for the holidays and was fortunate enough to receive it. I read it. I let it sit. I read it again.  My opinion didn't change.  He has always seemed so straightforward, yet by his own words, he contradicts himself in his book.  We are of the same generation - actually very near each other in age - and I particularly didn't care for his generalization of boomer experience.  I really felt he was above such things, but he proved that wrong in this book.  I hope to goodness not all of my generation - especially those who actually enlisted and ended up in a war zone, rather than finding an alternative - are lumped together with Mr. Matthews.  The book is good reading for his fans who believe every single thing he says, but for those who were looking for deeper opinion, it is sorely lacking.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book on sale and decided to give it a whirl. It was actually quite interesting. While I don't agree with his politics (Matthews is a Democrat) and it is the reason for the four stars, I can appreciate his independence, objectivity and I concur with a previous reviewer that this book is refreshingly honest. Matthews became a Democrat despite growing up in a family of Republicans and first supported Barry Goldwater for President. I was also surprised and agreed with his assessment of the Clintons too. While I think Matthews should give a little more thought as to what freedom is, The fifth chapter "Freedom Is Contagious" alone is worth the price of the book.</span>
