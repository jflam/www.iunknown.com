                    <span>I have spent lots of money on Flash books and most aren't worth a dime.  This book gives you hands on training by building a site. I would say it isn't the easiest book to read, but very well written.  What this book showed me was how to put to use what all those other books talked about.  Learning flash is one thing, but knowing how to design a website using flash is something hard to grasp.  This book helped.  Also, this book made me realize how difficult it is to put a quality site together using Flash.  Consequently, Flash seems like a lot of work to spruce up your site a little.  What we really need is a program easier then Flash that can animate your site (Swish doesn't have the power to do what flash can).  Buy it if you are prepared to read and work hard at building and learning from this book.  Believe me you'll learn something from this book if you put forth the effort.</span>

                    <span>If you have any desire of learning Flash MX, this si the bookfor you. I'm a college student with little time and even a smaller checkbook. This book definitely taught me everything I needed and wanted to know about Flash -- from making a movie to the complexity of Action Scripting -- in little time. Plus, it was easier on my pocketbook than almost any other comprehensive book available.</span>

                    <span>The concept behind this book is to learn by building a Flash MX project from beginning to end. It is a great concept and a great way to learn. Sadly, the delivery is highly flawed.<p>To cite an example: The activity on page 73 has the reader turning on the Grid feature and editing the properties. The book tells the reader to select File, Grid, Edit Grid. There are no Grid selections under the File menu option. They are located under the View menu. Mistakes such as this occur far too often in the book.<p>I suppose a reasonably intelligent reader could figure it out for themselves (and learn in the process) but, if that is the case, why does one need to spend $30 to work around someone elses errors.<p>I also found myself annoyed by the use of non gender neutral language. In most instances, "she" is used over the more neutral "they". I do realize that this is a minor point, but annoying otherwise.<p>New Riders publications, have some great ideas. However, their technical editors leave a lot to be desired. In nearly every book I have used by them, their have been serious technical flaws (one book's files did not match the text instructions). These books are not inexpensive and greater care should be taken with technical material.<p>I was feeling generous today and gave it 3-stars. You will get something out of it, but be prepared to work for it.</span>

                    <span>Don't let the project site developed in this book mislead you. Though its style and design are aimed to a very young audience, learning by developing the site touches on every feature of Flash MX, even the up-town, whiz-bang, o-so-cool features used in the most sophisticated Flash sites, so, rather than ooohing and wowing over dazzling effects, you actually delve into the foundational concepts  and techniques of creating a Flash site.<p>The explanations are clear, and the instructions concise. For those who have never created a Flash file or site, but who have a million ideas to impliment, this book is invaluable.</span>

                    <span>Do you learn best by reading the theory and mechanics, and then doing it? This one's for YOU! <p>The writing is concise and broken into manageable clumps that suit those who mull new ideas as well as those who read only headings and captions, then slam into gear on their own.<p>Build a website using FlashMX with no pain or strain. But don't be fooled by the simplicity of this book's website project style and subject matter. The site construction takes you painlessly through every up-town feature FlashMX has to offer. <p>In a classroom/lab situation or alone in your own quiet corner of the web universe, this book will boost you up to speed with FlashMX in a flash.</span>
