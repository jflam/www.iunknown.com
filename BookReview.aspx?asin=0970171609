                <span id="Label1">Whether you are visiting the central Tibetan plateau or more easily accessible Tibetan areas in northern India, Nepal, Bhutan, or western China this is the guidebook that gives you all the information you require to truly explore this wonderful region. The Tibetan way of life thrives in many areas outside of the area commonly known as "Tibet".   <P>With a unique collection of over 280 highly detailed, tried and tested maps in combination with more than 400 pages of practical travel information and 339 illustrations, color and black & white photographs, "Mapping the Tibetan World" is a one-stop guide and map book to this entire Tibetan region.  <P>The more than 280 maps are clear, concise and packed with useful information as well as all the relevant towns, villages, monasteries, trekking routes and base camps as well as other points of interest along the way. There are country maps that cover all of the main Himalayan destinations including double page maps of Nepal and Bhutan. Bus route & highway maps, which help with planning your routes into the region and in getting around. The regional & local maps along with special ones showing large monasteries and sights of special interest will allow you to relax and soak up the atmosphere of the place without those nagging worries that you are missing out on something just around the corner. This collection of maps is the most comprehensive ever offered in a guidebook covering the Himalayas and many of them are simply unavailable anywhere else. Please see the Interior Artwork provided above for a taste of what to expect.  <P>The travel information provided includes difficult to find bus and train timetables, air schedules, sample budgets and model routes as well as hotel rates, restaurant suggestions and hundreds of interesting sights to see. This is supplemented by a balanced look at the historical, cultural and religious backdrop to the Tibetan way of life.  <P>There are language sections covering both the Tibetan and Chinese languages. Each town is identified by it's Tibetan and Chinese name (and at times Nepalese) and also by it's local name where the regional dialect is different. To further assist in your endeavors to get from A to B there is a full map and location index alongside an appendix crammed full of place names in English along with their names in Chinese characters.   <P>Readers who stand to benefit from this book include: *Independent Travelers Any traveler planning to explore any part of the Tibetan Cultural Area, whether in Tibet, China, Nepal, India or Bhutan. *Group Tours Anyone who is joining a group tour to the Himalayas and is in search of background information on the history of the area, the culture and customs of the people or the festivals and complex world of Tibetan Buddhism.  *Trekkers Those adventurous souls who are aiming to tackle the Everest routes from either the Nepal or Tibet side, challenging the Annapurna sanctuary or attempting Mt. Kangchenjunga among the many other peaks in the region. *Travel Professionals Travel and trekking agencies will be able to offer better organized and more in-depth travel packages to their clients by using this book. *Scholars & Others Anyone studying, researching or with a general interest in the region will gain invaluable information and gain access to a unique set of maps. You will gain further knowledge of the Tibetan people and the areas they call home and it will act as reference resource for years to come.</span>

                    <span>'Mapping the Tibetan World' is a very ambitious project, and one that succeeds brilliantly. <P>The once-great Tibetan world, though based on common culture and language, has splintered over the centuries into slabs attached to China, India and Nepal--with Bhutan the sole independent nation remaining. This book reassembles the complex jigsaw into a cohesive whole again, making it the perfect guidebook for travellers keen on visiting overlapping regions of the Tibetan plateau on a single trip.<P>The marvel is how all the complex data is compressed into 424 pages. The maps are highly detailed and many are not found in other sources: among them are excellent trekking maps.<P>If you want to explore the Tibetan sphere of influence, this is the book.<P>Michael Buckley, travel writer, author of Heartlands: Travels in the Tibetan World and the Tibet Travel Adventure Guide</span>

                    <span>I wonder what happened to my original review, which seems to have disappeared...<P>I had tried to go against the conventional wisdom about this book and recommend that, if one is not interested in purely religious destinations, another book might be in order.<BR>This book is concerned only with religious destinations in Tibet.<BR>Mountain climbers, trekkers, or bikers concerned perhaps with more terrestrial matters would be better served by a book with mile markers, better maps, and more information on lodging.<P>I was in Tibet in March of 2002 climbing Mt. Nojin Kansa. I had this book; another guy had a book I won't bother (this time) to name. I constantly referred to the other book for mile markers, pass altitudes, international phone providers, etc. <P>This book will get thee to a nunnery in short order. It will not provide the best maps or travel details.</span>

                    <span>At first glance, I thought this guide would be difficult to use as I was so used to the layout of Lonely Planet. However, I quickly adapted to it and found it very informative and reasonably up to date. Most useful was the section on Buddhism when visiting the extraordinary temples in Tibet, as well as advice on routes to take and how to get places. Unfortunately, after a vehicle accident just outside of Lhasa, my book went missing somewhere between the side of the road and the hospital bed (don't let that put you off visiting this remarkable country!). So I was overjoyed when I discovered the guide again in Kathmandu, and bought another copy so I could continue to use it!</span>

The travel information is also very detailed, especially when it comes to the local public transport timetables and routes. I am also impressed that it covers in detail all the Tibetan areas in the Chinese controlled areas and beyond and not just around Lhasa.</span>
