                    <span>Daniel Goleman is co-chairman of the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations, based at Rutgers University. He is the author of the bestsellers 'Emotional Intelligence' (1995) and 'Working with Emotional Intelligence' (1998). This article was published in the March-April 2000 issue of Harvard Business Review.<p>This article is based on research by the author with consulting firm Hay/McBer (previously the late David McClelland) into the leadership styles of 3,871 executives. This research found six different distinct leadership styles: (1) coercive; (2) authoritative; (3) affiliative; (4) democratic; (5) pacesetting; and (6) coaching. The author discusses each style in detail, including the direct and unique impact the different styles have on organization climate, including financial performance. According to previous research by David McClelland "climate" refers to six key factors that influence an organization's working environment: (1) flexibility; (2) responsibility; (3) standards; (4) rewards: (5) clarity; and (6) commitment. The article introduces a table with the effect of each of the six leadership styles on the six key factors of organizational climate. The author advises readers to mix the different leadership styles: "Many studies, including this one, have shown that the more styles a leader exhibits, the better. Leaders who have mastered four or more - especially the authoritative, democratic, affiliative, and coaching styles - have the very best climate and business performance." It is not that these leaders mechanically match their style to fit a checklist of situations, they are sensitive to the impact they are having on others and seamlessly adjust their style to get the best results. For readers that worry about their own leadership skills do not need to despair, according to the author it is possible to grow your emotional intelligence whic "takes practice and commitment". The article is complemented by a short primer into emotional intelligence (also see the author's 1998-article 'What Makes a Leader?').<p>Great article on leadership, which will never become a clear science. This article provides clear insights into the different leadership styles and their impact on organizational climate, which has a great impact on financial performance. Do not forget to read his 1998-article 'What Makes a Leader?' that discusses the five components of emotional intelligence. I recommend this article to managers, people moving into management, and MBA-students. The author uses simple US-English.</span>
