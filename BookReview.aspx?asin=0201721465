                <span id="Label1">While it may not show 100 ways of creating buttons, or how to get slick chrome effects, <I>Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Web Design</I> does offer a thoughtful and image-packed look at using Photoshop to design for the Web. <p>  The first of four sections gives an overview of Web basics--how all the elements work and what the main issues are (e.g., browser problems; Web palettes; the differences between image formats like GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs). The second section covers the basics of Photoshop with a focus on creating Web content (for example, fixing digital photos for Web display or making smooth GIF animations). There's also a section on when it might be better to use ImageReady. (This coverage has been beefed up since the previous edition.) <p>  Anyone can make GIFs and JPEGs, but the real pros know how make images look good with not much bandwidth. So, the third section details optimizing image sizes, for which both Photoshop and ImageReady offer ample tools. The last section deals with basic GoLive tools--fitting the pieces together to create Web pages. Little tutorials appear throughout to walk readers through pivotal scenarios like "Creating Slices and Rollovers" and "HTML Authoring." <p>  It's appropriate that this book, aimed at visually inclined designers, is filled with images: each page features full-color illustrations and screen shots--it's beautifully designed. The opening chapters make this an excellent choice for readers new to the topic (defining terms, exploring the design concepts behind planning a good site, and interviews with successful Web designers). Later sections, which discuss compression algorithms, cascading style sheets (CSS), and preparing and embedding video and audio, make this a good choice for intermediate users. But the main audience will be designers who have used Photoshop in their print work and now want to start designing Web sites. <p>  Besides Photoshop, ImageReady, and GoLive, the book also touches on other useful applications, like Alien Skin's Xenofex and Eye Candy 4000; Apple's QuickTime VR and Final Cut Pro; RealProducer; and SoundJam. Here, as throughout, the author may not show all the details, but he does provide the fundamental principles that ensure a sound foundation of knowledge to build on. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I> <p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to Web design using the tools of Adobe Photoshop 6, ImageReady 3, and GoLive 5, including <ul><li>An overview of Web design-related issues <li>Creating images for the Web <li>Working with layers, actions and filters <li>Comparing image formats and discussing compression algorithms <li>Optimizing file sizes <li>Creating rollovers, animations, and background images <li>Going from ImageReady to GoLive to assemble elements into a Web page</ul> </span>

                    <span>I got a fair bit from this book even after 7 years of web design and Photoshop experience. It does tend to lean rather heavily on graphic-intensive designs (as you would expect given that Photoshop is one of the 2 tools in the title) and gives less focus to designing tight HTML and small sites than I would have liked. That said, the sections on graphic optimisation are pretty useful and the overall book is a good read.<p>Photoshop features heavily but the GoLive information is fairly short and I get the impression this was probably hastily bolted on to an existing Photoshop-only text.<p>My only real complaint (which is a nit-pick) would be that this must be the worst proof-read book I have ever come across. Not only are there typos and spelling errors on pretty much every page but I actually found at least one editor's comment in the text too!</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic book. Probably the best book in my collection. This isn't just a book full of tutorials for people to rip off. It provides a great deal of insight on web design. After reading this book you will always be able to come up with just the right look for your site. This book not only provides insight on how to come up with just the right look for your site but an in-depth look at file types, file sizes, vector graphics, web safe colors, and modem transfer speeds. This is a must have book for any serious web designer. Nice job Michael Baumgardt.</span>

                    <span>when i purchased this book, i expected to learn or read regarding web design or web graphics creation/integration with photoshop.  funny thing is, that's not even 20% of the focus of the book.  but you'll be in for a surprise.<p>i unintentionally learned some important things concerning web design..  like information archetecture, and specific real life examples to explain its purpose...  there are more topics presented that you'll benefit from..   but not from any info directly relevant to photoshop application.  and the information presented regarding photoshop won't be readable for total beginners in my opinion(start with adobe photoshop 6 classroom in a book).  <p>also, there are tons of innovative display of great web design works.<p>i think this book is a random book with tis and tat..without a specific purpose.. . random books are not for beginners in my opinion...<p>don't get this book for photoshop.<br>get this book if you already have some fundamental background in web design and want to further strengthen your background.</span>
