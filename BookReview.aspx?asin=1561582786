                    <span>Fine Homebuilding does a great job of highlighting unique architecture. My only wish is that it wouldn't get recycled over and over again in hardcover. My plea is for Fine Homebuilding is to keep searching out fabulous homes to keep it fresh. My admonishment is to Taupin Press for boring it's very attentive audience. I now look through a book before I purchase it, I usually find that I already own 20-30 of the pics that I find interesting.</span>

                    <span>I just love the small(?) houses in this book. I'm one of those people that dream of one day being able to build my own home, and therefore have numerous books and magazines with house plans. This book is the best by far that I have. The plans and pictures in this book are just brilliant. I love the fact that most of the houses are different to the normal square or rectangular shape that is so prevelent these days. All though most of the houses in the book aren't really that small, at least not to me, there are some wonderful designs. The detail provided about each design is thorough. The Energy-Efficient Houses and Craftsman-Style Houses books are terrific as well.</span>

                    <span>This book has a wide variety of different homes-- which to me didn't seem that small. The plans as well as a description of primary concerns in design are often included. Best of all, many of these homes were designed on a budget of about $100,000, which makes these houses seem much more inspiring and realistic to the potential home builder. I'd never thought of designing my own home until I saw this book, but now it's one of my hopes for the future.</span>

                    <span>This book is a compilation of articles from the magazine and is the second volume to be published focusing on great small houses. There are 31 different projects of various styles and locations. The articles are often written by the owner / designer and are quite thorough. Many include presentation style: sections, details, and floor plans.<P>I found this book to be very interesting to read. I really liked the first volume small houses and had great expeditions for this edition. I feel that this books content to be equal or better then the first edition and the format a little bit easier to read. There really is a lot of content for the size and price of this book. The articles are all from the early 90's to mid 90's. <P>Anybody interested in purchasing, renovating, or designing a small house will appreciate this book.</span>

                    <span>I loved the big pictures and easy explanations. I like homes that are small but open. With rooms that flow from one to the other with out alot of sharp corners and cramp hallways. Also very creative in style and form. This book had every idea I liked and some I never thought of.
