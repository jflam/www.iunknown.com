                    <span>"On Guerrilla Warfare," by Mao Tse-Tung, has been translated into English by Samuel B. Griffith II.  Griffith also provides a substantial introduction to the text.  The book is written in the context of China's guerrilla war against Japanese occupiers; this conflict is mentioned often by Mao.  In this book Mao discusses the differences between guerrilla and "orthodox" military forces, as well as how such forces can work together for a common goal.  Other topics covered include propaganda and political concerns, the formation of guerrilla units, the qualities of a good guerrilla officer, discipline in a guerrilla army, and guerrilla bases.
<br />
<br />Mao stresses the importance of speed, surprise, and initiative in guerrilla war.  Among the most interesting sections of the book is a code of conduct for guerrilla fighters.  Most of the book is fairly dry and matter-of-fact, but there are welcome flashes of passion, poetic imagery, and global vision that make this more than just a textbook.  Translator Griffith notes that Mao's text was first published in 1937.  Despite the passage of time, I believe that this is still a relevant text, and I recommend it in particular to all professional military personnel.</span>

                    <span>This book was written by Mao Zedong (1893-1976) in 1937, as he was waging a guerrilla war against the occupying army of Imperial Japan. Having already had ten years guerrilla experience, Mao was already an expert, and in this book he beautifully explains his basic strategy and tactics. He covers everything from why guerrilla activities should be integrated with conventional military activity, how guerrilla units should be organized, and how they should operate.
<br />
<br />When first picked up this slim book, I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much. Indeed, Mao's stress on guerrilla activity as part of a larger conventional war struck me as somewhat limiting. But, as I read, I got to see the beauty and simplicity of what he was describing.
<br />
<br />Is it hyperbole to say that this book should be compulsory reading for anyone interested in guerrilla warfare - past and present? I think not. This is a great work on the subject, and should rightly be considered a military classic. I highly - indeed, very highly - recommend this book!

                    <span>I think Mao intended this essay to be another one of his theoretical Marxist works (Mao thought of himself as a first-class Marxist theoretician).  But without question it also served as an instruction manual for his ragtag Red Army while fighting among the tortuous terrain in northwestern China, in part against Japan, in part against Chiang.  Considering his success as a practitioner of guerrilla warfare, one would have to be insane to ignore this work.
<br />
<br />I'm struck how short that chapter is on guerrilla wars in history.  Mao was widely read in Chinese and world history and it would have been his style to display this knowledge in a work like this had he chosen to do so.
<br />
<br />Perhaps Americans should not think of themselves as only at the receiving end of guerrillas.  Washington learned this kind of fighting during the French and Indian Wars, and he put some of this experience to good use against a British army better armed, better trained, and greater in numbers than the Continentals.  He exploited geography, made surprise raids, used mobility and patience to wear out the red coats - all hallmarks of guerrillas.  The all-important Battle of Trenton was such kind of unconventional warfare: an Indian raid, essentially.  But it sure got results.  Regular or conventional battles like Yorktown only came later, when British impatience was at the breaking point.  As Franklin had predicted, the British could and did occupy all the towns - including Philadelphia, New York, and Charleston - up and down the eastern coast but they could not hold onto them.  (The comparison with Iraq is irresistible.  The redcoats never numbered more than 30,000 or so men, fighting among 2.5 million American civilians.  Now America has 5 times as many troops in Iraq (about 150,000) as there were redcoats in the 13 colonies.  But Iraq's population is 25 million!  And that's not counting foreign fighters from Iraq's neighbors.  American guerrillas probably had better geography than Iraqi insurgents but the Iraqis seem more eager to commit suicide missions.)
<br />
<br />Mao really could have done better than just cite Russian resistance to Napoleon as an example.  (Never mind his other Chinese examples. for the moment.)  Apart from Washington, the Spaniards also tore the Grand Armee to pieces with guerrillas - in fact, Spain's where the word came from.  Lawrence of Arabia sabotaged Turkish railways in northwestern Arabia (rather like insurgents blowing up Iraq's pipelines) - to great effect.  Of course, another great example of guerrilla warfare was the block-by-block, street-to-street fighting at Stalingrad.  But always, to my mind, the Teutoberg forest was where guerrillas first made their greatest name in Western history.  (I know little Greek history to comment further.)  Octavian lost three Roman legions thanks to the German barbarians, and Rome hadn't suffered a panic quite like this since Spartacus.
<br />
<br />Believe it or not, Mao got his inspiration not from Lenin (though he paid much lip service to him), not even from Sun Tsu (whom he read only when his military career was over), but from the classic historical novels of ancient China, especially The Water Margins and Three Kingdoms.  That he didn't cite these is understandable enough: he always insisted on learning truths from facts, and novels don't provide facts though they do generate interest in the motivated reader.  And Mao was nothing if not motivated.
<br />
<br />Griffith's extraordinary credentials are not worth repeating here.  His intro is excellent. He is dead right that guerrillas thrive anywhere: from the dense jungle of Vietnam to the flat deserts of Iraq.  Where there are clear political objectives (knowing the difference between long- and short-term goals), men willing to fight (and die), a will to win, and lots of patience, all it takes is a little hard thinking to make the worst-equipped great guerrilla warriors. Let us learn from the master, not by regurgitating his rules, which he would never have done himself, but by thinking critically and philosophically through his logic.</span>

                    <span>I read this in high school in the late 1980s and asked myself, "Why wasn't this mandatory reading at West Point in the late 1950s and 1960s?"<br>This book, in conjunction with Ho Chi Min's writings on the use of guerrilla warfare, is the absolute basic understanding of the Viet Nam War from back BEFORE the French Foreign Legion were fighting for their colony.  EVERYTHING, and I do mean EVERYTHING, in this book is used in the fight against the French right up to Dien Bien Phue, and continued up until the fall of Saigon in 1975.  EVERYTHING. Why did America lose the Viet Nam War?  Read this.  How could America have been so wrong to back Ho Chi Min, Chaing Chi Chek, and Kim Il Song, in the Second World War?  Read this.<br>You will say, "Wow" many times throughout the book, and in the end you will ask, "When was this first printed?  How the bleep could we have been so wrong?"</span>

                    <span>Stanley B. Griffiths work is timeless, relevant, and is a must read for those seriously exploring the Western use of joint, interagency, and multinational force to counter guerrilla activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Colombia, etc.. Griffith's 1961 introduction alone is worth the price of the book. His recommendation to study guerrilla warfare in 1940 and again in 1961 was on the mark. He cites examples of successful guerrilla operations (Frances Marion; the Spanish against Napoleon; the Russians against Napoleon; the Russians against Hitler; the Vietnamese against the French, Castro in Cuba) and the value of these historical examples to further study. He cites ten key factors worth comparing to determine which side has the advantage in a guerrilla war. His discussion of the three phases of guerrilla war, and the warning to stop them before they they advance beyond phase one is sage advice. His recommendation to locate, isolate, and eradicate is a simple pattern for developing an effective counterguerrilla strategy. He does warn that countering guerrilla operations is not solely a military activity--the political arm is the key. Perhaps it is his conclusion that historically, there has not been a counter to revolutionary guerrilla warfare which gives one pause when addressing world events in 2003. Griffith comes to these conclusions by laying out Mao's thought in simple, clear writing. Essentially, Mao recognized the fundamental disparity between agrarian and urban societies, he advocated unorthodox strategies that converted deficits into advantages: using intelligence provided by the sympathetic peasant population; substituting deception, mobility, and surprise for superior firepower; using retreat as an offensive move; and educating the inhabitants as an offensive move; and educating the inhabitants on the ideological basis of the struggle. This radical approach to warfare, waged in the mountains by mobile guerrilla bands closely supported by local inhabitants, has been adopted by other revolutionary leaders throughout the world. The challenge for those studying guerrilla warfare is still on the table: what do you do about it? A start, is reading Mao's writings which provide the first documented, systematic study of the subject.</span>
