                <span id="Label1">There is no product on the planet that enjoys the devotion of a Macintosh computer. Apple's machines have legions of loyal, sometimes demented fans. <i>The Cult of Mac</i> surveys the devoted following that has grown up around Macintosh computers. Like fans of a football team or a rock group, Macintosh fanatics have their own subculture, with clearly defined obsessions, rites, and passages. Famously dedicated to their computers, many Mac fans eat, sleep, and breathe the Macintosh. Fans who get Mac tattoos and haircuts, people who attend Apple Store openings like they are Grateful Dead shows, counterculture icons who love the Mac, people who turn old Macs into aquariums (or bongs), Ellen Fein lookalike contests, erotic fiction featuring Steve Jobs; it's all here. Technology reporter Leander Kahney exposes all sides of Mac fanaticism, from the innocuous to the insane. </span>

                    <span>Do NOT order this book from Amazon. I placed an order for this book as a gift on February 9th and after numberous unaccounted for delays on Amazon's part the book now has an estimated delivery of April 9th. That's 2 whole months after my order was placed! It has been pushed back 4 times now, and each time I wasn't notified until 2 days AFTER it was supposed to ship. Now, every single holiday I would have had the opportunity to give this gift to the intended receiver has past or will be past by April 9th. They really should have it listed as out of stock. I'm so upset with Amazon's service lately, every package I've ordered in the past month and a half has been late.  If you really want this book go buy it from a respectable company with prompt service. Amazon has clearly mislead its customers recently. After 4 years of being a devoted customer, I will no longer be using Amazon anymore. </span>

                    <span>I simply cannot imagine anyone getting the Microsoft logo tatooed on their butt, but MacFreaks, yeah it figures. See page 57. 
<br />
<br />And what about the marketing study recently conducted by Chicago's DePaul University who researched the people who still use (and love) their Apple Newton's. (You can find Newton's on E-Bay for $150-200 if you want to join the group.) 
<br />
<br />This book is an unabashed love afair with the Mac. It's really a coffee table picture book about the Mac. From user group meetings to Jay Leno's Macquarium where the tube doesn't show pictures of fish but real ones, or paper models that you can use as Christmas tree ornaments; but why go on. By now you know the contents of this book. It's by MacPeople, about Mac's and for MacLovers. 
<br />
<br />It's a delight to see this book, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and has a lot of fun.</span>

                    <span>I got this book as a gift from my wife and I love it.
<br />
<br />I am a Mac addict and I have been using Mac for ever. I love this book because it gives very interesting stories about the Mac from a non-techy point of view.
<br />
<br />I believe this is a great gift for someone who loves his Mac. However, it may be a little boring for someone who does not have a true passion for his Mac.
<br />
<br />Enjoy your Mac.

                    <span>Few products acquire such fierce loyalty like the Mac.  Fewer products inspire the creative juices and desire to "think different" than the Mac does.  If you've just sighed or harrumphed quietly to yourself (you know who you are) then you need to a) lighten up and b) peruse the pages of this book...  Come over to the Mac side...  It'll be our little secret...  =)
<br />
<br />Beautifully creative and artistic, full color pages end to end.  The book reveals in "coffee table format" a little history, a number of confessions, and plenty of portraiture from the birth of the Mac to the present day.  My favorite chapter discusses the "Fantasy Macs".  Mac devotees all over the world design and publish incredibly innovative and fanciful images of imaginary (and sometimes not so imaginary) Macs.
<br />
<br />A must have for the True Mac user.  For the rest, a little taste of what you've been missing out on for the last twenty years.</span>
