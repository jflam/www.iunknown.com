                <span id="Label1">In the bestselling tradition of  <b>When Elephants Weep</b> and <b>Dogs Don't Lie About Love, Inside the Animal Mind</b> is a groundbreaking exploration of the nature and depth of animal intelligence.<br><br>While in the past scientists have refused to acknowledge that animals have anything like human intelligence, a growing body of research reveals otherwise. We&#8217;ve discovered ants that use leaves as tools to cross bodies of water, woodpecker finches that hold twigs in their beaks to dig for grubs, and bonobo apes that can use sticks to knock down fruit or pole-vault over water. Not only do animals use tools&#8211;some also display an ability to learn and problem-solve.<br><br>Based on the latest scientific and anecdotal evidence culled from animal experts in the labs and the field, <b>Inside the Animal Mind</b> is an engrossing look at animal intelligence, cognitive ability, problem solving, and emotion. George Page, originator and host of the long-running PBS series <b>Nature</b>, offers us an informed, entertaining, and humanistic investigation of the minds of predators and scavengers, birds and primates, rodents and other species. Illustrated with twenty-four black-and-white photographs, the book is the companion to the three-part, hour-long show of the same name, hosted by Page.<br></span>

                    <span>This is a terrific, heartwarming book. Filled with incredible facts, a great sense of humor, and a lot of interesting verbs, George Page does a super job of making the subject even more interesting than it is on it's own. Do animals think? Feel? Communicate? The answers to these and other fascinating questions can be found inside these pages. You will be amazed at what you learn. I think George Page knows his stuff, and I think his years with the PBS Nature series has paid off in a fabulous display of animal empathy, inquisitiveness, and knowledge. After perusing this book, you will never look at an animal in the same way, be it house pet, zoo creature, or wild beast. Take the time to explore each wonderful page, and learn a lot about animal nature, and maybe even human nature. I would read this book again and again and again!</span>

                    <span>Bravo! I had finished reading this fascinating book about the same time the PBS special of the same name was airing on TV. I was trying to get through the latter parts of the book before the three parts were broadcasted. Mr. Page does an excellent job of explaining animal minds in lay terminology for the less scientific reader, and gives insight on the history of anthropomorphizing the thoughts and intelligence of all animal species. I was entralled with the history behind such practices throughout civilization. It is also interesting to think that smaller creatures do have remarkable intelligence, like honeybees, birds (especially clever), ants, etc. A very entertaining read, some good observations on chimpanzees by Jane Goodall. This book held my interest. Page demonstrates that animals are capable of learning complex tasks, and learning from memory. Hopefully this book will enlighten more people to think of animals not merely as pets or lower species, but to think of them as smart in their own way. Highly recommended.</span>

Anyone who enjoys animals as much as I and have made then their career and life like I have...will enjoy this book very much. In fact, just anyone who enjoys animals will enjoy this book. I dare those who did not enjoy this book to write something better!</span>

                    <span>George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30.</span>

                    <span>I just finished this book and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The writing was smooth, and went quickly and the topic is fascinating. I often wonder what the future will hold for communication between species and Inside the Animal Mind helps to cement my belief that interspecies communication will be possible someday.<P>The author makes a very good point in suggesting that our means of measuring animal intelligence are limited...after all we can only test them in ways that we understand. How well would most of us do if we were told to climb a tall tree and make a nest of leaves and, oh yes, raise our young in there as the squirrel does? Or given leave to roam the African plains...without a written map to show us where water sources are,as the elephants do. Would we "pass" those tests? I have my doubts.<P>Besides, beyond intelligence there is the point that he makes at the end of his book, "but can they suffer?" Yes, I think that is clear and for that reason alone they deserve better treatment than many of them have had at human hands over the centuries. Do unto others...the Golden Rule should not be limited to "other people." Or, as Emily Dickinson wrote, "If I can stop one heart from breaking/ I shall not live in vain/ If I can ease one life the aching/Or cool one pain, Or help a fainting robin/Unto his nest again; I shall not live in vain.</span>
