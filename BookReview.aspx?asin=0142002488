                    <span>As a life coach for Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to choose just one,) I'm tickled when career books don't assume everyone has known what they've wanted to be since they were ten! Maybe Mozart could do the same thing all his life, but lots of us thrive on change!  This book can be a great tool when a Renaissance Soul feels "done" with one interest and now needs to move on to finding something else.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is wonderful at helping you figure what you want.  There are three sections: "Where are you?," "Where do you want to be?," and "How do you get there?"  Each of these sections provides you with insight into problems that many face, things to contemplate, and reasonable steps to find more satisfying work.  This book doesn't try to answer all of your questions or tell you what you should do.  Rather, it provides you with a framework to help discover what potentially could be more fulfilling.  I felt the resources section helpful for further reading for each of the topics.
<br />
<br />There are several exercises that help you get a better idea of what you would find interesting and satisfying.  I would suggest going through the exercises with someone who knows you well.  My wife was very helpful in helping me answer some of the questions and providing a different perspective.
<br />
<br />After going through the exercises, I recognized a few things I should skip and others that I should concentrate on.  I haven't figured it all out yet.  But, now I am a little more focused on what's important.  I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>This title provides effective exercises for would-be career changers and entreprenuers.  After spending 10 years in the corporate world and making a couple unsuccessful attempts at small business, I found myself thinking "I don't know what I want, but this isn't it."  Locked into a career that pays well, but has little else to recommend it, I've been having a hard time finding a vocation that offers fulfillment, but doesn't involve going broke in the process.  The exercises in this book helped me clarify what I want (and do not want) from my work-life and helped me to develop a plan to acheive it.  I recommend using this book in conjunction with "Do What You Are" by Tieger.</span>

                    <span>I found out a little more about myself as far as attitudes and personality (not much I didn't already know; just a litte reaffirming I guess to have gone over the exercises), but I still don't know what I want.<p>The book may help you, or maybe not, place yourself into one of the six categories the author describes on why you want to change jobs.  The book may also help you itemize your values, attitudes, change readiness, personality preferences, interests and skills into neat categories.  The book does nothing in helping push you to finding gratifying work.</span>

                    <span>I found the information and exercises in this book to be a simple aggregation of the standard self-help/self-improvement informaton that you'd get from an ineffective career counselor, HR manager, or a corporate management consultant.  Many of the excercises are wandering and unfocused, and not very helpful in determining goals and action plans for change.  I'd like my money back, but more importantly, I'd like the time I spent reading the first few chapters back.</span>
