                    <span>Wow...this guy was something else. Here we have Junky: a novel written by one of the most twisted yet interesting writers of his day. Burroughs tells a story of what it was like to be a heroine addict in the 1920's and 30's. How he had to find crooked pharmacists and had to watch out for the cops. I thought it was interesting that he mentions how the use of heroine has strengthened him to living a long life. But who knows he did die at 89. So maybe he was right or lucky. He goes into quite a lot of detail regarding the ups and downs of heroine addiction. Never a dull moment. </span>

                    <span>My Favorite of Burroughs and by far the most accessible of his work that is hilarious and haunting it is hard to imagine someone writing crazy stuff back then. Keith Richards wasn't even born then but others primarily American artists were apparently struggling with the junk sickness. Despite our apparent vapid state in the eyes of the world we have held on to a certain underworld. Not so much that Junk was the only thing but the art that came along with it as like a tsunami for the later waves of British influence. It is ironic how the people of America often feel inadequate to their European counterparts - Even Canada! When we really look at things it becomes clear how the invasions are going in many directions. Neil got by on his charisma alone and he was not much of a roommate, so I have been told. This book is one of the mother loads for sure and a good lead into the deeper stuff of Burroughs and many of his contemporary. I loved the fight with the cat perhaps most of all.

                    <span>Junky is a novel i can relate to.  The story Burroughs writes is not about heroin; sure, most of the characters are smack addicts but more importantly they are just addicts.  I tried to read Naked Lunch by the same author a couple of years ago but had to finish on about the third page.  For someone with an experience of the seedy world of drugs, Burroughs writing can be disturbing.  I suppose if i was still on drugs while i tried reading Naked Lunch it may have seemed glamorous.  That is the brilliance of Burroughs.  He was a junky until he died - from morphine to smack to methadone.  For an addict, life is junk.  So in a sense, Burroughs does write a story about junk - he writes a story about life.  Yet, not only the life of an addict; Junky is the tale of a journey.  A man who needs to escape the meaningless existence of a junk virgin.  Of course, not everyone will agree, maybe you never touched junk, maybe your life is full of existence, maybe you believe in God or get off on sky diving or whatever i dont know.  I loved this book because in gets inside my head.  The late William Burroughs sticks his hand through the covers, throttles me around the neck.  "Read the ****** book, feel my pain, get off your lazy behind at live life..."  I am an arrogant nasty man, i have a zest for suffering.  I dont even bother picking up a book unless its going to make me work.  I hate life and so did Burroughs; if there is a God and there is a Heaven, he doesnt like me and he doesnt like Burroughs, both of us are going to hell.  Please dont feel sorry for this great man, and dont believe for a second that there is a moral to the story.  I didnt use drugs for any particular reason but the way i used was destructive - an addict by definition is a bad person.  It makes me laugh just to say that because i always try to convince myself its not true.  All the same i may ask, what is bad and what is good.  How can you judge me, why do i judge Burroughs.  But the truth is, we all feel hatred - Life sucks. Go ol' Will' knew all this and thats why he kept sticking needles in his arms and drinking methadone till he found a better place.  He was too unsure, he was afraid but accordingly to the rules we all lay down, he was a bad person.  He was a user, not just of drugs but of people, he was a manipulator.  He was a married man and didnt mention his wife but once in the whole novel.  He was a self centered, arrogant, nasty piece of work - He was real - Burroughs was a real man and he was a damn fine writer...Sanity is the great barrier to fine art.  Junky is a fine novel; a portrayl of a good, honest man living in a world of labels and regulations.  You say he was insane, you that will read this review and hate me for wasting your time.  And that guy over there and the girl across the sea, far, far away...they both think, wow...i really want to buy that book.  Thanks Jason...your awesome.  JUNKY - Its real.</span>

                    <span>William S. Burroughs looked for America through an angry fix and apparently found it. His first novel is filled with beat-poet anachronisms and more. It is a diary of an unrepentant soul gone south into the depths of Hell. "I was in a cell with four strangers-- Three of them were addicts...God help my pink ass." 
<br />Holy Christ, I rest my case.
<br />My Review: Shocking, violent, beautiful and unhinged, "Junky" is the ultimate 50's beat-poet statement of rage, guilt, addiction and damnation-- worthy of Dante's "Inferno"...</span>

                    <span>Yep, the title pretty much sums it up; a franked, personal recording of drug addiction in rather more innocent times, it makes for a very interesting and enjoyable read of a bygone era in the American underground scene during Hoover's war on drugs.</span>
