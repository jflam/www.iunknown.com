                <span id="Label1">Scott Kelby is both funny <I>and</I> generous. His wry sense of humor doesn't get in the way of the hundreds of nifty techniques in this new collection of <I>Down & Dirty Tricks</I>. In fact, when you first flip quickly through the book, gobbling up all the creative ideas and timesaving tips, his sly jokes only add to the I've-just-hit-the-lottery feeling.<p>Whatever you're looking for--type that looks distressed, made of gel, or carved in stone; shadows in perspective or in motion; text that wraps around a globe; a glinting starburst on the edge of an object; a logo artificially placed at the bottom of a pool; or a starry sky created in an instant--just about every trick is here. And most are done in 10 steps or less. Also, each page has a Quick Tip sidebar (there're over 200 of them) that are worth the price of the book alone, with everything from getting better results from your eyedropper tool (click on Options and change the Point Sample to "3 by 3 average") to the quickest way to change units of measurement (the secret is in the Info palette).<p>The book has been updated since the previous edition with mostly new illustrations, many new and better ways to perform the same tricks, and a few completely new ones. Project files and images can be downloaded from the book's companion Web site at downanddirtytricks.com. Although aimed at experienced Photoshop users, the text is detailed enough for readers of all levels. For example, steps like "make a copy of that layer by dragging it to the New Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers palette" or "press the letter <i>m</i> to switch to the Rectangular Marquee tool" are repeated in full whenever a trick calls for them. This not only helps beginners, it allows all readers to hop around the book and be able to carry out any trick in any order. Yet another reason this book could've been titled <I>Speedy Down & Dirty Tricks</i>. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>"Down and Dirty Tricks" by Scott Kelby is more than just a collection of tutorials on how to get dynamic effects with Adobe Photoshop's plethora of options, it is a way for PS users to familarize theirselves with all the program has to offer through these step-by-step recipes for creating eye-catching effects in digital art and graphics. While naysayers make the point that Kelby has simply rehashed many frequently seen tutorials from the Web, that is not true. Many tutorials to create similar effects to the ones found here can be seen on different sites, such as teamphotoshop.com, but Kelby's instructions and well-rounded use of the program through the book's tutorials should give even an inexperienced PS user a good time learning the program and a good variety of skills. This book is a valuable addition to the library of any graphic artist or desiger or just anyone who is interested in doing things with Photoshop. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>While it's certainly worth the time and effort to learn about Photoshop's features and functions the hard way, sometimes it's nice to just be able to whip out a cool effect in a few minutes. Scott Kelby gives users dozens of sample projects, as well as hundreds of individual tips and tricks, in a step-by-step format that even beginners can follow.<P>The effects are divided by broad category (type effects, photo effects, drop-shadow effects, etc.), which is helpful if you sort of know what you want your finished effect to look like -- but, it's also fun just to browse the book and try something that looks interesting. Kelby's writing style is clear, but funny at the same time; you certainly shouldn't get bored working your way through any of the effects. Also, his concise yet informative step-by-step captions will give new and experienced users material for further experimentation and tweaking.<P>Some reviews have commented that certain sections contained errors. I haven't worked my way through every single section of the book yet, but of those I have (roughly two-thirds) there have been no glaring errors or omissions. This isn't to say there aren't typos or errors; I'm sure there probably are, just as there are in almost every book. I haven't found any that have detracted from the value or clarity of the book, however.<P>PS7 Down & Dirty Tricks really isn't a "learn PS7" book, so I don't recommend it for that purpose, though it is instructional. Buy a good, comprehensive book first, and then buy this one so you can have some quick fun when you bog down on channels, paths, or some other confusing topic in your "big" book. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>this was one of teh first photoshop books i bought, along with another of Scott Kelby's books Photoshop for Digital Photographers, they are both great and make an excellent reference pair. Down and Dirty tricks was infinitely helpful to me, before it i really didn't know how to use any of the good tools in photoshop, and even though the book is set up as seperate instructions on how to make specific projects (which can be rather helpful at times so you can just jump in and start), I learned techniques and tricks that i use everyday in photoshop, and the side bars in this book help almost as much as the main content, giving you keyboard shortcuts and extra info. Although this book is not very indepth about advanced concepts in photoshop, it shows you how to do alot of neat stuff and Scott Kelby is a funny author so its not as dry as some of the other photoshop books I have read.</span>

My students simply love to try out all of the possibilites this book offers while practicing the tools and effects that Photoshop offer us. That book revealed some features of Photoshop that I never used before. Easy to use, easy to learn and very straight forward content.</span>
