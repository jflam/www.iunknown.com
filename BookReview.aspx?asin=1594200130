                <span id="Label1">"The United States today is an empire&#151;but a peculiar kind of empire," writes Niall Ferguson. Despite overwhelming military, economic, and cultural dominance, America has had a difficult time imposing its will on other nations, mostly because the country is uncomfortable with imperialism and thus unable to use this power most effectively and decisively. The origin of this attitude and its persistence is a principal theme of this thought-provoking book, including how domestic politics affects foreign policy, whether it is politicians worried about the next election or citizens who "like Social Security more than national security." Ferguson, a British historian, has no objection to an American empire, as long as it is a liberal one actively underwriting the free exchange of goods, labor, and capital. Further, he writes that "empire is more necessary in the twenty-first century than ever before" as a means to "contain epidemics, depose tyrants, end local wars and eradicate terrorist organizations." The sooner America embraces this role and acts on it confidently, the better. Ferguson contrasts this persistent anti-imperialistic urge with the attitude held by the British Empire and suggests that America has much to learn from that model if it is to achieve its stated foreign policy objectives of spreading social freedom, democracy, development, and the free market to the world. He suggests that the U.S. must be willing to send money, civilians, and troops for a sustained period of time to troubled spots if there is to be real change&#151;as in Japan and Germany after World War II--an idea that many American citizens and leaders now find repulsive. Rather than devoting limited resources and striving to get complex jobs done in a rush, Americans must be willing to integrate themselves into a foreign culture until a full Americanization has occurred, he writes. Overall, a trenchant examination of a uniquely American dilemma and its implications for the rest of the world. --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>Niall Ferguson is a brilliant scholar and a talented writer. As a prose stylist, in fact, he may have no equal in the among historians his age. In fact, Ferguson modeled his writing style on the late popular historian A.J.P. Taylor, who also reached a large, popular audience through his writings and lectures. Unfortunately, Ferguson's dazzling rhetorical skill camouflages an occasionally interesting, but highly dishonest book.<P>For Ferguson, like Taylor, has a very serious weakness. <BR>He understands European history (and its colonial appendages in the 19th and 20th century) very well. But he is WAY out of his depth writing about the 21st century, and world affairs. Worse, Ferguson is so desperate for America to be an 'honest and successful' empire that he intentionally misleads his readers to advance his dubious passion.<P>Ferguson claims that America can invade and successfully reform 'failed societies', were it not handicapped by an unfortunate 'imperial deficit disorder'; i.e. a refusal to commit the manpower (half-a-million soldiers for invasions, hundreds of thousands for occupation), time (decades), and money (hundreds of billions of dollars) necessary for (possibly) successful imperialism.<P>Put this way (in hard numbers, not catchy-cutesy phrases like 'imperial ADD'), Ferguson's proposals seems absurd; indeed, almost megolamaniacal. Nevertheless, it remains a very popular view among armchair generals (just look at some of the sycophantic reviews here!). However, most Americans would never agree to such massive imperial commitments-nor should they. Donald Rumsfeld (whatever his shortcomings) was fully aware of this. His attempt to invade and occupy Iraq using a relatively small, affordable, high-tech army proved to be an abject failure, even before the occupation descended into a nightmarish maelstrom of torture, chaos and corruption. But unlike Ferguson's pie-in-the-sky, million-man imperial army, Rumsfeld's plan was not complete fantasy.<P>And here we arrive at the heart of the matter: empires cost money. For all of Ferguson's whining about how Americans are unwilling to 'pay the cost of empire', it is never made clear why they should do so. Deposing brutal dictators is indeed laudable goal, but most Americans will oppose intervention unless it is perceived as cheap (in both lives and money) or necessary (for national security). This might disappoint Ferguson, but the historical record does not seem to support his views of 'benevolent empire'.<P>Ferguson is so desperate to see America play the role of 'New Model British Empire' that he descends into uncharacteristic intellectual dishonesty. He absurdly uses Japan and Germany (long established nation-states, ethnically homogenous, enjoying temperate climates, ultra-indutrialized...) as the paradigmic examples of successful American occupations. <P>In fact, Nicaragua, Liberia, and South Vietnam are far more representative of America's attempts at 'nation-building': tropical, agricultural countries ruled by corrupt elites, where the US sank billions of dollars into the pockets of brutal dicatators (and in the case of Vietnam, saw thousands of American and *millions* of Vietnamese die) only to reap a legacy of hatred and failure. Iraq seems destined to be the latest (and hopefully the last) in a long series of American imperial failures.<P>In his continuing quest to justify American empire, Ferguson ends his book grasping at straws. He points out that Medicare (the medical insurance program for seniors) costs more than the Defense budget, and suggests that cuting Medicare would make it possible for the US to engage in regular imperial operations of foreign invasion and occupation without adversely affecting the lives of ordinary Americans. Does Ferguson seriously believe that *any* American would risk death from illness or seeing their parents die for lack of medical treatment...for the sake of empire??? Or does he suggest that Medicaid can be magically 'reformed' to deliver the same service at half the cost (but if fiscal magic tricks are so easy, why not do the same with the defense budget?) <P>As the more honest British writer Anatol Lieven bluntly put it: America can either have an army capable of dominating the world; or medical care and pensions; or tax cuts for the rich. We can't afford all three; in fact, we can probably only afford one of these choices. Attempting to have guns, butter AND tax cuts, AND paying for it by borrowing from abroad AND printing money is obviously recipe for disaster-on this last point, at least, Ferguson is clear and correct. Unfortunately, it is what we are doing right now.<P>Niall Ferguson has written excellent books on the British empire, financial history, business history, and historiography. But in Colossus, he is clearly out of his depth; worse, his advocacy of an "American Empire" has led him to write a dishonest and misleading book. A great dissapointment from such a great scholar.</span>

                    <span>This is a compelling and worthwhile read. It is not an "anti-US" book, but provides constructive analysis of foreign policy. Niall Ferguson is a professor at NYU plus a fellow at Oxford and the Stanford Hoover Institution. He has authored six other books on politics, history, and economics. In this book he attempts to bring together economic data, history, and political concepts to prove some points about the role of "empires" in the spreading of economic and political benefits.<P>One of his main points concerns the success of past empires such as the British Empire in the spread of democratic institutions, democratic ideals, trade, investment, and economic growth. The British Empire was in fact a vehicle that spread positive economic and social development across the globe. It provided a political and economic framework for the development of many countries and regions. When there was de-colonization, some of the poorer countries that were not yet self sufficient failed to sustain develop on their own and have remained mired in war, disease, etc. and run by various undemocratic repressive regimes. These states - some even with the benefit of oil wealth - among others are now "failed states" and are problematic to themselves and other world citizens.<P>The author claims that the UN is really quite a small and an ineffective political institution having a budget of less than 0.1% of the US federal government. It is not an institution (yet) where we can solve the world's problems. The US on the other hand, although far larger than any other country economically and militarily, is caught in an imperialistic ambivalence in which the US can perceive injustices and can in fact invade countries with overwhelming military force, but then lacks the ability to remain focused for any length of time once the war is over. Once the quick military victory is won, it wants to bring the troops home and in general it fails to follow through. The invaded country is not left in a state of political equilibrium or economic self sufficiency. Lacking the needed stability and permanent reform, such countries remain problem "failed states" - like Afghanistan. <P>He claims that the US is an imperialistic nation but is in a state of self denial. Even though the rest of the world views the US as imperialistic, the US itself fails to grasp or wants to avoid that concept because of the potential negative self image connotations. So the US remains ambivalent and confused in its foreign policy, and according to the author lacks the ability to carry out comprehensive and coherent foreign policy. Symptomatic of that is the concept of a limited war - sending for example 250,000 troops to Iraq when the generals said send 500,000 (my figures). Also he thinks that US suffers from an "attention deficit" syndrome, plus self doubts, internal confusion, and looks for quick military solutions. It remains largely fearful of any long term conflict that produces American casualties similar to Vietnam. Conflicts that produce casualties - be they peace keeping or otherwise - quickly loose US domestic public support. The author claims that the American political leadership has been reluctant to make a case for sustained foreign involvement - often not finishing an engagement - even though a greater effort is often needed to solve the problem and reverse the fortunes of many "failed states". <P>The US administration says that it is not in the business of nation building, but according to the author a long term investment in many countries is in fact that is the only way to solve the problems in a more permanent fashion (as we did in Germany and Japan).<P>This is a very well written book with lots of facts and figures. It tends to pull together a lot of nebulous concepts and bring them into focus. Highly recommend. I found it to be a compelling read. Five stars.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>The author claims that Palestinian terrorism in Israel is the result of Israel's failure to negotiate peace and instead make war on terrorism. He either intentionally or ignorantly omits a consideration of the fact that israel numerous times has offered peace to the Palestinians, and most recently offered to give the Palestinians it's entire infrastructure in Judea and Samaria and Gaza (i.e. all the housing, etc.). The result of that offer was the most recent intifada. You can't negotiate with an enemy who irrevocably wants to destroy you, or who in many cases sees your destruction as an end in itself.<P>Although the author writes with seeming intelligence and insight, his failure to acknowledge basic facts such as those I have presented above, discredits his own work. If he fails to inform his reader correctly on one issue, how can one know whether or not he falsly presents facts on other issues. I don't know whether or not to believe him.<P>Sometimes we believe people know what they are talking about because they write or speak well, not because what they have to say is true. I believe this is one of those cases.</span>

                    <span>"Colossus" is a typical Niall Ferguson book. It is provocative and contains fresh insights; it navigates with considerable ease between history, politics, and economics; and it is extremely well written, illuminating succinctly the author's thoughts and engaging the reader's interest.<P>Mr. Ferguson, formerly of Oxford and now a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, writes to sketch out the reality of America's global position-to argue that, for all intents and purposes, America is an empire. Mr. Ferguson is not fundamentally opposed to empires-not because he likes foreign control but because he recognizes a benign type of liberal empire that can afford both the metropolis and periphery with benefits that independence cannot.<P>"Colossus" surveys various themes, beginning on whether America constitutes an empire (yes), then surveying America's ascent to its role as a global power, and finally gauging America's relation to multilateralism and its allies (American unilateralism, he argues, has more to do with the United Nations' overall failure to achieve certain objectives than with American instincts.)<P>But the real question is, what is the impact of this empire? Mr. Ferguson is enthusiastic about the prospect of a liberal empire, a position he bases on the record of decolonization; decolonization, he writes, was "an experiment to test the hypothesis that it was imperialism that caused both poverty and wars and that self-determination would ultimately pave the way to prosperity and peace. That hypothesis has been largely proven false."<P>For all his eagerness for America to play its role and underwrite the current wave of globalization, Mr. Ferguson is skeptical about America's ability to be an effective liberal empire. Empires, he argues, need to go places, learn their histories, and expend the money, manpower, and attention to get the job done. America's celebrated examples of nation-building-Germany and Japan-took years to complete; and both countries still retain American troop presences. All this is in contrast with America's appetite for an exit strategy from Iraq and Afghanistan. <P>In other words, America should be a global leader, but is unlikely to be an effective one, unless it undergoes a profound metamorphosis of the way it views its imperial role. America's looming economic liabilities are also going to alter America's budgetary orientation, possibly affecting its position as a superpower. Whether Mr. Ferguson is right in his predictions remains to be seen; but "Colossus" will surely stand out as one of the most authoritative and comprehensive reviews of America's role as an imperial power.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of those precious works that goes in and re-arranges the brain cells, causing your perceptions of the world at large to be made sharper and clearer than they were before reading it. The author provides such a thoughtful and creative array of views on the subject of Empire, and America's role as an Empire, that my own perceptions of American influence in the world has undergone a complete overhaul. Even if you disagree with the author's points, as I did on many occasions, your own thinking on the subject will be made more structured and coherent as a result of being exposed to the author's revealing discussion. <P>It should be mentioned that Ferguson does not knee-jerkingly cast Empire in a negative light, as I believe its title mistakenly suggests he is going to do. He asserts that the kind of empire that America could be would be a good thing for the world, if America would but live up to that potential. His conclusions as to why and what will keep America from living up to that potential are both sobering and "hit the nail on the head" on target. <P>All of the simplistic criticisms of American power that litter the New Arrivals tables these days makes this book stand out as doubly worthwhile. Niall Ferguson's book provides a provocative education on a topic, American power and empire, that grows more important with every day.</span>
