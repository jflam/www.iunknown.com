                <span id="Label1">Extensible Markup Language (XML) has been perhaps the biggest buzzword in application development for several years and now Microsoft has taken XML into the core of its .NET Framework. This book is aimed at teaching XML (and related technologies such as XPath, XSLT, and XML Schema) to beginning and intermediate C# developers who want to understand what all the fuss is about. <P> Over the course of the book readers will develop a good appreciation of not only what XML is, and how to handle it in C#, but also how to use XML to build applications to run on a single desktop, single web server or distributed, multi-platform web services, in ways that have been extremely difficult to achieve with previous technologies. <P> To reinforce the core concepts, the book makes use of numerous individual examples along with two case studies. Firstly, there is an examination of how different XML based approaches can be used in the development of a contact application. The complexity of the project develops as the reader's knowledge increases through the book. Secondly, we dedicate a full chapter to describing the use of XML and a SQL Server database in the implementation of a web-based news portal.</span>

                    <span>As some have pointed out, there are flaws in the code in the book (not major ones, though, and with a basic c# understanding you can work around them).<P>Also, most of the URLs associated with this book are dead, so finding the resources you need to use this book (i.e. try to find the downloadable code) is impossible. It looks like Chapter two provides some resources in on-line only format, which of course means, you don't get them and can't try out what the book tells you to try out.<P>However, In the end, the book covers its core material well, and is one of the few books on its topic. The reason I give it four stars is because I was looking for a book on exactly this topic and this book was available and seems to be serving my need well.<P>The reason I don't give it five stars is that the URL *on* *the* *book's* *cover* is dead, and you can't find the relevant resources.<BR>----<(...)</span>

                    <span>This is a code snippet from the book on page 25 (first code sample in the book):<BR>DataTable objTable = new DataTable();<BR>DataRow objNewRow;<BR>objDataSet.WriteXML( "C:\\AddXML\\Contacts2.xml" );<BR>DataSet objDataSet2 = new DataSet();<BR>objDataSet2.ReadXML( "C:\\AddXML\\Contacts2.xml" );<BR>dataGrid1.DataSource = objDataSet2.Tables[0].DefaultView;<P>Now, where exactly is the objNewRow used? Why declare it if you're not going to instantiate it or reference something with it?<P>And that London guy found no flaws in the code? This is the first code example in the book, and already I can't figure out what they're trying to do. Also, this preceded that last snippet:<BR>string XmlFilename;<BR>XmlFilename = "C:\\AddXML\\contacts.xml";<P>Okay... assuming that we're using Hungarian notation, which is what the author did in a rather odd way in the earlier example, why not just do this:<BR>string _strXmlFilename = @"C:\AddXML\contacts.xml";<P>I used an underscore to denote that the variable is private. No matter.<P>People code some strange stuff, in some strange ways. But Wrox just gets me. It seems like they were producing just total crap in the past couple of years. I bought this book because it was only 10 bucks at Borders, and I guess it's worth the 10 bucks in that it gives me sheer delight to know that these guys made so much more money than I ever will, and I still code better than them.<P>-Ryan Cammer<BR>ryancammer@yahoo.com</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as an introductory text to teach myself XML with C#. The book gives me that, but it could have been done far better. I am left with the overall impression that this was either a first time effort for the authors, or that the book was rushed to make a deadline and not enough editorial review and proof-reading took place (I suspect both).<P>Simple things like the illogical order in which topics are presented throughout each chapter, misleading diagrams, unclear or just plain bad use of grammar, inadequate use of examples in the early chapters, some VB code snippets (it's supposed to be a C# book) are all simple mistakes that could have been eliminated at editorial stage, and which, had this been done, would have made for a far better reader experience.<P>This book does it's job, but I am sure there are better texts out there.</span>

                    <span>This is not an easy book to read. The first 3 chapters are very heavy going with little in the way of productive examples. I was looking for a book that gave me the basics of XML with C#. I was not looking for a book that spent the first 3 chapters covering the basics of XML on its own. <P>Having said that, I think the authors do a fairly good job of covering the material that they are attempting to do. This is definitely an introduction to XML, though, and there are a lot of unanswered detail questions that you will obviously need to research in other books.<P>There are several mistakes in the quoted code, and the fact that the WROX site is no longer available makes this a tough book to work through. Fortunately my C# is good enough to spot most of the syntactical errors, but I pity someone who is new to C# too.<P>In a nutshell, this book is okay, but you're going to need a lot more than this to really get to grips with the stuff.<P>I'm going to look at a couple of the O'Reilly books...</span>
