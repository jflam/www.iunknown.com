                    <span>I was searching for a book to help me build my vocabulary in preparation for the GRE.  Of course, I always read the customer reviews before I make any purchase here.  I must say that the previous review that gave this book only one star encouraged me the most to buy the book.  It appears that this reviewer is in more desparate need for a grammar book than a vocabulary book (you can always work on that later, love).  This review will not help anyone decide whether or not to buy the book, but take my advice and analyze how the reviewer writes--not just WHAT they write, lol.</span>

                    <span>Nurnberg and Rosenblum did a fine job putting together this book of vocabulary words.  The different chapters focus on various themes or groups of words, including some from mythology.  Some rather obscure and challenging terms are included, and I particularly liked that aspect of this publication.  If you're looking for an entertaining vocabulary building book that includes more words than other competing items, then this is the ideal vade mecum for you.</span>

                    <span>I got this book while preparing to take the GRE. Their choice of words and their explanations are very good. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who does not just want to cramme the words for an exam. If you love english, you will love this book.</span>

                    <span>I bought 3 vocabulary books for study during summer. Among those 3, this book has the worst quality. the words in this book are too old (1950s) Maybe my grand father found this book was useful in that days. But not  now!. And the examples and explanations are so weak that these words don't  make any chunk as they insist! Moreover, this book has unreasonable higher  price than other vocablary books. the paper is so low quality . And the  letters are too small to percieve. You might regret if you buy this low  quality book. I recommend to buy "1100 words you need to know".  That was really helpful.</span>

                    <span>This is the most incredibly wonderful book written on the subject of words.  The approach is not like  wordlists but is full of stories and anecdotes.  This book is an eyeopener for the wonderful world of words.<p>A must for anyone interested in words at any level.</span>
