                <span id="Label1">"What I think Date has done is nothing less than to lay out the foundational concepts for the next generation of business logic servers based on predicate logic. Such a breakthrough should revolutionize application development in our industry -- and take business rules to their fullest expression." --Ronald G. Ross, Principal, Business Rule Solutions, LLC Executive Editor, DataToKnowledge Newsletter  The way we build computer applications is about to change dramatically, thanks to a new development technology known as business rules. The key idea behind the technology is that we can build applications declaratively instead of procedurally -- that is, we can simply state WHAT needs to be done instead of HOW to do what needs to be done.  The advantages are obvious: ease and rapidity of initial development and subsequent maintenance; hardware and software platform independence; overall productivity; business adaptivity; and more.  What Not How: The Business Rules Approach to Application Development is a concise and accessible introduction to this new technology. It is written for both managers and technical professionals. It consists of two parts: Part I presents a broad overview of what business rules are all about; Part II then revisits the ideas in Part I and shows how they fit squarely into the solid tradition of relational technology. Topics covered include: <P>Presentation rules <P>Database and application rules <P>Building on the data model <P>Potential advantages and disadvantages <P>A new look at relational fundamentals <P>Business rules and the relational model  Overall, the book provides a good grounding in an important new technology, one poised to transform the way we do business in the I.T. world.</span>

                    <span>First off, it is difficult to give a fair review to a book with a copywrite date of 2000 that I am just now reading.  The concepts are interesting and reasonable, but I don't think the state of things is as bad as the author suggests.  Section II wraps up by stating that business rules *should* be able to be expressed in constraints, but the SQL vendors have let us down in this area.  I find that most of the constraints that the author describes are supported by Oracle 8i which is not a new release of the product.  Much is made of automating business rules using Rule Engines, but it seems that these can be handled in the DBMS.  The advice on data modeling in the last chapter is good, and I think you can come away with a different way of looking at things.  After reading the book, though, I am not overwhelmed with the urgent need to have my team invest in a Business Rules Engine.</span>

                    <span>At first I was pleased with this Book, but as I progressed through the Chapters I got progressively more disappointed. In conclusion, I think the comments on the back page say it all "provides a good grounding" - I'd rate it 'average to good' - but certainly not `excellent'.<br>What lets it down are the pitiful worked examples. They are key to explaining the concepts, but the choices are terrible. They focus on Inventory Control, but I wonder if the author has ever done any real analysis in this arena? <br>In Chapter 4 a few examples are introduced, that reappear throughout the book, for example : <br>(a) "Suppliers S1 and S4 are always in the same City" - and this is reaffirmed as 'being not all unrealistic'<br>(b) "Suppliers in Athens can move only to London or Paris"<br>(c) "Average shipment quantities never decrease"<br>but in my 25 years experience in systems design I could never imagine these rules as being acceptable in their own right, never mind as 'classics' to be used in training/education?<br>When one finds poor examples like this, it always make me wonder whether there's other topics in the book that in my naivety I am accepting hook, line & sinker, and others readers more familiar than me would similarly find to be in error? I suppose I'll never know. So I still need to read further about the topic in case I've been misinformed; so if you're going to buy one book about business rules - then this isn't the one.</span>

                    <span>This book clearly lays out the case for declarative application development and presents what is required to achieve the next level of development automation.  The material is easy to consume and will never be outdated.<p>For those that are "in the trenches", the book's content may seem too far from current reality be useful.  The fact is, technology which implements the ideas Date describes, now exist, and will be pervasive shortly.  Current model-based code generation tools come close, and there is at least one product that fully realizes Date's suggestions ...<p>Those wishing to stay ahead of the curve will benefit greatly from understanding the fundamental concepts presented in this book.</span>

                    <span>The book seemed to be interesting when I glanced through it in the IT-bookstore. I also thought that it would have it's "message" in a very compact and intense form, since it's fairly short book.<p>Well, first of all the book's layout seems to  support my feeling of rip-off; the page margins are huge, font is big, and everything seems to echo the fact that they wanted to artificially lengthen the book.<p>And the content isn't in a terse format, but more like keeps saying the same things again and again, stuffed with some quotes from other authors who seem to support his theories. He even interprets one of the quotes, so that it fits his theory! <p>Also what irritates is his "Tutorial D" language, which he uses to illustrate his point. To justify a use of a language that is not familiar to anybody, would require more in-depth academical study of the subject. <p>In short: Mr. Date seems to found something that he values greatly, and what he thinks will revolutionize the software development in future. If he's on to something, he doesn't communicate it in a very clear way.<p>Damn. That was like throwing my money away.</span>

                    <span>To me the content of this book is not more than I would expect in a magazine article or something from an op-ed page.  As with anything from Chris Date, it seems to mostly be pointing out how miserably the "relational" database vendors have implemented the One True relational model introduced by Codd and championed by Date.  Beyond that, it makes the point that "business rules", the semantic layer typically bolted ad hoc onto a "relational" database with triggers and "application" layers, are better enforced as some sort of constraints expressed as part of a more formal "data model" of the database.<p>Beyond that the book does not seem to say much, and I do not see that it offers the reader anything more than opinions.  I personally agree that "relational" databases like Oracle, DB2, SQLServer, PostgreSQL, etc., do not really provide a "relational" database in the sense that Chris Date thinks of "relational", and I agree that it would be better to shift some "business rule" enforcement towards the database.  But I do not think these things are likely to happen as described in this book anytime soon, and in any case I do not think this book offers anything to current or future users of any databases which is not offered much better by other books.</span>
