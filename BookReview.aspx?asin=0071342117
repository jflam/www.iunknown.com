                <span id="Label1">From the early 1950s into the late '80s, IBM <I>was</I> the computer industry. Not only that, IBM was, to many, industry itself. It consistently set the standard for corporate performance and profitability, both in the U.S. and worldwide. But that all changed in a strange, swift, and brutal way. IBM--which had fiddled while Microsoft and Intel created a firestorm in the personal-computer world--lost money for three consecutive years in the early '90s. The decision to allow Microsoft to control PC software and Intel to supply the microprocessors (they're both companies IBM could've easily bought out early in the game) came back to bite IBM on its bloated blue butt. And its no-layoffs policy, though admirable, meant the company kept a workforce of more than 300,000, making decisions at a glacial pace while other companies nimbly jumped from one new market to the next.<p>  All that changed when Lou Gerstner was named CEO of IBM in 1993. Gerstner had already led turnarounds at American Express and RJR Nabisco, and, as <I>Saving Big Blue</I> details, he proved to be the right man for the job. Gerstner started by changing the company's funereal dress code and eventually redirected the company to provide computer services rather than just computers. <I>Saving Big Blue</I> makes for interesting reading as a case study, but also provides a blueprint for any manager attempting to turn around a business. <I>--Lou Schuler</I></span>

                    <span>As both an IBM employee & one very interested in the workings of this unique company, I enjoyed reading 2 just-released books in the past 2 weeks, Robert Slater's Saving IBM and Garr's. Slater's was the business case version of IBM. Garr's was the real scoop behind the workings of not just Gerstner but his many lieutenants, both long-time IBM employees and outsiders. Although I was somewhat embarrassed by some of Garr's stories, including the FUMU's, I still enjoyed the book. I was disappointed in the lack of coverage with IBM Global Services.</span>

                    <span>As a former employee of both IBM and AT&T, I lived through years of lack of leadership, innovation and bad management decisions. Lou Gerstner demonstrated that a few common sense principles (listen, customers, focus) go a long way in building a business. I enjoyed the book very much and recommended it to my co-workers.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Listen, my children, and you shall hear the incredible saga of how IBM nearly died and was revived by Lou Gerstner. Robert Slater tells the tale of IBM's turnaround after it nearly sank under the weight of institutionalized arrogance and failure to heed advancements in the industry it had dominated. Gerstner broke company tradition, fired employees who believed they had a sinecure, slashed a decade-old bureaucracy, and switched IBM's focus from products to solutions. This action portrait shows a man smart enough and tough enough to rebuild an empire. The book's lessons are artfully woven into the fabric of Gerstner's personal story and IBM's corporate history. We [...] recommend this book to any high level executive whose organization needs a revolution or to any businessperson who wants a juicy reminder of what it takes to win the war of independence.<br></span>

                    <span>I was disappointed by this book. As an ex-IBM'er who was there during the bad times as well as the Gerstner led recovery, I was looking forward to insights about the times and the man. The book lacked both. It was written in a sloppy way, with the same tired facts about stock price recovery and growth in different parts of IBM's business being repeated over and over again. When it appeared there would be some fascinating insight, it faded into nothingness e.g. when Slater started to write about the demise of senior execs, the best he could do was trot out some triteness about the disposal of Lou's brother Richard who was at that time a consultant. The book was filled with quotes from Fortune and many other business magazines as if all his research was done from them. Over all, a disappointment.</span>
