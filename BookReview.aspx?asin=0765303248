                    <span>It's truly special how La Plante somehow takes one's own gritty reality of life, death and divorce, sends them off on a bike ride through time, space and climates, and ends up with a journey full of humor, sensitivity, hope and dreams.  This book is a vacation for the soul complete with pit-stops for laughter, tears, and reflection.  <p>Sure would love to let loose and really take such a trip but until then, I'll take my daily dose of Detours to remind me to keep the perspective by getting lost.<p>PS... I'm off to Ebay to buy a bike!</span>

                    <span>INCREDIBLY AWESOME!! LaPlante has captured the very essence of what we all yearn for....IT! A search into the mirror for the true meaning of hardaches, joy, love, honesty, fellowship and sincere happiness. One doesn't need to be a motorcycle enthusiast to savor the rewards this adventure will salivate. His humorous style will leave you giddy but the real story lies between the Hamptons of New York and the hallowed ground of the Black Hills of South Dakota. His wit and outrageous cast of characters makes this wild ride a must read, all the way home. This true exploration will leave a reflection in the mirror. Destined to end up a classic!</span>

                    <span>A man comes to terms with his life's decisions and puts them into perspective during his lone bike trip from East Hampton, NY, to Sturgis, South Dakota.  Honest and without pretention, it will make you want to take a break from daily routine to prioritize and appreciate what we all take for granted. You do not need to be into motorcycles to enjoy this gem of a book.</span>

                    <span>Author Richard la Plante wanted to once live his American dream of attending the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.  However, the now fiftyish Richard knew his time to consummate his dream apparently passed and he always would be a couch potato wondering what he missed.  With a young child and a pregnant wife and now fifty-three, Richard faced with economic worries and writer's block decided it is time to live his fantasy.  Borrowing a bike, he begins his odyssey.<p><p>IN DETOURS: LIFE, DEATH, AND DIVORCE ON THE ROAD TO STURGIS, Richard, in his autobiography, concentrates mostly on the trek to the Dakotas, which serves as an allegory to life's journey from birth to death.  This is a strong but quite different type of autobiography.  Though some will say the author ignored his responsibilities to his family with this risky venture, many will agree this book is worth reading not only for the well-written morality tale, but also for encouraging individuals to sing "My Way".<p><p>Harriet Klausner</span>
