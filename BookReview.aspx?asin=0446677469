                <span id="Label1">The rich are different from the rest of us, if for no other reason than U.S. tax and securities laws allow them to invest in ways that keep us from catching up to them. That's why 90 percent of all corporate shares of stock are owned by 10 percent of the people. Kiyosaki believes it's possible for anyone to move up into that 10 percent, but it takes a different view of investing than most people have: it takes a plan to be a successful investor. And a plan is more than simply buying and selling, or collecting "assets" that bring in no cash and are thus more akin to liabilities. The way most people invest, "they might as well be pushing a wheelbarrow in a circle," he writes. A plan is "mechanical, automatic, and boring," a formula for success that has worked historically for most of those who've used it. Kiyosaki's "rich dad" (actually, the father of his best friend) tells him the simplest analogy is the game Monopoly: buy four green houses, trade them for one red hotel, and repeat until you become rich.<p> The overall message of <I>Rich Dad's Guide to Investing</I> is that this is an abundant world, full of opportunity for the sophisticated investor. However, it sometimes takes a while to find this point. Much of the book is told in dialogues between young Kiyosaki and his rich dad, and these conversations can ramble. There are rewards for the careful reader--for example, in the middle of a section on the basic rules of investing, Kiyosaki's rich dad compares investor education to toilet training: difficult at first but eventually automatic. But getting to these inspired metaphors means wading through a lot of repetitive dialogue. It's a bit ironic that someone who advocates investor discipline should show so little as a writer. But by the end of the book, even the rambling starts to make sense. By the hundredth time you read that the rich don't work for money, and that you don't need money to make money, both concepts start to make sense. It still looks difficult to apply these ideas, but <I>Rich Dad's Guide to Investing</I> certainly makes the case that they'll work for anyone bold and smart enough to practice them. <I>--Lou Schuler</I> </span>

                    <span>I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore and I realize now that I should have read the reviews before purchasing the book.  This book is incredibly annoying.  The banter between the poor kid and his friend's dad is annoying and never gets to the point.  I'm still not sure that I know the point of this book, come to think of it. 
<br />
<br />The dialogue is repetitive and you can never get concrete information from him.  He just keeps saying "the rich invest differently than the poor" (duh!) and then the author goes on to describe the rich guys beautiful house in Hawaii.  The only morsel of knowledge that I got from this book was that the rich invest in real estate (not a revalation) and that they invest lots of money in IPO's (initial public offerings).  He goes on to say that you basically have to have over 200K to invest in the IPO's that he invests in.... but he doesn't give ANY knowledge to those who wish to begin investing.  I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book and my only reoccuring thought is that I'm so angry at this guy for wasting my time and money.  My Suze Orman books have been much more useful because they contain CONCRETE information (i.e. Start a ROTH IRA, how to diversify your portfolio, how to build credit and keep your FICO score high).  This guy just explains <over and over> how the his rich mentor keeps smiling at smirking at him because he doesn't have any money.  
<br />
<br />I am completely baffled at the good reviews that have been written about this book.  Are these people related to the author?   I'm not trying to be sarcastic at all.  The only thing this book could be useful for is inspiration.  YES! I want to be rich.... please tell me what it's like to be rich!  Describe the beauty of the mansion in Hawaii... and yes, describe the servents that bring you drinks.  Inspiring yes, but there is no information here!  
<br />
<br />Oh wait.... I get it now. The way to become rich is to write a useless book with a catchy title so hopefully a few suckers (like me) will buy it.  Sorry to sound so harsh, but I wish I could get my money back. Please save yourself and do not purchase this book.  I'm off to write a book now so I can become rich.... </span>

                    <span>Having no prior knowledge about investing, I would now consider myself more savvy in the investing world.  Kiyosaki's Guide to investing was very easy to read, understand, and comprehend.  Much of the text is in dialogues between him and his "Rich Dad" and the conversations were about real life situations that Kiyosaki could better understand from his small and frequent lessons provided by rich dad.  The conversations in the first chapters of the book were a little redundant with the same idea of there are people who invest, but in order to get rich you must be at least one or more of the following: rich, patient, smart, or just know people who know more.  I found this book very motivational and giving me the urge to want a lot of money.  If you are interested in hearing a personal story on becoming rich and their methods, this book is perfect.  Rich dad does not provide easy and quick ways to make money, but ways to think about where you are financially and assessing what you really have; then discuses smart ways and decisions to increase your financial situation.
<br />This book is useful to anyone who has always wanted to invest and make more money, but not jump into the stock market or other investing situations that they do not know about because a great amount of detail is gone into about the basics of investing (actually for many chapters).  People of all ages will find use out of this book, but if you already have a very large perception on investing, this book may be a long summary to what is already known. _Rich Dad's guide to investing_ has mental quizzes after each chapter to help you better understand the lesson and then apply it to your life.  I found these lessons useful in analyzing my own situation and not just learning about someone else's finances.  Rich dad makes you feel more confident about investing, explains that investing does not have to be hard or risky.  The vocabulary throughout is defined and explained so an amateur reader will understand the lesson.  Kiyosaki's guide may also be very resourceful for one who is an entrepreneur, or would like to start and build their own business because Rich dad gives excellent reasons why building a business is good and how to make that business successful.
<br />The technology of investing has become very complex and may seem confusing, but this investing book is honestly what it says it is: a "Guide" and not straight forward answers and solutions to any money problems you may have.  Money is a part of everyone's lives, and it is always needed, and if you want it, Rich dad will make you want to begin your investing today.  I never realized how important it is to plan your money in very extensive details and into the future.  In the end you can tell how well you have done, as Rich dad puts it "A financial statement is your report card once you leave school."  If you have always wanted to invest, but do not feel confident about where to begin or where your money should be placed, this book is what you will need to begin.

                    <span>If you pulled the few relevant and cohesive sentences from this book, it would at best make a pamphlet you could read in about 5 minutes.  Unfortunately, I bought what I thought was a book, not a useless pamphlet.
<br />
<br />The majority of the book falls into one of three points the author says with such repitition (his copy and paste skills are unrivaled), it will drive you crazy.  The repeating mantra of the auther is:
<br />
<br />1) I'm rich
<br />2) You could be rich (although I won't share any concrete useful ideas on how)
<br />3) Buy my games (so I can get richer)
<br />
<br />With so many good books out there (Peter Lynch's book was a GREAT read and actually useful), I wished I had spent a little time reviewing this one at my local book store before wasting my money.

                    <span>The writing of this book is horrible. There is no flow and the stories repeat themseleves over and over. There are fluff lines like "I nodded" or "rich dad nodded" over and over to where you think you are in the movie Groundhog Day. There is NO specific advise in this book. It is all amorphous generalities with no point. I was expecting some math formulas, graphs, real-life examples and/or philosophy (such as investor patience, etc.) It just seemed to drag without ever going anywhere. The overwhelming premise of this and the other Rich Dad books are "saving and investing, going to school and working for a corporation" are for suckers. I know plenty of people who are well-off who have done one if not all of the three things above. This book preys on the lazy, ignorant and disenfranchised. If you want a guide that will help you no matter where you are in life financially read "Rich in America" by Jeff Maurer. Also for those of you that do not know, in 1992, Kiyosaki wrote a book called "If You Want to Be Rich and Happy, Don't Go To School"? It is "dedicated to Ralph H. Kiyosaki, former Superintendant of Education, State of Hawaii, the best teacher I ever had." This would be "Poor Dad." But Rich Dad Poor Dad, which came out in 1997, says pretty clearly that "Rich Dad was the best teacher he ever had. It seems like he not telling the truth about something.</span>
