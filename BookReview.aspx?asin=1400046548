                    <span>"The Finishing School" is a terrific book, and every bit as fascinating as "The Warrior Elite." Dick Couch shows exceptional tenacity in following every twist and turn of training that these incredible warriors go through, and he handles the narrator's job superbly--giving us a personal reaction every now and then from his perspective as a SEAL in the Vietnam era. <P>Couch provides insight into what makes SEALS succeed (or fail) and enriches our understanding of how crucial training is to their complicated missions. I felt like I was there in the classroom and on the range with them at all times. Yes, the training evolutions do seem to go on without end, but that's one of the book's points: these guys are the best trained, toughest warriors the world has ever seen, and they will come after you from the sea, the air, or on land. <P>I particularly enjoyed the sections dealing with the SEAL weaponry; the choices they have are fascinating and scary. If you're a Navy buff, or in the least bit interested in what force America can project almost anywhere on earth, then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>I gave Warrior Elite 5 stars. Finishing School was good but there were so many sections that I glossed over because all they had was Navy-Speak bureaucracy-type stuff that I didn't think was interesting at all. The parts that were great were when they focused on one of the SEALs and gave his background and story, etc, and on the details of the training. Maybe to a Navy insider it might be more interesting but it would have gotten 5 stars from me if he would have concentrated more on the actual trainees and not all the mil-speak departmental stuff.</span>

                    <span>Dick Couch portrays the SEALs in advanced training excellently. Though there isn't the connection between the reader and the characters in the story as in The Warrior Elite, Couch shows just how demanding advanced SEAL training really is. It is a tribute to all the SEALs who defend our country day in and day out. A must read for anyone who is interested in the real story about Navy SEALs.</span>
