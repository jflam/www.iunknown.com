                    <span>NEVER, NEVER, NEVER ride behind a semi. You are behind eight retreads. If one of them shreds your trip is over. The hailstorm of rubber and wire that hits you in the face will  be the end of it. I have crossed country both ways from California to Key West, from San Diego to Yellowstone, Montana. I almost got it from a semi tread less than fifty miles from home in Ohio.</span>

                    <span>I found this book easy & extremely enjoyable to read. Being owners of a Goldwing, my wife & I are planning a similar trip. This book has help me, through very detailed descriptions of route and sights,to get a better idea of the path we would like to take. I envy anyone that takes advantage of the opportunity to such a journey. Thank you Gary for sharing your dream come true.</span>

                    <span>I found Gary's book an easy read. Although I've never ridden a big bike, I have traveled around the country in an open Jeep and could relate to his concerns about the weather, traffic, vehicle reliability and the like. His  book got me to dreaming and planning my own "Grand Adventure"!</span>

                    <span>The book not only describes the author's ride through all the lower 48 on his Goldwing but it's also a good reference with highways traveled, sights seen, items to bring, & telephone numbers for state tourist info. A fast trip & a fast read. For those with wonderlust & imagination.</span>
