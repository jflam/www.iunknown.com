                <span id="Label1">The sixth collection of George Will's syndicated op-ed columns finds the iconic conservative pundit complaining about abuse of the battered-woman syndrome defense and other "excuses" offered up in courts, overglorification of multiculturalism, the double entendres on <I>Friends</I> in the months before the 1996 presidential election, and an assortment of other manifestations of declining cultural values. ("When parents cannot watch early-evening television with their children without wincing, their distress will take on political coloration, and the winner of the nation's premier political office is apt to be he who best exemplifies credible disgust with what distresses them.") He also finds rays of hope, such as Eugene F. Rivers, a Jesuit who ministers to the people of Dorchester, Massachusetts, and the diligence of Cal Ripken: "On September 6, [1995] the nation was mesmerized by the spectacle of a man going to work, as usual. He works between Second and Third in Baltimore." </span>

                    <span>Yes, as one person complained, this book is "just" a compilation of Will's previously published columns & essays (with a few speeches thrown in as a bonus). That's a bit like saying that the King James Bible is "just" a compilation of the speeches of a few Hebrew prophets. George Will, with his class, wit, and insight makes Gore Vidal & HL Mencken look pitifully small. Not only is this book insightful, but I read it at the beach, so it's not as difficult as some might think.<P>This man walks with giants, and his ability to connect so many disparate events into one overarching theme would make Jerry Seinfeld proud. And it's not all the Republican party line, as some might suggest: to one person's comments that the Republican welfare reform of 1995 would lead to thousands of homeless dying on steam grates he says "actually, we'll have to build more grates."<P>Then this comment, an ispiration, on page 211: "In today's deregulated global economy, with highly mobile capital and an abundance of cheap labor, the long-term prosperity of an advanced nation is a function of a high rate of savings - the deferral of gratification that makes high rates of investment in capital, research, & development, and education. All these forms of social capital are good for society as a whole and are encouraged by high rewards for those who accept the discipline."<P>Or this, from page 259: "The postwar agenda of unideological 'problem-solving' politics erased the distinction between problems that can be solved and conditions that must be endured."<P>Want a real education? Then read this book, along with "The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent: Selected Essays", a collection of Lionel Trilling's greatest essays. You'll learn.</span>

                    <span>I'd give this book zero stars if I could. To compare it to the Bible, as one reader had the unmitigated gall to do, is an insult to the great authors of that book. A comparison to Mein Kampf would be more appropriate.<P>There's nothing here that you haven't seen before, just the rehashed rantings of yet another angry and disenfranchised white man who refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections and launches into ad hominem attacks of the Democratic party in general and the Clinton presidency in particular. <P>If you like having your thinking done for you by the likes of Will, Rush Limbaugh, et al, then this is the book for you. Those who like to think for themselves should look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>So the reader below, "just_browsing" has just compared this collection of Will spewages to the King James Bible, and you know what - I agree. In fact, I believe this book to be a far more significant tome than the King James Bible. Yes, it is true that the New Testament portion of the King James Bible revealed to me the true word, and allowed the holy spirit to enter my soul and made me reborn and filled with love for my god and for all humankind. But, I don't know - this book by Will just seems to do so much more. His beatifully articulated conservative viewpoints, on such matters as Clinton's fornications, Clinton's lying, Hillary's lying, and other such wide-ranging issues, has made me completely rethink everything I learned from the King james Bible, and I now realize that the only humans on earth that are worthy of my love are the conservative pundits.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the reviewer who states that Will is not as hateful as the Clinton administration is. The Clinton administration destroyed computer keyboards and vandalized the White House and the Vice President's house to the point that both had to be completely razed and then rebuilt at the cost of approximately $25.6 billion dollars to the taxpayers. George Will, on the other hand, presents a factual and unbiased analysis of what is wrong with the fornicating, DNA splattering partial birth aborter and cigar-insertor who was our president.</span>
