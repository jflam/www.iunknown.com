                    <span>From Joe Catal, author of the book "Telesales Tips From The Trenches". <br>As a national sales trainer who teaches people how to sell by phone, this book is an incredible read. There's a huge difference in telling someone a sales technique and teaching that technique. The book covers every situataion you may encounter and answers it on a psychological and practical level. I consider myself a very good public speaker and my evaluations normally come back as excellent. After reading this book, I had to rate my seminar a C+. If you've been struggling with your training this book will be a Godsend for you. I'd like to personally thank the author for teaching me the right way to give a seminar. This is a must read, and I'd be shocked if you read this book and your seminar didn't improve 100%.</span>

                    <span>After receiving this book I read it straight through in 2 days.  Absolutely the best information for any trainer.  Robert does a tremendous job of detailing just about everything a trainer needs to know.  I highly recommend this book.  I also purchased 2 other books at the same time - I probably won't even read those now.  Get it - you WILL enjoy it!</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book to ANYONE who teaches, especially anyone who teaches adults.<p>I wish I had read it before I was a Teaching Assitant (while a graduate student at a major university). TAs get very little help in learning to teach and yet do most of the teaching - EVERY TA should read this book.<p>It will feature prominently in my X-mas gifts!</span>

                    <span>This book changed my career. I was responsible for developing a course to teach our employees how to become better presenters. I did a ton of research, read many books, but this one was my single most used resource.  The large majority of  my company's training philosphies are now based on  this one book. It's working for us incredibly well. I tried everything in  the book that Mr. Jolles suggested. Most worked, very few didn't. Without  this book I'm sure the course I developed wouldn't have been half as good  as it was. We now have a staff trained using the methods Mr. Jolles  suggested and with great and measured success. Thanks Robert! You have no  idea what a huge impact you have had on my career and my company's profit  margin! The only problem with the book is the title. You should really  change it to something that describes what it's actually about. Just get  rid of the "How to Run Seminars and Workshops:" part.</span>

                    <span>The book covered soup to nuts:  from concept to implementation of a training session.  I've been in the business for 12 years and just last week pulled it out to review the information about those  "characters" in class.  OK, OK, I had a "sniper" in my  group and needed a "shot" of help!  I worked through it with no  "blood-shed"!  Thanks Rob!!!</span>
