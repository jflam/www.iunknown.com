                    <span>Once again 'Build Like A Pro' series by Taunton Press, publishers of Fine Homebuilding, has produced another fine book.<p>This 'coffee table' size book has plenty of what makes the 'Build Like A Pro' series a success.  Overall this is a very pleasant book to look through; great layout, lots of photos, and step-by-step details.<p>If you are new to construction and want to replace some of your own doors and windows, I am sure you will find this book very useful.  If you are like me, and have a background in construction, I think you will still find a few great ideas to utilize.  <p>Nearly every page offers a sidebar where you can learn a tip or two including; tools and materials, tips from a pro, what can go wrong, and much more.  The photos are top notch and often a detailed sketch is provided to help explain a step in the process.<p>I have yet to see a 'Build Like A Pro' book that hasn't been well worth the price.  Good luck with your window and door installation!</span>

                    <span>I'm a homeowner with plenty of construction experience...at least that's what I thought until reading this book.  The author provides plenty of time saving tips for installing windows and doors in both new and old construction.  I just finished my basement and wish I would have read this book a few months ago; It would have saved me a lot of effort.</span>
