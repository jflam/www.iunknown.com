                    <span>Morgan Wootten is probably THE most successful high school basketball coach, and his book is one that I believe coaches at all levels can benefit from.  I have found that the principles, plays and strategies he has written to be very beneficial in my own development as a coach.  Plays and diagrams are simple and complete, and his focus on developing his kids as both individuals and players is great reading.  This book is one you will want to take your coaching and your team to "the next level."</span>

                    <span>This book does much more than just teach the game of basketball, it shows  coaches how to prepare their kids to be successful in life. And does an  excellent job at both. His experience and record speak for themselves, the  man definitely knows the game. But I feel his expertise at the X's and O's  is just icing on the cake.   I first discovered Mr. Wootten's masterpiece  about five years ago while preparing to coach a Y.M.C.A. travel team (my  first gig). It was the main source I used to develop my program. I recieved  rave reviews from both the parents and the Y.M.C.A. Over the past five  years I have endorsed the book in social settings(when the subject arose)  but hadn't seen the book since then. In the meantime I've had an increased  yearning to coach basketball, which I've gone back to school to accomplish.  Today I found out, it was Mr. Wootten's book that caused me to believe I  was born to coach.I recently landed an Assistant Coaching job for the  Varsity Women's basketball team at the Div.III school I'm attending.  Preparing for the upcoming season I deciced "Coaching Basketball  Successfully" was the first book I'd reread. Very quickly I realized  where my passion to coach came from. The coaching philosophy paper I had to  write the previous semester was eerily similar to many of the ideas in  Coach Wootten's book. Since the copy I'm reading now is from the library, I  intend to buy my own copy and one each for both the Men's and Women's Head  Coach here at my school.   Coach Wootten's wonderful book optimizes the  true meaning of the word COACH..,and sparked a fire in my soul, to be the  positive influence and guide that a coach is supposed to be. Exactly what  our children deserve.</span>
