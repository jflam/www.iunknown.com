                    <span>This is quite a fun book! I love the idioms, such as "sorehead," which I had almost forgotten!<P>This book reminds me of the other "Dealing with People" books I have read, but Giblin has a specific zest and glibness that is enchanting. This bouncy language drives the book across its points. It was a quick read, and very conversational so you aren't being lied to , or confused. I recommend this book to be used with "How To Win Friends And Influence People."</span>

                    <span>I am amazed that this book was written 43 years ago and yet all the basic principles behind human behavior that Les examined still apply today.<P>I could not get my hands off this book as I enjoy it so much.<P>The most practical and useful book I have ever read especially for people who really want to improve their interpersonal relationship.</span>

                    <span>If you have trouble handling people, this is the book for you. Sure, it was written in the 1950s, but it does NOT need to be updated. Everything the author says is true; and he explains it all in an easy, understandable, and thoughtful way. One of my favorite parts is when Les Giblin tells a story about one of his friends who walked up to total strangers and chatted with them as if they were old friends. ("No one ever called him fresh or rude.") Giblin asked his friend what his secret was. His friend's secret is revealed; Buy this book, b/c it's worth it!</span>

                    <span>I've owned this book for some time, but have only recently read it. Many other authors have recommended it, as well as quoted it. For a short book, (less than 200 pages) it took me too long to read it. It is definitely a book worth reading and re-reading, but with other books which are better written, this one may sit on my shelf for some time. Again, this book does contain positive information, so I do recommend it.</span>
