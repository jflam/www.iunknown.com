                <span id="Label1">Thunder Run is the story of the bold assault on Baghdad by the Spartan Brigade of the Third Infantry Division. With fewer than a thousand men, and facing Iraqi forces dug into bunkers and buildings, the brigade punched a hole through the heart of Baghdad with a high-speed charge to Saddam Hussein's Presidential Palace and Republican Guard headquarters. Many Iraqi soldiers fled or surrendered during the onslaught, but significant numbers stood and fought. Iraqi forces destroyed the brigade's command center, ambushed the brigade's resupply column, and even as it appeared that the brigade was seizing control of the capital on the battle's second day, a fierce counterattack across the Tigris River trapped an American company under withering fire and forced a retreat. Many Americans believe that Baghdad was taken with a minimum of effort. But for the Spartan Brigade it was a brutal and terrifying three days of urban warfare. The product of dozens of interviews, and with a foreword from best-selling author Mark Bowden, Thunder Run is a riveting firsthand account of how a single armored brigade of fewer than a thousand men was able to capture an Arab capital defended by one of the world's largest armies.</span>

                    <span>There are currently many books out about the Iraqi war. This one focuses on the 3rd division and their "thunder run" up hiway 8 and eventually into downtown Baghdad. It brings the horrors of battle right into your living room with very descriptive passages of battle and the emotions of the men who fought in this untried military strategy. There are vivid descriptions of the firefights and through the narrative you get to see the war from the soldier's point of view. Unlike some non-fiction works, this one reads almost like a novel. It is quickly paced and will keep you reading for hours. An excellent book, I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Looking at the news media, most give the impression U.S. forces simply walked into Baghdad, ending the war. This book tells the true story. It wasn't a cake walk. The Thunder Runs (the first on April 5), and most importantly the second on April 7, involved extensive and prolonged engagements. The battles were fierce and intense.<P>Other reviewers have provided a good accounting of the core of the book, so I will provide some information on the sourcing. Although written in novel form, the author, David Zucchino, provides information on the extensive sourcing used for the book. Zucchino, while also an embedded reporter, interviewed over 100 of the participants, establishing first hand accounts of the action. To that he added reviews of combat histories of the units, notes and journals of soldiers, logs, radio conversations, photos, videos. He was also able to interview Iraqi officers and Iraqi civilians, providing a rare and insightful glimpse on what it was like on the other side. He avoids page by page sourcing (which would bog down the narrative), but does provide notes on sources at the back of the book. The end result is a beautiful narrative that in its own right would be a masterful fiction novel, until you realize it is non-fiction. It really happened!<P>Tells the true story. Well written. Well sourced. Highly recommended. Five Stars</span>

                    <span>An overall well done history of the "Thunder Runs" to demonstrate to the press, the Hussein Regime, and the world that the US was in Baghdad, and in Baghdad to stay. A gripping account of the mismatch in quality and quantity of forces, underscored with accounts of the gory details of combat.<P>This history shows overwhelmingly, that modern armor forces are matchless in dominating a low-tech enemy with poor local command and coordination. The toughness of the heavy US MBTs as well as the IFVs comes through in this book as cited in numerous examples. The overall toughness and adaptability of the US troops comes through as the overriding factor however. Using their skills and teamwork, the American soldier not only penetrated into the depths of the Hussein Palace complex, they then fought numerous battles to preserve logistical lines of contact, sometimes in thin skinned ammo trucks and fuel tankers in a hot battle zone, and then fought through the debilitating loss of the Brigade command post to an SSM to persevere against thousands of Ba'athists and Syrian mercenaries in making a claim to Baghdad's symbols of power.<P>In summation, a well researched book, written in clear pose, with a little bit of dry objectivity thrown in, a recommended read for amateur theorists and military enthusiasts.</span>

                    <span>As an Army Officer, I am very interested in hearing what tactics, techniques & equipment worked in Iraq and what didn't. While the Army has been gathering much of this information internally, a few books are now appearing to tell the story of what really happened during the march on Baghdad. Conventional wisdom and Army doctrine told us that urban warfare was not the ideal place to use armor. To secure the city would require that US forces set a siege while the light infantry (e.g., 82nd Airborne or 101st Air Assault Divisions) clear the city block by block. What the Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division (Mechanized) did was to simply rewrite Army doctrine. Aggressively employed, they proved that armor can be the supreme tool in urban warfare. There were several other lessons learned from the Third's charge ("Thunder Run"). The Army has had to rethink convoy procedures and other areas concerning logistical support in a "non-linear" battlefield. Furthermore, the division proved that organic fire support using mortars and self-propelled artillery is still critical to success in the "close battle", and that airpower has not replaced those important systems. The story is gripping, because the battle was a closely fought affair. The book is full of examples of how great our young soldiers are; for they are the best army in the world. David Zucchino was an embedded reporter with the division during the battle and he has done an outstanding job in telling the Third's story. Overall, this is an important book and undoubtedly the first of many that will tell of this conflict.</span>

                    <span>'Thunder Run' is a gripping but sickening read. It describes in great detail what happens when the all but invincible armoured might of a 21st century army runs into a ragtag bunch of ill equiped, poorly trained, disorganized and confused Iraqi defenders. In the words of some the American soldiers it was a "turkey shoot","a cakewalk", "a slaugher". There is very little honor here. Iraqi defenders launch themselves in pointless attacks against the Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles with AK47's and RPGs and are chopped in half by coaxial machine gun fire; fleeing Iraqis are mercilessly gunned down; injured Iraqis (accidentally) run over by tanks; swimmers fleeing a palace shot in the water; dogs eating the dead. And of course civilians surprised by the swiftness of the assault blunder into the kill zones. The soldiers and tankes doing the fighting seem to realise this, in the words of one "It was his job to kill the enemy, but he got no satisfaction from mowing down soldiers who seemed so incompetent, so vulnerable, so poorly led".</span>
