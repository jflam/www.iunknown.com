                    <span>Anyone who wishes to read a comprehensive, yet entertaining account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition owes it to themselves to read Undaunted Courage. Starting with the historical background, and early life of M. Lewis, the story of the expedition's journey across a continent is told in such a readable style that one is almost sorry when it's over, and they've returned to St. Louis. Ambrose makes extensive use of their journals, and adds his own views on why certain decisions were made, both wisely and not, over others. While pointing to the obviously gifted leadership of "the captains", he is not oblivious to their faults. Likewise in his descriptions of the various Indian tribes: both noble and unadmirable practices are related. The overall result of the author's approach is to tell a tale of courage and discovery, without any undo sentamentalism. There are, to be sure, many moving descriptions of events, e.g., the suicide of Lewis, who probable suffered from bi-polar (manic-depressive) illness, years after the expedition itself. And his descriptions of the various settings, with which he is eminently familiar, make it easy to understand why buffs today retrace long segments of the Corps of Discovery's routes. All in all, a great work of history. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This book is an amazing accomplishment.  Stephen Ambrose has given us an amazing work with "Undaunted Courage".  We learn the background of Merriwether Lewis, his close relationship with Thomas Jefferson and of course the trek across the country.  Ambrose gives us a strong narrative, sprinkled with excerpts of Lewis and Clark's journal, interjecting his unique take on the situations.  Stephen Ambrose is unparalleled when it comes to historical writing.</span>

                    <span>This detailed book is a long read, but worth it.  Ambrose takes you into the early life of Lewis from 1774 through the expedition and his encounters with the Corp of Discover. Throughout the journal, the realization is that he says almost nothing about the other expedition members, Sacajawea or Clark in detail.  The infant son of Sacajea and Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste "Pomp",  gets little if no mention, nor the difficulties of a native american teenage woman on this amazing journey.  This book is about Lewis. Although some of the journal is missing, other writers have speculated based on facts of the lives of the Corp of Discovery members. Ambrose seems bent on characterizing Merriweather Lewis in a certain light, one with perhaps some hereditary mental disorder; taking his own life in the end after the journey. However, the facts that he did present were interesting, although I would have preferred to know more details about the Native American tribes they encountered.

                    <span>Undaunted Courage is just a great piece of American history by one of the great modern American historians.  Typical of Ambrose, this story has more detail than you want at some times (do we need to know how many pencils were carried on the raft?) but it really does give you a window into a whole different time and place.
<br />
<br />I learned so much about the journey, the opening of the West, and the post-journey lives of these adventurors that I'd never even considered.
<br />
<br />Great book for fans of American history, the American West, and Ambrose.</span>
