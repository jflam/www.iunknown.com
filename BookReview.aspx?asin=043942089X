                    <span>The Thief Lord, originally written by Cornelia Funke in German, poses an interesting question: Is writing or plot more effective for children's stories? If you answered the former, Thief Lord isn't for you; the language is often simple and some wordings are very obviously translated. The reason so many children (and pre-teens) have been drawn to the book is its fairy tale like plot. <P>The Thief Lord focuses on the story of two children, Bo and Prosper, who have ran away from their Aunt and Uncle to Venice, a city their deceased mother used to tell stories about. The boys choose to run away because Aunt Esther and her husband want to adopt Bo, but not Prosper. Once in Venice, the boys meet up with a group of runaway children who live in a movie theater and are taken care of by a thief the same age of the rest of them who calls himself 'The Thief Lord'. Unfortunately, Esther has contacted a detective named Victor Getz, who agrees to search for the children, with silly and often laughable results. <P>The plot takes a sudden twist when a magical and mysterious merry-go-round and a Conte looking for the missing piece enter the picture. The ending, while not particularly surprising, is quite enjoyable none the less. <P>Although The Thief Lord is not Newberry material, the characters are likable and the plot exciting, making it a sure fire hit with younger Harry Potter fans. The writing, the weakest point of the book, can easily be looked over.</span>

                    <span>The Thief Lord, by Cornelia Funke , was probably the best book I ever read.<BR>The setting of modern day Venice played a big part in the story with crazy canal boat rides and tales of its beautiful artwork and sculptures.<BR>The book starts off with a detective named Victor who has a new assignment; two brothers named Prosper and Bo who were orphaned when their mother died. Then they ran away from their aunt who was supposed to be adopting Bo and sending Prosper to boarding school. There aunt and uncle believe that they are somewhere in Venice. Victor's assignment is to track them down. <BR>Meanwhile in an old Venice movie theatre six orphaned children camp out, Bo and Prosper among them. The other four include a boy with hair like a hedgehog named Riccio, a dark skinned boy named Mosca, a girl named Hornet and the leader of the group Scippio called The Thief Lord. Together they live in the old movie theatre, The Thief Lord stealing jewelry and other things for them to sell. <BR>All's well until the children meet up with Victor and learn a secret behind Scippio that will change their and his future forever. <BR>The plot in this story is a great one with twists and turns along the way. Especially when they come across the mystery of the Merry Go Round of the merciful sisters and effect's them all.<BR>The story has soft parts, thrill rides and mysteries. <BR>Funke really knows about children and how they act. She really makes you feel for the characters and understand their thoughts.<P>The ending was both satisfying and disappointing. I would recommend this to ages nine and up. It might be a little hard for younger children. But anyone else I hope will love it as much as I.</span>

                    <span>After the death of their mother, Prosper and his younger brother Bo, are set to be separated. Their aunt Esther only wants to adopt five-year-old Bo and send twelve-year-old Prosper to some far away boarding school where he would probably only get to see Bo once a year. Not wanting to separate the two boys escape to Venice, a city their mother told them had magical lions and great canals. At first life in Venice is hard, but after they meet a young girl named Hornet who introduces them to an orphange life gets much better. However Prosper feels uneasy since the orphange is funded by Scripio, known as The Thief Lord. Meanwhile, Aunt Esther has not given up on finding the two boys, as she has now hired the city's top detective Victor Getz to track them down. After a series of events, Victor discovers their hiding place and many more surprising turns finally bring to light the true identity of The Thief Lord.<P>The Thief Lord is definitely a very enjoyable read. Unfornately a book that was suppose to be realistic was made into a part fantasy ending which didn't fit the book at all. Nothing in the whole booked suggested fantasy as being part of the book and the ending came totally out of the blue. If you get past the ending though you'll definitely enjoy this book that has is like a 21st century Dicken's novel.</span>

                    <span>I found The Thief Lord to be a very interesting read. Yes, there were some parts that I did not understand, but, overall it was very good. Not up to Jo Rowling's Harry Potter, which I have read many times and love. <P>Also, I was also told it was a fantasy book but the only fantasy part was at the very end.<P>I am going into 6th grade, 11 years old, and I listened to The Thief Lord<BR>by Cornelia Funke on an Audio Cd.</span>
