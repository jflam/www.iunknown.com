                    <span>This is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the Bill Evans trio. This was I'm told  Bill's first all ballads record. Riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962.  None of the music sounds dated. considering it's 41 years old. This is the first recording Bill made with Chuck Israels taking over for the late Scott Lafaro as the bass player. This album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it. The music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection. One goal that Bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and  original sounding jazz. I dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording. To me it sounds more like European classical music. Also thank god for Bill's college music theory teacher at Southeastern University Gretchen Magee.  Because if it werent for her motivation {Evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition "Very Early" {which is the last track on the CD its just breathtaking...}Being an amature pianist myself, "Very early" and "childrens play song" were the first two Evans' compositions I taught myself to play. The piece is a composition played in C major at a slow waltz tempo. He played the tune until the end of his life in 1980, but the original version on "moonbeams" might be the all around finest one.  It is given a very slow and delicate treatment, and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow  falling gently around you. I also really like his interpretation of "It might as well be spring". I think that Bill Evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that. He didnt play anything he didnt have to. He always played just the right amount of  notes and chords. With this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement. Evans once told Tony Bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on "truth and beauty." With the album "moonbeams" fans of Evans' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Bill Evans has been called the Chopin of Jazz, and MOON BEAMS, perhaps moreso than any other album, shows you the reasons why.  Like the composer of the NOCTURNES, Evans in this collection of understated ballads evinces a nocturnal after-hours feel, a haunted sense of melancholy that nevertheless doesn't slide over into lugubriousness, a poetic sensitivity to phrasing, and an incredibly sure touch that registers the subtle gradations of pianissimo.   In addition, Evans, employing his gorgeous and instantly recognizable tone, is such an intelligent, tasteful and unflashy player he almost promotes the illusion as he goes along that his improvisations are inevitable and definitive and could hardly have been phrased or stated in any other way -- almost as if they'd been scored ahead of time.  Finally, though he was no minimalist, Evans NEVER overplays, and that phenomenon is such a rarity in post-Swing jazz that it is to be avidly cherished by any serious lover of this music (it is also one of the reasons why Evans can be listened to with enjoyment by people who are otherwise unreceptive to modern jazz). <p>This recording is ideally to be listened to after midnight, in a dimly lit room -- preferably with your significant other -- with snifters in hand as you blow smoke rings at the ceiling and ponder the romantic possibilities of life. Yes, it really is that gorgeous.</span>

                    <span>Bill Evans is a musician you never tire of listening to. He has the ability to play a tune freshly, every time. This recording is, in my opinion, his finest. The first date after the untimely death of Scott LaFaro, this album is beautiful ,melodic and haunting. Every tune is played with typical Evans genius, but on this session he seems to be expressing his musical ideas with even more flavor and emotion. The first cut is the most expressive and emotive I have ever heard in the trio setting. I am sure it was dedicated to LaFaro, even though it supposedly is an anagram for the producer of the date, Orrin Keepnews. Evans expresses his passion, joy and grief for his young bassist in every note and the result is, to my mind, stunning. I love Chuck Israels' bass lines and the chords Evans plays quietly over the bass solo are beautiful and ephemeral. Every tune on this CD is wonderful, the playing of everyone is at such a high level of creativity that this music will live on forever. This is a can't miss choice if you like piano music.</span>

                    <span>This is the "perfect" ballads album from Bill. As strong as silk  thread, tender and moving all at the same time!<p>When you see him bends  his back, lower his head down, eyes closed, fingers gently touching the  keys....how can you not be moved with this recording? Man!<p>Read his books  and you understand how this is a shy, loving man who just pours himself  anytime he produces the music. Simply one of the most intelligent persons  in the music business, before and after, he is here with the carefully  selected tunes to accomodate his sensitive side, thumbs up to Orrin  Keepnews who compiled this only all-ballads album from Evans!<p>Check out  If You Could See Me Now....or I Fall In Love Too Easily..you'll understand  how this man can simply describe the color of the rainbow and the soft  radiant evenings with fewest notes possible...carefully arranged, simply  astonishing! How did he do it?<p>The mover, the shaker, the genius that  inspires the millions, the center of the soft glowing light, here it is:  Bill Evans!</span>

                    <span>i give this album 5 stars simply because every track is stunningly sublime.  the mood of the album is much grayer and introspective than bill's other albums (although its hard to be more introspective than bill  already is), as 'moonbeams' was one of the first albums evans recorded  after the accidental death of Scott LaFaro, the transcendental virtuoso  bassist who formed the most 'simultaneous improvisation' trio jazz has ever  seen (along with paul motian on drums).<p>evans respected laFaro as a  musician held him in the highest regard. after laFaro's death (10 days  after the Village Vanguard show) evans took a short sabbatical from music.   this album shows bill coming out of this depressing cave, at night,  rediscovering the moon and stars...<p>the disc is worth the first track  alone 're: person i knew,' a track probably dedicated to lafaro. evans  himself recorded this composistion on other occasions (one of my favorites,  on the 1970 'from left to right' album which features evans on the  fender/rhodes electric piano). evans probes the keys, searching for a reply  to some anguish.<p>the rest of the tracks are marvelous gems of nightmusic;  this is also the only evans CD which features all ballads.  if you are  looking for an evans album that 'swings' dont buy this one (opt for  'everybody digs bill evans'). this music does not swing; it sways, broods,  subtly swimming in the night;<p>incidentally, the title (and the track  'moonbeams and polka dots') comes from a bud powell (probably the biggest  pianist to influence evans) track by the name of...well...'moonbeams and  polka dots'</span>
