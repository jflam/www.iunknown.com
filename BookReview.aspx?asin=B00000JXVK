                    <span>Please, please, please buy this movie as a gift to yourself.  Once you've seen it you'll probably buy it for many others.  It makes an extremely inexpensive and extremely enjoyable gift for anyone.
<br />
<br />My wife is the person least interested in motorcycles in the world.  She absolutely loves this movie, along with my 17-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter.  My 5-year-old twin daughters love it most of all.  They call it the "voom-voom-movie" because that's the first sound you hear.
<br />
<br />Everyone from grandma to motorcyle freaks to babies will love this film.
<br />
<br />It is so much more than just a motorcycle movie.  It's about the love of leisurely and competitive motorcycling all around the world.  It's about the only superstar actor ever who was a bona-fide competitive motorcycle racer, Steve McQueen.  It's about $2.00 parts costing tens of thousands of dollars in prizes.  It's about paying for the love of a sport with your life.  It's about the poetry of a group of cyclists going incredible speeds within inches of each other.  It's about taking a ride on the beach or on a horse trail with your buddies.
<br />
<br />It has an original and very catchy 70's sound track which you'll never forget.
<br />
<br />I give this movie ten stars.  It's the all-time top under-rated film in my opinion.</span>

                    <span>This is a good video by Bruce Brown Films. I Purchased this because I was allready getting into motorcycles and recently purchased a Honda Shadow. Music was a bit out-dated, but strangely enough, I now hum some of the musical themes from the movie.  (Very Carpenderish type 70's music).  I enjoyed the movie and found myself replaying it over 10 times and it is always nice to come back to it again. I especially liked the last bit at the end where all three bikers are riding around what appears to be a desert area near the coast of California.  The music meshed nicely with this part and that old Hammond B3 Organ.  The video is a good history account of racing in late 60's early 70's.  The theme of the movie appears to be that Motorcycles are both fun and dangerous, and shows the variety of racing approaches to the sport.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite films. I watched it after I started riding dirt bikes, however, I can understand how it would have inspired many people people to start riding motorcycles. In all of his films, Bruce Brown has the unique ability to portray that "you shoulda been there" feeling. Never in my life have I wanted to travel back in time more than when I watched this movie. I can only imagine what it would have been like racing across the SoCal desert atop a 500cc Husqvarna, riding right next to Steve McQueen. Buy this DVD.</span>

                    <span>That's what I was thinking as I watched this movie.  Sure, the music is corny, but the footage is fantastic!  It had me itching to get my bikes out of the garage.  The movie awakens that urge to compete!  A really superb film-if you love motorcycles, then you'll love this!  (Just don't watch it when you can't ride, I did and had spring fever big time from it!)</span>
