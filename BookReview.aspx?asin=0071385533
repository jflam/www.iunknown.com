                    <span>As a software developer I can reiterate what the previous customer reviews have stated about this being a great book for a survey of the Wireless GSM world and the business aspects of GPRS.  I found some of the information on WAP very interesting as well (I always suspected it was a flavor-of-the-month). I just wanted to point out that there is no technical info down on my level in this book. For example, one will not find out how to open a PDP context with the AT command set, nor get product comparisons of the various PCMCIA modems for GPRS that are already on the market.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a good summary of GPRS from many points of view, and generally lives up to its cover billing.  It provides a broad overview of GPRS, with short chapters written by industry experts.<p>For those seeking a detailed technical understanding of GPRS, this book is not for you -- the "technical" chapters are very high level.  But for those wanting to get up-to-speed quickly on the "whole GPRS" (from applications to roaming to business issues to...), it's a quick and mostly well-written and well-edited read.<p>There are a few technical errors (e.g. HSCSD was not introduced in GSM in 1993) and some data inconsistencies across chapters (not surprising given the format) The chapter sequencing is also a bit odd in some cases, making a sequential read-through somewhat disjoint.  But the index is complete and most readers will learn something in every chapter.<p>Overall, the book achieves its intended purpose quite well, and most authors have a slightly humorous style which is as gripping as the topic allows.</span>

                    <span>GPRS Demystified is a very good read.  The chapters are short with intros which define the overall content of the section.  I found most parts of the book to be insightful with none of it  downright boring.  <p>Overall, I rate the book four and a half stars and believe it will appeal to those wishing to better understand the GPRS service concept.  It is a soup to nuts overview of GPRS by chapter writers which use various styles to tell their part of the GPRS story.   Interesting stuff. <p>I learned a great deal by reading GPRS Demystified and highly recommend it to those wishing to gain an understanding of this new cellular technology service.</span>
