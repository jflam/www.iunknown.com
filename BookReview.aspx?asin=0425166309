                <span id="Label1">"From its opening pages, in which she recounts her own premature birth, triggered by terrifying rumors of an incipient pogrom, Bernstein's tale is clearly not a typical memoir of the Holocaust. She was born into a large family in rural Romania...and grew up feisty and willing to fight back physically against anti-Semitism from other schoolchildren. She defied her father's orders to turn down a scholarship that took her to Bucharest, and got herself expelled from that school when she responded to a priest/teacher's vicious diatribe against the Jews by hurling a bottle of ink at him...After a series of incidents that ranged from dramatic escapes to a year in a forced labor detachment, Sara ended up in Ravensbruck, a women's concentration camp, [and] managed to survive...she tells this story with style and power." -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br> <br>"There are many recent accounts of Holocaust victims, but this work stands alone as a testimony to personal strength and an independent spirit." -<i>Library Journal</i> <br> <br>"Extraordinary." -<i>Booklist</i> <br> <br>"An engrossing history lesson as well as an important archive." -Faye Kellerman <br>"Well-told...deserves a prominent place in the archive of Holocaust survival stories." -<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br> <br>"One of the best of the recent wave of Holocaust memoirs"  (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) <br> <br>--An ALA choice for the Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults, and the second-place winner in the General Trade Nonfiction category at the New York Book Show <br>--Includes an introduction by Edgar M.

                    <span>The Seamstress was a compelling story of survival and strength of the human spirit. The speaker of this book has an uncommon tenacious quality. As a Holocaust survivor she gives an angle on her experiences that you don't get from fiction. When you read fictional stories about important events the characters seem to lack a certian depth or belief factor that makes the story seem like that could not have really happened, or that it is very unlikly. In The Seamstress there seems to be a horrible factor about the war and the Holocaust that as a reader you do not understand how people could do this to other people. In the back of your mind you have to believe, though you can't have empathy for what incredible expierences that they have lived through. The sometimes simple and sometimes detailed description adds spice to the reading. Throughout this book you soon realise that Seren Tuvel is one who, because of her older sister roles, is the planer and caretaker of those around her. The strong family bonds that shape her life as an adolescent shape the lives of her family later. The losses she and others like her have suffered display clearly that there has got to be a better answer problems then wars and tyrannical leaderships. Trying to learn history from dry factual books does not give nearly the depth that this book does to the horrors of war, where one person trying to stay alive where all the odds are against them. I don't yet know the fear of being singeled out after my government has given up on me, and may no one ever have to experience what Seren Tuvel and the millions of others have. The Seamstress is a wonderful book, and for all of us who have grown up in a world where we know very little about first hand experiences of war, and understand even less, this book dramatically puts you in touch with the raw emotions of survival. In many cases now we hear of stories of survival from plane crashes and bombings, but that is only physical. What people in Camps went through was a mental, emotional, and physical survival, "We think of survival in tearms of living through life-threatening events, survival of the physical being. There are many chronicles of the dramatic acts undertaken to cling to life; the psychological exercises practiced to maintain hope and optimism. The majority of these tales, however, deal with the short-term, intense crises: surviving an airplane crash for three weeks, being trapped in a cave for five days after the wall have collapsed. Looking at the protracted version- four years of physical and emotional dehumanization- alters any perception we may have had of those who survived daily events in the camps." My personal reaction to this book was one was such a better understanding for life and a better appriciation for what people have done, and what they are doing to make the world a better place. I have gained an insight to an amazing life. Everything in this book had a purpose and added so many dimensions to Seren and the people around her. This book was unlike any book I have ever read before.</span>

                    <span>I simply could not put down Mrs. Seren Tuvel's book. This is truely one of the best books that I have ever read. This is a truely fine book, written by a remarkable woman who lived to tell of the horrors of the Holocaust and her strong will and determination to survive. This book I would highly reccomend to anyone. It is sad that Mrs. Tuvel-Bernstein passed away some years ago, but her spirit lives on through her amazing story. This is one of the best Holocaust memoirs ever published.</span>

                    <span>In the early 1030s, as Hitler grasped his power tightly; the Jews began to be treated very unfairly. For years they had been considered "dirty", but their lives were about to become miserable. During the 1930s many Jews and others who would have hurt the Nazi beliefs, like homosexuals, Jehovah's Witness believers, and other "criminals", were put into concentration camps and basically not allowed to live.<BR>	The story of Seren Tuvel, a young, Jewish woman, is a story of courage and will to survive. Seren was always different from her family, for she had no intention of staying in the home her whole life. She left her family behind in a village in Romania and moved to Budapest to study while she was still a young teenager. In school, Seren was teased for being a Jew, though she did not look like a Jew. Seren had long, blonde hair and blue eyes, just like anyone native to the land she was living. When she was in Budapest, she quit school and became a seamstress. Soon, as Germany gained power, the Nazis slowly crept into her life, taking away her rights and some of her dignity, just because she was Jewish. It was not difficult for her to find jobs, like it was for other Jews, because Seren looked like a Gentile. As the war in Europe went on, her family dispersed to different places, like Israel or to different cities in Romania and Hungary, but the Jews soon would not be able to travel. Before long, Jewish men were taken into the labor force to support Hungary. Only weeks after that, the women were also forced to help support their enemy. Seren, her sister, and two friends met up at this point and would stay together to survive. They went through the work camps, leaning on each other for survival. <BR>	Seren Tuvel must have known how important her story of courage was, because just years after moving to America, she began to write her story. Seren (Sara) Tuvel-Bernstein wrote her memoir magnificently. Her leadership, love, and devotion to her loved ones, were revealed in such a precious manner that the reader cannot help but love her. Seren wrote, "I felt completely responsible for these three young girls[Seren's sister and two friends]; to me we were all sisters. I had to do everything in my power to enable us to remain alive." She revealed the truth in her own perspective and still showed some of the perspectives of the others around her, for example what her family and friends though of the events that had been happening.<BR>A great strength shone through the book as Seren told the readers exactly what she had been through, although all of what she said was her interpretation of the event. She confessed her feelings about people, even a man named Samuel, with whom she did not have the feelings that he had for her. After he had told her his feelings and she told him something that made him very happy she wrote, "What in the world have I let myself in for now?" Seren let Samuel think that she had the same feelings for him, while, really, she had no intention of settling down with anyone. There were other instances where Seren told the reader her thoughts during all the horrible events in her life that she had not told many other people. Writing those confessions gave her memoir a strong truth and power.<BR>	Although Seren expressed how she felt easily, the people around her, especially the family members, were not well depicted. Two very important family members, her sisters Esther and Zipporah were some of the members that were somewhat confusing. Those two people were not easily recognizable in the beginning. Once the sisters got their share of being alone with Seren, they got their own distinct voice. They each should have gotten that closer to the beginning of the story. <BR>The memoir of such a great survivor during the Holocaust is a fantastic book to read. A reader will see what Seren Tuvel and the other Jews went through and get close to really getting to know the author. Seren does not get gory and give too many horrifying details of anything that happened, but the readers see enough to really feel what the prisoners of the Nazis went through. The story is absolutely amazing! It is not fast-paced, but Seren keeps the reader hooked and shows what her life was like.</span>

                    <span>Like others, I could not put this book down. Seren's story was captivating--she was incredibly strong in the face of horror. The fact that she was not German and explains what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe gave me a perspective I have not had. And, like other reviewers, I found her lack of bitterness amazing. This was the first Holocaust book I've read which made me understand that people had no idea what happened to members of their families. I knew it before; this time I felt it.</span>

                    <span>I read it in one sitting. This book really touched me as no other has. I'm a 'tough guy', but sobbed like a baby at one particular point...but I won't give it away! I've collected some great WWII biographies, and this one tops the list.</span>
