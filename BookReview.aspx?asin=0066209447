                    <span>After reading about 20 pages of this book, I was so sick of the frequent description of obscenity and could not read on.  I retuned the book the next day and decided that National Book Award perhaps has very odd standards to pick the winner.  Unfortunately many public libraries recommend National Book Award books. The caution I learn here is: You need to make your own judgment.</span>

                    <span>I too purchased this book based on critic reviews (NY Times for one).  It stinks.  Even if it is not accurate..I believe it is poorly written and belongs more in the urban girl genre i.e. Sex in the City" than in historical fiction.  I am very disappointed,  I will stick to Isabel Allende and authors like her if I want to read about South America.</span>

                    <span>One of the most interesting things I learned last night when I met Lily Tuck at the National Book Award gold-medal tour was that she never visited Paraguay before writing this novel.  Even more interesting, perhaps, is that she said that she almost certainly would not have written The News From Paraguay had she visited the country where it takes place.  At first this sounded odd to me.  After all, historical fiction relies heavily on extensive research in order to recreate a world that will seem authentic and genuine to the reader.  But then I started to think about my impressions of the book, and the first thing that occurred to me was that this book did not read like a typical work of historical fiction.  Yes, it was based on actual people who lived and actual events that took place 150 years ago.  But the overwhelming sense throughout this book is that those people and events sprung out of an imagination, not an encyclopedia.  And that, I believe, is what makes this book a real gem.  This is history told the way it should be - as a story.  While remaining faithful to true events, it recounts those events in a way that makes you forget that you are reading about something that actually happened.  You get so absorbed in the imaginative detail, in the grace of the prose, and the human drama, that the historical element of the novel quickly becomes secondary to the literary element.  And that is the way it should.
<br />
<br />While not a perfect novel, it certainly is a delight to read.  Perhaps most importantly, Tuck has managed to write in 250 pages what a lesser author would have required twice as long to accomplish.  The brevity of the novel, I think,  is what gives it its sense of urgency throughout.

                    </div>
                    <span>If you're looking for the literary equivalent of a bowl of popcorn, this is the novel for you: I've ripped through 50 pages in a half hour without breaking a sweat, and while I'll probably persevere and read the rest of it, I won't do so because it's riveting reading so much as to justify having paid for it. 
<br />
<br />The language, as has been noted by other reviewers, is drab and flat: while I suppose that the primitive vocabulary, simplistic syntax, and pallid descriptions might be intended to reflect some aspects of Ella's personality or character, they don't make for a very rewarding reading experience.
<br />
<br />Add to this the choppy, episodic, patchwork format, and you've got a book that requires work to stick to, but offers little incentive to do so.
<br />
<br />If you're interested in learning about Paraguay, don't bother with this silly piece of fluff: buy a copy of John Gimlette's "At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig: Travels Through Paraguay." Gimlette's language, pacing, and storytelling ability compared to Lily Tuck's are as Hyperion to a satyr: I enjoyed it so much that I re-read it a few weeks after my first reading, and it was just as much fun the second time as the first.
<br />
<br />If you're looking for a novel about the same cast of characters that Tuck employs -- well, Gimlette's book, while it is presented as non-fiction, is vastly more entertaining, and unless he's grossly misrepresenting Paraguayan history, the reality is so bizarre and juicy that it doesn't require any fictionalization.
<br />
<br />The best thing that I can say about "The News From Paraguay" is that it gives me hope that I, too, may someday win a National Book Award: I just have to dumb down my vocabulary, dismember my narrative, and replace every third adjective with "bad".</span>
