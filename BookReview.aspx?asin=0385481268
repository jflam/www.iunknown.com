                <span id="Label1">Relatives are the family we are born with, but friends are the family we choose.  Friendship brings extraordinary comfort and joy to our lives--and best friends go a step further.  They are there not only to celebrate our happiness, but to cushion our pain.  What is it that inspires everyday friends to forge a lasting connection and become best friends?  <P>Sharon J. Wohlmuth and Carol Saline, the bestselling authors of <i>Sisters</i> and <i>Mothers and Daughters,</i> capture the essence of the ties that bind these "chosen families" together.  In this beautiful collection of essays and photographs, Saline and Wohlmuth survey friends from a broad range of American life.    <P>As the voices and perspectives of these men and women mingle, echo and occasionally differ with one another, we discover how friends meet, how they sometimes fight, how they reconcile, and what keeps them close.  Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Bacon, Angela Bassett, Naomi Judd, Larry King, Patti LaBelle, Andrea Mitchell, Morrie Schwartz, Kerri Strug, and Gay Talese share their relationships with people who would love them even if they weren't famous.  Many lesser-known but equally inspiring friendships are included as well: three gorgeous sisters who share everything from their apartment to their careers as classical chamber musicians, an affluent novelist whose best friend is a nun living under a vow of poverty, two Holocaust survivors who built their friendship in the Nazi death camps and rekindled it when they accidentally met on a street in Boston, and five octogenarians who grew up as best buddies and have never lost their intimate attachment.  <P><i>Best Friends</i> illustrates more than just the good fortune of the people in its pages; it reveals the power, dignity and variety of the precious bonds we develop and maintain throughout our lives.   <P>Sharon J.  Wohlmuth is a Pulitzer Prizewinning photojournalist and lecturer who has covered national and international assignments for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> since 1978.  Her previous books are <i>Mothers</i> and <i>Daughters and Sisters.</i>  She lives in Philadelphia with her husband, Lawrence Teacher.  <P>Carol Saline is a National Magazine Awardwinning journalist, broadcaster, and public speaker.  A senior writer at <i>Philadelphia</i> magazine and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Syracuse University, she lives in Philadelphia.  Her previous books include <i>Straight Talk, Dr.  Snow, Sisters,</i> and <i>Mothers and Daughters.</i></span>

                    <span>I don't think I fully understood what the true meaning of having a "best friend" was until after reading this book. It gives such insight into what it means to be and to have a Best Friend. It explores the concepts of unconditional love and true acceptance of the people we call our Best Friends. This would be a great book to give to the person in your life that holds the honor of being your Best Friend.</span>

The saying and verses are touching and the stories are reminders of what friendship is like or should be like!

                    <span>I have read all three books cover to cover. In addition to being nice books to look at, they tell compelling stories. By the time I finished, I was misty-eyed and feeling like I needed to reconnect to the friends I've had for the past 10-15 years. Even though the same phrase was repeated throughout the book,"My friend is one who I can be real with; someone I've told things I've never anyone else before." in each case, it feels fresh and new due to the unique circumstances each friend met. I was glad to see men, people with disabilities, Asians, blacks and hispanics, teenagers, and young children just starting to learn about friendship. It's really an inclusive book and I hope they do another trilogy: Fathers and Sons, Brothers, Couples.</span>

                    <span>I especialy loved the story about the two younger girls Greta and Satya. I am so glad they found eachother I understand how hard it is to be a teenager in this world and what a comfort to know you not only have a friend to talk to but a best friend to share and relate with. The girls were so young and inspiring I wish I had a friendship like theirs when I was younger.What a captivating book even better than the first two.</span>
