                <span id="Label1">Gripping accounts of all known fatal mishaps in the most famous of the World's Seven Natural Wonders.  <P>Two veterans of decades of adventuring in Grand Canyon chronicle the first complete and comprehensive history of Canyon misadventures. These episodes span the entire era of visitation from the time of the first river exploration by John Wesley Powell and his crew of 1869 to that of tourists falling off its rims in Y2K.  <P>These accounts of the 550 people who have met untimely deaths in the Canyon set a new high water mark for offering the most astounding array of adventures, misadventures, and life saving lessons published between any two covers. Over the Edge promises to be the most intense yet informative book on Grand Canyon ever written.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must read for anyone planning to venture into the Grand Canyon. It chronicles every known death in the canyon and on its rims. Morbid? Perhaps, but the book's real aim is to keep you the reader from making the sorts of decisions that have led to hundreds of people's deaths.<P>The fatal incidents are grouped into categories: falls from the rim, falls within the canyon, heat/dehydration, drowning, etc. Some cases are covered in just a sentence or two; others are described in riveting detail. It's a hard book to put down.<P>Having made 15 backpacking trips into the canyon, most of them a week long, I figured I knew everything there was to know about safe and sensible behavior in the canyon. But even for me this book was a real eye-opener. For someone going to the canyon for the first time or the hundredth time, "Over the Edge" just might be a life-saver.</span>

                    <span>This collection of fatal and near-fatal incidents in the Grand Canyon might make one hesitate to ever do anything again-- don't go near the edge! Don't fall in the river! Don't hike alone! Don't ride in a helicopter!<P>And yet... <P>This book has a strangely positive side. By reviewing and analyzing accident after accident at Grand Canyon National Park, the writers give a picture of how to mitigate one's risks while still enjoying this fabulous place. Their analysis of risk factors seems somewhat clinical, but also saves the book from being one long gruesome body count, and allows the reader to learn by others' bitter experiences. <P>Do watch your step. Do wear a life jacket. Do hike with friends and bring lots of food and water. And mule rides are safer than helicopters (the question of whether mule rides or helicopter tours are appropriate activities for a national park are left for the reader to contemplate).<P>The "darwin awards" tone of the book keeps it from getting too grim, and on the other hand, there is a compassion to the writing that reminds us that these cautionary tales are about real people whose deaths were genuinely mourned by their families and by those who tried to save their lives. <P>Why not five stars? I reserve that for pulitzer prize quality writing-- this isn't quite there (and where were the car wrecks?) -- but it's darned good, and worth your time and money.</span>

                    <span>i really liked this book,cause it told me everything about the canyon that a traverler, really needs to know before he goes there,the canyon is the most beautifull sight to behold in all its glory,its really amazing, and majestic,but at the same time it can be dangerous,we must have a respect for the canyon, this book will not only tell you about the dangers from falling,and drowning,but will tell you the full history of the grand canyon,these are events that really took place,i hope that everyone who intends to visit the grand canyon,will read this book first,so they can enjoy all the grand canyon has to offer,and live to tell about it....</span>

                    <span>Having just returned from my second cross-canyon hike, and my third trip to the bottom of Grand Canyon, I say this simply: BUY AND READ THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU PLAN YOUR TRIP! I was somewhat surprised to find that the book contains much, much more than just tales of death. The two authors are supremely qualified to write about the canyon: One is a former ranger there, and the other is a former doctor there, and both have hiked extensively for years there. The advice they give is some of the best I've ever read in any source, and their explanations of phenomena like flash floods, for example, are the best I've ever seen. I wish I had read this book before my first trip, which was done with an overweight pack and too little knowledge. My last trip was better, with a pack that weighed 33 pounds (vs the 65 of the first one). <BR>BUY and READ this book!!!!!</span>

                    <span>Born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, I have visited the Canyon numerous times throughout my life. And the one question that has always been with me when I see the Canyon is "How many people fall off each year?". In the gift shop of El Tovar, I discovered this book, however, was stuck paying the gift shop price!! The book not only answered my rather morbid question; it took me on a complete journey of stories of those with poor judgement, freak accidents, and those who were just innocent victims of the unknown in such a tremendous place. It is such an eye opener to all of those who have been to the Canyon...and also for those planning to someday visit! I would even be as to so bold so say that those who haven't been to the Canyon SHOULD read this book before entering...it could possibly save your life. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read...and will recommend it to all who are interested in learning a completely different, if not macabre version of what should be a fun, relaxing, family vacation spot!</span>
