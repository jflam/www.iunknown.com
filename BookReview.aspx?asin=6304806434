                <span id="Label1"><i>Con Air</i> is proof that the slick, absurdly overblown action formula of Hollywood mega-producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (<i>Top Gun</i>, <i>Days of Thunder</i>, <i>The Rock</i>, <i>Crimson Tide</i>) lives on, even after Simpson's druggy death. (Read Charles Fleming's expos&eacute;, <i>High Concept: Don Simpson and the Hollywood Culture of Excess</i>, for more about that.) Nicolas Cage, sporting a disconcerting mane of hair, is a wrongly convicted prisoner on a transport plane with a bunch of infamously psychopathic criminals, including head creep Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich), black militant Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), and serial killer Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi, making the most of his pallid, rodent-like qualities). Naturally, the convicts take over the plane; meanwhile, on the ground, a US marshal (John Cusack) and a DEA agent (Colm Meaney), try to figure out what to do. As is the postmodern way, the movie displays a self-consciously ironic awareness that its story and characters are really just excuses for a high-tech cinematic thrill ride. Best idea: the filmmakers persuaded the owners of the legendary Sands Hotel in Las Vegas to let them help out with the structure's demolition by crashing their plane into it. <i>--Jim Emerson</i> </span>

                    <span>Con Air is a blockbuster movie. A film that soars with the best of them. And since it's produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, no wonder it's a hit. Making his directorial debut, Simon West does a terrific job pleasing the crowds of movie-goers. Cameron Poe (played by Nicolas Cage, with a Southern accent and shoulder-length hair) has just been releashed from prison after being convicted of manslaughter in the first degree. After 7 years, Cameron is finally going home to his wife and daughter. Hitching a ride home on the 'Jail Bird,' Cameron is put on a plane with the world's most vicious criminals including Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom (John Malkovich), Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi) who "makes the Manson family look like the Partidge family." Within 5 minutes of takeoff, the criminals have already assumed command of the plane, are in possession of all the weapons, and took all the guards hostage. Being the former United States Park Ranger that he is, Cameron Poe decides to try and save the day with the help of on-the-ground U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (played by John Cusack). Con Air is an explosive film with great special effects, superb acting, and humor on the side. I recommend it for anyone looking for a movie with non-stop action beginning to end.</span>

                    <span>Pound for pound, for pure fun, this is one of the greatest movies ever. Please note that I said for pure fun. I'm not comparing this movie to "Ben Hur," "I, Cladius," "Shakespeare In Love," or any other movie that has a great deal of scope & breadth. Again, I'm only talking about movies that are for unfettered entertainment's sake.<P>"Con Air" is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't, either. This is a Bruckenheimer movie that is heavy on action and comedy, and light on plot & character development. Yes, most of the movie is absurd, but it is also absurd in a fun way.<P>The cast is absolutely impeccable, featuring Nicholas Cage, John Malchovich, Steve Buscemi and John Cusack. We even get Colm Meaney as an irate Irish DEA agent - a wonderful touch! The direction is superb, and Trevor Rabin delivers yet another riveting score. <P>This is a can't miss for anyone who wants to sit back & watch an hour & a half of hilarious mayhem. This is what I would call a guy movie - squared!</span>

                    <span>This movie is about as believable as finding that "Snow White" was based on a true story...this movie is so ridiculously stupid that I gave one star. First of all, if Nicolas Cage's character killed someone in self-defense, there'd be no trial, he wouldn't be charged. Second, JOHN MALKOVICH AS A VIOLENT, MULTIPLE FELON? WHO DID HE BEAT FOR THE PART...STEVE URKEL? Then there's John Cusak trying desperately hard to show us that he can act...that he's still got it...but HE NEVER HAD IT! BELIEVE ME, IF THESE FELONS COULD FIGURE A WAY TO TAKE CONTROL OF A PRISON TRANSPORT PLANE USING A PAPER CLIP AND A MATCH, THEY WOULDN'T BE IN COUNTY LOCK UP, THEY'D BE RUNNING THE WORLD. Most of the directing shots are tilted and herendous, the acting is stupid (with Cage's phoney Southern accent), and the fact that Malkovich conviently lands on a conveyer belt that ends up crushing his head is way too unrealistic...ANOTHER THING, MALKOVICH IS ABOUT AS BRUTAL IN THE FILM AS IS WATCHING HIM ACT!</span>

                    <span>For pure adrenalin and testosterone exposure, one can't do much better than CON-AIR. There are a ton of unbelievable action scenes, and that's the key word---unbelievable. One can't say director Simon West didn't keep the action flowing. The finale in Las Vegas is way over the top!!!<BR>Credit the actors for doing something with their roles, especially the brilliant John Cusack who puts his teeth into his meaty role as a US Marshall. Also Colm Meaney as the DEA agent who is obstinate and overbearing, to say the least. There are a nasty set of villains--John Malkovich, Nick Chindlin, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, David Chappelle---a nice looking guard played by Rachel Ticotin, another good bad guy played by Mykel Williamson, and Monica Potter does a nice turn as Poe's wife. Nicolas Cage is so bland, saddled with a ridiculous Southern accent, and does so many stupid things, it's hard to see how we can consider this guy that heroic.<BR>But, if you want a two hour roller coaster ride with plenty of guns and action, CONAIR is hard to beat. It also has the Trisha Yearwood version of "How Do I Live," which is worth watching the movie!!!!</span>

                    <span>When I first sat down to watch this film I was expecting anything, but when it was over I knew it was one i'd always want to Have! The Story is about a man who has done time in prison for murdering somebody who tried to hurt his wife! And Finally he's going to go home! Tho on his way home he is put onto a plane that seems to have Americas worst criminals in hostory abourd, and the plane is highjacked by them and the plot starts! to take place and unfold, and many storys are told through the way, with some comedy, some action and some fun along with some decent acting for a film of this type!<P>This movie is worth it in my opinion! But its not to everyones taste, my recomendation is to hire it before you buy it if you can! It does play on personal opinions and tastes! To me its a great movie, but you be the judge for yourself!</span>
