                    <span>Eugenia Ginzburg, a highly educated and patriotic communist in 1930's Soviet Union, was falsely accused on a preposterous charge of counter-revolutionary terrorism and sentenced to ten years imprisonment that included horrible periods of solitary confinement and eventually labor in the infamous Siberian gulag archipelago made famous by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The utter senselessness, depravity, and human waste of these years are almost impossible to imagine, but Ginzburg's intricate descriptions of interrogation, prison life, and Siberian work camps make the reader shudder with bone-chilling cold and despair. This book should be forced reading for apologists of communism and the old Soviet Union. It eloquently, but shockingly, makes obvious why tyrannical power (in this case, Josef Stalin) is humankind's greatest evil and, without intending to do so, explains why (now) Russia is a nation tormented by its past and struggling to find a respectable path for its future. This book is not, however, a political commentary. It is at its core a heart-wrenching account of a very courageous woman who lost her husband, children, citizenship, and freedom to the paranoia and criminal evil of Stalin and communism. Throughout Ginzburg's tale, though, shines her indefatigable spirit. I read this book in only three sittings and the only complaint I had was its abrupt ending in the middle of her confinement. Ginzburg takes up the rest of her story in "Within the Whirlwind," which really should be volume two of this novel</span>

                    <span>The moment I opened this book I was immersed within it. Eugenia Ginzberg is a superb writer who uses her skill to deeply communicate the horror that the political prisoners in the Stalin years experienced. The story reflects the extremes of the human spirit: evil and love. It's not possible to read this book without being emotionally effected. It gave me a deeper appreciation for many of the freedoms, rights, and simple pleasures I have in my life. The book ends rather abruptly, though it apparently picks up in another book, "Within the Whirlwind." I will be getting my hands on that because I really want to know what happened to Ms. Ginzberg. After reading this book, I feel like I know her in some way.</span>

                    <span>Amazing book, recounting the horrors of "an honest Communist" who suffered under Stalin's repression. Ginzburg describes the 18 years she spent in prison and in work camps, from Kazan to Yaroslavl to Kolyma. A must read for those who want to understand the Stalinist period and the legacy of suffering that lingers in Siberia.</span>

                    <span>I recieved my copy of this book and started to read it and I read it with one hand as I prepared dinner, cleaned up, got the kids off to bed, and decluttered the house. I made some tea and continued to read. At about midnight the phone rang-- my husband had to go in very late to help someone-- and I just about had a heart attact as I stammered into the phone, "Oh G--, who is this?"<P>The book is THAT rivetting and THAT real. <P>AS the other critiques indicate, this is about a women's arrest with trumped up charges that only got worse, and her survival in the gulags. I felt like I connected with her because she is a mother and a professor. She lost her profession and her children in the blinking of an eye. I couldn't read it without checking on my own children and thanking God that we live in a place that is not like what hers was. You realise that there was little way of surviving for someone who wanted to play sanely and defend herself in an insane system. When she was in isolation, I felt like I was there with her. She doesn't write in a frilly, dramatic manner; she writes with a simple, clear voice. She isn't asking the reader to feel sorry for her because she is only telling her story. <P>I think the most movingpoint of the book was when she was in a camp helping out in the kitchen and she found out that one of her early accusers was in the camp and dying. Another prisoner came in and asked for rations as he was sharing with this man and she was about to tell him to relay to the dying man that Eugenia Semyonovna sent them to him, but then she stopped herself, "How could I poison this man's last meal?"<P>You see how a person can get to the point of loosing thier sanity then save themselves from loosing it and how many lost it and never regained it.</span>

                    <span>In her work Journey into the Whirlwind, Eugenia Ginzburg gives a personal account of the first three years of her eighteen-year ordeal during the Stalin purges of the 1930s. Teacher and editor of the Communist paper "Red Tartary," Ginzburg was accused of being a Trotskyist counter-revolutionary by a colleague and was thrown in jail, interrogated, dragged from prison to prison, kept in solitary confinement, and finally sent to a labor camp in the Siberian taiga. Ginzburg's position reveals the fact that party members (especially of high rank) were the first victims of the purges. Also, her past camaraderie with such people as the daughter of the notorious Soviet jurist Andrey Vyshinsky allows Ginzburg to offer the reader information about the important players of the purges that other victims may not have been able to provide.<P>Politically, it must be noted that this is not an anti-Communist book. The author remained loyal to her party. If anything, this book reveals how very strong party loyalties were to the men and women who were victimized as "enemies of the people." Throughout the book, Ginzburg refers to her cell mates by their party affiliation. Old party rivalries even persisted in the prisons. Communists often refused to believe that their government was arresting loyal party members and would never question the "conspirator" accounts in the Soviet newspapers. Ginzburg's husband, for example, remarked after seeing such a report: "Have you heard? Petrov has turned out to be an enemy of the people! How cunning he must have been to get away with it for so long." Out of this loyalty to the party came a loyalty to Stalin. One inmate still exhibited hope asserting "We must all of us write to Stalin so that he knows the truth, and when he does, how can he let such things happen to the people?"<P>Historically, Ginzburg's book is a document of the Soviet tactics to extract confessions and force accusations to incriminate others. The book does not contain descriptions of overly heinous crimes. Most of the abuse Ginzburg received was psychological. She did not, for example, experience the "standing cell" at black Lake where prisoners were placed in a dark room so narrow as to permit the prisoner only to stand with his arms at his sides. What Ginzburg describes is the social and psychological adjustment of the prisoners. For example, the inmates learned to communicate be tapping messages on their cell walls. Socially speaking, Ginzburg reveals that prison life "developed the better sides of my personality." No, this is not an apologist's work, but this book is also not a condemnation of the Communist party.</span>
