                    <span>A fascinating account of Nazi "scientist" and "doctor" Josef Mengele, who cheerfully "selected" thousands of Jews, Gypsies, and other people for quick death (gas chambers) or slow death (by exhaustion, malnutrition, and the filthy conditions) at Auschwitz, and who performed pseudoscientific "experiments" on many human prisoners, especially twin children. Delving into Mengele's past, as an endearing child known as "Beppo", and his life after the war (unrepetant to the end) the authors have created a fascinating portrait of this complex, twisted man. Juxtaposed with Mengele's story are the stories of the few twins who survived the experiments at Auschwitz. I found it especially poignant to see the contrast between Mengele's relatively easy life after the war--he used his family's wealth to start a successful business in South America and hobnobbed with other members of the South American Nazi "elite", and the lives of the twins after the war--most of them lost their families and lived in severe poverty, as well as being haunted throughout their lives by the horrors they suffered at Auschwitz. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Both my parents served in the armed forces overseas during World War II, and it was through them, as a young adult, I heard of the "children of the flames" and the horrors of the concentration camps. When the book was first published, it caught my attention for that very reason. "Children of the Flames" is not an easy book to read simply because of the subject matter. However, the authors have managed to relate the story in a way that tells of the evil acts committed but in as diplomatic a manner as possible. The attrocities are almost too bloodcurdling to conceive. For me, it was impossible to read "Children of the Flames" in one sitting, especially the interviews which actually describe life and the experiments at Auschwitz. <P>This is the story of Josef Mengele and his "children of Auschwitz". Selecting primarily twins (or others who caught his eye) from the multitudes of Jews headed for the gas chambers, Mengele used these innocent children to satisfy his own perverse needs, all in the name of research, as human guinea pigs for his own horrendous experiments. The book is based upon interviews with survivors of Mengele's twins, and the reader will quickly discover, there are few survivors. The interviews tell the life of survivors before capture, during their time at Auschwitz and after their release. Almost all victims have had a lifetime of horrific, unending nightmares except those who cannot remember. Those who cannot remember, and there are few, are perhaps blessed with the body's unique defence system to block out that which is too unbearable and too painful to remember. <P>It has been over fifty years since the Holocaust, but it will forever remain a part of our history. Perhaps we owe it to the survivors of the Holocaust, and the families of those who did not survive, to honour their memory by a book such as this. For those of us who were born after World Ward II, the book will give the reader a deeper appreciation of the freedom we have today in North America.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely a fiery book, containing gruesome stories, accounts of horrid crimes, and documents of the life of Dr. Josef Mengele. This book is very deep and goes into detail of the life before the Holocaust, during the Holocaust, and after the Holocaust. This book is a must read, but may be very inappropriate for children under 13. I rate this book a 4 out of 5, due to the content and graphic images painted into my head.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Josef Mengele had a pleasant and peaceful childhood in a friendly environment. In his early years, he was known as the playful Beppo, but in his prime years, he was feared and known as the Angel of Death. As the story unravels, stories collected from survivors Mengele's gruesome experiments give an insight about the horrors and crimes committed by the Angel of Death. These real holocaust stories teach the meaning of treasuring what you have, because one day it's here and the next day, gone. There are many holocuast stories out there, but this book is dedicated to the 160 survivors of Mengele's experiment, and the life of Dr. Josef Mengele.</span>

                    <span>if you are ready to have some real insight on what it was like- you have to read this book.this book is written in a fascinating style. the way both views are combined deserves utmost respect. i read this book in just about one afternoon. i couldn't put it away until finished. the most important aspect was to see the children's lifes unfold after the war and also that of Mengele. i am somewhat, but not completely gratified about how Mengele lived out the rest of his life, solitary and haunted. i wish he would have been brought to justice, it would have given more closure to a lot of people; but knowing how he spend the rest of his life separated from family, stripped of his titles , ridden by ailments etc. , gives some gratification (not enough 'though!)what troubles me is the the fact that he never had regret for the things he'd done- justified by pseudo-science. i'm sure he's burning in hell himself now. for "his twins" life was hard and difficult- how can someone live with such memories? but defying it they built lifes for themselves and had families, although somwhere, somehow a part in the puzzle is always missing.<BR> having read many books concerning WW II, and living the war through my parents' eyes - i have to say that this one touched me very deeply. <BR>i was born and raised in germany and grew up with the history of my country. my parents were both children during the second world war, so i carry their memories of the war as mine.my mother herself is a fugitive from hungary - it is hard for her to talk about that. her family lost everything as well, when the russians came. i live with their accounts of what life was like for them, now i can add memories of others to that -it is heartwrenching and very hard to conceive that all this happened, but it did. my heart aches and bleeds, but we all must deal with it and make certain that it will not be repeated. as we must remember all the victims of this war and any other war, we must teach our children about the past. it should never be forgotten. <BR> we have to know history in order for us to not let it be repeated.</span>
