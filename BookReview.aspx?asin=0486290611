                    <span>This book has a great collection of drawings from various geogrraphies of India. They are all small in size and most of them are simple to draw or practice. I bought this book for my daughter who loves to sketch. She really enjoys spending time recreating some of the designs. Ajit Mookerjee did a nice job of compiling all these designs into one book.</span>

                    <span>My family all love arts and design, and over the years this book has become dog eared because we have turned to it so many times for inspiration for everything from easter egg painting to cake decorating to holiday gift certificates. Some of the designs are quite low quality, it's true - they are much more useful for inspiration than for copying a design straight out of the book. I love it, and I think every household should have one - but that's just me. If you are looking for a glossy commentary and showcase of indian design, this is not the book for you.</span>

                    <span>I was looking forward to getting this book as I am unable to find quality books on Indian designs and motifs. Being from India, and really interested in beautiful Indian art from a very young age, I have even contemplated writing a book using my own collection of designs.<P>I was very disappointed when I got this book. 5000 designs sounds like a lot of work but a lot of the designs are not even worth using... the quality of drawing is so poor - it is an embarassment! There is even repetition of same designs on different pages. I would have forgiven that but the author seems more focused on making the number of designs large rather than actually making them legible qaulity. Moreover what really annoys me is the fact that he offers hardly any explanation to the source of the various designs he has used.<P>Overall very poor book... i wouldn't recomment it to anybody except that there are not that many books out there on Indian designs.</span>
