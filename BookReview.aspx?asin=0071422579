                    <span>As a duel licensed real estate agent, appraisal certified 15 year real estate investor and real estate website operator, I can honestly say that I have never seen anyone that gives you the nuts, bolts and tools of mathematical computation and analysis like MR. Gallinelli.
<br />
<br />Of the hundreds of real estate books that line my shelves, Franks book here has a place above my desk that is within arms reach, this book doesn't collect any dust!
<br />
<br />I can't stand books that leave you with some off the wall idea that only the author has figured out how to use, those are worthless, Frank takes you by the hand and knocks the fear of math right out of your head and gives you a monstrous calculator data base at no charge to actually DO the math while you're reading along.
<br />
<br />I'm going to have to give up a little secret here too, Frank is reachable, you can actually get in touch with this man when you have a question. He also teaches in his spare time at Columbia University to keep his skills sharp while giving back to his community in more ways than most.
<br />
<br />I'm a stickler for ethical treatment of the consumers in real estate and without going into the details of Franks mathematical formulas, models, presentations, examples, hints and rules of thumb, I will say that for less than $20 your are getting what many boot camp promoters charge thousands for.
<br />
<br />This is a full blown investment course that gives you the ability to accurately project forecasts that directly impact the bottom line, I may be a little biased as Frank can be found at my site www.magicbullets.com but I'm not exaggerating when I say Frank Gallinelli is the best in the business and I have never seen anything better than what Frank is offering you here!

                    <span>One of the most annoying things I find about real estate investment books is that most of them can be condensed to about 30 pages.  The other 170 pages usually try to sell you on the idea of getting into real estate in the first place, and offer plenty of examples that don't have anything to do with anything.
<br />
<br />This is 252 pages of pure information.  There are examples, of course, but they relate directly to the concepts he's working with and illustrate them clearly.
<br />
<br />It's heavy on math, but that's why I bought it.  I'm a math person and have been jonesing for something like this book for a long time.  It's not difficult - all the calculations are high-school algebra at their most complex- but if you're not a math person, as stated, he gives out free spreadsheets that do them for you.
<br />
<br />Also as stated, if you have a finance degree this book isn't for you.  If you're like me, and want to know what to do with the numbers, then this book is a must.</span>

                    <span>at some point, every investor needs this information. figuring out whether something is a good investment or not basically boils down to Return on investment. also figuring out when to sell is important. (basically when the Internal Rate of Return decreases).
<br />must read!</span>

                    <span>There is a lot of good criticism here.  So, I will only add that the next printing should include an index, and possibly a glossary of terms.  Only then will it be a truly useful reference work.</span>
