                    <span>I am talking the certification test next week. I almost did not buy this book because of the negative reviews, but I am very glad that I did. I completely disagree with the three prior reviews: I think this is indeed a study guide, and not a user guide. It is 200 pages, so of course it cannot teach you Dreamweaver. Its purpose is to give you a sort of elaborately annotated "checklist" of DW 2004 MX features so you can address the features you are not familiar with; even if you use DW often, there will be areas you are not familiar. I think this a great "study guide" if you go through it with DW open on your PC/Mac. Here is the point, straight from the intro: "This book is not a cheat sheet. It will not teach you DW MX 2004 from scratch, nor will it give you a list of things to remember to pass the test. What it will do is help you systematically review every major (and not so major) feature..." Against this promise, this "study guide" delivers. Especially because the Exam Specifications that you download from Macromedia--I don't know about you--raised more for me questions than it answered.
<br />
<br />For 200 small pages, it also has a high signal-to-noise ratio. There are some really helpful snippets in here. I can't promise I'll pass the test, but in my opinion, a decent strategy includes (1) use DW, (2) work through either the Missing Manual or the Bible, and (3) use this study guide to systematically give yourself a comprehensive tour of the program features.</span>

                    <span>It can't hurt to read this book, but as a study guide if fails.
<br />Firstly some of the answers were wrong. Worse, most of the questions don't appear in the exam.
<br />If you are interested in learning about some of the features in Dreamweaver, OK read this. But if you want to do the exam, buy something else. So, one star because it claims to be a study guide. Otherwise it would be three.

                    <span>This is a the most useless book I've ever bought. It doesn't give me anything that I need to pass the exam. Only a text describing what dreamweaver mx 2004 really really is. Not a study guide how to meet the problem. Moreover it lacks of challenging questions.<p>Very Dissapointing.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>For starters, the book itself is really good; I did learn a lot about DWMX 2004 that I wasn't as familiar with as I'd like to be, however, the errors that showed up (yes, not only in the content but in the answers to the sample questions) were not only disturbing, but should be a pretty big concern for those who have less of a knowledge of the tool.<p>The exam questions were of little relevance to the book--that is, there were very limited questions that I felt I gained any insight to by painstakingly reviewing the book that is supposed to be what you need to pass the exam.<p>In fact, I will firmly state that I passed the exam based on real-life experience and exposure to the tool and HTML, ColdFusion, Javascript and CSS instead of what was in the book.  That was pretty disappointing.<p>Again, I do find that the book was great for helping expose me to some of the features I hadn't really checked out before, but I cannot honestly give credit to the book for helping me pass.  There is some core understanding that it will help you with, but nothing is going to get you through this exam like "real life" experience.</span>
