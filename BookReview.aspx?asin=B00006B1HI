                <span id="Label1">Originally broadcast on CBS in March 2002, <I>9/11</I> is an extraordinary record of that fateful day in New York City. This one-of-a-kind documentary was originally conceived as a portrait of 21-year-old Tony Benetatos, a firefighter trainee at Manhattan's Duane Street firehouse, located seven blocks from the World Trade Center. By the time filming was finished, brothers Jules and Gedeon Naudet had captured history in the making, including the only image of the first jetliner striking Tower 1, and the only footage from <I>within</I> the tower as it collapsed. This is not, however, a film about the murderous nightmare of terrorism. It's the ultimate rite-of-passage drama, more immediate and meaningful than any fiction film could be, with Benetatos and his supportive colleagues emerging as heroes of the first order. Sensitively narrated by codirector and fellow firefighter James Hanlon, <I>9/11</I> will endure forever as a tribute to those, living and dead, who witnessed hell on that sunny Tuesday morning. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>This is by far the BEST 9/11 documentary around!  When it came out on TV my husband and I went to our fire department to watch it.  We were not the only ones who had that idea.  EVERY FIREFIGHTER in our department was there.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the place when it was over.  It really showed what happened to the firefighters, and how they WANTED to be there.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. This documentary on 9/11 is the story of 2 brothers who were out to make a documentary of fire fighters, but instead they made this. They made this by mistake. But it is still worth a lot of watches.

                    <span>This documentary is phenomenal. The real thing. I watched this the other day and for once completely understood the feelings of what went on. Since I was fortunate to not have anyone close to me affected by 9/11 events it hadn't sunk in what a tragedy it was until this film. Granted it is just one firestation, but it is not supposed to be of all of them. It is the raw footage that was filmed by two brothers who just so happened to have the camera rolling that day. If you want a film that shows all aspects including the Pentagon then this may not be for you, but if you want an inside personal view of what it was like for two brothers each with cameras, this movie is absolutely phenomenal. It will leave you awestruck. The intensity and feelings captured by these guys is amazing. I highly recommend this movie to get a true feel for what happened that tragic day. No special effects, no "extras" for effect, just the real thing.</span>

                    <span>     The title of the film indicated to me that the presentation would be about the whole episode of 9/11.  I anticipated seeing all of the film of the planes crashing into the buildings, the collapse of the towers (both of these were in this film but the pictures were not clear in explaining the event.  They are more amateur/victim footage from up close to and inside of the building while the tragedy is taking place.)
<br />
<br />     The film is interesting.  And if you want more of a personal documentary approach (centering on a department of Firefighters who were there that day - but, only one of the many departments of Firefighters involved) then this is the film for you.  
<br />
<br />     I bought a copy with the thought in mind of having a record of the event that I could show to my children in ten years so that they could, with candid clarity, understand what took place.  This is definitely not the film appropriate for that purpose.  The feeling of the film is a record of what we all thought on that day, "what the hell is going on?"  There is no follow up footage on what we discovered about the events in the years following or even what happened after the rescue operation which took place for the few weeks after the collapse.  There is no theory as to how the hijackers accomplished what they did or what motivated the attack.  There is only a bunch of stunned people trying to figure out what they could possibly do.  This is not a "9/11 documentary".</span>
