                    <span>This wafer-thin guide reminds me of something a tour bus company might hand out to it's passengers. There is not much detail, it is more a pamplet than a guide and most dirt routes are completely omitted. <br>"Road Guide" doesn't serve as enough of a guide, even at the modest price. Death Valley is a huge park and to produce a quality guide one must go into some depth and do copius research. Aside from some nice color photos here there just is not much good to say about this little book. Except for the one or two day rushed visitor, who will never again return, this guide doesn't even come close to being helpful. If you just want to make a one-time quicky visit, drive through and never take the time to really see and discover Death Valley I suppose you could find this of some use. I'll be relegating mine to a box of garage sale merchandise I have.<br>If it weren't for the nice photos I'd give this one star, and I've never rated anything that low before.</span>

                    <span>This Road Guide was the only book I purchased before traveling to Death Valley in April 2001 with my husband and two daughters, ages 12 and 10, and I found it was the only book we really needed.  The Road Guide gives you all the information you need to explore Death Valley over a 2 to 3 day period of time. And don't worry about taking the "bumping" roadways if you don't have a 4WD!  They are really no problem and actually have the most interesting scenery.  I will look for other Road Guides for our future travels.</span>
