                <span id="Label1"><div><i>BLOW</i> is the unlikely story of George Jung's roller coaster ride from middle-class high school football hero to the heart of Pable Escobar's Medellin cartel-- the largest importer of the United States cocaine supply in the 1980s. Jung's early business of flying marijuana into the United States from the mountains of Mexico took a dramatic turn when he met Carlos Lehder, a young Colombian car thief with connections to the then newly born cocaine operation in his native land. Together they created a new model for selling cocaine, turning a drug used primarily by the entertainment elite into a massive and unimaginably lucrative enterprise-- one whose earnings, if legal, would have ranked the cocaine business as the sixth largest private enterprise in the Fortune 500.<br><br>The ride came to a screeching halt when DEA agents and Florida police busted Jung with three hundred kilos of coke, effectively unraveling his fortune. But George wasn't about to go down alone. He planned to bring down with him one of the biggest cartel figures ever caught.<br><br>With a riveting insider account of the lurid world of international drug smuggling and a super-charged drama of one man's meteoric rise and desperate fall, Bruce Porter chronicles Jung's life using unprecedented eyewitness sources in this critically acclaimed true crime classic.<br></div></span>

                    <span>While it may be difficult to empathize with the downfall of one of the biggest drug cartels in history, the story of George Jung will certainly amaze, capture and hold your attention from start to finish. Anyone who grew up in the sixties, an era of "flower children, hippies,love-ins, sit-ins," Vietnam protests and communal living, will recall the introduction into our society of "pot" and LSD. George Jung became one of the largest importers of marijuana, which eventually led to his connection with Carlos Lehder and the Meddellin Cocaine Cartel.<P>From opulant living, a home literally lined with money, fast women, fast cars and fast-paced lifestyle to the downward spiral of drugs, paranoia, health problems and arrest, this is the actual account of George Jung's life. This is the amazing journey of a man who had it all, to a defeated man who lost everything in the process. It is an inside look at life in the fast lane from the glorious moments in the sun to absolute terror, corruption and destruction. Now a major motion picture, you will not want to miss either the book or the movie - both are excellent.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a true story of the rise & fall of George Jung. George became involved with smuggling pot in from Mexico in the 1960's & went on to become one of the founding members of the Colombian Cocaine Cartel led by Pablo Escobar. Geogre intially was Pablo's MAJOR U.S. cocaine distributor, was the one link Pablo had to the U.S. cocaine distribution network. Another Colombian, Carlos Ledher, stole George's U.S. connections, & cut him out of the business. George then basically married into a Colombian family, and started moving smaller cocaine contract loads through a relative by marriage-Humberto. Humberto was connected to Pablo Escobar. <BR> This book is well written, and also tells a bit about drugs, their cultivation, the human physiology of drug interactions, and how basic smuggling operations are established. It is also just a plain good story. I thought the ending was a bit sad though.<BR> To clear up the question of: "Is George free, or in Prison". George was free, and delivering seafood to restaurants in Massachusetts. He subsequently got busted smuggling pot from Mexico, and received a 22 year jail sentence in 1993-1994, and is currtely in prison at Otisville, New York.</span>

                    <span>Those interested in learning about the disparate personalities largely responsible for the cocaine avalanche that washed over America need only read this excellent book and Mark Bowden's equally fascinating work of non-fiction titled "Killing Pablo."<P>In "Blow", we laugh at the ordeals of George Jung and company as they grow rich exploiting America's burgeoning drug market while being chased, indicted, and jailed by inept and unsophisticated law enforcement agencies and prosecutors. In "Killing Pablo", we shudder over the actions of the world's (formerly) most ruthless drug lord who held Colombia hostage through rewards and ruthless punishment aptly termed "plata o plomo" (silver or lead).<P>Porter and Bowden performed exhaustive research on their respective protagonists and produced rousing narratives. Two of the finest works of non-fiction - of any topic - I've ever read.</span>

                    <span>George Jung is widely acknowedged as the man who introduced cocaine for mass consumption to people in the United States, and this book tells us how he did it. Sort of a lesson in how to smuggle.<P>From his begginings as a high school football player, through his early days selling marijuana in Florida, right through to his career as the number one cocaine supplier in the US and ending up with him languishing in prison, every aspect of his life is covered here in all it's glory.<P>With a life as rich in detail as Jung's, the book could easily have become bogged down in detail, but it's to the writers credit that he never lets the pace flag.<P>Highly reccommended.</span>

                    <span>Ever wonder what would be your life if they made it a movie?<BR>Awesome book! Well-written for a pop bio. <P>I fell asleep reading it, dreamt about about the Medellin cartel, picked it up again before getting out of bed. <P>This, the real story, was messier than the movie. The essence was the same, but the order was different. Details were moved around. George had a sister. His girlfriend didn't die of cancer. He didn't quit after breaking with Carlos. <P>That was interesting to me, but I found this story just amazing. . . and well put-together. Good work Porter.</span>
