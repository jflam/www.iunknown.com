Suddenly, Brian finds himself alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother has given him as a present -- and the dreadful secret that has been tearing him apart ever since his parents' divorce. But now Brian has no time for anger, self-pity, or despair -- it will take all his know-how and determination, and more courage than he knew he possessed, to survive.</span>

                    <span>Have you ever been stranded in the woods all by yourself? In the book HATCHET, Brian Robeson is on his way to visit his father for the summer when his pilot has a heart attack. Brian is able to crash land the plane in lake nearby. Brian had to face the elements of nature and starvation. He had to learn how to survive with only his hatchet and his surroundings. This book is for middle school age students because the vocabulary is exelent and easy to understand. <BR> HATCHET is a good book thatyou cant put down. There was a tornado that destroyed Brian's shelter and scattered every thing he owned. One night while Brian was sleeping a porcupine intruded his shelter and stabbed Brian in the leg with its quills.<BR> HATCHET was a good book that teaches you how to survive in the wilderness. Brian had to gather berries, hunt rabbits and birds, and spear fish to eat. <BR> Hatchet is a fiction story because it didn't really occur.<BR> Brian Robeson has a plane crash and is stranded in the wilderness. He has to learn how to hunt for his food. Brian has to fend against mosquitos, flies, bears, moose, and tornados.</span>

                    <span>Recommendation<BR>I would recommend this book to anyone 11 years old and up because it presents a picture of how a young man survives the wilderness. Another reason would be that it was a very interesting story about survival. For example, any mistake that Brian makes could cause disaster. "Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death". Another example is when Brian tries to start a fire, but does not know what to use. "Clearly there had to be something for the sparks to ignite, some kind of tinder or kindling-but what?" In conclusion, if you are interested in survival and adventure, then read this book.</span>

                    <span>The main events in Hatchet are related to the conflict and the solution. The conflict was the plane crash that Brian was in. He had to survive in the Canadian wilderness. One of the solutions that he had to do to survive is make a home. He also had to find food by hunting and fishing. He had to make a fire to help him survive and be seen to be rescued. He was successful because he was rescued. <BR>I rate this book 5 stars because it showed how 11, 12, and 13 year old boys can take care of themselves when they are alone in the woods for 54 days.It also was interesting to read because Brian was keeping a secret and never told his dad. It was exciting because you would not know what was going to happen next.</span>

                    <span>I had to read this book for a school project, and let's just say it was pretty bad. I've read many better survival stories that were a little more realistic than this. But, Hatchet has taught me a lesson: Pay attention to all that's around...you'll never know when you'll end up in a situation like Brian's.</span>

                    <span>The book is basically like a self-journey. The main character did his best to live in the wilderness with harsh conditions the best he could. He was physically beaten by large massive animals, bitten by many mosquitoes, and the anticipation to leave. He also wondered about the situation with his mother and her mysterious lover. I would suggest everyone to read this book.</span>
