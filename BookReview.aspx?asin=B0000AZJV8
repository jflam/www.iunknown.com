                    <span>This program is pretty pricey for what you get. I wouldn't have felt too bad about the price, except I found out after buying it that it no longer comes with an instruction book. There are lots of good books on amazon on how to use Frontpage, as long as you don't mind forking over another $50.oo. At least this program isn't as expensive as Dreamweaver, but then again, Dreamweaver is not going to be used for the same reasons that Frontpage is used for.
<br />
<br />It took me two weeks to get comfortable using Frontpage 2003. And I spent most of the time figuring out that allot of the options it offers to make things easier, just don't work, or only work when you are using certain servers or certain browsers. Before buying you should go to, mww.interlacken.com/winnt/tips/tipshow.aspx?tip=29 and learn in 2 minutes what took me two weeks to learn the hard way.
<br />
<br />Not only is using lots of fancy crap, such as java, flash, etc. annoying to most people, lots of browsers are not even set up to run all this unnecessary glut. So either you have to give your customers a plain HTML page to go to, or loose sales. Check out two of the most popular web sites on the internet, amazon and ebay. They keep it very simple and it is not because the cannot afford to hire anyone to add a bunch of fancy buttons and flash.
<br />
<br />The reason I am saying this stuff is that you can get some really cheap or even free web page design software, if you are not going to be adding a bunch of fancy stuff.
<br />
<br />If you do get this program and do learn to use it, it can make your life allot easier if used properly. Do a search on google for frontpage vs. dreamweaver to learn what lots of other people say.</span>

                    <span>This program is useless!  Don't waste your hard-earned money on this junk.  The interface is horrible, the overall design absolutely makes no sense, and the so-called components won't work.
<br />
<br />Bottom line is... unless you want to flush your money down the tubes, don't bother buying this.
<br />
<br />Instead, may I suggest Dreamweaver, or NetObjects Fusion; two very high quality programs.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Here is a list of my favorite improvements in 2003... 
<br />
<br />1)Previous versions of Frontpage had a lot of annoying bugs.  Some people did not even realize that their troubles with Frontpage was not their fault but were actually bugs in the software. This new version fixed the annoying bugs of previous versions.  
<br />
<br />2)Another huge improvement is the tabbed interface.  The tabs are similar to the FireFox browser.  They make it easy to go from one file to another quickly.
<br />
<br />3)The split screen option.  You can view the html and graphical web page at the same time.  This is nice if you like to edit the   html by hand once in a while.
<br />
<br />4)Web page file/folder navigation.  You can easily navigate through all of your files and make quick edits in 2003.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I could not give this program 5 stars because there are still a few minor bugs/issues/defects whatever you want to call them.  They are so minor though that most Frontpage users will not notice them.  Overall though this is a great program for a newbie to a guru.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>FrontPage 2003 is not intuitive, html code is not web standards compliant, does not have built-in support for advanced server side scripting languages. Other things you will need in order to get the most of your purchase are a book about FrontPage 2003 (no less than 500 pages), Windows 2003 server hosting strongly recommended. Additionally for Professionals: Visual Studio .Net 2003, Windows XP Professional or Windows 2000 Professional. To begin with my father who is a complete novice found it much easier to use Dreamweaver 2004 MX. My father liked Dreamweaver's the ability to easily add rollovers and other effects.  He criticized FrontPage 2003 for making it hard to do even the most simple tasks. FrontPage 2003 has the same templates that were in FrontPage 2000 with the same trashy code and if one tries to edit the code FrontPage will undo any corrections one makes. FrontPage 2003 adds Internet Explorer specific code when using features such as auto thumbnail, web components, word art, etc.. Word art may not be compatible with older browsers from Microsoft. FrontPage 2003 does not check for compliance to web standards from w3c.org which allow one to make a website that can be viewed correctly across all browsers. FrontPage 2003 does not have built-in support for advanced server side scripting languages, you have to use Windows Professional in order to test ASP.NET code and IntelliSense is not available for server side scripting languages. You don't believe me this quote is from the Microsoft support website:
<br />	Note  FrontPage does not currently support server-side scripting, CGI (CGI: Common Gateway 	Interface. A standard method of extending Web server functionality by executing programs or 	scripts on a Web server in response to Web browser requests, such as in form processing. Use of 	CGI can make a Web page more dynamic.), ASP.NET, or Visual Basic .NET.
<br />[...]I wish Microsoft had told me this before. When its time to upgrade I'm going with Macromedia because developing professional websites with Microsoft isn't less expensive.</span>
