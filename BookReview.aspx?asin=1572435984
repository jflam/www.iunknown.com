                    <span>First, I am not a Yankees fan, but they have had some great players over the years and Mantle is, arguably, one of the best, and I have always admired his considerable talent. Everyone knows his statistics and how he liked to party, but I was looking for some insights into the man, and this book delivered. The book is a series of reminiscences by teammates, opponents, writers, friends and people whose lives were touched in some way by Mantle. Some are funny, some are poignant, but all of them together give a picture of the man. If you enjoy reading about the person behind the legend, and how he was perceived by others who knew him, then you'll enjoy this book. It's a good read and I recommend it heartily.</span>

                    <span>Well done! I remember when you two were kicking around the idea of a Mickey Mantle book. Congratulations on all your great ideas coming to fruition. You two make an excellent team. Good luck, I hope you sell them all! I look forward to your next collaboration.</span>

                    <span>There are lots of Mickey Mantle books out there, but I've never seen another like this. Anecdotes about Mickey from friends, teammates, and notable fans whose lives he touched. It's a fun, fast read as each story gives you a new perspective on one of the most colorful Yankees of all time. Unlike the standard-issue biographies out there, this book reads like a series of quick conversations and it is fascinating and entertaining to hear from such diverse names as Yogi Berra, David Halberstam, Regis Philbin, and Willie Mays. I learned a lot that I didn't know about Mickey, and I highly recommend this for you other Yankee fans out there.</span>
