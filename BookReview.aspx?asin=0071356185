                    <span>Most of us developed our management skills, or lack thereof, in the same way: through trial and error. But Morey Stettner's new book will give anyone freshly promoted to the ranks of management a valuable head start by spelling out practical steps that new managers can take to be effective. For all of you old-timers, reading this book will induce a near constant mental stream of "I wish someone had told me that when I was starting out." For example, Stettner's first step, writing out a basic plan of how you want to manage your subordinates, might at first seem a bit na√Øve to veterans. But consider this point: How much time did you spend thinking about the techniques you would use in managing people before taking over your first managerial assignment? The probable answer is not much. In a clear voice laced with illustrative examples, Stettner covers the critical skills managers rely on every day: speaking, listening, criticizing and disciplining. For his insightful treatment of these topics, we [...]  recommend this book to managers new and old, employees and students of management - But then again, aren't we all?<br /></span>

                    <span>This book is well written and nearly perfect for those transitioning to a management position with little time to spare.  I found it to be well organized and concise, highlighting good common sense principles to  remember when you take the helm of your new position.  It addresses many of  the common stereotypes and pitfalls new and experienced managers encounter.   The book does fall short of one of the back covers claims about hiring.   Nowhere within it's pages does it discuss hiring strategies or interviewing  skills.  This was disappointing and a critical piece missed by the author.</span>
