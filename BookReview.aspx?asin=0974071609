                    <span>Perhaps I underrate this book as it might really be useful as a reference. But I am just a run-of-the-mill DBA. What I look for when a new Oracle version is out is a book that explains the new features in a readable fashion and that makes me understand anything required to pass the OCP exam (which is more than I will ever need in real life as the Oracle RDBMS is increasingly blown up with unnecessary features). This book is not a book that one would like to read cover to cover: it is very much written in the stile of the official Oracle documentation, constantly listing parameters over whole pages. This could be useful if you want to drill down into a certain feature, but in such a case you might want to turn to the online documentation anyhow. And you should have read an Oracle 10 New Features book that really made you understand the big picture beforehand.</span>

                    <span>This is the best 10g New Features book out there.
<br />
<br />I got hold of the Oracle Press New Features book as soon as it was released and was pretty disappointed as it contained very little substance.
<br />
<br />In contrast this book contains loads of information on all the useful new features and is well worth having. I've spent plenty of time reading the Oracle manuals and it seems to me that this book condenses all the relevant information into a single volume.</span>

                    <span>It is much worse, than everything, what I read about Oracle before. 
<br />Generally it is the copied original documentation. 
<br />Practically there are no normal examples.
<br />So sorry.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was on my way to write more or less a negative review of this book, however I changed my mind and now I really think that this book is a *good* reference after all. Why?
<br />First title on Oracle 10g new features that I read was Robert Freeman's book. With modest 200+ pages it's an excellent introductory kind of text and nothing more, it's far from being  considered as a reference (or complete) guide to 10g new features. On the other hand Mr. Ault, Liu and Tumma's book has from the very beginning the ambition to be a true REFERENCE, as complete as possible (they even write some short introduction about new bioinformatics features included in 10g!!). It is amazing how many information they managed to compile and present in detail, especially considering the timing - short beta cycle of 10g and obvious &#34;gold rush&#34; of the publisher (shame on you ;-). Sometimes their explanations are a little beat too verbose and tedious (repetitive) for my taste - sort the writing style that we're familiar in Oracle manuals. 
<br />The worst thing about this book is the lack of proper technical editing. At first, I was convinced that this book was not edited at all, or that authors reviewed each other's chapters. Then I noticed Mike's comment in which he mentioned that someone from Oracle reviewed the book. Ahh...that explains everything, they barely cope with their own official manuals and now they're helping others ;-&#62;. How bad is it? Not as bad to bash it altogether....anyway, I saved some funny comments for the end of my review, they're made by the &#34;editor&#34; of the book (I guess?) and were left unchanged, ended in the final print...page 445: &#34;Not sure what you mean by example....Could you give a complete example here?&#34; or on page 447: &#34;Give a working example - LEVEL clause is missing and you should add parenthesis&#34;.</span>

                    <span>I am appalled by the low quality of this book.  The writing is weak and the examples are poor.  Some features are described for many pages with many very similar examples and others entirely lack examples or explanation.  There are plenty of cases when the book directly contradicts itself (p78 the database size is 8 million G in the table and 8 million T in the text; p82 there are 11 platforms in the table but the text says that there are only 9;...)  In short, it appears that the book was never proofread.</span>
