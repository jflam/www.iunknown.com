                <span id="Label1">&#8220;Since the first navy frogmen crawled onto the beaches of Normandy, no SEAL has ever surrendered,&#8221; writes Chuck Pfarrer. &#8220;No SEAL has ever been captured, and not one teammate or body has ever been left in the field. This  legacy of valor is unmatched in modern warfare.&#8221;<br><br><i><br>Warrior Soul</i> is a book about the warrior spirit, and it takes the reader all over the world. Former Navy SEAL Chuck Pfarrer recounts some of his most dangerous assignments: On a clandestine reconnaissance mission on the Mosquito Coast, his recon team plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with a Nicaraguan patrol boat. Cut off on the streets of Beirut, the author&#8217;s SEAL detachment must battle snipers on the Green Line. In the mid-Atlantic, Pfarrer&#8217;s unit attempts to retrieve&#8212;or destroy&#8212;the booster section of a Trident ballistic missile before it can be recovered by a Russian spy trawler. On a runway in Sicily, his assault element surrounds an Egyptian airliner carrying the Achille Lauro hijackers.<br><br>These are only a few of the riveting stories of combat patrol, reconnaissance missions, counter-terrorist operations, tragedies, and victories in <i>Warrior Soul</i> that illustrate the SEAL maxim &#8220;The person who will not be defeated cannot be defeated.&#8221;</span>

                    <span>One of the best books I've read about US Navy Seals. In the same category of Marcinko's Rogue Warrior and Robert A. Gormly's Combat Swimmer but Warrior Soul is more human and sentimental. The book not only describes the military exploits of an ex-serviceman but also a real life struggles of a super human being against psychological and physical odds. The real highlight of the book is its last chapter. What a formidable advice from Pfarrer: 'Hold on to the people you are close to,and love them fiercely.Get up every morning and live like there is no tomorrow. Because one day you'll find it's true.' I wish a good luck to Mr. Pfarrer in his combat against his illness.</span>

                    <span>I have never been a Navy SEAL but, after reading Mr. Pfarrer's excellent "Warrior Soul," I can safely say that I now understand a bit more what makes the most elite warriors in the U.S. military tick physically and emotionally. Above all else, as Mr. Pfarrer poignantly shows us, they are human beings who laugh and love and bleed just like the rest of us. Sometimes, those commonalities tend to get lost in the media's typical glorification of special forces operators. That said, "Warrior Soul" paints the most vivid picture imaginable of what it takes to become one of these special men and the lasting effect such a heroic undertaking has on their lives. This is a finely structured book penned by a truly terrific writer. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.</span>

                    <span>So many books out there about the military carry the hollywood theme with them from the theatres. Its high adrenaline macho talk about some guy who thinks he is the best soldier there has ever been. However, Pfarrer's book goes completely the opposite direction. He seems to talk about combat the way it really was for him without any self-serving purpose. Beautifully written with many sections that just make you squirm with their realism. This book is about a man faced with the terrible realities of war especially his involvement with Beirut. It is not glitsy or glamourous. As a young man trying to figure out if I would like to be a part of our countries armed services, I appreciate such a realistic portrayal of what its really like.</span>

                    <span>To start off, I thought this book was your normal memoir of someone who thought they were the greatest. This is unlike most of the other military memoirs. <P>Mr. Pfarrer does not talk about how good he was, or how great a leader he was. Unlike most memoirs, Mr. Pfarrer talks about how good his team was, not how great he was. He says stuff the way it was, he admits to not being the best husband, he admits to screwing up. This story is amazing, the stories he tells of America's secret wars that the news glanced over. It puts a lot of stuff in perscpective. <P>This is probably the best book I've read in the past year, and the absolute best book out there about the military, and special operations.</span>

                    <span>"Warrior Soul: The Memoirs of a Navy SEAL", by Chuck Pfarrer is quite a change from what I normally read. I subscribe to AVANTGO's RANDOMHOUSE channel and one of the excerpts they provided was from the first chapter of this book. After reading the excerpt, I was instantly hooked. I HAD to find out what happened next. I bought the book the next day. It's a real eye opener when you realize the things Pfarrer describes are true and part of our history. The author has a knack for conveying a wide range of emotion to the reader, making him/her feel like they were in the trenches, jungle, sub, boat or alley with him. Looking for a SAFE adrenaline boost? Read this book. The book also mentions a number of world events that someone from my generation may have heard of, but was too young to put into global historical context. The author generated a genuine interest in me, that lead to my researching a few of these events. I can understand why, when looking for this book at the book store, I found it under military history.</span>
