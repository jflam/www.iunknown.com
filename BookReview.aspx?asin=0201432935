                <span id="Label1">Author John Vlissides is a member of the so-called Gang of Four: writers of the bestselling and influential <I>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</I>, a catalog of 23 design patterns. This more recent book delivers considerable insight on using and applying software design patterns--reusable designs for common programming problems--and compiles the author's further experience with patterns. <p> <I>Pattern Hatching</I> first defends the patterns movement by offering 10 myths about patterns, which provide a framework for thinking about the role of patterns in today's software. (While not a silver bullet, the author argues for the continued importance of patterns throughout software engineering.) The next section shows how to apply several patterns (drawn from the original 23) in a file system; the author uses and describes common patterns such as the Composite, Visitor, Proxy, and Singleton. To help illustrate how to use patterns and how they work together, the author also provides C++ source code for the designs in the book.<p> Part of the fun of reading <I>Pattern Hatching</I> is getting the author's insight on the origin of thinking about patterns, including several patterns that were actually left out of the original book, such as the Generation Gap pattern and the Multicast pattern.<p> For readers who are familiar with <I>Design Patterns</I>, <I>Pattern Hatching</I> is a lively behind-the-scenes look at one of the most important recent developments in software design. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>A very helpful book especially very after GoF?s one reading . However it has a lot of C++ specific places, java developers will find the book also interesting :). It's written by one from the gang - John M. Vlissides. First part of the book gives a glance view of applying several GoF patterns in dummy simple file system building (Composite , Proxy, Visitor, Singleton, Mediator ) . The author also introduces two new patterns which don't mentioned in the Design Pattern (Generation Gap, Multicast ) in the next parts . </span>

                    <span>I was taken back by this gem. Vlissides starts of by dismissing all of the false claims and rumors about design patterns. He then proceeds to take you through the creation of a basic file system, explaining things like what a 'mkdir' type of program should do, and how to impement it. During this whole process, he presents various design patterns taken from the GoF book in a real context.<p>Don't buy this one alone. This is meant to be a supplement to 'Design Patterns'.</span>

                    <span>This really is the best book I know for describing the process of applying patterns to an application. It's a definite skill, a definite thought process, and very hard to convey. I do it by setting people specific problems to solve with specific patterns and hoping they develop the mapping for themselves. That usually works, sooner or later.<p>The first half of this book is like sitting behind Vlissides while he works at the keyboard, and listening to him talk to himself. It's very informal and conversational. I don't know how well it generalizes to other patterns in other contexts. For some people, though, a concrete example like this seems very helpful.<p>The second half of the book didn't give me much useful information. It continues the informal, conversational style. This part, however, involves several developers in the process of identifying, characterizing, and sometimes disqualifying candidates for design-pattern-hood. As much as I respect the people in the conversation, that section has a Disney-like fictional quality that I don't like. The old conversations have been reconstructed and morphed into some cleaned-up and picked-over form that reads well. Mostly, they just don't say anything that I can really use.<p>Seeing an example worked may help some people. On the whole, though, this book has less information per inch of shelf space than many others. Populate your bookshelf accordingly.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent companion for the GoF book, altough it has "own substance". It is written in a very plain, enjoyable and direct language. It address some extremely interesting issues for patterns interested audience.<p>It starts analysing the Top Ten Patterns Missconceptions, giving a great view and light on this issue. He groups the misconceptions in 3 groups, being What patterns are, what patterns do and facts about the characteristics of pattern community.<p>The second chapter gets even better: he copes the design of a Unix like File System design with Design Patterns, using Composite for the Files and Folders, Proxy for the Links, Singleton for users, Visitor for file system commands (he uses Unix cat command as an example), Template Method for single user protection and Mediator for multiuser protection. <p>Chapter 3 is maybe the best: it goes into some patterns and analyzes where it falls short. He goes into how to kill a singleton, Observer's class and relationship explosion problem (using of course an example!) and how to solution this with an alternative approach with a Visitor. Following, he presents the Generation Gap pattern (which didn't made it to the GoF book) and goes through some other stuff related.<p>Chapter 4 shows the pattern creation process of the GoF. It is awesome! he tryes to demistify themselves, showing the discussions regarding the Multicast pattern (which didn't made it to the GoF book). He reproduces all the email conversations between the GoF members, showing their pattern creation process filled with great insights.<p>Finally, chapter 5 offers 7 habits of effective pattern writting.<p>I've found this book very inspiring. I enjoyed a lot reading it and it gave me the opportunity to see how does the GoF work. <p>If you enjoyed the GoF book, this is one is for you!!!</span>

If you are starting new with patterns... read this.... just 150 pages. If the cost seems high, buy an used one.</span>
