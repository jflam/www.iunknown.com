                    <span>I thought the book was an outstanding read and in fact have read the book several times.  I have no idea why some reviewers want to critique Mr. Lavigne's writing style or "vulgar" word selection so harshly.  He is, after all, writing about the Hells Angels.  I feel these folks are missing the main point of the book which is to give the reader and insightful look into the bike gang, their rituals, codes etc.  To this end, Mr. Lavigne does an outstanding job!  I found the book to be a very comprehensive portrait of the most famous of biker gangs.  If these readers were so offended by some of Mr. Lavignes language, choice of words whatever then they need not be worried with researching the Hells Angels!  Simply put, the book is by far the best and most insightful look into the inner workings of the Hells Angels that I have ever read - and I have read most all of the books on the Hells Angels out there.  I strongly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I need to add one more thing to my review above.  There are a number of glaring errors in the book that call into question how much first person research Mr. Lavigne did and how much was based on hearsay from bikers, law enforcement, or other sources.  The first error may be considered minor - a map purporting to show the locations of various HAMC clubs places San Bernardino in Ventura county instead of San Bernardino County.  Others include claiming that the P.O.B.O.B's where founded in San Bernardino (they were founded in Bloomington - hence the acronym, "Pissed Off Bastards Of Bloomington", a suburb of Fontana, California.)  There are others, but all together they make you wonder how much of this is reasearch by the author and how much is taken from other less informed sources.</span>

                    <span>Yves Lavigne's unrelenting vulgarity takes away from what is otherwise an informative and well researched first-person account of the growth of the Hell's Angels growth from 50's rebels to 60's cause celebre to modern day mafia.  Their ability to enforce omerta (the code of silence)among their members, at least in this account, makes them more effective, and more dangerous, than La Cosa Nostra.  How much of this admittedly entertaining tale is truth and how much is fantasy?  Only Mr. Lavigne and the Hell's Angels know with any certainty.</span>

                    <span>From the second i opened this amazing exploration of wheels and deals, I was on the edge of my banana seat.  Forget tonka trucks and PUCH mopeds - these bikes are what its all about.  I was a little nervous at the beginning because of the expletive in the title, but then I found out it was just a way for the angels to identify themselves in this crazy crazy world we live in. <p>as far as secret keeping and three minus two - i lost track but who cares.</span>

                    <span>This book was recommended to me by a CHP officer as a good resource for MC clubs' criminal history. If this is what passes for a good resource, I'd say the MC Gang-True Crime genre is ripe for a real history written by a real life honest to goodness writer.<p>After finishing this book, initiation in the Hell's Angels almost looks refreshing. First the good: it held interest, was a fast read, and had interesting 'facts' (the reader has to assume this is either true or not, as the author doesn't cite any specific text except, apparently, what he read in the newspapers).<p>However, I have to wonder if it held interest because of how awfully it was written, thus affecting a sort of voyeuristic "Where is he going with this?" kind of feeling. As to it being a fast read, I can't really account for this, as it often felt as though the whole book was the same first-draft page reprinted 339 times and shipped to the book store.<p>I don't know if Lavigne was going for his own 'style' here or not, a la Hemingway. What I do know is that writing a history of anything written entirely in present tense is enough to make me want to stop shaving and bathing and beat people up as I ride around on a bike trying to forget the whole experience. When did this brilliant idea surface? It's very irritating and the book suffers tremendously for it. <p>Also, I'm not sure anyone, including the author, reread or edited this book beyond the first draft. It seems like every 3,4,5 pages some bit of information is repeated as though it was a new thought. Very often this repetition is almost a complete letter-for-letter copy of a previous paragraph. <p>And another thing: could Lavigne compare MORE things to genitalia? Jeez, it's like he writes sentences around some 8th grader playground vocabulary in a way he just MUST have thought a tough guy would talk. You just start feeling embarrassed for him after awhile. <p>Although Lavigne claims to dislike motorcycle gangs and ostensibly writes this book to 'expose' them, he writes as though he was some Hell's Angels rejected prospect who writes a poison pen book to get back at those mean guys, but down deep he still pines away for them. <p>Messy, unsubstantiated (though probably mostly true), overwrought, reaching, ultimately a disappointment. This is the book that, in getting published as is, makes struggling writers who are ten times better bang their heads on the walls in frustration.</span>
