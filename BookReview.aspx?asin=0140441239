                    <span>Review by Tom rederiksen - http://members.aol.com/spdtom/index.html - AZTEC STUDENT TEACHER RESOURCE CENTER: Diaz is an accomplished writer and I was impressed with his attention to detail as it related to the daily life and inter-personal relationships between the Conquistadors. This is a fairly long book but reads easily and anyone that enjoys a good 
adventure or mystery novel will find this an interesting book. As there are precious few first hand accounts from this time period, this first 
hand narrative is a must read for anyone getting started in the study of the Mexican conquest time period.
 
 This book was written rather late in life by the author. Supposedly, Diaz read a copy of a book by Lopez de Gomara, Chronicle of the Conquest of New Spain, and was so outraged by references to "Cortes this", and "Cortes that", that the old soldier penned this classic. Were it not for the work of Diaz, the world would not have a comprehensive record of the conquest. A must read.</span>

                    <span>Bernal Diaz left us a compelling eyewitness account of the Aztec conquest, written in the plain and unassuming style of an old soldier. His keen eye and attention to everyday detail makes Diaz's book a perfect companion to William Prescott's 1846 "History of the Conquest of Mexico," which has lost none of its classic brilliance.</span>

                    <span>Bernal Diaz del Castillo, Governor of Santiago de Guatemala, wrote his account of the conquest of Mexico while an old man because he felt that many of the works concerning the conflict were little more than de facto hagiographies of Hernando Cortes. Considering his feelings regarding the then-published writings of Bartolome de Las Casas, it is probable that he was equally concerned with rebutting the latter's colorful account of the conquest. Diaz's account is straight-forward and without literary pretensions, presenting a pleasing contrast to the smoother narrative of Cortes' letters and the unbridled passion of Las Casas' BRIEF ACCOUNT. In other words, it makes for quite pleasurable and interesting reading! <P>One of the recurring themes is how the Spaniards are treated by non-Aztecans as they travel toward Mexico City. Many of the states which were more distant from Montezuma's capital were quick to side with the Spaniards in the hopes of throwing off the Mexican yoke and ending their military threat. When the Spaniards appeared to be successful and strong, their allies became more committed to them and when they were shown to be vulnerable their allies began to question the basis of loyalty to the new occupiers. Once the Spaniards gained the upper hand, numerous subject peoples, finding that the Aztecan soldiers were no longer able to rape and plunder them or take their sons & daughters to be sacrificed, began seeking the aid of the Spaniards and providing them with support. Throughout, the Tlascalans were their most powerful and consistent allies (and were quickest to adopt the faith of the apparently powerful Christian divinity).<P>Arriving at Cholula, a client-state of the Aztecs, the soldiers are nearly massacred and determine to make an example of the Cholulans in order to prevent similar occurrences by others who might be pressed to kill the Spaniards to please Montezuma. Here we see an account which is fairly similar to that of Cortes as provided in his letters (which is not always the case) and which differs markedly from the 2nd- or 3rd-hand account by Las Casas in his BRIEF ACCOUNT. After the leaders who attempted to get rid of the Spanish occupiers were killed (and Cortes was finally able to end the atrocities of his Tlascalan allies), Cortes forced a peace agreement on the Tlascalans and the Cholulans and the populace of the city soon returned. Briefly mentioning Las Casas' BRIEF ACCOUNT, Diaz points out that the Franciscans personally visited the area and determined that Diaz's (and Cortes') account - and not Las Casas' - was consistent with the statements of the natives.<P>In Mexico City, the Spaniards were treated well as Montezuma and his advisors debated what to do with the newcomers. They were allowed their own place to worship and were fed and clothed by the Mexicans. Finding themselves trapped in the city with an inceasingly hostile population (which had found that the Spaniards were vulnerable) and indications that they were in danger, they took Montezuma into custody. This combined with attempts to force the local populace to conform to less violent religious practices pushed much of the Mexican secular and religious leadership, as well as the populace, into a more hostile mode. Violence escalated, a new leader was chosen by the Aztecs & Montezuma was killed by darts and stones thrown at him and his Spanish captors. The Spaniards manage to escape the city, then return with a large number of allies from the peoples formerly subjected by Montezuma and his recent ancestors. After a violent conflict which severely damaged the once beautiful city of Mexico, the Spaniards win the day. In the process, Cortes privately has the new Aztec leader, Guatomoc tortured to give up his treasury (which Cortes wants to keep largely for himself).<P>This informative and fairly dispassionate account of the conquest is gritty, realistic and deliberately shows the best and the worst of the Spaniards, the Aztecs and the subjected peoples who saw the coming of the Spaniards as a means of liberation from Aztec oppression.</span>

                    <span>The Conquest of New Spain, by Bernal Diaz is perhaps the best telling of the events that followed the untimely arrival of Hernan Cortez and his band of Conquistadors in Mexico. Diaz himself was one of those conquistadors, and although his takes on what happened are not without bias, they are nevertheless very informative. When you finish reading this book you will have a near perfect understanding of what happened to the Aztec Empire in Mexico.<BR>This book gets the highest recommendation possible.</span>
