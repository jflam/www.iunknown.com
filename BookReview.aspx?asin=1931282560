                <span id="Label1">This career planning guide is written specifically for high-functioning adolescents and young adults on the autism spectrum, their families, teachers, and counselors. The two authors weave together a unique blend of information and advice based on personal experiences. Temple Grandin draws from her own experience with autism spectrum disorders and her professional career, and Kate Duffy uses her expertise on employment issues and the mother of two teenagers with autistic-like behaviors. The result is an extremely useful and practical book that introduces step-by-step processes for the job search with a major section on the impact ASD has in the workplace, including managing sensory problems, how to nurture and turn talents and special interests into paid work, jobs that are particularly suited to individuals on the spectrum, and much more. First-hand accounts of job experiences and advice from individuals representing a broad range of careers particularly suited for high-functioning individuals on the autism spectrum round off this exciting new resource.</span>

                    <span>I have read all three of Temple Grandin's books. Each offers a different look at what it is like to experience Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In "Developing Talents" Grandin provides the readers with insight into how parents and educators can assist people with High Functioning Autism/Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS)achieve success. <P>Presented in an easy to read format,this book focuses on using one's strengths, natural talents, and special interests to gain<BR>employment and lead successful lives. This book offers helpful strategies to promote such things as addressing sensory needs in the workplace as well as creating a portfolio to showcase one's talents.<P>In today's society, having marketable job skills is a must. This book gives a proactive look at some of the challenges faced by people with HFA/AS. It is important for parents and educators to introduce the concepts of the book early in the educational careers of these students as the skills are life skills in addition to career skills.</span>

                    <span>As a parent of an adolescent with Asperger Syndrome, I found this book easy to read and understand, with practical how-to instructions and guidelines for preparing my son to enter the work force. I really liked the emphasis on developing social and communication skills that are found throughout the book. This is one I will recommend to friends and relatives as well as my son's educators.</span>
