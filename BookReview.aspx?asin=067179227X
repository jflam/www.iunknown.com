                <span id="Label1"><P> A number-one bestseller from coast to coast, <I>Den of Thieves</I> tells, in masterfully reported detail, the full story of the insider-trading scandal that nearly destroyed Wall Street, the men who pulled it off, and the chase that finally brought them to justice. Pulitzer Prize winner James B. Stewart shows for the first time how four of the biggest names on Wall Street -- Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Martin Siegel, and Dennis Levine -- created the greatest insider-trading ring in financial history and almost walked away with billions, until a team of downtrodden detectives triumphed over some of America's most expensive lawyers to bring this powerful quartet to justice. <P> Based on secret grand jury transcripts, interviews, and actual trading records, and containing explosive new revelations about Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky written especially for this paperback edition, <I>Den of Thieves</I> weaves all the facts into an unforgettable narrative -- a portrait of human nature, big business, and crime of unparalleled proportions.</span>

                    <span>"Den of Thieves" reads like a thriller, recounting in spellbinding detail the rise and eventual fall of Wall Street's iconic villains, Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, and Dennis Levine.
<br />
<br />For those who believe Milken's philanthropic activities in recent years are confirmation that he has fully atoned for his sins, this book will make you think twice.  He is depicted here as pompous and tyrannical, contemptuous of the investing public, and brazen in his belief that he was above the law.
<br />
<br />Students of securities law would also have much to learn from this book, with its textured descriptions of insider trading laws, the plea bargaining process, the inner workings of the SEC, and the legal maneuverings of prosecutors and defense attorneys in cases of securities violations.  As it happens, Harvey Pitt, Martin Lipton, and other renowned corporate lawyers figure prominently in the storyline.
<br />
<br />One niggling complaint: James Stewart's prose is too pedestrian.  Sometimes this gets irksome - for instance, the word "appalled" is used repeatedly to the point of exasperation.  For a former editor of the Wall Street Journal, I was expecting prose with a bit more panache.</span>

                    <span>This book is fantastic! Author James B. Stewart creates a regaling story for the reader with a compelling narrative of the 1980's Wall Street era of greed and glory.  
<br />
<br />Stewart takes the reader into the lives of the big players on the Wall Street court at the time: Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, and Martin Siegel among many others.  In great detail, Stewart provides the full story of the insider trading scandal that nearly destroyed Wall Street.  Stewart also shows how these "players" created a series of security scams that made legitimate trading pale in comparison.  
<br />
<br />Equally as intriguing is the story of the SEC detectives that brought the rampant illegal trading to a screeching halt.  Not a detail is spared: The lawyers on both sides.  The trials. Judge Kimba Wood!  This is as close to the real thing as it gets.  A great story from a masterful bard!  I rate this book at five stars.  Destined to be a classic.              </span>

                    <span>This was one book that I could not put down.  The book is broken into large sections, each dealing with a particular criminal and his corresponding activities.  In-depth descriptions of what was going on behind the scenes at some of the most respected financial firms of the time--absolutely fascinating.  If you were around in the 80's, and you work/participate in the investment industry, this should be required historical reading.</span>
