                    <span>"S.W.A.T" is a surprisingly standard cop flick, a throwback to a calmer if not recent cinematic era. It is still stuffed full of guns, villains and mayhem, but unlike "Bad Boys II," or even the excellent "Training Day," the movie does not paint an urban world teetering on the brink - criminal masterminds run amok, but Los Angeles isn't quite burning. It seems bizarre to consider "S.W.A.T" comforting, but it is.<P>Colin Farrell is Jim, a former S.W.A.T member relegated to scrub duty after he and his rogue partner, Brian (Jeremy Renner), break protocol in a hostage negotiation. Sam Jackson is, yes, Hondo, chief of a newly formed crew that resurrects Jim's career from the gun cage. LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez play Jim's buds, while Josh Charles, the do-good cop, is Jim's main shooting rival on the crew. Director Clark Johnson charts the crew's training - it amounts to a recruiting poster, set to a video game soundtrack - a circle changeup, of sorts, to the usual hit-the-ground-gunning structure of most modern cop films.<P>The crew eventually is dispatched to handle the prison transfer of a Eurotrash crime boss (Olivier Martinez) who brags, in the movie's most quotable line, that he will offer "one hundred meellion dollars!" to any brave crook willing to bust him free. Half the city's loose cannons are up for it, including Brian, now off the force, who has a connection inside Hondo's crew. In a twist, Martinez's character is not a supervillain of limitless cunning and strength, but an ineffectual, well-funded heel, pout-lipped and soft-bellied as Brian escorts him through sewers to the rendezvous: a private jet waiting on an LA bridge. <P>Renner was unknown to me, but his few scenes with Farrell crackle with energy. The face of an insolent cherub, he makes for an appropriately smug sellout. Jackson, for once, is the calming influence collecting a paycheck, and "S.W.A.T" is better off without his bravado. And while Farrell has not yet proven his acting chops - we'll have to wait for Oliver Stone's "Alexander" - there is an offhand, understood masculinity that recalls a young Mickey Rourke, or Sean Penn. Only Rodriguez, notching another asexual sidekick role to her club, is a bust. <P>Cynics might call "S.W.A.T" inconsequential in that relives the climax from "Die Hard 2" and generally avoids the graceless, graphic violence of its 2003 competitor "Bad Boys II." I far preferred it; unoriginal as the movie is, "S.W.A.T" is the very idea of escapist entertainment without the sideline helping of head wounds and nihilism. Action junkies should eat it up.</span>

                    <span>I skipped this one in theater because it looked cheesy and man is it ever. Colin Farrel and Sam Jackson's talents are wasted in this mess of an action movie and the dialogue and realism of SWAT is below-average at very best. Don't even rent this stinker, catch it on cable for free.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Based on the 70's cop drama TV show, S.W.A.T. is pure slickly produced mainstream action fluff of the highest degree. Beginning with a rebellious and disgraced SWAT member (Colin Farrell) who is picked to join a new squad (which includes Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Brian Van Holt, and Josh Charles) by a fresh out of retirement sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson). Soon afterward, the head of a European drug cartel (Unfaithful's Oliver Martinez) is captured and offers 100 million dollars to whoever breaks him out of prison, and the crew ends up having their hands full when anyone and everyone comes out of the woodwork to claim the bounty. The film looks great and his some great action scenes, and the cast is nicely assembled, but it's an ultimately shallow experience. If you're a mainstream action fan, this is worth a look, but there's better, more character driven action films out there that are more than worth your time.</span>
