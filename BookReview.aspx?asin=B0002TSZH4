                <span id="Label1">Sex and sunlight are on ample display in <I>Betty Blue</I>, director Jean-Jacques Beineix's passionate look at mad love. (Every French director is contractually required to make at least one movie about l'amour fou.) It begins at the seashore, where handyman and failed novelist Zorg (Jean-Hugues Anglade) has his life electrified by Betty, a woman whose sense of abandon frequently tips over into the pathological. This was the role that introduced gap-toothed, voluptuous Beatrice Dalle to the world, and neither Dalle nor the world has ever quite recovered. Traces of Beineix's precious<I>Diva</I> are still present, though this is a darker and more memorable ride, especially in the three-hour "version integrale" that restores an hour of footage. Its copious nude scenes are a drawing card, but stick around for the age-old alchemy of life translated into art. Gabriel Yared's score is a favorite of movie-soundtrack mavens, especially its haunting piano theme. <I>--Robert Horton</I></span>

<br />After watching this movie in 1991, I've been haunted by its story for a very long time, till finally my friends in Amazon.com sent me an email telling me about it coming out on DVD. I was afraid of buying it at the beginning, because of the new RCE, Region Coding Enhancement it has, so that you wont be able to play it on a Region Free DVD Player. i heard many stories about not being able to play it and other sorts of stuff. Well, i purchased it at a Virgin Megastore in Miami last month and lucky me, it played well in my Regio free dvd player. 
<br />
<br />I finally got the chance to watch it after 14 years of waiting, and oh boy, what was I missing for such a long time. it was worth the wait all along.
<br />
<br />Betty Blue, is one of the most beautiful love stories ever written, though its a tragic one. You can literally feel the love Zorg feels for Betty, how she brings out the best of him, how much she admires him, even though he has lost faith in himself. The joy, the love, the pain... you will fell every little thing they feel, its that real!
<br />
<br /> The acting was brilliant, the photography excellent, and the music...oh the music!, well, let me put it this way, the piano theme wont leave your head for many many years to come. It was also a long time since a movie had moved me in such an incredible way. (it brought some wetness to my eyes, i tell ya)
<br />
<br />You have to watch it for yourself to get your own conclusions. But anyhow, if you get the chance, buy it, rent it, do whatever you want, but just watch it. Although its quite long (3 hours) you wont regret the ride, its an amazing picture. </span>

                    <span>A publisher sends "this is the worst book I ever read" rejection letter to her boyfriend and Betty goes to the publisher's house and stabs him with a fork.  Unfortunately, this is a sign of Betty's mental decline, and her love.  This is a love story set with blue lighting (the director magically works blue light in whenever possible.) , and one blue symphony that echoes throughout the movie (I'm not a music expert, but it seems to me most of the music is a variation of the same larger haunting work.)  The terrific acting kept me always in the story, forgetful I was watching a movie, and not real life, with that unselfconscious nudity only the French seem to be able to master.   So don't even worry what the French title: 37Â°2 le matin (32 1/2 degrees in the morning) means.
<br />I saw this in 1986 in an art theatre in Missoula Montana when I was in the creative writing program.  Probably a major influence in heading me toward movies rather than books.  What a fantasy for a writer!  You meet this incredibly, unsatiable, woman, who believes in you when you don't believe in yourself.  There is this incredible scene where she finds Zorg's (her boyfriend's) notebooks--he says they are nothing.  But she reads them, loves them, and comes to believe in him--more than he does in himself.  She urges him to submit his work--and rages at his rejections.
<br />Meanwhile, what was probably a sexual escapade for Zorg grows into real love, and concern as we begin to suspect that Betty is not quite right, that her overzealous reaction to the world is a slipping toward madness.  Most of the story involves watching both love and madness grow amid the mundane aspects of ordinary lives.  But in the end, a shocking, yet understandable end, there is hope, and the definite promise of hope fulfilled.  It's the kind of movie that makes you wonder if the story is true--and haunts you for years.</span>

                    <span>Betty Blue is touted as an "erotic drama" by the distributor, a tag which sells the film grossly short. It certainly has frank depictions of sexuality and much nudity -- after all, this is a film that opens on a real-time extended sequence shot of two people having sex -- but to call this erotica is to miss the complete picture.
<br />
<br />Betty Blue is an organic look at a troubled relationship in all its glory and ugliness, tenderness and violence, joys and sorrows, made possible by the director's sympathetic and unembarrassed eye, and the sheer dedication of lead actors Jean-Hugues Anglade and Beatrice Dalle. Seldom has a cinematic couple been better paired, and seldom with so much chemistry. Dalle conveys a world of psychological complexity in her face, her eyes seeming to shift with her inner beats. Dalle received the bulk of the attention for this, her breakthrough role, so it might be easy to overlook Jean-Hugues Anglade, a fantastic actor who's every bit as good as Gerard Depardieu, perhaps even half a notch above Jean Reno. In reality, he is the anchor for the film's wrenching emotional journey. When Zorg plays the piano theme for Betty, easily the loveliest scene in the film, Anglade's eyes seem to dance, and the actors say more with their looks during their moments together than all the sex scenes in the world. Thanks to the deft direction, all those nude scenes don't seem like titillation -- merely an illuminating fly-on-the-wall view into the relationship. This couple certainly seems like the type who would be comfortable being naked around each other, and those scenes create a sense of genuine intimacy, rather than intent to arouse.
<br />
<br />If there's one thing this film does well, it is the mixture of comedic and tragic scenes which makes it seem such a complete picture. Betty is not always wild and uncontrolled; Zorg is not always patient and loving. They are two flawed characters, made all the more likeable because of their flaws, and their interactions make us laugh, smile in understanding, frown, and cry.
<br />
<br />This extended edition makes the film far better. It's been about 10 years since I last saw it so I can't make very specific comparisons. But the restored scenes are substantial, not cosmetic addition of shots, but an explosion of the story, and while I can't name too many specifics, as a whole this version just feels more right, more natural, and more emotional.
<br />
<br />Look beyond the film's "erotic" reputation and find a character study, and a portrayal of a relationship, which is as moving as any I've seen.

                    <span>I want to write in response to one of the highlighted reviews which sums this movie up as sexy and artistic (lots of eye candy) but otherwise having a pretty empty story. 
<br />
<br />I first saw this in the theaters when it was released (mid 80's), at a time when I saw one or two movies a year, and they inevitably effected me profoundly. Right after I saw this one I was schedule for a month long solo meditation retreat! Argh!!! I couldn't get this movie out of my mind, the attractive characters, the tragic story.... I sat with this story for hours, days, weeks....it was emotionally draining, and I was not left thinking it was weak or shallow. It was a metaphore for our foolish hopes, dreams and fears, with a sense of redemption in the end or at least unending continuity. It is truely tragic. Like a Richard Thompson song of lost love, seemingly happy situations develop to reveal the maddness they always were. (The director begins with the most powerful intro imaginable, raw realistic sex - Is that just the way the French are, or are they trying to shock US? - Betty is mad from the getgo, it's just we see her go from an infectious passionate manicness to an all consuming depression. It is her craziness that makes her seem so alive and attractive. Her passion is enviable and seductive until we see the flip-side. And then there is the inverse reaction for her lover Zorg as he continues with his existential awakening...Oh cruel, crazy, beautiful world.)
<br />
<br />This may not be a "great" movie but it is powerful, poignant, lyrical, and oh yes, sexy...., and the acting and direction are near perfect.
<br />
<br />(This longer "director's cut" edition detracted from my memory of the theatre version, and while it did help flesh out the characters I think it went on too long without adding much.)
<br />

                    <span>Zorg meets Betty and is forever in love with her.  Unfortunately, she is a very unstable person, descending into madness.  Betty is so free spirited and impulsive that she is a very engaging person, which makes Zorg love her even more.  Several years ago, I wanted to rent the DVD, but was advised to rent the VHS instead, as it was much better.  This DVD, the directors cut, is very faithful to the VHS version that I rented at that time.  Fans of French films will want this DVD with the unforgettable performances.  It is at times hard to watch, with the pain involved with Betty's descent into insanity, but that makes it even more gripping.  I only wish this DVD had some bells and whistles about this amazing film portrayal of characters who are deeply in love with each other.  The film has a lot of joy mixed with sadness, with love always present.</span>
