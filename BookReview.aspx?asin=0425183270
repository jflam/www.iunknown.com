                    <span>Healing ADD is a landmark book that every counselor, psycholgist, psychiatrist,and pastor will want to have. More importantly if you struggle with ADD or know someone who does this book is a must read. I and the therapists who are associated with me have referred over 600 people in the last four years for SPECT Brain Imaging Scans. As a psychotherapist I have found Dr. Amen's work to be truly a landmark in the field of psychiatry, psychology and medicine in general. "Healing ADD" helps the reader to identify which of the six types of ADD that they have, and then the practical steps to take for treatment. An alarming number of people are medically mismanaged when it comes to ADD treatment, and the work that Dr. Amen has done through over 10,000 SPECT Brain Imaging Scans has resulted in a system of diagnosis and medication management that brings more precision to the care of the ADD patient.So many of the horror stories and bad press that Ritalin is given are due to inaccurate diagnosis. Ritalin or another stimulant will be prescribed when another system of the brain needs to be treated first before a stimulant is given. The checklists that are provided in Dr.Amen's book will give the reader a guide as to whether the counselor or physcian they are working with is headed in the right direction with the treatment program they design. What is also exciting about this work is how it educates and empowers the lay person to truly be in charge of their care, and be able to ask their therapist, or physcian the needed questions to make sure they are getting the most up to date care and treatment possible. This is a book that the lay person and professional will benefit from. If you are being treated for ADD you might want to purchase a copy for your doctor. <P>Earl R. Henslin Psy.D., B.C.E.T.S.

                    <span>At last! Some real guidance through the difficulties of identifying, let alone trying to correct ADD. I'm the director of a nutritional therapy clinic. We have sent several people with ADD (as well as 	with brain injury and stroke) to Dr. Amen's clinics.	Until now, though, I never understood why his medication protocols typically worked so well. His book makes it clear, using fascinating "before and after" SPECT "photos" of the ADD brains treated, that there are several distinct kinds of ADD. It goes on to explain the special treatments suitable for each. Dr. Amen also devotes several chapters to some effective, non-drug options. Like his first great book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, this one is full of inspiring case histories, and is so readable that you can't put it down.</span>

                    <span>This book was a big disappointment. Using brain scanning imagery AMEN has deduced that there are six types of ADD. I find his taxonomy very questionable, and while I don't object to anecdotal evidence to support medical views, Amen turns very slight differences in behavior into major types of diagnoses. The descriptions of the various types interweave to the point that the differences among them are very slight. Why six? Why not 60? Amen's selective perception seems to be pseudo-science reductionist claptrap to me. I have ADD, and as I studied the traits of each one of Amen's categories, it seemed that I was a likely candidate for five of the six. His suggestions regarding diet are laughable: he recommends a healthy well balanced diet as a component to "healing" ADD. Well, now isn't that the most innovative idea about improving one's health: a good diet?!?!?! Thanks to psychostimulants I have been able to completely change my life in ways that at one time would have seemed miraculous. At times, I still feel it is miraculous. But I would never say I am "healed." The term in the title seems to be more marketing ploy than accurate empirical statement. I do recommend the book SCATTERED by Gabor Mate, a physician with ADD. That book is far more informed, holistic, thoughtful, incisive. It is also very well written. The style and methodology of Amen's book makes the DSM-IV seem as though it were written by God him/herself.</span>

                    <span>This book is the most comprehensive source of information on ADD available.<P>The basis of the treatment techniques, SPECT scans, is also revolutionary in its approach and nearly self-evident. This approach of examining both patients' histories and SPECT scans at the same time is obviously an effective means of targeting not only the specific type of ADD (Dr. Amen has categorized 6 types) but also recognizing other disorders that may cause confusion about the ultimate diagnosis.<P>His work is the tip of the iceberg in diagnosing and finding successful treatments for ADD, anxiety, depression, violent behaivors, Alzeheimer's, obsessive disorders, manic disorders, head-injury related disorders, substance abuse disorders, dementia, and many other brain-related disorders.<P>It is loaded with information. Many professionals would do well to not only ready but study the information.<P>This book can be considered a companion to "Change Your Brain, Change Your Life."</span>

                    <span>I have no doubt that Dr. Amen has a lot of experience with SPECT scans, and ADD. I worry that his conclusions haven't been reproduced or confirmed indepedently outside his laboratory, which makes me highly skeptical of his results, and generalizations. Therefore, as the SPECT identifications are the selling point of his book, I can't recommend it. <P>The title, should also give anyone who has studied ADD pause, as ADD isn't really something that can be "healed", although it can be substantially mitigated. It strikes me as very a "huckster" or "snake oil salesmen" kind of title. <P>In a world with so many charlatans and unethical companies trying to fool people or exaggerate claims to make a buck, it is disturbing to see a medical doctor disregard the reproducibility demanded by the scientific method.<P>The general advice given in the book is good, but by no means unique or exceptional, by comparison.<P>I would recommend Driven to Distraction to those who are looking for more scientifically sound information and advice regarding ADD, and it's treatment.</span>
