Minimal knowledge of general networking and administration is assumed, making the material accessible to intermediate and advanced readers alike.  Designed to meet multiple needs, the first part of the book presents a general overview of the subject matter, and the next three sections cover detailed instructions for design, deployment, and integration of directory services. The text is full of practical implementation advice and real-world deployment examples to help the reader choose the path that makes the most sense for the specific organization.  </span>

                    <span>Background:<BR>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol that enables locating organizations, individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a network, whether it is a public Internet or a corporate Intranet. <P>As LDAP adoption and deployment is increasing, the expanded second edition of "Understanding and Deploying LDAP Directory Services" is published with more materials from the authors on the protocol and how to apply it effectively in different network environments. <P>Book Organization:<BR>The book consists of twenty-six chapters divided into six major parts:<BR>- Directory services overview and history<BR>- Designing your directory service<BR>- Deploying your directory service<BR>- Maintaining your directory service<BR>- Leveraging your directory service<BR>- Case studies<BR>The book begins by defining directory services and what they can offer for an organization then gets into the specifics of how LDAP organizes directories and handles queries with coverage of LDAPv3 extensions and the Netscape Directory Server. <P>The books then moves on to explore a wide range of topics such as designing directory services, naming, topology, replication, privacy, security deploying, directory services, implementation pitfalls, cost analysis, maintaining directory services, troubleshooting, and creating and enabling directory-service <BR>applications. <P>The book offers help and advice for comparing "LDAP-compliant" products on features, management tools, reliability, performance, scalability, security, standards conformance, interoperability, cost, and other criteria. Then, having chosen a vendor, you'll walk through piloting your application <BR>and testing it for performance, scalability, and reliability. Finally, the authors show how to put the system into production, keep it running smoothly and securely, provide for backups and disaster recovery, and make improvements over time. <P>The final section of the book presents four thorough deployment case studies, showing how diverse organizations can use LDAP as a simple, versatile solution for a wide variety of problems.<P>Is the book for you?<BR>The book gives a good architect's or project manager's understanding of LDAP and of the difficulties inherent in deploying any complex mission critical software system. <P>For architects, this is a concept book rather than a reference book: After reading this book you will still need to refer to product manuals or reference books to help you figure out how to implement your design. <P>For a project manager, this book is valuable especially with the checklists, something that can be used to guide the deployment of many new systems. <P>Software developers would read the book to understand more on issues such as redundancy, security and privacy. <P>For IT professionals who are relatively new to the area, it is the book to read on LDAP. <P>General Comments:<P>- There are many specialized terms that are used without being defined or before being defined. <P>- There is a lot of superfluous material bringing the book to over 900+ pages requiring constant filtering on the part of the reader. <P>- The book offer more concepts that practical help. You will find a lot of managerial discussions, including talking to your users, piloting your directory and getting feedback. If you are looking to learn how to technically implement LDAP, these discussions will not interest you much. <P>- The book assumes that you have a good understanding of LDAP and Directory Services. The introduction chapters do not cover many basic concepts, many terms are not explained until used several dozen times, and there is no glossary. <P>- Managers will appreciate the sections on product selection, piloting an LDAP service, costing, disaster recovery, long-term maintenance, monitoring, and application development in a directory-centric world complete the picture. <P>- Several case studies are presented, including useful sidebars entitled "20/20 Hindsight". <P>The Good Stuff:<BR>- Provides a lot of theoretical concepts <BR>- Covers all aspects of LDAP deployment <BR>- Discusses the design aspects of LDAP	 <BR>- Designed to meet multiple needs <BR>- Minimal knowledge of networking is assumed <P>The Not So Good Stuff: <BR>- Not much on practical implementations	<BR>- Sometimes the explanations are too long 	<BR>- With over 900 pages, the book is too long <BR>- Sometimes hard to follow the line of thought <BR>- A glossary of technical terms is not provided <P>Conclusion:<P>If you are planning to work with LDAP whether you are a network manager, a software developer, or an IT administrator, the book provides a lot of information which will help you define your directory requirements in detail and design a directory service that meets them. You will also ind the book valuable during the evaluation, planning and deployment process. However, if you are a programmer who is looking for a programming book or some kind of a product manual to help you setup LDAP services, this <BR>is not the book for you. It is mostly targeted for architects as it is more of a concept book rather than a reference book. <P>In general, the text is full of advices and real-world deployment examples to help the readers choose the path that makes the most sense for their specific organization. I personally would recommend the book as a general <BR>overview of LDAP and deployment scenarios.</span>

                    <span>Overall it's a book for people who need to get familiar and to START designing/prototyping a LDAP system without any background on the LDAP technology itself. I have to skip lots of chapters (related to general business, project management, cost control,corporate politics..) in order to understand the essential LDAP schema/attributes and the overall LDAP design patterns. The authors does give some very good real life design examples at the end. I am looking for a 'LDAP Design Patterns', this book partly ( 30% ?) covers this topic.</span>

                    <span>I bought several LDAP books and try to jump start on this topic.<BR>This one let me very quickly to get into it.

                    <span>Good for Theoretical concepts but when it comes to practical implementation it's not much of a help and you would have to use the web as a guide for implementation and troubleshooting, which in my case was somewhat frustrating<BR> However, it helps you in understanding the design aspects of your LDAP.<BR> So the final verdict i would give is that if you would like to implement your Directory service in the most professional way then it is advisable that you read this book (you have to have lots of free time to yourself too ) but it will not be the only place that you will be looking for information regarding LDAP.</span>
