                <span id="Label1"><div>Described by Robert Hass as "unquestionably one of the great living European poets" and by Charles Simic as "one of the finest poets living today," Szymborska mesmerizes her readers with poetry that captivates their minds and captures their hearts. This is the book that her many fans have been anxiously awaiting-the definitive, complete collection of poetry by the Nobel Prize-winning poet, including 164 poems in all, as well as the full text of her Nobel acceptance speech of December 7, 1996, in Stockholm. Beautifully translated by Stanislaw Bara&#171;nczak and Clare Cavanagh, who won a 1996 PEN Translation Prize for their work, this volume is a must-have for all readers of poetry.<br></div></span>

                    <span>"Hatred is a poem that I believe is a statement the world is making today, whether we like what it is saying or not. As our world is coming closer to a war, we are forced to think about hatred everyday and what it actually means. "Let's Face it: It knows how to make beauty. The splendid fire-glow in midnight skies. Magnificent bursting bombs in rosey dawns." Is hatred as beautiful as this passage from her poem reads? Isn't there another way to make beauty than to use hate? <P>Szymborska is a poet who does not hide behind her writings. She expresses herself and thoughts and is not afraid to do so. This certain poem of hate could be a bit risky to write, but it actually tells the truth. Hate is everywhere, even on the sports fields, with the fans and athletes themselves.<P>This book, Poems New and Collected, has many great themes such as love, war, perspective and existence. Everyone may not agree with her writings, but I am sure some sort of connection will be made. I know I felt a connection to her while reading her poems.</span>

                    <span>Wistawa Szymborska is a very intelligent poet. Her work is one of the best that I have ever read on. One of her poems is called, "The End and the Beginning." The part that touched me the most was stanza two; "someone has to shove the rubble to the roadsides so the carts loaded with corpses can get by." This little stanza holds so much feeling and information it can be overwhelming. Her poems are powerful in a way that she makes you feel like you are right there with her as she is writing this poem. She puts so much of herself into these poems and this is what makes them so wonderful to read. So I would like to think her for writing such wonderful poems for others to read.</span>

                    <span>Szymborska is a talented poet. She conveys a dark view of humanity through her poetry. In her poem "Hatred" Szymborska explores the human emotion of hate. She describes it as efficient; in no way blind or patient. Humanity's hate is immortal and "unflinching." Another example of Szymborska's dark view of humanity is expressed in "Advertisement." Advertisements are manmade; they take over people and make them promises. She goes as far as to calling them the devil asking for your soul.<BR>Szymborka's poems are written in simple language so anyone can understand them. She does not make them unduly complex. Her writing makes one think and does not take life lightly.</span>

                    <span>Szymborska's Poems New and Collected is a well-written book. She has a way of taking the poems and turning bad situatiions into something positive. These poems represent humanity and shows basic human nature; something that we can all relate to. I enjoyed these poems partly due to the subject matter. The poem "Nothing Twice" actually made me think twice about my life and how I live it. I feel that this is significant because this is the kind of reaction that you should have when reading a poem. It got me thinking and asking questions about myself and that is an important aspect of poetry for me.<P>Within the poem "Hatred" many passages personify and show how persistent hatred is and how it is always present. The poem illustrates the diligence that hatred has. Then, the peom takes this dark view of hatred and turns it into something positive. Symborska is able to illustrate how the bursting of bombs makes beauty with "splendid glow-fire in midnight skies." I like how in the end of misery and evil can emerge something beautiful. These poems allowed me to see light at the end of the tunnel. Overall, a good book, and worth reading.</span>

                    <span>Szymborska's book, "Poems New and Collected" rattles the mind's realm of reality, spirituality, and unknown humanity. A predominate pattern of poisioning passages of darkness lead to peepholes to positive. She delivers a inspiringly intelligent, thought inciting pile of poems. She displays a great genius with the poem, "Four A.M." as it generates ideas on aspects glomming in the back of all creatures nonexistent or existing minds. She touches audiences with poems like "Parable" which toss out open ended questions about our own lives. Szymborska almost sees humans with an open hand hovering over the world's weather of events brought on by unnamed named fates. Szymborska's book is a sail set adventure on the ying and yang yacht of pondering poetry.</span>
