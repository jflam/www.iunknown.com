                    <span>"Whale Rider" was released on June 6th 2003, it is rated PG-13, and is 1 hour 45 minutes long. Whale Rider is directed by Niki Caro and is based on the book written by Witi Ihimaera. The main actor in this film is newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes who was selected from many hopefuls to play the role of Pai. Keisha performs her role extremely well and makes the film complete. Her performance is well balanced by that of Rawiri Paratene who plays Pai's grandfather Koro. Other actors in the film are Vicky Haughton who plays Flowers, Pai's grandmother, and Cliff Curtis who plays Porourangi, Pai's father.<P>Whale Rider is set in the coastal village of Whangara, New Zealand. It is the story of a young Maori girl, named Pai, and her fight to defy the hard set traditions of her people. The film is told through the eyes of Pai and begins tragically when her mother dies while giving birth to her twin brother. Porourangi is disgraced, as his son was supposed to carry on the line of chiefs, and so leaves the village indefinitely. Pai is left in the care of her grandparents, her grandfather, Koro, being the current chief of the tribe. Once Pai turns twelve Koro rounds up all the boys in the tribe and begins to teach them the ancient ways in hope of finding a new successor. Pai is not allowed to train as she is female so she seeks out the help of her uncle to teach her the customs. Her struggle begins, her aim being to break tradition and take her rightful place in the tribe.<P>The gorgeous scenery of New Zealand makes a perfect backdrop for this film and the carved meeting houses help to intensify the Maori culture; the visual quality is excellent. The acting in the film contributed to making the characters exceptional, they are very believable and the audience is able to relate to how they are feeling. Much of the music used in Whale Rider is traditional of the Maori people and incorporates song and dance; it has specific cultural significance and is characteristic of New Zealand. Overall I found this film to be outstanding and exceedingly moving; one that should not be missed.</span>

                    <span>Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment has hidden two surprises on its Special Edition DVD of 'Whale Rider' that are not immediately obvious. Here's how to locate them.<BR>From the DVD's Main Menu go to the 'Special Features' and there select the 'TV Spots' menu entry. On the next submenu highlight the menu entry' Special Features' at the bottom of the screen and then press the 'Right' arrow key on your remote control. This will give you access to the original New Zealand theatrical trailer for the film.<BR>Now go back to the 'Special Features' menu and highlight the 'Main Menu' entry at the bottom of the screen. Press the 'Left' arrow key on your remote control to get access to a 6-minute clip, which is eleven year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes's remarkable audition tape that won her the role of Paikea in the film. Despite having no previous acting experience, Keisha was chosen from thousands of girls in an extensive school-wide search.<P>I just wanted all you who own this DVD to know of these 2 hidden extras, you will LOVE them!!</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, even though I thought the main charachter should of been a boy. The main premise of the story was of two fraternal twins (boy and girl). The girl survived and was discouraged from becoming a chief. Yet she persevered and trained with the help of some other villagers even though her grandfather wanted a male heir. Her grandfather's goal was to recruit one of the boys from the village school. There were tests of fighting skills and retrieving a whale medallion that the grandfather threw into the ocean. I would highly recommend this movie because it made me feel very good to watch it. You are going to get your monies worth whether you rent it or buy it from amazon.com</span>

                    <span>Don't let the people raving about what a great family movie this is scare you away...while Whale Rider is appropriate for younger ones, it is definitely aimed at a more mature audience. Very good story, extremely moving and heartbreaking. I cried for hours.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>We live in an age where moving stories of courage and determination just aren't enough. Those tales have to be accompanied by Oprah Book Club moments of overcoming handicaps and tragedy or dealing with racism and sexism. Many a great story is ruined because the real drama of life takes a secondary role to the politically correct lens through which it is told. <P>In Whale Rider, it is the Lifetime-esque melodramatic subplot dealing with the evil old men who run the world and try to prevent little girls from reaching their life's destiny. The story takes place inside an aboriginal whaling community, seemingly untouched by the modern cultural advancements of the past one hundred years. Of course, our liberal filmmakers decided these people needed to be lectured in gender roles, and thus the little story of a young girl over-coming an oppressive and chauvinistic world is born. <P>Now, that all sounds like criticism for this film, and I do admit I wish this Steinam-like depiction of men was toned down a bit. But that one flaw doesn't change the fact that this is a wonderful film, a truly remarkable achievement. Forgetting all the male-bashing, at the center of the film is a touching story about a young child who so wants to be loved, especially by her grandfather. She latches on to a story from family's her past about a great voyager who arrived at their island on the back of a whale, a great warrior whose soul will someday return in a "chosen one". The young girl decides she has as much claim to the birthright as any of the boys and attempts to prove to everyone (especially her grandfather) that she is worthy. <P>We seldom see young people depicted in such an honest manner. This touching story will be loved by almost everyone (and the feminists may take steps to have it canonized).</span>
