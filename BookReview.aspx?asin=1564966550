                <span id="Label1">The blending of two vastly different styles achieves stunning results in <I>East West Style</I>. It's far more than simply adding a Japanese painted screen to your comfortably overstuffed living room--it's about finding beauty in clean lines, unusual textures, and an overall balance of simplicity and opulence. With dozens of glossy photos and simply written text, author Ann McArdle clears the path to a wholly new style, using only the best of both worlds.<P> At first glance, many of the rooms seem a little spare by western standards. On closer examination you'll spot comfortable couches with down-filled cushions, silk bed coverings, and deep baths meant for long, relaxing soaks. One sunny spot behind the kitchen sink is filled with a small rock-and-bamboo Japanese garden, a delightful new use of the ubiquitous bay window.Furniture ranges from the classic Eames chair to a plump, bright-yellow loveseat to an elegantly stark raised platform bed, each looking equally at home in its setting. Dramatic carved screens, Chinese silks, and unique ceramics are added in small doses, rather than as full-blown themes--the idea is to achieve harmony, balance, and a sense of peace that incorporates every element in your home and garden, paying attention to shape and ultimate effect rather than strict conventions.  Accompanying the pages of inspiration is a shopping resource list, which will prove a great help as you head off on your way to a whole new interior style. <I>--Jill Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>Interior design is very subjective to one's taste. <BR>I was looking for a book that had plenty of examples of living rooms, bathrooms, and bedroom that had fused east and west elements. Some other books I have looked at concentrated more on phyical eastern objects and pieces.<P>This book gives a very good introduction on paring American and European style furniture with Asian style furniture. There are plently of pictures and the writing is simple and easy to understand. One picture has a Le Corbusier Chaise Lounge ( LC 4) in the bedroom adjacent to a crocodile shaped teak bench in front of a bed. Most traditional modernists wouldn't have thought of such a pairing.<BR>Other photos include a compact Eames Sofa in asian style living room.<P>There lots of screens ,bamboo and fabrics examples in the photos as well. <BR>This book will be a great coffee table book as well. I've had lots of people pick it up when they come over. <P>The bottom line is that once you read and look at the pictures many times, you develop your own sense of style. This practice determines which style works for you. <P>This book will give you focus on your objective to combine the two elements in your home.<P>Perhaps one day, your living room, bathroom or bedroom will be featured on Metropolitan Home because of this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The five main chapters of this book are "Simplicity and Order", "Proportion and Form", "Harmony and Balance", "Color and Texture", and "Eastern Treasures". The book purports to show you those "eastern" elements can be incorporated into western rooms. Well obviously the concepts of color and texture aren't unique to the east so you might expect a length discussion about how eastern notions of color and texture differ from western notions and how the two can blend together to create a harmonious and beautiful room. Instead, the two pages of text in this chapter merely say, "Ancient Eastern beliefs include much color symbolism that relates to the emotional responses the colors evoke" and "The Eastern affinity for natural fibers and materials introduces a broad range of textures". Gee, thanks.<P>The other problem is the poor dilenation of topics. If you flip to a random picture in the book you'll have a hard time whether they are trying to tell you something about texture or proportion. Certainly, in a complete room all of the factors need to balance each other out, but without focusing on each one individually it is harder to grasp its importance.<P>There are a few hundred photos of designs that look like they would, for the most part, require expensive modifications (for instance, the kitchen with contrasting textures made of three separate materials or the dining room with the floor treatment). As another reviewer pointed out, virtually all of the photographs reflect a Japanese and (to a much lesser extent) Chinese aesthetic.</span>

                    <span>If you think that Eastern style is all about Japanese style and minimalism then this is the book for you. But if you think Asia includes India, Thailand, Burma, Bali, Korea etc, you will find this book and its aesthetic a huge disappointment. I did. Stick with Kelly Hoppen.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book for anyone wanting to elements of Asian design, which are so popular today, to their home. With so much to choose from you can't help but be inspired. Sections focus on various principles including simplicity, order, proportion, harmony, balance, color and texture. Examples in photos are accompanied by descriptive text.<P>Since I am a crafter I am always on the lookout for the things I can make for myself and I saw many here that I could. My favorite idea is a Japanese-style dining table that is sunken into the ground. It looks so elegant and I am dreaming of having one someday. They also use lots of screens, which are one of my favorite elements with their beauty and versatility. I though an attic room with a semi-hidden bed was a great idea as well.<P>I appreciate the practical approach here of incorporating authentic Asian design into existing Western homes of various types. If you are looking for some fresh ideas for your home and want a simple, yet elegant style this book will give you some great ideas.</span>

                    <span>I am so pleased with this purchase. I was a little skeptical initially because the front picture wasn't to my taste, but the inside photos show diverse ways in which to incorporate eastern elements into a liveable design scheme. Another thing that I appreciate about this specialized design books is that I learned general principles of design from the author. The photos are beautiful, the rooms are beautiful, and the suggestions are thoughtful and fairly easy to implement without going crazy overboard on money. I love it! Can't wait to start buying seriously!</span>
