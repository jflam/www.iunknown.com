                <span id="Label1">In a motion picture starring Brad Pitt, SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET is the autobiographical account of a young Austrian adventurer and the escape from an internment camp that changed his life forever.  In 1943, Heinrich Harrer, a noted mountain climber and skier, slipped out of captivity in India and made his way through the Himalayan passes to the Forbidden City of Lhasa in Tibet. From destitute vagabond, he rose to the position of tutor and confidant to the fourteen-year-old Dalai Lama.  Until their parting in 1950, when the Chinese Communists overran the country, his close relationship with the revered holy man profoundly altered his way of living, even his way of thinking.</span>

                    <span>You have got to read this book. It is so good. It starts out with the description of an escaped German POW's travels through fuedal Tibet, then onto the Forbidden City of Lhasa, and finally the teaching of the Dalai Lama himself! Then he is forced to flee through the 18000 foot valleys of the Roof of the World before the rampaging Chinese. 	This book is touching emotionally, in the fact that it shows the life of a vibrant people and culture so tragically snuffed out. 	It is a wonderful advernture story, and if you enjoy reading about exotic religions, forbidden cities, inhospitable land, and god-kings, then this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>I decided to read this novel because I enjoy travel literature, and also because of a recommendation from a friend from Liechtenstein who was acquainted with the author. I found this novel to be quite fascinating, telling a story of survival in harsh terrain, a love for the mountains, and the gathering of knowledge about an isolated and mysterious culture. Mr. Harrer's ability to survive in the Himalayas, his quick adaptation to Tibetan lifestyle and language, and his writing skills paint the picture of an incredibly intelligent and enterprising individual. This book lends strong support to the cause for a free Tibet.</span>

                    <span>I was very surprised by this book becuase it is almost nothing like the Hollywood movie staring Brad Pitt. It was much better. The writting stlye was easy to read and involving and the candor of the books author about the people he lived with for years implies that he had a true love and respect for them, and had spent alot of time seriously observing them, this book was not written lightly or in a joking tone!! It' a wonderful story - read it!!</span>

                    <span>I read this book for the first time when I was only 13. I was absolutely captivated by Harrer's stunning descriptions of pre-occupation Tibet, and specifically Lhasa. Harrer portrays life in a world forbidden to foreigners and that no longer exists.<P>His memoir begins with his attempt to summit Nanga Parbat in the himalayas and continues through his captivity in a British POW camp through his many escape attempts to reach Tibet.<P>Harrer continues through his exhausting trek through the unwelcoming plains of Tibet, even encountering the infamous Khampa bandits. <P>Harrer then goes into his stay in Lhasa, emphasizing his time tutoring the young 14th Dalai Lama. He also discusses his time working as a public servant for Lhasa alongside fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter, mapping Lhasa, building dykes along the river et cetera. <P>Finally Harrer discusses the downfall off Tibet due to the Chinese invasion from an insider's standpoint, even up to Harrer's escape from Tibet.<P>His writing makes old Tibet so real, and his final words (which I will not reveal) speaks to our hearts as humans, not as Americans, Chinese, Tibetans, Germans, Austrians, or whatever we may be.<P>The only flaw that I can think of for this book is Harrer's ego shows through his writing. While it is not a major flaw, it is annoying.<P>I highly reccomend this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is first of all a great story about a daring escape from a POW camp in Northern India followed by a fugitive's trek across some of the worlds most inhospitable territory. It seems impossible that anyone could have survived trekking over the Himalayas in winter with no equipment other than a few rags for clothing. The rest of the book is a remarkable eyewittness account of Tibet and especially Lhasa just before the time of the Chinese invasion. Harrer paints a vivid picture of a lively and colourful Forbidden City (Lhasa), and his great love of the country and its charming people shines brightly through. Towards the end Harrer becomes a personal tutor of H.H. the 14th Dalai Lama and his account of his relationship with the only 14 year old leader of Tibet is endearing and touching. I enjoyed the book very much not only because of the topic matter but also because of Harrer's honest, tough, and yet deeply respectful and caring attitude toward Tibet and its people.</span>
