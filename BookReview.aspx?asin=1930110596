                    <span>This book was good during it's time, but now it is outdated. The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004. So, if you are like me, disappointed with head first books and looking to be certified as fast as possible, do yourself a favor and buy the second edition of this book. You won't regret it.

                    <span>This is not only a good book for SCWCD 1.3 exam, but also a good reference for web application development. I read this book thoroughly and took some mock exams available in the internet, then i appeared for the real exam. I got 98%. I would strongly recommend this book for customers to buy.</span>

                    <span>This book is all you need to pass the SCWCD Exam in the 1.3 version, I studied extra subjects in order to pass the 1.4 version.
<br />
<br />Excellent book.</span>

                    <span>This is a solid and useful study guide. Especially useful are the questions at the end of the each chapter, the electronic practice exams on the CD, and the quizlets. The book lacks hands on programming projects, or programming assignments, which would have been really useful for solidifying the material. Yes, you can make stuff like this up for yourself, but then why are you buying a book? 
<br />
<br />Also note that this book is not for the current version of the exam, and after december 14th 2004, the version of the exam that the book was made for will no longer be relevant. 
<br />
<br />My favorite chapter was the one on enterpise design patterns. The author also has a good little section on showing how all of the design patterns presented fit into the enterprise architecture as a whole. </span>

                    <span>This is a excellent book for SCWCD. Anyone interested to pass the exam should not miss this book. This book is very clear. I passed the SCWCD with a score of 93% and I am very thankful to the authors. The CD comes with some very helpful documents like the Servlets and JSP's spec, and comes with a very good test program, these questios are very similar to the real exam!</span>
