                <span id="Label1"><p align="left">Once upon a time Linus Torvalds was a skinny unknown, just another nerdy Helsinki techie who had been fooling around with computers since childhood. Then he wrote a groundbreaking operating system and distributed it via the Internet -- for free. Today Torvalds is an international folk hero. And his creation LINUX is used by over 12 million people as well as by companies such as IBM.</p><p align="left">Now, in a narrative that zips along with the speed of e-mail, Torvalds gives a history of his renegade software while candidly revealing the quirky mind of a genius. The result is an engrossing portrayal of a man with a revolutionary vision, who challenges our values and may change our world.</p></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Well the title was right.  The book is "Just for Fun".  It is a lighthearted look at Linus' short life so far.  Sharing both 
<br />his  Finnish heritage (and experiences in Finland) as well as well as his Silicon Valley life I found some connection to his 
<br />experiences.  I laughed at his frank description of the lack of any life in San Jose.  Although his childhood and adolescent 
<br />experiences in dealing with his geekiness was amusing they were just a bit much.  If was a bit surprising that the author was 
<br />has written for Red Herring magazine was a little light on the technical side of things.
<br />
<br />Two things spoke to me however.  His personal observations on the Open Source Movement versus commercial software development; and his detailed account of why work has to be fun.  
<br />
<br />He talks about how work climbs the evolutionary latter from being neccasary for survival, to the need to be a part of a greater social cause and then just for plain fun.  The three part evolutionary process helps to explain how dedicated hackers 
<br />help to create Linux while not directly benefiting financially.
<br />
<br />The most interesting discussion I took from this book however was his opinions on the Open Source versus the Commercial software industry (Redmond, Washington).  He gives some great examples of the US market for cell phones compared with Europe.  He states that because the Europeans cooperated on an agreement on standards first this led to levels of innovation far greater than that experienced here.  I also found his example of the music industry compelling.  His claim is that the MP3 standard (as well as file swapping services) started in reaction to the user UN-friendly policies of the music industry of pushing one hit song CDs down the consumers throat.  To get around buying a CD with only one or two songs that are worth hearing, consumers have circumvented the system by swapping only those one or two songs that are any good.
<br />
<br />A light read with some interesting insights.  If you want to read more about the Open Source Movement however there are books out there which present it in greater detail.</span>

                    <span>This book is exactly what I expected it to be.
<br />Linus don't give us a detailed explanation on why he did things this way but frankly, this is not an error for a book of this category.This book is an auto biografy, not a kernel hacker's book.
<br />Reading this book you will feel how the Torvald's life is going on.
<br />It's true. Reading this you will undertand Torvalds is tired about Linux.Yes. Linux is now a job, no more an hobby. Linux is responsability.With great surprise you'll discover that Torvalds has nothing against Microsoft. This book is fun. I like the Tovald's way of writing. Very informal. I read this book three times and I consider it one of the best autobiographies I ever read.Higly recommended. </span>

                    <span>I picked this up to read during a 10-hour plane ride.  Having been using both Linux and FreeBSD for my business, this book struck my interest.
<br />
<br />I'm not really even sure what this book is supposed to be or who the intended audience is.  The book is dumbed down and details are skimmed over, which is frustrating for any Linux user.  Only a Linux user would want to read this anyway and they would want a technical book.
<br />
<br />Most of the book is written by Linus.  While the history of his life is interesting, the lack of details and technical know-how is left out.  I was hoping for more under-the-hood details and OS vs OS discussion.   Instead of the "my way is better", I was hoping for more of a discussion on architecture views.  Clearly, other OS authors don't think they are writing anything less than their best either.
<br />
<br />Sadly, Linus seems to have lost the passion for his OS.  I was expecting an uplifting sales pitch or a "we will do anything in our power to make Linux the best it can be".    Instead you are faced with him stating that he doesn't know what the future will bring.   That is a bit scary coming from the one that controls the kernel.  Money has clearly gone to his head.  There is nothing wrong with money, just the attitude that usually comes along with it.
<br />
<br />Linus seems to use this book as a means for venting.  Bashing everything to other operating systems (normally with no argument to back it up) to root beer.  Hey, I like root beer!  The venting includes some big names in the industry some of whom he walked out on.  
<br />
<br />Other important open source contributors and biggest names in Linux development are left out.  The open source movement happened because a lot of people worked together, not just on this project but many other important ones such as X, Perl, Apache, KDE, Gnome, etc, etc.
<br />
<br />The co-author really makes the book frustrating.  Extra chapters a sprinkled in with recaps of visits with Linus.  He follows him around like a lost puppy and observes him as a comic book hero.  Instead of adding anything to the story of Linux, he only sheds light on visits, observations, and family details.  To make matters worse, the guy uses a MAC.  Why is this guy writing the book?
<br />
<br />Highlights include a bit more background on Linus's personal life, a rapidly skipped-over timeline of Linux OS, his Finnish-to-America transition, some details on Java, and some interesting takes on the open-source movement.
<br />
<br />Frustrations include Linus's constant complaining, lack of technical detail, poor co-author that doesn't use or know anything about Linux, unnecessary opinions about the meaning of life among other things, and lack of passion for Linux.
<br />
<br />This book could have been so much better, but it is still worth reading if these topics interest you.
<br />Linus, you are a good guy but you aren't my hero.

                    <span>In Just for Fun, Linus Torvalds, the Finnish creator of the Linux operating system, mixes his personal story, told in both narrative and e-mail dispatches, with the saga of his development of the Linux operating system. Torvalds' personal account makes the book fascinating. He began as a self-proclaimed nerd (and even a jerk) who labored to create an operating system in his garage and eventually became the head of the world's largest open source project. By requiring buyers and licensees to keep the Linux source code open, Torvalds assures the continued technological evolution of his system. The episodic nature of the book makes it choppy, the technical descriptions are hard for the uninitiated to track and co-writer David Diamond's digressions are revealing about Torvalds' personal life, but a little disruptive. Even so, we recommend this entertaining, interesting book that may even lead you to consider using Linux on your computer, whether or not you are another self-proclaimed computer nerd.</span>

                    <span>First problem Mr. Torvalds co-wrote the book - should've left it to the professionals. Though one gets the impression from the book that he's such a control freak that wasn't an option. Considering his ego I'm suprised the book wasn't longer. A lot of drivel, negative comments about industry people he's met, ego stroking, self-important blather. He's cashed out, made his millions and good for him - think he'd acknowledge the Free Software Foundation/GNU etc. instead of critizing them. Nothing wrong with being a sell-out, just don't deny it and minimize the contributions others made to your success.</span>
