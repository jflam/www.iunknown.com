                <span id="Label1">A unique autobiography in images from seven decades of Duncan's photographic career.  <P>The legendary photographs of David Douglas Duncan explore the broad range of human nature, from the most quiet notes of life to the crashing crescendos of war. Duncan began taking pictures for newspapers in the mid-1930s, then joined the Marines, where he produced some of the most moving images of World War II. With <I>Life</I> magazine, he documented the end of British rule in India and covered conflicts in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Korea with clarity and compassion. Returning to the battlefield with the escalation of war in Vietnam, he produced two more books that became icons of the American soldiers' experience.  <P>Since then, he has produced books on such diverse subjects as Picasso's making of a painting to the sunflowers of France, with forays into the world of tragic personal loss. Still exuberant in his eighth decade, Duncan's keen eye and heart continue to illuminate the human experience. Over 400 photographs in color and duotone.</span>

                    <span>About ten years ago, when I was about 30, I kept running into this book called "Yankee Nomad" at used bookstores. It was a book published in 1966 and it contained some incredible photographs. I finally found a copy which was in perfect condition for a reasonable price and I bought it.<P>And I actually found myself reading it from cover to cover. My initial attraction was based on my love of photography. But I soon discovered that the book appealed even more to my love of travel. David Douglas Duncan was a photojournalist who roamed the world for various major magazines (Life, National Geographic, etc.) for several decades (five or six!) on assignment covering some of the most significant events of the 20th century. I do not exaggerate when I say this man's life makes Hemingway's pale by comparison. The variety of places, people, events and dramas which this man photographed is staggering.<P>This book, "Photo Nomad" seems to be an updated and revised verion of "Yankee Nomad." It includes the next three decades of DDD's life as well as the photography going back to the late 1930's covered in "Yankee Nomad." There is some overlap of photos, but the new stuff is so good and of sufficient quantity that it is definitely worth having even if you happen to have (or want) "Yankee Nomad."<P>It is the DIVERSITY of images and places which I find most appealing. A sampling: The south Pacific in WWII; North Korea; treasures of the Kremlin; Palestine; Afgahnistan; the High Atlas mountains of Morocco; giant squid fishing off the coast of South America; Egypt; and, as quite an enhancement, many photos of Picasso at work (DDD and Picasso became close friends and were mutual admirers). I also loved a series of photos of classic 1950's Mercedes which were raced by DDD at high speed in beautiful European settings and photographed at slow shutter speeds so DDD could capture "the spirit" of the car as it whizzed by leaving a trail of light. <P>I've always been a Robert Capa admirer, but DDD has war photos which are just as good and then a vast variety of other images. His life has been a montage of powerful images and events. I just wish I'd read (or just looked at the photos) of his books 20 years ago, as I'm sure I would have altered my career choices based on what I learned about this man's career.<P>This book is very well produced in cloth-covered hardbound. There is a moving little photo story of DDD's small doggy which apparently was recently taken when his car was stolen and which DDD responded to by utilizing his media friends to mount a massive publicity campaign to recover (successfully, for ransom money). DDD is apparently still alive and well and living in France.<P>My short list of Magnificent 20th Century Lives would include DDD in the TOP FIVE. This book explains why. If you are into travel, photography, adventure, history, geography, or humanity, you will LOVE this book and you will feel great affection for its creator.</span>
