                <span id="Label1">"A splendid history.... If Americans want to be convinced of the benefits of empire, as well as apprised of its costs, they need merely pick up Ferguson's dazzling book." --<I>Weekly Standard</I><P> The British Empire was the largest in all history: the nearest thing to world domination ever achieved. By the eve of World War II, around a quarter of the world's land surface was under some form of British rule. Yet for today's generation, the British Empire seems a Victorian irrelevance. The time is ripe for a reappraisal, and in <I>Empire</I>, Niall Ferguson boldly recasts the British Empire as one of the world's greatest modernizing forces. <P> An important new work of synthesis and revision, <I>Empire</I> argues that the world we know today is in large measure the product of Britain's Age of Empire. The spread of capitalism, the communications revolution, the notion of humanitarianism, and the institutions of parliamentary democracy-all these can be traced back to the extraordinary expansion of Britain's economy, population, and culture from the seventeenth century until the mid-twentieth. On a vast and vividly colored canvas, <I>Empire</I> shows how the British Empire acted as midwife to modernity. <P> Displaying the originality and rigor that have made him the brightest light among British historians, Ferguson shows that the story of the Empire is pregnant with lessons for today-in particular for the United States as it stands on the brink of a new era of imperial power, based once again on economic and military supremacy. A dazzling tour de force, Empire is a remarkable reappraisal of the prizes and pitfalls of global empire.</span>

                    <span>Let's start with the reviews. When you read them, try to keep in mind the simple fact that this book is both describing an historical era (the British Empire) and assessing it. Not all historians do the latter; and too many are content to do a boring job of the former. I think Ferguson does a superb job on both fronts, but it is nonetheless possible to disagree with his assessment of the empire while admiring his well-paced narrative and lavishly illustrated survey of it. How the Empire came into being; why it was British (as opposed to Spanish, Dutch or other); how it operated; how it was funded; who its beneficiaries were; what it did badly; the horrors of which it was guilty;piracy on high seas, the slave trade, its role in Africa, India, Australia, Ireland and elsewhere: Niall Ferguson captures it all. But not just that..He is interested in applying the lesson of Empire to the world today. It is the modern world, after all, that the Empire shaped for better or worse. And here we arrive at Ferguson's assessment. Readers might take issue with a balance sheet approach to the Empire, and they make take issue with the evaluation itself, but in providing us with such an assessment Ferguson brings the Empire to life in these pages. On net, the Empire was a positive good, if only because "in the end, the British sacrificed her Empire to stop the Germans, Japanese and Italians from keeping theirs. Did not that sacrifice alone expunge all the Empire's other sins?" Ferguson thinks so. I agree. Others may not. You don't need to agree with his conclusions, but you cannot walk away from the question, for now the United States is poised to be an Empire -- an Empire in denial in Ferguson's view -- and whether and to what extent the U.S. should assume, or can assume the role of an imperial power is upon us all. What do you think? This is what Ferguson is asking us to do in this outstanding work, in effecting saying: Here's the historical framework, here's what I make of it. Well, what do you think? Read Empire. Re-read it. Like it or not, the question of Empire is upon us.</span>

                    <span>First, prospective buyers should understand that this is NOT a history of the British Empire, but rather reflections on the empire, and its implications for the modern world, particularly the United States. It is more like a graduate school History seminar in book form, largely set out in fascinating and apt anecdotes, and generously, but never obtrusively, illustrated with a wonderful selection of maps, photos and paintings. Thus, it presumes a fair amount of knowledge of world, and especially British, history. And although I consider myself quite knowledgeable in these matters, I was surprised and delighted with facts and stories I had never come across before, or, perhaps better stated, had never viewed from Ferguson's particular angle. Don't for a minute believe the book is merely the excuse for the TV series: it stands on its own as a refreshing and perceptive treatment of an age that is gone, but on the grand wheel of history, may come again. Ferguson rolls out a parade of small stories and forces the reader, in a most gentle and enjoyable way, to think big. If that single attribute doesn't denote a worthwhile history book, I don't know what does. You won't regret the read.</span>

                    <span>Niall Ferguson has written a well-balanced portrait of the rise and fall of the British Empire. Ferguson does not downplay at all the sins of the British administration in its colonies: e.g., eager pursuit of slavery in the 18th century, brutal crushing of failed rebellions against British rule in the 19th and 20th centuries and mismanagement of famines in the 19th century. <P>However, the British Empire played a key role in the spread of the ideas that have conquered the world: free markets, democracy, Anglo-Saxon culture ... and Pax Britannica (now Pax Americana). As Michael Mandelbaum reminds us in his masterpiece about the ideas that conquered the world, free markets tend to promote democracy and enrich most of their economic agents over time. And democracies are inclined to conduct peaceful foreign policies.<P>Before WWI, Britain was the most fervent advocate of free trade. Furthermore, British imperial power relied on the massive export of capital and people. The U.S., heir and adopter of many best practices of the British Empire, however, became a convert to free trade only after WWI. Furthermore, unlike the British Empire, the U.S., currently at the apex of its power and influence, is a massive importer of capital and people. <P>Ferguson rightly points out that the British Empire had a self-liquidating character. The British Empire learned from the American Independence that granting self-government to the most advanced colonies (read White Dominions) was key to its survival. Nonetheless, the British Empire was clearly ambivalent about self-government beyond its White Dominions. The British Empire understood that this ambivalence was not even sustainable: e.g., India was granted Dominion status in the 1930s. The crippling price that the British Empire paid in defeating the partisans of Illiberalism in both world wars accelerated its inevitable decline due to a lack of resources to meet the growing challenges and opportunities of globalization. <P>Ferguson also reminds his audience that the failed de-colonization in many Third World countries clearly shows that the achievements of the British Empire cannot be taken for granted. Although guns, germs and steel have played an important role in the fates of these human societies as Jared Diamond rightly points out in his best seller, civil wars and lawless, corrupt governments are today the ultimate culprits for their failure. Without free markets, a country is condemned to remain at the doorstep of the world and sink in both oblivion and irrelevance unless it is a dangerous failed state. Without the exercise or at least the threat of (soft) power, there cannot be globalization that ultimately benefits most human beings. The network of bases and informal spheres of influence are some of the tools that the U.S. has at its disposal to further the advancement of the current liberal hegemony that cannot be taken for granted. Sometimes, the temporary occupation of the most dangerous failed states is key to facilitate the ultimate advent of democracy that Winston Churchill nicely describes as the worst form of government except for all the other forms that have been tried from time to time.</span>

                    <span>THis tour de force traces the rise and decline of the British empire and emphatically argues that although not always wonderful the British empire was the best alternative to empire like the Nazis and Japanese 'coprosperity sphere'. In this wonderful volume we learn of the exploits of Livingston, Clive, and many others who carved out 25 percent of the world for England. We learn of the less glorious aspects like the Boer war and the anti-slavery movement. THe major oversight is neglecting to the tell the tale of UDI in Rhodesia, of Smuts and of Mao Mao or the Falklands war, but nevertheless this book explains how Britian made the Modern world.<P>Seth J.

                    <span>In this book of the TV series, Ferguson attempts to survey the British Empire's history and impact on the world. In the earlier chapters, he makes a reasonable job of telling the story truthfully, but when he reaches the 20th century, his imbecile political opinions wreck the narrative.<P>He depicts the Empire's bloody origins in piracy and theft. He shows how the British people bore the Empire's costs, how the Indian people paid for the Indian Army, while the Empire's gains accrued only to a tiny minority of bondholders, and how the export of India's riches led to the vast famines of the 18th and 19th centuries. He accurately describes the imperial slogan 'Commerce and Christianity' as theft and fundamentalism. <P>He praises the Empire's 'capital export to the less developed world', as if investment was about giving not taking. The investment should have been in British industry. He blames trade unions for the Great Depression - "Rising real wages led to unemployment" - unpardonable economic illiteracy from a Professor of Economics. <P>He blames World War Two on a 'descent into protectionism' rather than on the continuing rivalry between empires. He writes that the USA was the key to victory - so not the ally that destroyed 90% of Nazi forces? He writes that Britain "sacrificed her Empire to stop the German, Japanese and Italians keeping theirs. Did not that sacrifice alone expunge all the Empire's other sins?" (A strangely Catholic doctrine!) But Churchill thought he had saved the Empire, only to find that the USA nipped in and stole it! And the answer to Ferguson's question is still no.<P>He sneers that anti-imperialism is linked to anti-semitism, sneers about 'conspiracy theories' about oil, sneers about 'freedom fighters' (his inverted commas), sneers about the Soviet and Chinese achievements. As usual with reactionaries, he poses as bravely saying unpopular truths, while actually just retreading the hoariest, most discredited, clichés. He ends by calling ludicrously for the USA to set up a formal empire, a universal 'political globalisation'!<P>Book, TV series and author are as showy and shallow as was the Empire itself.</span>
