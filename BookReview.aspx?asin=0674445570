                <span id="Label1">In the 19th century, when the idea of eugenics (selective breeding to generate superior members of a species) was invited off the farm and into the parlor, it was a far-fetched notion with little possibility of success driven by clearly racist motivations. But at the end of the 20th century, biotechnological techniques and other agendas are making forms of human eugenics plausible.  Rich in anecdote, narrative, and fact. An important book.</span>

                    <span>...This was one of the most widely recommended and referenced books by those who disagree or agree with the eugenics movement in the United States. Those who lambasted the scientific idiots running the eugenics movement as being prejudiced and biased in their science, lauded this book as one of the most complete of all recent books written on this topic. Those who support the motives behind eugenics, fixed upon this particular book and author as the one they needed to tear apart. That gives readers an idea of how accurately Kelves pushed the buttons of those who would practice eugenics, euthanasia, doctor-assisted suicide, and other such controversial practices. Kelves research job is outstanding, and even though the reader can tell the opinion of Kevles from the way he writes, he certainly more than backed up his writing with pertinent references and cross-references. <p>In fact, I enjoyed reading his references and bibliography, because it was just loaded with information that he chose not to use in the text of his book. I also tend to go searching through his index and references for extra information because of all of the books I've read on eugenics here in the U.S. his is the most valid and inclusive of everything I've seen so far. This is a topic which is very difficult to read, let alone write about, without developing very strong opinions not only of the movement itself, but of the people involved one way or another in this particular stain on American history. See...I cannot even keep my own mouth shut for writing a short review on a book on the topic...I cannot imagine researching it for a period of years and being expected to remain distant and objective about it. Kevles does a relatively good job presenting the facts and not becoming too strident about the questionable scientific practices which flourished in order to 'prove' preconceived ideas and beliefs. The book is extremely readable (especially compared to most textbooks for sociology or ethics), and I can understand why professors would recommend this book to their students rather than reading a dry textbook. I certainly have no plans to get rid of my copy, and I will be lending it out and recommending it to those I teach concerning the disabled and bioethics. ...</span>

                    <span>Kevles is a very clear and thorough writer.  I have read other articles by him as well as this book, and he presents the history of eugenics and its modern possiblities with a readablility that will be clear to anyone, even w/o a sciene background.  The book does cover a lot of information, but is enjoyable.  If you have an interest in the possibilities regarding the use of genetic knowledge, this book is worth your time.</span>

                    <span>I had to read it for school... I am a college freshman...in my Sociology class we had to choose a book off of a reading list to report on.  <p>Remembering the mention of Eugenics in High School Biology, and  remembering my odd fascination with genetics and hereditiy, I thought I'd  give this book a try.  I was fully ready to embark on a difficult and heavy  book that discussed scientific matter that went over my head (being a film  student, eugenics doesn't come up very often.) Much to my surprise I found  the book very readable, and I became obsessed with reading it. Everything  about the whole eugenics scene was so complex and intereting.<p>I think I  could keep up with it all because of the way the author presented the  subject.  It was laid out so that a person (like me) who knew next to  nothing about eugenics, could pick up the book and get a history of the  people and the practices of genetics and the uses of human heredity.  I  recommend it to anyone who is somewhat interested in eugenics, but does not  have the background or time to devote life study to it.  It satisfied my  curiosities and my book report!  :)</span>

                    <span>Daniel Kevles's In the Name of Eugenics is a thoughtful, well-written look at the eugenics movement of the early twentieth century.  In an extremely readable manner, Kevles has produced a most accessible and informative study of eugenics that will be of interest to people with various amounts  of knowledge of the field.  Kevles meticulously examines the lives of the  eugenicists as well as the many implications of eugenics in American  society.  This book is invaluable to anyone studying eugenics and is a  great resource.</span>

                    <span>The book attempts to point to some of the abuses of eugenics in the past in an attempt to discredit modern scientific views of the inheritance of traits in particular the inheritance of intelligence.  The inheritance of  intellectual ability was irrefutably demonstrated by Hernstein and Murray  in their seminal work "The Bell Curve".  Ever since the  publication of this work there has been a steady stream of the most banal  and unscientific writings attempting to refute its authority and  conclusions.  Although the "History of Eugenics" was written  before "The Bell Curve" was published it nevertheless enjoys the  attention of such notable leftists as Jay Gould who have taken it upon  themselves to mount a relentless campaign to discredit Hernstein and  Murray's work. <p>The words of praise of Kevle's book by Jay Gould which  appear on its back cover is particularly disingenuous since the author  praises Mr. Gould in the book.  But praising those that agree with him and  criticizing and demonizing those that don't is the author's as well as Mr.  Gould's style.  So there is nothing new here.  <p>Apart from the author's  small contribution towards work on the history of eugenics there is really  very little to recommend this book to anyone interested in an objective  treatment of this important subject.</span>
