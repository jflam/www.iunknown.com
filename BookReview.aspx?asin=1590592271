                <span id="Label1"><p>Written in the same style that has made Ivor Horton a best-selling author, this third edition of his popular title is a comprehensive, ground-up tutorial! The third edition has been completely revised and updated, and is ideal for self-taught students and scholars enrolled in structured courses. The text and examples are progressive; each topic builds and expands upon the previous topic. Further, the book provides in-depth coverage of class templates, including an introduction to the Standard Template Library. <p> 	 No prior knowledge of any particular programming language is assumed; the only requirement is a basic appreciation of elementary programming concepts. If you understand the basic notions of how programs work&#151;like branching and looping&#151;this book is for you! Horton demonstrates all language elements with complete working code examples, and includes practice exercises at the end of each chapter.</span>

                    <span>Anyone reading these reviews is obviously just getting started in C++, and if you're like I was 6 months ago, you're probably confused by all the "starter" books out there. Don't waste your time! Buy this book (and only this one until you get your feet wet) -- you will not be disappointed. The format/layout and efficiency of each chapter will keep you well focused and keep you from yanking your hair out. I needed a crash course in C++ and of course, it just couldn't be done (21 Days? Don't even think about it!) -- other books got me nowhere, but Ivor's book allowed me to spring into an Advanced C++ course with no prior training and keep my head above the water. Keep in mind the new ANSI/ISO standard, which Ivor covers in great detail. Do yourself a favor and minimize the headaches...start here!</span>

                    <span>I'm a student and the book we are using in class (C++ From the Beginning by Jan Skansholm) I find difficult to read and EXTREMELY hard to use as a tutorial as well as a reference book. Ivar Hortons Beginning C++ however is easy to read and follow and comes with lots of examples! (I learn by example, don't you?) I spent almost a week of intense searching for the "right" book that could teach me C++ (There are a lot of C++ books out there) and I'm so glad I picked this one. The only "downside" is that you'll need a fairly new compiler (MS VC++ 5.0/6.0) although you'll certainly benifit from the books explanations even if you can't use the newest features. I just wish I had bought this book bofore.</span>

                    <span>If you want to have a strong foundation in C++ read this book. All major C++ concepts are explained in detail. This book will reduce the number of situations where you feel, "AHH!!! Why wont this code work, my syntax and logic is perfect", because it is crammed full of even the most minor (yet very important in some cases) information.<BR>If you are serious about C++ programming and want to start windows programming and/or game programming or any API/SDK programming this book is for you. However if you are not serious about programming with C++ find another book, because the author does go into detail on every topic. If you don't like C++ you may become bored.<BR><BR><BR>P.S.<BR>I must warn you sometimes the authors coding style may be difficult for true beginners to understand. Don't let this sway you, just keep at it and reread the code and explanations several times.</span>

                    <span>What a huge book! It contains every detail of C++, it teaches you C++ from the first principles (basic data types up to the complexity of Object-Oriented Programming). You don't need to know another language to learn from this book, all what you really need to benefit most from this book is continuity of reading, enthusiasm and application of the examples and exercises in each chapter. The book contains a total of 20 chapters, each of which is full with examples of the real-world plus some exercises at the end of each chapter. One more thing, you have to bear in mind that this book doesn't teach you much about the Standard Library, nor anything about Windows programming (since it doesn't belong to any compiler.) Rather, it focuses on OOP and language grammar. This book plus another one for Standard Library you'll be a real C++ programmer. If you are a beginner then go and buy it right now, it's for you!!</span>

                    <span>This is the second book I've poured through by our friend Mr. Horton. The first was Java 2 a few years ago. I'm forced to feel that the book was written for me. His personality truly comes out in the book. I do not recall any boring moments throughout the reading. Creating quality C++ applications are now a living reality. The shear ease of learning this language forces me to reflect on why many developers choose to assume an arrogance. This is a great book for someone wanting a great jumpstart in C++. Hurray for Ivor. Now, if he could just write a book on how to code for KDE.</span>
