                    <span>While most knowledgeable baseball fans have a passing acquaintance with Negro League Baseball, precious little ink has been devoted to the institution itself.  Author Neil Lanctot has corrected this oversight with a downright fascinating and meticulously researched book.  "Negro League Baseball" chronicles the history of the sport from its earliest origins until its ultimate demise in the early 1960's.  From the outset there were a multitude of obstacles that the operators of most of these teams were simply never able to overcome.  Poor administration, lack of suitable venues, constantly shifting franchises and raids from competing leagues were just some of the problems the Negro Leagues were up against.  And when the leagues finally became profitable in the early to mid 1940's the spectre of integration in organized baseball and the shortsightedness of the league owners would ultimately seal the fate of this venerable black institution.  
<br />This is an absolutely fascinating story that you are sure to become engrossed in.  The writing is first rate and as I mentioned earlier the book is extremely well researched.  Sports fans and history buffs alike are certain to enjoy this one. Highly recommended!      </span>

                    <span>The author weaves together an amazing amout of historical research to tell an interesting story. All the important figures are here, Satchell Paige, Josh Gibson, etc., but he also introduces lesser known though equally interesting personalities, especially the owners. Never before has anyone told the whole story of the Negro Leagues like this, explaining why Negro League baseball was important as an institution to African American communities across the country.</span>
