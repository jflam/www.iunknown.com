                <span id="Label1">All of Raphael's most important paintings as well as a significant number of his drawings and engravings are reproduced, principally in color, in this splendid new tribute to one of the most admired artists of the Italian Renaissance.  <P>In this lavishly illustrated book featuring some 300 illustrations, the author takes a fresh, critical look at the life and work of Rafaello Sanzio, or, as he signed certain paintings, Raphael Urbinas--in homage to his native city of Urbino. Described as "an artist touched by grace," Raphael is considered along with Michelangelo and Leonardo to be one of the greatest painters of the Italian Renaissance.  <P>Raphael (1483-1520), whose birth and death were on a Good Friday, belonged to a family of merchants; aside from his training in the studio of Perugino, little is known about his earliest years. He arrived in Florence in 1504, where he studied the masters: Masaccio, Ghirlandaio, Leonardo and produced magnificent paintings of the Madonna as well as remarkable portraits; in 1508 he went to Rome, where he died a dozen years later at the height of his powers, after creating monumental works at the Vatican. At thirty years of age, he was, in the eyes of his contemporaries, a living legend. In his Lives of the Artists, Vasari wrote: " While we may term other works paintings, those of Raphael are living things, the flesh palpitates, the breath comes and goes, every organ lives, life pulsates everywhere."  <P>In a fascinating text De Vecchi reexamines each of the major periods of Raphael's short career dispelling the myths about him that have accumulated over the centuries. He reminds us that the most "profound" element of Raphael's art was his striving to express in his work the dialectic between earthly and heavenly love, which was an important concern of his contemporaries The coverage of the text extends beyond the paintings to Raphael's significant work as an architect and designer of interiors. The reference material in the Appendix includes a chronology and a bibliography.  <P>Other details: Approximately 300 full-color illustrations</span>

                    <span>Let me first mention that I am reviewing the 1994 edition, 128 pages, which is a slightly abridged edition of an earlier 1973 edition. It has 100 illustrations, 40 full-colour plates. I have perused the 1973 edition and found the text to be exactly the same. There are just fewer illustrations and colour plates. That seems to be the only difference. <BR>My one complaint about the book is that there really is no personal information on Raphael; it basically concerns just his painting. How much he produced in his short span of 37 years! Never married, his work is his legacy. An art class I once took focused some time on his "School of Athens" fresco in the Vatican. He painted a surprising mixture of classical, religious, and secular themes. Among the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance, along with Da Vinci and Michelangelo, both of whom were older. I highly recommend this book for any lover of the Arts. And especially if you have been to Rome and the Vatican. Or, if you are planning such a trip.</span>
