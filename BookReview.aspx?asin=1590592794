                    <span>When I was buying this book, I was afraid if it will be only a printed version of PDF docs. But the book is much more, then simple documentation. Helen Borrie is a professional, and an experienced developer, so she often writes about programmer's bad habits or the reasons why databases are so poorly designed.
<br />Some parts of this book may however seem as a typical printed PDF, but lots of notes, comments or warnings make it a really interesting reading. The good thing is, that this book offers also an opportunity to gain some basis of database designing, and database theory.
<br />Why you should buy it? Because it is much better and (unless you own a good laser printer) much cheaper than using downloaded PDF's. You cannot also get Borrie's comments that make this book really rich.
<br />A must-have for all database developers, not only Firebird developers.

                    <span>This book is excellent for understanding what Firebird can do and how you can do it by hand (not with IBExpert or any other database administration tool). It doesn't show how you can use it with Delphi, Builder or any other programming languaje. It doesn't have step by step instructions, either a lot of screen illustrations (it has about 5). Well my Delphi friends, with this book now we have half the way to heaven :-) but what about the other half? :-(

                    <span>I broadly concur with the comments made in the preceding reviews.  I was surprised by the efforts Ms. Borrie went to in assuring that database concepts remained approachable for less experienced developers.  Regardless, the content and organization of this book make it perfectly suitable as a  resource for virtually anyone doing data tier work.  
<br />
<br />Until MySQL 5.0 moves out of alpha testing, Firebird is easily the most stable, full-featured, open source RDBMS out there.  The Firebird Book does a good, solid job of making that engine accessible.   5 out of 5.</span>

                    <span>A well written and thorough reference on Firebird. The book covers everything from installation, through queries and SQL, through management and into security. Illustrations are used sparingly, and code fragments are not excessively long. I rated it four out of five because I think the layout could have been tightened up to reduce the page count and to organize it a bit more effectively.</span>

                    <span>In the field of open source, there are only a few major relational databases - MySQL, Postgres and Firebird. MySQL has been garnering prominent wins recently, whereas Firebird has been steadily chugging along with relatively little publicity. But the book shows that if you are considering a free database, you should seriously look at Firebird. The book describes a very highly fleshed out database, that supports much standard SQL querying. Plus Firebird has had stored procedures and foreign keys for some time. The book goes into detail on these. Whereas MySQL has only its latest version incorporating them. Not as mature as Firebird's.
<br />
<br />The core of the book is its Part 5, with several chapters talking about Firebird's SQL variant. The good news is that you should recognise much of it already. Much of your previous SQL experience should carry over to Firebird. Preserves your productivity if you migrate.</span>
