                <span id="Label1">Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel's wrenching attempt to find meaning in the horror of the Holocaust is technically a novel, but it's based so closely on his own experiences in Birkenau, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald that it's generally--and not inaccurately--read as an autobiography. Like Wiesel himself, the protagonist of <i>Night</i> is a scholarly, pious teenager racked with guilt at having survived the genocidal campaign that consumed his family. His memories of the nightmare world of the death camps present him with an intolerable question: how can the God he once so fervently believed in have allowed these monstrous events to occur? There are no easy answers in this harrowing book, which probes life's essential riddles with the lucid anguish only great literature achieves. It marks the crucial first step in Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died.  </span>

                    <span>God bless Elie Weisel, the author of "Night," for sharing with others a sense of what it was like to try to exist behind barbed wire in a Nazi concentration camp.  Such unconscionable inhumanity should, in of itself, confirm the notion that "Evil" does exist in the world, and can rear its head if given the opportunity to do so & not resisted.  How many times must this lesson be learned?  Cambodia, Rwanda---to lesser extents in Iraq (mass graves of 100s of thousands of Saddams victims), Bosnia, and now in Sudan.  It's not the possibility of "evil" that is our problem though.  It is our unwillingness to recognize it swiftly enough so that we may be able to do something about it in time.  With Sudan look how the world continues to give that government the benefit of the doubt as thousands are exterminated---with only Colin Powell & President Bush calling it what it is: genocide.  Yet the world....papered over reports of Lenin & Stalin's butchery until such dirty deeds were completed by said dictators;  looked the other way in Cambodia; ignored Rwandans; and stood up for Saddam Hussein even after 17 United Nations' Resolutions declaring him in breech of international law.  Mass murder by brutal regimes may be impossible to prevent in all cases, but we sure can try our best therein & books such as Mr. Weisel's---showing the face of evil, so we can better recognize it for what it is---are must reading, consequently.  I'm heartened that many teenage students are exposed to this book in schools across the USA annually; for only through education can people become men & women "of the world", intellectually speaking; and only by becoming such can come "to conceive of minds of men markedly different from themselves"---ie., ones instilled by evil.  The words are Soviet historian Robert Conquest's, one of the few lonely voices who sought to enlighten the world vis-a-vis Stalin's murderous behavior, when liberal and leftist's excused such away with the notion that "one has to break a few eggs to make an omelette"---the idea that building socialist ends outweighed treating humans as living/feeling beings.  That's why Elie Weisel so often speaks publicly that to forget what happened in Nazi Germany is not going to help us prevent incarnations of such behavior from occurring in the future.  We are not lving up to his admonitions, of course, but---thankfully, we are beginning to make some headway of late (Mr. Weisel himself supporting President Bush's confrontation with Saddam Hussein.)   Having just read "Saddam: King of Terror" by Con Coughlin---how Iraqis (by the tens/hundreds of thosands) were tortured by being lowered into boiling water and/or acid, amongst other unspeakable methods short of a bullet to the head for saying "Boo", Mr. Weisel's book/experience/words remain ever relevent still.  P.S. I listened to the audio version of "Night" and hearing such words that make up this book were perhaps more moving than had I re-read them (having first read the book some years back).  Hence, I offer up the suggestion of considering the audio edition of this book as an alternitive to the bound version. (05Feb) Cheers!  </span>

                    <span>I have just currently read Night by Elie Wiesel, The book is a sterotypical WW2 novel, yet the book's imagery is quite impressive. Elie used his first person experience as an advantage in this novel. I found it hard to start the book though. It started off slow and straight forward. Later in the book I started to form an interest. One Negitive about the book is the way it starts (not to repeat my self), It starts off in the middle of the beginning, You never really got to find out anything about his past or back ground. </span>

                    <span>     I thought that the book Night was really good.  The author, Elie Wiesel, told his story so well that I could picture everything in my mind while I was reading.  I'm glad I read this book because it was about the Holocaust and I have learned about the Holocaust, so it was interesting to read.
<br />     The book is a true story about the author, Elie Wiesel, and his life before the Holocaust and in the Concentration Camps.  He was thirteen years old living in Sighet, Transylvania when the Hungarian police set up two ghettos for the Jews.  Elie and his mother, father, and two sisters were in the last group to be taken from the ghetto to the concentration camps.  Elie describes his train trip and what he sees at Auschwitz.  When they arrived at Auschwitz, Elie and his father were separated from his mother and sisters.  After that you heard nothing more of the mother and sisters.  Elie and his father spent two years at Auschwitz then went to Buchenwald.  He was at Buchenwald until it was liberated.
<br />     The book is very good, but I wouldn't recommend it if you get grossed out or upset easily because there is a lot of detail in the book.  If you like history and you don't get grossed out or upset easily, then I would recommend this book.  If you read this book there is a second book called, Dawn that you should also read.

                    <span>"Night" is the remarkable work of Elie Wiesel that gained him notoriety as a writer and caused him to win the Noble Peace Prize in 1986.  Originally, the book had difficulty finding a pulisher as it was found to be too depressing.  Depressing as it may be, there is nothing about the Holocaust that is not depressing.  It is reality.
<br />
<br />In "Night", Wiesel recalls the numerous locations that he endured as a Jew in World War II Europe.  After being forced from his home to the ghetto, he was transferred to several different concentration camps.  It was at the first camp that he saw his mother and sister for the last time.  However, he was able to stay with his father through most of his relocation.  His father only passed away near the end of the war, just a short period before the Jews were liberated.
<br />
<br />What strikes me about "Night" is the stark, cold reality presented by Wiesel.  I could almost feel that cold with Wiesel as he shivers through the cold night.  The physical and mental pain he felt was authentic, though he grew calloused as time passed.  The emotions expressed by Wiesel are also very authentic.  Even to this day, he still feels abandoned by God.  How could an all powerful God allow this to happen to his people?  While it is difficult for me to empathize with his anger toward God, I can certainly understand his rationale. </span>

                    <span>Elie Wiesel's autobiographical account of his life in the Nazi concentration camps, titled "Night," is wonderfully written.  Wiesel's use of imagery among other literary techniques is used adeptly, and in general, I was able to easily comprehend what he was trying to convey.  There were few exceptions to this, though with a little brain power, most anyone could realize what he meant.
<br />
<br />The book's mood is quite sad and depressing, but how else would you be able to tell about life in a Nazi concentration camp?  The Holocaust was a sad and depressing event, and Wiesel's emphasis on that is to show the realism of the events.  Of course there was to be death.  There were 6 million deaths, so if you are one to want to remain ignorant to these facts, then I do not suggest you read this.  However, if you want to see how terrible these events truly were, then reading this book would be a good start.
<br />
<br />Also, Wiesel's writing of this book in first-person also emphasis the hardships he and those around him endured.  When he wrote about the hunger he and the others endured, I was able to feel it as well.  When he wrote of the losses he experienced, both physically and emotionally, I was also able to feel that.  
<br />
<br />To conclude, I must say that this book was very moving for me, and that those who decide to read it (which I would highly recommend) should be aware that there is no happy ending, and that at that point in his life, there was no happiness.</span>
