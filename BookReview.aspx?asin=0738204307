                <span id="Label1">How to thrive in an age of information overload by learning to do more of what matters and less of what doesn't. Drawing from a study of over 2,500 people in 460 companies, Simplicity has been hailed as " a breakthrough in the design of understanding," a book that "outlines the future of leadership." It's a powerful guide to working smarter, not harder, and, in the process, creating more flexible and productive organizations, more compelling experiences for customers, and more fulfilling work for everyone.  <P>"Jensen's observations about today's business world are dead on, and his core message is simple to understand. From the first page of the book, Jensen reveals that his 'Simplicity Manifesto' is rooted in a keen observation of the price we have all been paying for trying to thread efficiency onto chaos via management-by-nuancing-around." -Tom Brown, Across the Board</span>

                    <span>Let's start with ourselves: Throw out the reviews that say the author walks on water. Throw out the negative reviews that expected the author to solve all their problems, or deal with a complex subject in too-few pages. <P>Jensen delivers extremely well within the limitations of what a book can do. In the first section he details the challenge of choice- and info-overload in ways that bring it home to our own behaviors. He holds each of us accountable for our own solutions. <P>Then he delivers the tools for those solutions. I can personally vouch for the fact that his approach to behavioral communication, storytelling, listening, and working backwards from people's needs have truly changed how my team interacts. Once we understood the power of clarity through use of the tools, we took on the accountability. This book didn't change our entire world. Just a valuable portion of how we try to work smarter and faster.<P>For me, whenever a book can help me do that, it's awesome.</span>

                    <span>This book is must-reading for anyone who needs to make sense of everything coming at them at warp speed. If you're an employee or free agent, you'll find the tools you'll need to cut through day-to-day clutter. If you're a leader, ignore this book at your own peril. Jensen shows how storytelling, conversations and making connections for people are critical, and how the future of companies will look like the Net -- leaders will have to build tools and structures for business units of one...the individual.<P>I've already gotten over a dozen copies for the team leaders I work with. It's that helpful! Bonus: For me, the design is a big plus too. One-page summaries. "Simple Notes," "Getting Started" tips and large type emphasizing key points and people's quotes.</span>

                    <span>the book is intriguing at the beginning, laying down some good thoughts on how the corporate world became too complex.<BR>Then it gets into a overlong description of technicality of his "simplification" processes that to me it looks very complex. So I basically started skimming the book starting from page 100 on...<BR>Bottom line: good first 100 pages, rest not good. This is my opinion</span>

                    <span>I had great optomism when I picked up this book, caring much about simplicity at work and in product design. However I found this book did not live up to the title - the page layout and design is complex, heavy on semi-relevant, but not great, quotes and anecdotes from people other than the author. The book generates a great deal of models, buzzwords, and processes, that could be beneficial, but are definitely not simple to follow, or to put into practice. The study mentioned in the book, which might be great, is impossible to find on the website (http://www.simplerwork.com - claims the section is under construction).</span>

                    <span>This is two reviews, really. One for Simplicity, the other for the author's new book, Work 2.0. Another confession: I don't expect a book to solve all my needs. If I get one major or useful "aha!" (as the author calls it), then the book is worthwhile.<P>In Simplicity, he focuses on the basics of cutting through the clutter. I've had lots of experience in all sorts of communication and coaching tools and workshops, and nowhere have I found such useful guidance as Simplicity about what to do when there's too much communication, too much information. The hapters on behavioral communication and "hitting delete" more often are worth the purchase!<P>In Work 2.0, the author goes further. I was excited by his SimplerWork Index. He applies the principles from Simplicity to organizational design, work and tool design. He's setting new standards for what we should consider when envisioning great places to work.<P>The the communication tools in Simplicity, and the new things you'll think about in Work 2.0 make this pair of books a very worthwhile investment.</span>
