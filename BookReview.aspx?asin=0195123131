                <span id="Label1">Let a general Reference Librarian at the Library of Congress show you the best ways to find the information you need.  <P>With all the changes in information storage and retrieval, anyone doing research today may feel unsure of the most efficient ways to use the library. Through clear explanations of nine fundamental methods of searching, Thomas Mann provides an overview of little known but powerful strategies used by librarians and information specialists.  These techniques can be applied profitably to almost any area of research, from discovering business records or government documents to unearthing manuscripts in archives or finding genealogical Web sites on line. Chapters explain how to take advantage of controlled vocabularies, browse library shelves systematically, construct keyword searches, use published bibliographies, and even make personal contacts with knowledgeable people. Throughout, Mann enlivens his advice with real world examples, positing along the way some energetic and reasoned arguments against those theorists who have prematurely announced the demise of print. Against the trendy but mistaken assumption that "everything" can be found on the Internet, Mann asserts the lasting value of physical libraries and time tested research strategies, while acknowledging the complementary applications of computer technology. All formats--including books, journals, newspapers, microforms, audiovisual materials, primary documents, bibliographic databases, and digital libraries on the World Wide Web--are considered for their unique advantages, as well as for their limitations.  <P>Required reading for students, scholars, information seeking professionals, and laypersons, The Oxford Guide to Library Research offers a rich, inclusive overview of the field, one that can save its readers countless hours in the search for information.</span>

                    <span>Outstanding work with clear illustrations and examples of how to improve your library research. I learned more about library research in this book than in all my years pursuing a doctorate degree. <P>A MUST have for anyone who spends time in the library. You do not have to be a professional researcher or academician to get useful tools from this book. My kids have read the book as well, and their research projects for school improved dramatically. <P>I strongly recommend this book is you plan any research projects in the future.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Mann shows that he has extensive knowledge when it comes to the subject of library research in this book, i.e., The Oxford Guide to Library Research by Thomas Mann. The table of contents is well developed and is easy to use. The preface is very well written and is written in a very scholarly, yet entertaining tone. However, as the chapters progress, one gets the feeling that he, i.e., Dr Mann did not intend this to be so much a novel as a reference work that is meant to be used occasionally if one has a question on a certain topic, e.g., locating material in other libraries or computer searches: types of sources Dr. Mann has also added a surprisingly well developed appendix and the index is one of the better ones created. The only downside is that his writing style gets to be a bit tedious at times; then again this book was not meant to be read from cover to cover, so therefore it serves its purpose well, i.e., that of being The Oxford Guide to Library Research by Thomas Mann.</span>

                    <span>This is a terrific book for anyone interested in books and finding information. The author works at the Library of Congress, and has extensive experience looking for information of all kinds. he uses both print and electronic sources, and both to great advantage. His tips on using ordinary sources are exceptional; for example, did you know that the AMERICANA often prints important American speeches in their entirety? If you are a book lover, this is a useful guide, which you will use for a long time.</span>
