                <span id="Label1"><P> <B>A riveting new Temperance Brennan forensic thriller from Kathy Reichs, the internationally acclaimed forensic anthropologist and <I>New York Times</I> bestselling author...</B> <P><BR> Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist for both North Carolina and Quebec, has come from Charlotte to Montreal during the bleak days of December to testify as an expert witness at a murder trial.  <P> She should be going over her notes, but instead she's digging in the basement of a pizza parlor. Not fun. Freezing cold. Crawling rats. And now, the skeletonized remains of three young women. How did they get there? When did they die? <P> Homicide detective Luc Claudel, never Tempe's greatest fan, believes the bones are historic. Not his case, not his concern. The pizza parlor owner found nineteenth-century buttons in the cellar with the skeletons. Claudel takes them as an indicator of the bones' antiquity. <P>  But something doesn't make sense. Tempe examines the bones in her lab and establishes approximate age with Carbon 14. Further study of tooth enamel tells her where the women were born. If she's right, Claudel has three recent murders on his hands. Definitely his case. <P> Detective Andrew Ryan, meanwhile, is acting mysteriously. What are those private phone calls he takes in the other room, and why does he suddenly disappear just when Tempe is beginning to hope he might be a permanent part of her life? Looks like more lonely nights for Tempe and Birdie, her cat. <P> As Tempe searches for answers in both her personal and professional lives, she finds herself drawn deep into a web of evil from which there may be no escape. Women have disappeared, never to return....Tempe may be next. <P> With its powerful mix of nail-biting suspense and cutting-edge forensic science, <I>Monday Mourning</I> is the best yet from this superbly gifted, megastar author who, as <I>New York Newsday</I> says, is "the real thing."</span>

                    <span>This is my First Reichs novel, I typically don't care for female authors (don't ask why I guess I'm just a Macho kind of guy) but this is a gripping story from Ms. Reichs, plenty of twists in the tale! and the paceing is perfect, leading the reader steadily onwards, but never at the cost of those all-important passages or chapters which show the struggle to get to grips with the problems faced by Tempe Brennan, the Forensic Anthropologist for the province of Quebec. Explanations of the more complex scientific examinations are neatly woven into the on-going story, and Ms Reichs pays the reader the compliment of not feeling duty bound to lead them by the hand. Now I'll have to go back and read the others in the series! I do have to recommend one other book: "A TOURIST IN THE YUCATAN" By Brumfield, Some rough edges but overall a great thriller!</span>

                    <span>While not quite as well executed (I thought) as "Grave Secrets," "Monday Mourning" was, nevertheless, an absorbing read; and once the pace picked up, about a third way into the book, an absolutely riveting read.<P>Initially forensic anthropologist, Temperance Brennan, thought that the only big thing she would have to do this trip back to Montreal would be to testify at the trial of a murderer. But that was before she got involved with the grizzly finds in the basement of a pizza parlour. The skeletal remains of three young girls have been found, and the questions are: how old are these remains, and how did they end up in the cellar? The detective in charge of the investigation, Luc Claudel, believes that because the building is quite old, that the remains are probably from the early part of the twentieth century, and as such a problem for archaeologists and historians. But Tempe disagrees: instinct (plus a feeling of antipathy for Claudel and his quick rush to judgement, together with the deep belief that proper examinations on the skeletons should be carried out before any quick decisions are made) tells her that the remains are not all that old. And then she receives a mysterious 'phone call from an old woman who claims to know something about the skeletons. Unfortunately, a bad connection prevents Tempe from learning anything concrete from this mysterious caller. Was the call a prank, or did the woman really have valueable information? Frustrated by the lack of police interest, and prodded on by her visiting friend, Anne, Tempe begins to do some investigating of her own and finds herself face to face with evil that she's never quite experienced before...<P>The story was an interesting and riveting one, and I did feel compelled to finish the book in one sitting. Fortunately the prose style was smooth, if a little spartan (and if I found the lecturer-like tones whenever Tempe or another one of the forensic team was explaining some procedure a little grating, that was just me); so that in spite of the fact that I found the whole subplot involving Tempe's friend, Anne, a bit distracting (ditto the entire subplot involving Andrew Ryan), "Monday Mourning" was still an absorbing read. I did however find that some things were tied up a little too neatly and not very credibly for me anyway -- why the murderer moved one set of remains for example, and why Tempe, not the police, was perceived of as an important threat from the very beginning. But perhaps this last "niggle" has more to do with fact that I'm not all that familiar with the series, and perhaps it is a well known fact that Tempe, not the police, is a force to be reckoned with? Whatever the case, if you're looking for a somewhat swiftly paced and interesting read, than "Monday Mourning" will definitely do. It may not be the best Tempe Brennan book, but it is up that with the better installments in the series.</span>

                    <span>I have been a fan of Kathy Reichs since I read her first book, Deja Dead in 1997. Her stories have gotten better in the intervening years....more depth to her characters, including Tempe, more depth to her stories, great plot lines, and a steady pace that keeps the reader hanging on. I agree with other reviewers that Monday Mourning is her strongest work yet....but all of her books are worth reading.<P>Tempe is in Montreal to testify in a murder case (what else). While she is there, she is called to investigate three skeletons discovered in the basement of a small pizza parlor. Upon first impressions there is some thought that the bodies are "historical", and this is supported when 19th century evidence is discovered near the remains. However, Tempe isn't convinced. She carbon dates the remains and discovers that they day to the 1980's confirming her fears.<P>As background we discover that Tempe's love life isn't going well. Her significant other isn't giving her the attention she needs. Further, her male co-workers continue to take her and her contributions to police work lightly.<P>Suffice it to say that the reader is in store for another wonderful ride through fictional police work. A tight story with great characters, Monday Mourning is sure to make you a Reichs fan if you're not already there.</span>

                    <span>Tempe Brennan has left the sunny, warm clime of the Carolines for the freezing sleet and snow of Montreal. She has been called back to Montreal to testify in a trial. Tempe is a forensic anthropologist and has license to work in the US and Montreal. She speaks French fluently and has a CV to be admired. She is an enigma: an intelligent, professional woman who wears a surgeon's suit and robe while completing her delicate work in a morgue, and then a warm, womanly persona, dressed in the latest fashion with scent to match, cooking a gourmet meal for the man she loves. She is my kind of woman! <P>Kathy Reich's, the author is also a forensic anthropologist and works for the US and Canada. She knows of what she speaks, and she has a marvelous eye for detail and an explicit imagination.<P>Tempe Brennan is reading her notes for the trial when she is called by, Luc Claudel, Chief of Montreal Detectives in Homicide to a murder scene in a basement of a pizza parlor. Luc Claudel, I believe is very attracted to Tempe, and to hide his rude and crude behavior towards her tends to turn her off and get her blood boiling! At the scene Tempe ropes off the area, digs patiently and after many hours finds the skeletons of what she believes are young woman- three in fact. Because an old button found at the scene Luc Claudel believes that this is a murder scene from the early 1900's. Tempe is certain that this murder scene is from the 1980's So, begins the battle for what is correct and true. Tempe is drawn into this murder scene, her life is threatened, and she must work diligently for what she believes is right.<P>Tempe has had an off and on romance with Andy Ryan, a Montreal detective in the Homicide Division. She and Andy became closer when he visited her in the Carolinas, but since she has arrived in Montreal something is off. He has distanced himself and is called away frequently without any explanation. Tempe is concerned and hurt. How will this romance survive, if they cannot discuss what is going on?<P>Kathy Reich's book "Mourning" is a page turner. She is able to introduce the human element so well that we care about her characters. We want them to be happy, to win their cases, to battle for justice and above all for truth and love. Tempe Brennan fulfills the role of a modern, professional woman- brilliant in her job and warm and caring as a woman in love. She will outwit Luc Claudel in the coming series, I predict, and she will win him over. After all, she is my kind of woman! prisrob</span>

                    <span>I admit that I have struggled with Kathy Reichs in the past. I know others have rated her highly and compared her to Patricia Cornwell, but I failed to see any comparison.<BR>Reichs' failings, I felt, lay in her plotting and dialogue. Her characters always seemed very one-dimensional and uninviting, even though she had come up with some promising storylines. Reichs' previous efforts have, to me at least, been very artificial and amateur, clunky and awkward.<P>However, with Monday Mourning Reichs has transformed herself. Her characters suddenly have depth and believability; better, their dialogue has become life-like as the author has discovered (or uncovered) her ability to write funny, sardonic, sarcastic and sometimes ironic lines for her characters to deliver. Suddenly, I found that I laughed out loud at odd points when reading. Not real belly laughs as you get with Tom Sharrpe, but nonetheless some very witty moments to be enjoyed.<P>The plot is good. It is almost beleivable (I'm still not totally convinced about forensic anthropologists being called in so early in investigations) and we can see why the heroine, Brennan, has been involved. We see her struggle with the sheer evil that confronts her in this book. Indeed, the evil that is the main story in the book will take your breath away when it's uncovered.<P>So, all in all, a much improved writer showing some real skill at last.</span>
