                    <span>Tomorrow is Another Country is the sequel to the Mind of South Africa.  It described the transition from apartheid state to the Rainbow Nation.  Allister Sparks is a South African journalist (and is currently teaching at Duke University) who sought to get "the real story" before the actors started to forget.  He found collaboration from all sides so everyone would know the sacrifices made by both sides to form the new South Africa.<p>An excellent balance between being comprehensive and being readable, Tomorrow is Another Country is not a difficult read but not nearly as inspiring as Nelson Mandela's book, Long Walk to Freedom.  It does however capture more of the Afrikaaner experience, something Long Walk to Freedom often fails on doing.</span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding book with many original and personal accounts of what brought South Africa to a negotiated abandonment of minority rule. Objective and beautifully written.</span>

                    <span>An excellent read if you know at least a little about South African History. It's a "who's who" of the inside story of Africa's "Negotiated Revolution" and could count as a "cliff  hanger" if we all didn't already know the outcome of the story. But  for anyone who would like to know how the worlds most remarkable political  transition was pulled off without a bloody coup, who all of the players  were, and why one the worlds most brutal and racist governments kept the  world's most enigmatic man alive; then this is the read for you.</span>

                    <span>Allister Sparks tells a story in a brief, a reporter kind of a way, where he leaves out the details and gives you the key facts plus an explanation of them. By the time you finish the book you'll get a picture of the past and present of South Africa. You'll probably be clued in as much as people who leave there.</span>
