                    <span>FYI, when using the code in Chapter 8-4, "8.4 Ping an IP Address", all seems well and you get the different ping times in your console window. However, I referenced the dll provided in the sample code in a fresh application, and used it to ping ONE ip address several times (which was a machine on my same network segment sitting about 3 feet from me) and I got the SAME EXACT responses as the sample app did, which "SUPPOSEDLY" was pinging yahoo.com, SETI.com, and the local loopback address. In fact, no matter what ip addresses I tried to ping, the ping times were always the same approximate numbers. I would say that the only explanation for this is that the generation of the numbers is hard-coded into the dll, rather than being actual ping times. I would love to hear the explanation for this...</span>

                    <span>There just seems to be so much to learn with VB.NET and the .NET Framework to do things you've always done in VB or VBScript or any other language.  Sure, you could go search for it, but just pick up this book.  It'll save you hours and hours of hassle!  This has been my most valuable book.  Buy now!</span>

                    <span>This book is essentially a roughly-categorized list of neat things you can do with VB.NET.  Most of the tasks are ones you would think of and could figure out, but maybe have to struggle through the helpfiles and language reference in order to determine how to do it.<p>Not so if you own this book.  Simply look up a topic it covers, and not only will it present the solution in general terms in plain, easy-to-understand, concise English, but it generally provides easy-to-apply sample code.<p>This book is an essential reference for any VB.NET programmer and I only wish that the "cookbook" format was used for other languages (Java, C++, C#, or .NET in general).</span>

                    <span>If you have been VB Developing for a while, then you probably know know Macdonald's name by now.  Well, his book is really cool and typical of Matt's work.  The book is geared toward mid level developers, but I think beginning developers will save themselves a lot of 'learning curve' time by reading it, and advanced developers will certainly appreciate many of the concepts he puts forth.  There are many things that in it that are every day tasks, but I totally disagree with the reviewer that said there's not much new in this book.  As far as a cookbook goes, there is going to be some common stuff in it.  That's what it's all about.   There are many tasks that most every program entails.  But Matt has some great implementations and there is a ton of stuff that I really doubt every developer already knows.  I've recommended this book to two of my friends, and while they are both C# developers, they both really liked it.  Go ahead and pick up a copy, you'll like it.</span>
