                    <span>I personally liked the first one better because it introduced Harry to the magical world and all the good stuff that there is.  But this is definately a good continuation from the first adventure he had.  Kind of scary though, when you're trying to guess who or what is the voice...</span>

                    <span>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an amazing film. This sequel is even better.
<br />
<br />This film is not only funnier, and more fun than the first, it is much darker, and full of suspense and action.
<br />
<br />Any Harry Potter fans should see this.</span>

                    <span>This movie was more satisfying than the first Harry Potter film,
<br />which I didn't like very much. The story was better and darker,and the acting done by the kids was more realistic. The only thing about this movie that was bad, was that it carried some of the same problems that ruined the first movie, like the movie being too close to the book, and not enough suprises. But overall a more enjoyable expreience.</span>

<br />Pass on this and you'll regret it!

                    </div>
                    <span>The first movie "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" made a bucket load of cash for Warner Bros. and established itself as an even bigger franchise for motion pictures than the series of books had for the world of literature. A mere twelve months later and the whole gang came back for more of the same brand of excitement and childlike wonder that made the first movie such a treat.
<br />Amidst word that the cast may call it quits after the third movie and the sad passing of actor Richard Harris, the supercharging "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" proved that you just cannot keep a good  pre-adolescent student wizard down. 
<br />The first installment of the series suffered from the necessary need to set up the backstory and introduce the characters. It's much the same problem that hampered the recent adaptation of "Spiderman." The second chapter in the Potter series therefore is able to jump straight into the action, and action is something the movie certainly provides from a nerve wrenching, white knuckle quidditch game to a battle royal at the end between Harry and a giant monster, this movie never seems to stop moving.
<br />Yes, the truth be told "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is a far superior movie to its earlier incarnation. I have never read the books, but one can only guess that J.K. Rowling's confidence and skill had markedly improved following the success of her first novel. This adventure really seems to have some solid plotting behind it, with not only an intriguing and compelling mystery but also a more sinister and satisfying villain. 
<br />Of course the true villain of the piece is not unmasked until the final reel, along the way we are dealt with the standard red herrings and the impossible bumbling Kenneth Branagh who seems to have a lot of fun playing  with his quasi-celebrity status.
<br />Across campus the students (and some of the animals) of Hogwart's are turning up petrified.  Among the suspects at the school is Harry himself and the faculty fear that an unspeakable terror may have returned to the school after a 50-year absence,</span>
