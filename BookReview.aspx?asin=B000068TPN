                    <span>We Were Soldiers released in 2002 is based on the factual events that occurred in Vietnam in 1965. The writer/director Randall Wallace captures all sides of war in this movie. Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Colonel Hal Moore who is in charge of 395 U.S. Air Calvary men who are being shipped to Vietnam. He is the leader of the 7th Calvary, the same Calvary number as Custard. Madeline Stowe plays his wife who has to face her own challenges while he is out to war. This film is based in Vietnam where these men are involved in a new type of war involving helicopters. It illustrates what the U.S. Air Calvary, the Vietnamese Army, and what these soldiers' wives are going through during this battle. This movie shows Lt. Colonel Hal Moore as a father figure who has much religious faith. <P>The U.S. Air Calvary must go against all odds of being outnumbered by the Vietnam soldiers. This movie was very intense and focused as much on the individuals in the battle as the battle itself. It portrays the courage that all of these characters had. Madeline Stowe had the horrendous task of informing the soldiers' wives of their death. She knew that her own telegram could be coming, but she still went on day after day delivering them. This movie even had a group of men lost, against all odds they found ways to survive surrounded by enemies. <P>This movie was very graphic and would not be recommended for young viewers. It would make any person want to go out and join the army. These soldiers were faced with many odds and like many times the government doesn't want to let on how intense things really were over there when this battle was happening.</span>

                    <span>'We Were Soldiers' is one of the most moving and meaningful war films ever made. Unlike 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' brings you inside the war to the people. You really get to know the soldiers, you really feel for them. Randall Wallace brilliantly combines the two most important aspects of the Vietnam; the battlefield and the families at home. Many films try to do this, not many succeed. Wallace does this by dedicating the first 40+ minutes to the familiarization of the characters and families. While the battle is raging, Wallace frequently flashes back to the army base where the wives are faced with the difficult task of distributing death notices.<P>Mel Gibson puts forth a brilliant and moving performance as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore. Gibson masters this role. We can be sure that his portrayal of Moore is accurate because he worked with the real Hal Moore while filming. He became Moore, right down to the way he walked! Madeleine Stowe also puts forth an impressive and emotionally driven performance as Gibson's/Moore's wife, Julie Moore. I heard that she too worked with the real Julie Moore to help herself master the role.<P>The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic and haunting. I've never seen anything like it. I must mention one particularly haunting scene;<BR>The boys are lying in the bush at night with their guns aimed into the darkness before them. Two terrified soldiers begin to whisper to each other; where's the enemy? "I can smell them, they're here" proclaims one. They can't see anything. It's pitch black. The soldiers can barely breath. One whispers into his radio for a flare to be thrown into the woods in front of them so that they might see where their enemy is at. The flare come, the woods light up. The silhouettes of the Vietnamese appear. They are only inches from where they lay.<P>This is only one of the many haunting and unforgettable moments in 'We Were Soldiers'. It took my breath away.<P>'We Were Soldiers' is such an emotional film! I found myself sobbing by the time the credits were rolling. I wasn't the only one, either. Grown men were crying as well. We cried for the lost lives and the pain. We cried for the families and the sacrifices our boys made. This film really helped me to understand what happened in Vietnam and how it affected the families and those who lived through it. I honor them.</span>

                    <span>It is highly disappointing to watch Mel Gibson giving his high credibility (Patriot; Braveheart) as humanistic actor in this cheap propaganda. There is nothing in the movie but (a) 45 minutes of wasting time before going to Vietnam and (b) 90 minutes of violent extremist Vietnamese wanting to humiliate the west (by liberating their country??) challenged by few American heroes. <BR>Opposite to 1800 Vietnamese, there were almost 360 Americans, supported by artillery, helicopters and extensive use of Napalm bombs by jet fighters. What is heroic on this? Why making a movie about it? Are we back to the 50's to celebrate American heroism of WWII?<BR>Am glad that I saw the film on cable and did not specifically pay for it; the film is very boring, repeated and vague.</span>

                    <span>the war scenes are outstanding, but the scenes with the women getting the cards were too sappy. dvd has good extras. the irish song was kind of strange at first, but it and the rest of the music was very good.</span>

                    <span>This is a really great movie. The war scenes were great as well as the acting. My heart really went out to the wives of the men when they started receiving the messages that their loved one had passed on. I recommend anybody to see this movie. I won't forget this movie for a long time to come.</span>
