                    <span>This book is made awesome by the recollections by its author, Eric Nisenson.  To read the excerpts  from Nisenson's interactions with Miles gives the book a closeness that is only attainable by personal experiences.  The reader is drawn to it, the riveting detail transforms the words into a vivid picture in which the reader sees him/herself in Miles' living- room, hearing that classical rasp of his.  Definitely a must read for all those interested in Western music.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book, and tore through it as fast as I could while still reading it carefully.  Author Eric Nisenson is to be commended for the insights he provides into the career and character of Miles Davis.   Nisenson covers his entire career and life, from birth to death, even  though many periods are summed up too quickly, and I was often left wanting  more detail.<p>That said, if I had not read this "updated  edition" of the book, I might not be so full of praise.  Nisenson's  original version of this biography was released in 1982, and this updated  version came out in 1996.  Nisenson adds a Preface, and a few chapters to  the end of the book.  These additions are, to me, the heart of the book.   As I said, Nisenson does a fine job covering Miles's career in the body of  the book, and the author appears to have a greater understanding of the  character and true essence of Miles Davis than anyone else that I've read.   This is definitely the story of Miles Davis through the lens of the  author's experience, and Nisenson knew Davis personally and understands him  well.  However, it was the new material that provided the greatest insights  for me.<p>First, in the new Preface, Nisenson writes about the time that he  knew Miles Davis, when Miles was in "retirement," and when they  were working on this book together (Miles pulled out of the project later  because publishers insisted that he help publicize the book, and he was not  interested in doing so at the time.).  These glimpses into Miles's personal  life and character are revealing.  Most startling to me was the revelation  that Miles Davis had, in Nisenson's words, "beaten and abused women  throughout his life."  Nisenson laments the fact that, despite the  fact that Miles "brutally abused women" was "well known  throughout the jazz community," few, if any, jazz critics or  biographers, have seen fit to mention it.  I give Nisenson a lot of credit  for taking himself to task for not addressing the issue in his original  edition of "'Round About Midnight."  He writes:<p>"But now,  after ther O.J. Simpson affair, I really think it is time to view such  activity for what it is--sick and evil.  I guess when I wrote this book I  still thought of Miles as a friend, but there is really no excuse.  It  amazes me how people like Miles can scream about the evils of  racism--rightly so--and then continually abuse women.  What utter  hypocrisy."<p>Bravo, Mr. Nisenson.  It does not serve anyone well to  deify this musical genius without remembering the "sick and evil"  parts of his character.<p>Nisenson also adds a couple of chapters to the  end of the book.  These were extremely revealing to me.  In the chapter  called "Phoenix," Nisenson provides great insight into the  post-"retirement" phase of Miles's career, the utter absurdity  and banality of which has always perplexed me.  The final chapter, before a  useful abridged discography, addresses the question "who was Miles  Davis" and debunks and deconstructs the oft-repeated myth that he  "changed music four or five times."<p>The reason for the lack of  a fifth star in my rating is due to a two flaws in the book: One, it lacks  detail too much of the time and sums things up to quickly.  This book  should be about twice as long as it is.  And two, there are some mistakes  in the not-detailed-enough documentation of Miles's recording  sessions.<p>Despite these flaws, I strongly recommend the purchase of this  book.</span>

                    <span>If you want the ultimate Miles biography, get the Jack Chambers one. This book, at 300 pages, is sketchy in comparison. It is almost criminally negligent about Miles' music of the 60's and 70's. <p>What makes it worth  reading, however, is Mr. Nisenson's personal memoirs. The preface is called  "Hangin' Out with Daffy Davis". In it, he tells how he went from  idolizing Miles when he was a teenager to a situation where his phone would  ring late at night and he would groan, "Oh no, it's that damned Miles  again!" We've all heard that Miles wasn't a saint; this edition of  Nisenson's portrait confirms it.<p>Despite my earlier comments, Nisenson is  an excellent author and "'Round About Midnight" is a very  enjoyable read. So if you buy all good books on Miles or you'd like to hear  something a little different about him, get it. (After you read it, by the  way, think about the fact that this guy did not rate one mention in Miles'  autobiography.) If you want only one Miles bio, however, it's got to be the  Jack Chambers or the Ian Carr one.</span>
