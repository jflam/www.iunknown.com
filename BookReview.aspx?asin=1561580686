                    <span>This book teaches all the basics of joinery and usually tells how to do everything two ways, with or without power tools. He gives little tips that you would only know if you talked to someone with many years' experience. Great photos. He's got pretty goofy preferences on handsaws though. I've rented this one twice, and still like and need to read it. I'm going to cough up the dough and buy it. Tage Frid is a sharp guy and the book is easy to understand.</span>

                    <span>I recently found myself getting interested in woodworking with the purchase of a new table saw and bought a couple of books, including this title. It's impressive and an extremely good book for a beginner to purchase. <P>The first section (3/4 of the book) shows you not only every way to join two pieces of wood, but shows you how to do each joint with different tools. So if you have a table saw but not a router, you can still make each of the joints. This book also has some great (and very simple) jigs to help get started. The second part is a combination of information about bending wood, finishing, etc. Although not as comprehensive as the first section, it still has some valuable information.<P>Highly recommended to anyone.</span>

                    <span>Tage Frid presents a book that is well organized and insightful. I thought I had a good working knowledge of wood movement and joinery, but Frid offers some points that will help you make furniture that will last generations. The text does contain black and white pictures that can be hard to see, however, if you follow along in the text it will be clear what is being depicted. To address an earlier comment, this is an instruction manual for people interested in the finer points of woodworking and IS NOT a book for "crafty" people who think it would be chic to have a book about woodworking. Frid has been working wood for more than 50 years and his experience and expertise show through in this well written text. If you are interested in making fine pieces of furniture, then this book is a must read!</span>

                    <span>In view of all these rave reviews just a cautionary note. This is a reprint of two c 1980 books when b&w pictures were still acceptable, and the book uses very many. Maybe this will grow on the reader after a while, and there are also some illuminating line-drawings but the initial effect of this volume on the unprepared reader is depressing: all those hard to make out greyish b&w pictures. This is not helped by the fact that many feature an elderly, out of shape gentleman. Definitely not a coffee-table book!</span>

                    <span>Master Tage Frid has put in these books all anyone would ever need to become a very competent woodworker. <P>Although I had been doing a lot of work before, once I got his books my level of confidence went to the stratosphere. I now tackle very complex projects using mostly hand tools without the slightest problem. <P>He not only provides excellent advice but also does so in a manner that is easy to understand and makes a lot of sense. <BR>Best text on general woodworking I've ever seen. And I've read most of them, even the very old ones.</span>
