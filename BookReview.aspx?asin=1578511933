                <span id="Label1">God forbid that doing business and making money on the Internet should bear any resemblance whatsoever to the past millennium of bricks-and-mortar capitalism--that would be too easy.  Nope, it's a whole different ball game now, and the new rule is: adapt or die.  At least that's the message behind <I>Digital Capital</I>.  From the three principal cyberconsultants at the Alliance for Converging Technologies (one of whom, Don Tapscott, authored the bestsellers <I>The Digital Economy</I> and <I>Growing Up Digital</I>), comes a paradigm for global takeover: the business web, or "b-web" for short. In their words, b-webs are "strategically aligned, multi-enterprise partner networks of producers, suppliers, service providers, infrastructure companies, and customers that conduct business communication and transactions via digital channels."  Some examples are eBay, Cisco, Dell, MP3.com... in short, any enterprise that a) knows how to form lateral partnerships with other goods-or-service providers, and b) eliminates the role of planes, trains, and automobiles--not to mention lots of time, money, and human energy--by doing almost everything over the Internet. Not only do the authors provide a wealth of b-web case studies (including Charles Schwab, Priceline.com, Webvan, AT&T Solutions, and OptiMark in addition to those mentioned above), they outline a step by-step process for weaving a b-web of one's own. <p> Too often, <I>Digital Capital</I>'s sound ideas come marinated in think-tank jargon so alienated from plain English as to be nearly impenetrable. Consider: "Disaggregation leads to 'disintermediation' and 'reintermediation'," which, believe it or not, isn't a line that French film theorists use in pick-up bars, but the simple statement that business webs manage to cut out a lot of the traditional steps between producers and customers. Now why couldn't they just have said that?  No matter. After you nibble through the self-important MBA-speak, you'll find a smart look at how online shops are rewiring early 21st-century capitalism. --<I>Timothy Murphy</I> </span>

                    <span>I selected this book from the reading list of my e-commerce class in BUS 240 at California State University, San Jose.  It seemed applicable to today's evolving business environment and relevant to what we have been learning in our MBA program.  I found it to be a very encompassing and well written book.  The authors broke it up into four distinct parts:  Introduction, The New Models of Wealth Creation, The Human and Relationship Elements of Digital Capital, and Strategies for Business Webs.  Each section is nearly capable of standing on its own.  Some are more relevant to this class than others, but all are tied together in a coherent whole.  Depending on who is reading the book, more may be gained from certain sections than from others.  I personally learned something from each section or, at the very least, found myself thinking about the ideas presented in a new light.<p>Following the basic introduction, the book conducts an in depth examination of the five core business models for e-commerce.  Through detailed examples, the reader gains tremendous insight into the theories that drive these models.  This was an engagingly well organized presentation and left me with a firm grasp on how the various models operate.  This is an excellent read for both current and potential managers.<p>The last two sections of the book were disappointing in that they were nowhere near as detailed or informative as the second section.  The examples were minimal and the discussion relatively short.  As I was reading them, I found myself asking for clarification on some points.  Unfortunately, the authors did not provide it in this book.  Not to say that these sections weren't good, because they were quite informative as far as a basic understanding of the concepts.  The depth of coverage, however, left something to be desired.<p>Overall, this was a very good book, for both students and managers alike.  Even managers of companies that have already entered the e-commerce market are likely to find valuable information within its pages.  The business model descriptions and tours through existing companies to illustrate each were invaluable.  However, I think they could have expanded upon the last two sections and given the reader some deeper insight into these concepts.  I also would have liked some real world examples as illustrations.  These sections were so short and the business model section so much longer and expansive, it almost seems as if the title is a bit inappropriate.  Aside from that, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the models and strategies behind companies today?s e-commerce world.</span>
