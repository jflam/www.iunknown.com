                <span id="Label1">For travelers seeking transcendent landscape, rich culture, or a journey to enlightenment, Moon Handbooks Nepal reveals the heart of the secluded Himalayan kingdom, unveiling the many treasures of a land as rich in humanity as it is in natural beauty. Author Kerry Moran provides insight into Nepali culture and life along with fresh coverage of sights and attractions, dining and accommodation options, outdoor adventures that include elephant safaris in the Terai and rafting on the Trisuli, and advice on shopping Kathmandu's bazaars and markets, exploring the Valley's sacred shrines and pleasure gardens, and excursions to undiscovered places. This award-winning guide also devotes an extensive chapter to trekking in the Himalayas, with information on all major trails, newly discovered routes, excellent maps, and tips on planning a trek and finding a guide. Well-written and exceptionally informative, Moon Handbooks Nepal is the ultimate resource for an enriching travel experience to this extraordinary destination.</span>

                    <span>Being a traveller who usually swears by Lonely Planet guides, I have to admit that when it came down to taking one or the other, the Lonely Planet book stayed at home and this one made it into my backpack. It's just plain good. I will be sure to check out other Moon Guides in the future. Their series might soon be alongside my LP and Footprint Guide collections.</span>

                    <span>This may be the best guide book I have ever used. I think I should write Kerry Moran a fan letter for helping me to have an amazing and wonderful time on my six-week trip to Nepal without always feeling like a clueless tourist. This guide is so well written and interesting that I read it cover to cover during the trip-- even the sections about places we weren't planning to go. The cultural descriptions are informative and sensitively written, but not unrealistically rose-colored. The guides to towns and trekking routes give you an accurate and practical idea of what to expect when you get there without being overdetailed or bossy about telling you what do. The Nepali vocabulary and grammar in the appendix really came in handy and Nepalis, even when they could speak English, seemed genuinely pleased that I was trying to speak Nepali. The maps are not especially good, but then even with maps you would still have to ask directions. This is a great guide for anyone whose itenerary is not set in stone and who wants to get some genuine insight into Nepali culture.</span>

                    <span>This may be the best guidebook I've ever used-- I read it cover to cover during my trip, and feel like I ought to write Kerry Moran a fan letter. The advice and information in this book helped me to have an amazing and wonderful experience Nepal without always feeling like a clueless tourist. The descriptions of Nepali culture and customs are sensitively written and indespensible for a mystified first time visitor. The guides for trekking routes and towns are right on the mark but not overdetailed, so you get an accurate idea what to expect without being told exactly what to do. The Nepali vocabulary and grammar in the appendix were very handy and I really had fun trying to speak the language. This book does not have good maps, but I was able to get pretty good maps in Nepal.</span>
