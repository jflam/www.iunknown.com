In <i>Virtual Tibet</i>, Orville Schell, one of the preeminent experts on modern China and Tibet, undertakes a strange and wondrous odyssey into our Tibetan fantasies. He recounts the spellbinding adventures of the Western explorers and spiritualists who for centuries were bent on reaching forbidden Tibet and the holy city of Lhasa. Simultaneously, Schell embarks on a parallel present-day journey from Beastie Boys' "Free Tibet" concerts to a re-creation of Lhasa in the high Argentine Andes -- the extravagant set of <i>Seven Years in Tibet</i>, starring Brad Pitt.<br><br>At once comic and insightful, <i>Virtual Tibet</i> takes us beyond the fantasies to the reality of an isolated country that has repeatedly won the West's adoration, and paid the price for believing that our allegiance is profound.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Orville Schell has written a pretty good book. The basic premise of the book is that anything that Hollywood touches is going to suffer distortion. It's simply a primal fact of the beast. And what a beast it is! Equal parts whore, dreamer, cynical businesman, and hopeless idealist. Schell is very good at examining the strange interaction between Hollywood and the Tibetan exiles. And I think he does it in a not unkind manner.<P>The present Dalai Lama is an enormously attractive figure. He's a wonderful spokesmen for Tibetan Buddhism. His spirituality, sincerity, intelligence, and integrity seem to me to be beyond reproach. However, there is more to Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan history than the present Dalai Lama. <P>Regardless of what you think of the present gang in Beijing, what type of society was Tibet before the Chinese takeover? Schell describes it, more or less, as an oppressive feudalistic theocracy. Tibet as something short of Shangri-la. Schell depicts the old Tibet as being a dark, oppressive, and decidedly filthy place. We can condemn the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the suppression of the Tibetan people without creating fantasies of the old Tibet days. Schell is essentially calling for a realistic view of the historical events. By understanding a bit of the history of the area we may come to a more realistic idea of what needs to be done. The best political solution may be the type of compromise that Schell seems to suggest. This compromise seems to be along the lines of what the Dalai Lama has proposed in recent years.<P>Religion and reason often do not share the same realm. This is a truism that seems to be as valid for some of the adherents of Tibetan Buddhism as well as the followers of Jimmy Swaggert and Jerry Falwell. Buddhism has a wonderful spirtual tradition--as does Christianity and other religions. However, upon what authority do people consider the Tibetan brand of Buddhism to be superior to the SE Asian, the Japanese, etc. versions of Buddhism? The 4 noble truths and the 8 fold path are the same for all the different flavors of Buddhism. The present Dalai Lama's character strikes me as impeccable. But what of the other Tibetan Buddhist religious figures that came to the West in recent decades to proclaim the dharma? It's my understanding that many of them fell victim to the temptations of our modern culture: money, sex, drugs, etc. <P>It's our human nature--as Schell--points out to want to think that there is some magical place or idea that will remove all of our imperfections. I think he is right in saying that Tibet is another geographic and human place with it's own attendent vices and virtues. I am of the opinion that Buddhism, like the more thoughtful and sincere versions of Christianity, is a marvelous vehicle for spirtual growth. But that growth in any religious tradition is achieved only through strong effort and practice as well as sincere devotion to the teachings.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books ever written about the making of a movie. It is up there with Lillian Ross's "Picture:; she was writing about the earnest effort to film "The Red Badge of Courage" with a much-decorated veteran. Schell also writes about the effort to film "Seven Years in Tibet" with many Tibetan exiles, including the sister of the Dalai Lama. Both historical films were commercial and artistic failures, but the fascination of the books is with the industry involved rather than with the product. <BR> <BR> What I find most interesting are the discussions Schell had with Tibetans on location in Argentina. The reader knows that their hopes are not going to be realized. And the author knows that the hopes of American Tibetophiles are not going to be realized. He is impatient with the pretentions of some, particularly (and justifiably!) Steven Seagal. I don't see how anyone can read him as being unsympathetic to the plight of Tibetans, whether they are refugees in diaspora or colonized in Tibet. <BR><BR>While I do not Schell is an apologist for PRC colonialism, his pessimism may foster Chinese goals by making opposition seem futile. In particular, I think that Schell underestimates Tibetans' persistence. The survival and revival of Christianity in the Soviet Union should encourage caution about pulverization. Fifteen years ago, who thought that apartheid could end without a bloodbath or that communists would surrender power in elections in Eastern Europ? Nonetheless, I also think that many Western admirers of Tibetan culture/religion underestimate the will to domination of the colonialist PRC and the need of the illegitimate Chinese communist party to wrap itself in nationalism and spurious claims to any territory ever controlled by any earlier dynasty. <BR><BR> Given Schell's interest in the authenticity of Hollywood representation of Tibet in the 1940s and 50s, it is disappointing that he focused on "Seven Years in Tibet" rather than "Kundun" in which Tibetans are more than glorified extras and in which no blond American movie star is there to distract the viewer. (Schell says that he went for the bigger-budget production because he was interested in Hollywood commodification of Tibet. Probably book-buyers are also more interested in Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, and Steven Seagal, so Schell's decision has its own sound commercial instincts...) <BR><BR> Along with reporting on how Tibet is used and projected onto by movie folks and on the experience of plaster recreations of Lhasa in the Andes, Schell discusses Harrer at length and also runs through earlier Western visitors to "the roof the world" and how their reports were read by seekers of a kingdom of the spirit on earth. This survey may not be rigorous or original, but surely it will introduce this travel literature to many readers.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book that tells how over the years Hollywood has become just as much a propaganda mouthpiece as the Chinese media. Hopefully it will awaken those Western supporters of Tibet from their fantasies and simplistic views of the Tibetan situation.</span>

                    <span>Orville Schell's works have always been exquisite. Written in a crisp style, penetrating in analysis, his books have never failed to breathe life into their subjects and leave the reader more informed than before. Expecting the same tour de force as found in Mandate of Heaven and Discos and Democracy, I was not disappointed with Virtual Tibet: Searching for Shangri-La from the Himalayas to Hollywood. Schell tackles a topic that receives plenty of discussion and fanfare, but has experienced precious little objective study in recent years. Tibet has labored under the political and cultural repression of the People's Republic of China since 1951. Many believe that China is slowly committing cultural genocide through its repression of Tibetan religious and cultural customs and by encouraging vast numbers of Han Chinese to settle in Tibet. With the help of a charismatic Dalai Lama and throngs of Hollywood stars, the Tibetan issue has received a disproportionate amount of attention relative to its importance in world events. Whereas one struggles to find "Free East Timor" bumper stickers on cars, "Free Tibet" stickers are far more ubiquitous. The strong point of Schell's work is his analysis of Hollywood's fascination with Tibet. He interviews many of the most visible promoters of the Tibetan cause and also provides fly-on- the-wall accounts of numerous "Free Tibet" Hollywood functions and the making of the movies Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet. Through his interviews and observations, Schell largely confirms what I have suspected for years. Hollywood's promotion of the Tibetan cause has less to do with its relative merits than it does with the fact that it has become a fashionable issue in which to be associated. The Tibetan cause has become a virtual Rohrsach test in which Hollywood supporters can use to feel better about what ails them spiritually and politically. Schell's works demonstrate an uncanny ability of meeting all the right people and convincing them to reveal their true feelings. Instead of Communist Party officials or Chinese gangsters as in his previous works, Schell is somehow able to elicit revealing quotes from otherwise elusive individuals such as Steven Seagal and Brad Pitt. Although nobody has complained about being misquoted to my knowledge, I hope this reflects Schell's skill as an interviewer. It would be a shame if a writer and journalist of Schell's quality needed to embellish his subject's words for better copy. Schell succeeds in making the subject of Tibetan history more entertaining for the general reader without sacrificing content. Schell's Virtual Tibet is an informative and well-rounded work, lifting much of the mystique from an esoteric, yet prominent subject. While Schell sympathizes with their cause, he is able to remove the veil of motivation from Hollywood's Tibetan supporters. Many readers may have expected Schell to delve deeper into the issues surrounding China and Tibet, but this would have required Schell to tread over already well- traveled terrain. In deciding to leave the debate over the relative merits of Chinese policies toward Tibet aside, Schell has produced an original and thoughtful work of journalism. Schell's portrayal of the main protagonists for the Tibetan cause are unflattering and bound to upset many people. This is the hallmark of a fine journalist.</span>

                    <span>I read this, because I am an Asian Studies major and know who Prof. Schell is. I wrote a Masters Thesis for my MA from Seton Hall in 1982, called Chinese Communism and Its Impact on Tibet. I am basing this review on reading the book and some of the other comments I've seen in the reviews. It is true, we have always had an fascination with Tibet, because of Lost Horizon, Seven Years in Tibet, etc. I cannot see in the book where Prof. Schell played down Chinese heavyhandedness. He also states (rightly so) that no Western Govt. backs the idea of an independent Tibet. They do back the Tibetans not being maltreated. Face it, in the modern world, Tibet does not have the resources to survive as an independent country. If anything, Dr. Schell showed just how silly, many of the Hollywood folks jumping on this bandwagon are. This is just the latest fad for them. Movies about Tibet look great on the silver screen. The same cannot be said for Kosovo, or Sudan. I gave it four stars. Hollywood Tibet would have been a better title. Tinseltown Tibet? I am glad this was written to bring it to the American people. Another drawback with this book is, how many people reading it are just reading it for the stars listed and don't understand ALL the issues. I hope this will spur Americans to read more about China as well. I want to know how far the Hollywood circuit wants to go with this. Are they going to go to Tibet themselves? Be with anti-Chinese fighters. No folks, as much as I respect the Dalai Lama, his best hope for seeing his homeland again in his lifetime is to work out a deal with the Chinese. Religious freedom for dropping independence claims. Yes, there is no more Berlin Wall. Tibet cannot make it on its own. Read the book, and as an American, gain your understanding. Want to help Tibet. Help to educate Hollywood folks in both sides of this issue. Prof. Schell shows, it is more complicated than many would like to think.</span>
