                <span id="Label1">Finding the next Microsoft has been the Holy Grail for many investors. However, anyone who has dabbled in technology stocks can't help but be dismayed at their extreme volatility--it's not unusual for tech stocks to gain or lose 10 to 20 percent in a single day. So how can you win in this market and find the next Cisco, Intel, or Oracle?  The key to winning, says bestselling author Geoffrey Moore, is to play the "gorilla game."<p>  Moore's previous two books,  <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> and  <i>Inside the Tornado</i>, are the bibles for many marketing professionals and product managers. In these books, Moore describes the life cycle common to the successful adoption of technology products and pinpoints moments in the cycle, for example, "the chasm," the "bowling alley," and the "tornado," where products can either flourish or fade away. In <I>The Gorilla Game</I>, Moore takes these concepts, with the help of coauthors Paul Johnson and Tom Kippola, and applies them to the task of finding gorilla stocks--ones that dominate their market niches. The book looks at how the market values technology stocks and provides case studies of markets where gorillas have been born. Moore and his coauthors put their ideas to the test in the final chapter and pick a portfolio of stocks that they believe have the potential to become winners in the gorilla game. The result is a highly perceptive investment guide that anyone who's a fan of Moore's earlier work will find exciting and profitable. This revised edition, published a year and a half after the first, includes a new chapter on valuing Internet stocks. <I>--Harry C. Edwards</I></span>

                    <span>Hindsight is 20/20.  The hindsight that allowed Geoffrey Moore to put a book out on tech investing adidst the high tech bubble is also the hindsight that allows me to pan it, so I can not claim any great wisdom.
<br />
<br />The central concept presented in the Gorilla Game is that winners and losers in the technology industry industry are determined by the 800 pound gorillas.  The first company to become an 800 pound gorilla (Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, etc.) creates a long term sustainable competitive advantage by making platform decisions that favor themselves.  This concept is still very true today.  The companies that drive standards and create barriers to entry are the winners in high tech.
<br />
<br />The challenge here, though, is the stock market has caught up to that idea.  For a short period in the mid-90s, the standard bearers were undervalued.  The pendulum went the other way, and they rapidly became overvalued by the end of the decade.  People who bought into the "I'll be safe with the gorillas" got burned with everyone else when the tech bubble burst.  Following Moore's investing advice would've cost you a lot of money.
<br />
<br />Does this mean the book is worthless?  No...  It will still help you pick relative winners and losers (Microsoft, Cisco and Intel are all still around) and it is good as a management tool.  Unlike other markets where multiple winners can share the spoils (Many companies can make money selling soap) in technology the biggest really does have a huge advantage.</span>

                    <span>Great insight into what makes a Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, or other high-tech monster. Very instructive for spotting trends even if you are not into investing.<p>Sadly funny (in hindsight) closing remarks, however, when mentioning criteria for the gorilla-game theory to work: "...you need equity markets which have... high legal integrity... in the realms of ethics and legal integrity, US markets lead the world in policing their own ranks...". In light of the many recent financial scandals I'm sure the authors will rephrase this in the next edition.</span>

                    <span>The high-tech stock collapse has led to a lot of agonized soul searching from burned investors in the past year.  How in the world did all those dot-com pet stores get funded?  How did Cisco ever get a $500 billion dollar market cap, and how did so many other companies get valued at tens of billions of dollars with no profits and little sales?  <p>Well, one problem was that too many people read this book.  <p>Don't get me wrong--Geoffrey Moore is definitely a heavyweight business thinker.  His earlier books were tremendously helpful in explaining the strange, non-intuitive ways in which high-tech markets work.  But here, he and his coauthors attempt to build on his earlier work to offer a "gorilla investment strategy", which has now become a victim of its own popularity.  *Any* mechanical investment scheme will eventually fail if it becomes too widely used, and  it is easy to find the roots of the investment idiocies of the late nineties in this book.  Just look for emerging high-tech market leaders, he says over and over, with little attention paid to just how much this eventual market dominance might be worth.  Worse, he asserts that you can't know which company will emerge as the dominant player in a given sector, so invest in them all.  Venture capitalists, once they realized how many investors were following this strategy, responded by cranking out unlimited numbers of startups doing exactly the same thing; as long as they were competing in a market that might eventually select a "gorilla", then they could be confident of "flipping" a successful IPO to naive investors.  Anyone who used this book as a basis for investing over the past couple of years would have, in effect, been getting suckered into a Ponzi scheme.    <p>Moore creates a vivid symbolic menagerie to explain the dynamics of high-tech marketing, but any high-tech investor needs to know that in addition to the authors' gorillas, chimpanzees and monkeys there are a lot of dogs.  Also sharks.</span>

                    <span>Having worked on Wall Street in research I can say that this book is a must read for technology investors.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and I believe that, in a very simple manner, the authors lay out the evolution of technology giants within different sectors.  They help you identify the next "800 Lb. Gorilla," which may generate substantial returns for investors.  <p>If there is any weakness it is that very little is provided in terms of how do you value these companies.  Most past "gorillas" came public with very modest valuations but in today's markets many companies are coming out at higher valuations, providing less upside in the long-term.  The reason is that many investors are more astute than in the past and are seeking to find these "gorillas."  Therefore, the problem that lies before the investor is how to find the gorilla before the pros do.  Too many pros and individuals tried to find them in the past 2 years and only got burned (they were all greedy going after the hopes of generating such returns and the possibility that one would be the "800 lb gorilla.")<p>If you want to learn about technology life cycles, product differentiation and what to look for in the next decade's giants I recommend this book but recognize that it provides little in terms of valuation exercises.</span>

                    <span>Everyone has wondered how they could have latched onto a stock that would have turned a few thousand dollars into over a million.  In recent years, EMC, Cisco, and Microsoft provided such opportunities.  Yet few bought and held those stocks to get the full benefit of the ride.  In this book, you will find some ideas for locating the next stocks that could do this for you.  Keep in mind that the odds are long against you though.  A lot of serendipity is involved.<p>A popular pastime for the past 50 years (and possibly before that) has been to look at the stocks that would have made you the most money in the last 10 or 20 years and then to devise an investment approach to find the next ones going forward that will do as well or better. I have lost count of how many books I have read that have taken this approach.<p>I found the Gorilla Game to be refreshingly above the pack in this area. The authors do an excellent job of describing some of the ways that technologies get adopted, when the stocks do well (and when they don't), and when to buy and sell stocks in technology companies. They also devise a fairly detailed, somewhat risk-controlled investment process, and detail how it would have done in a number of case histories. From the backward-looking perspective, the book is solid.<p>The weakness of such backward looking methods shows up in their new material in the revised edition (1999) on the Internet. Although some aspects of their model apply to the Internet, many do not. They are left needing to vaguely explain how so much money was made so quickly in Internet stocks (before they began to plummet to nothing in March 2000). Their explanation is actually pretty solid, but they never quite come out and say that their methodology will not get you all of the fast-growing stocks in technology.  I doubt if any methodology could do that for you.<p>They needed not be defensive. No methodology is perfect. The main weakness of this one is that is designed around semiconductors, software, and computers. The technology patterns can look a lot different in future technologies. For example, what will happen with companies like Gemstar that lead in new television technologies that could disrupt the Internet for direct marketing? The reason this point is important is that the barriers to switching are higher in the technologies studied here than in many other areas. If you get into a low cost of switching sector (like business to consumer marketing on the Internet), you could invest in an industry leader and still lose your shirt. Although the book acknowledges these issues, it probably doesn't create a substantial enough warning. <p>The book is aimed at the medium knowledge investor (about the markets and technology). I hope they bring out a more advanced version. They decided not to go into specialized semiconductors like analog devices where enormous profits may lie in the future, because of concerns about not going over the heads of readers. A lot of the best run technology companies with enormous growth potential in markets with high bariers to competitors were not discussed in this book. I am sure most readers would be willing to spend some time learning about these other markets in order to make enormous gains.<p>Despite my quibbles, this is a fine book that will help all but those who are already quite knowledgeable about technology companies and technology investing. Good luck in capturing those irresistible gains in the future! Perhaps you will be the first person you know to identify the next irresistible growth enterprise that creates over a thousand to one gain!  I hope you do.  <p>May you be that one person in one hundred who outperforms the market over a lifetime.  <p>Otherwise, I suggest you play the odds and buy indexed mutual funds.  John Bogle's book, Common Sense about Mutual Funds, will be very helpful to you in this regard.</span>
