Other key concepts include XML, spreadsheet portals and database interaction. This is my top choice among many other books about Excel.</span>

                    <span>Firstly, I have to tell everybody that I am from China, and I got this this book from a friend of mine.
<br />
<br />Here is a story. Several years ago, when I worked in a network coporation, the CFO, an MBA back from USA, said to us, "If anyone in this coporation can use Excel as skillfully as those guys from ... (a famous consultanting company, who then worked as our consultant) do, I will raise his monthly salary by RMB1,000!" I was confused, "Is Excel so valuable, or, magic? If yes, what can it do for me? It's just a table-maker (and I heard of that it can do some calculations), but I am not an accountant nor an analyst. Well, perhaps I will never be qualified to get that RMB1,000; eventhough I learn it by myself, the sales job makes it unreasonable for me to to get it. Forget it!" 
<br />
<br />Last year, I saw EXCEL BEST PRACTICES FOR BUSINESS accidentally in a friend's home, and then there was no Chinese version of it. Since I thought my English is ok, I took it and had a rough reading. By just looking some titles and figures, I knew I had been totally wrong about Excel! It can do a lot for any business, as long as the business has something, even little, to do with data analysis and statistics! I took the book home and began to read line by line, following every example spreadsheet on the accompanying CD. I found something never heard of before, and I began to know that Excel is really useful to anyone. The book tells me how to get clear human resource information from a sea of data, which is especially helpful for me, to predict "unmeasurable" targets, and to make use of "uneditalbe" data from a PDF document, of course all with Excel. Those examples and tools on the CD are really great, they helped to solve some problems at-hands. The book begins with simple issues, such as cell reference style, which I've never heard of before, and goes as far as some complicated knowledge, such as how to get remote data with Excel 2003's XML capability, which is helping a friend of mine in a big project. So both beginners and experienced users will get benefit from it. Any one wanting to get the most from Excel will found this book is a powerful squeezer.
<br />
<br />Also, I got a satifying after-sale service as another one did. Even though I want to monopolise such a valuable resource, but Best Practices should be shared. This time I am right.</span>

                    <span>Excel Best Practices now sits within arm reach of my desk so I don't have to keep getting up to check it. The tips and examples obviously come from someone who has worked in the field and knows the program thoroughly. I highly recommend getting this book if you work in Excel and want fast answers to "everyday" Excel issues. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations.  It literally sits open on my desk at work for the entire day, allowing me to quickly jump to any page. The examples, `best practice tips', and various notes, are all highly detailed.  Power Excel training courses should be based on this book!
<br />
<br />Excel has a lot of power.  Loren's book shows you how to unleash the power.  This is not a simple how-to book; rather this is a practical book on using Excel in everyday business environments and applications. The tips I have learnt so far have saved me several hours of work each week (no exaggeration). There are a stack of useful utilities and example spreadsheets that come on the accompanying CR-ROM too. The book has shown me how to use Excel as a tool, as opposed to its face value features only.
<br />
<br />The additional surprise I received was the "after sales service".  I had a difficult problem with large data sets that I posted to the web site referred to in the book - http://www.excelbestpractices.com.  Loren himself replied to me.  Several emails between us later, my problem was solved. Loren provided me with a scalable solution that I previously thought could only be solved by using two additional third-party applications in addition to Excel.  Loren showed me that the entire solution could be provided within Excel.  Buy the book!

                    <span>In one year I bought (in succesive order): 
<br />1. John Walkenbach - Excel 2000 Power Programming with VBA
<br />2. Michael Kofler - Definitive Guide to Excel VBA
<br />3. Loren Abdulezer - Excel Best Practice for Business 
<br />
<br />The first two books use a lot of VBA code examples. Loren's Excel Best Practice for Business is a refreshing surprise. Written in simple, easy to understand english in fluent lines that read away as though is was a novel! Once started , I couldn't stop reading untill I finished the whole book.
<br />
<br />Its details are simple, but most effective. The outlined ideas give you a headstart when creating and maintaining Excel files.
<br />
<br />For example, Loren demostrates clearly what pitfalls to escape from when you design any Excel file. It is good that Loren reminds the reader of some old Roman advise ('Divide and Conquer') when recommending to SEPARATE the date into 3 layers: 1) original date, 2) analysis layer and 3) presentation layer) to CONQUER in your work of creating and maintaing Excel files.
<br />
<br />It is funny how, if one looks at his or her own Excel files, this simple device is still broken many times.
<br />
<br />Another example deals with the advantages of the R1C1 workbookstyle compared to the traditional A1 style. It sounds so simple, but yet, in Walkenbach and Kofler you will not find these kind of tips.
<br />
<br />Finally the book has great examples on the CD. Examples on how to use conditional formatting to colour and present your data.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, I can advise anyone to buy this book, whether he or she considers him or herself a novice or expert Excel user. GO GET IT!</span>
