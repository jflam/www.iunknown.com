                    <span>Anyone who has ever read one of my reviews, may notice a theme. The fact that I am 25 years old makes me rely heavily on reading books such as "Hank Aaron and the Home Run that Changed America" in order to comprehend the historical significance of many of the greatest sports moments of the 20th Century.
<br />
<br />Obviously, I was aware of what 715 was (and eventually 755) and what it meant, but it wasn't until reading Tom Stanton's book that I truly could grasp what it meant for the whole country, not just the baseball community. Reading about the turbulent times of America and the racial injustice that was going on in the 1970's during Aaron's pursuit, makes his accomplishment even greater.
<br />
<br />Receiving death threats in the mail, the fear of having one of his children harmed, and being called some of the ugliest names imaginable, were all things that he had to endure the entire time his quest was going on.
<br />
<br />This book is wonderfully written and truly captures the importance of Hank Aaron's record-breaking season. This book is an important part of not only baseball history, but American history as well and should become part of any teacher's curriculum when teaching about civil rights.</span>

                    <span>Barry Bonds may eventually break Hank Aaron's record, but he will never displace him as a hero worthy of a child's adulation. This book is a dramatic and entertaining portrait of a dignified and decent man who overcame great obstacles while dethroning the most mythologized sports legend in American history, Babe Ruth. I thought I knew everything about Aaron's pursuit of the record, but Tom Stanton surprised me over and over again. It's a great read and the perfect antidote for the disappointing news about players on steroids.

                    <span>What makes a legend? Is it their talent? Is it their presence? Must one possess a little of both in order to be revered?  Hank Aaron, a talented baseball player from Mobile, Alabama became a legend when he broke Babe Ruth's home run record, but before that, he was a talented all-around player for the Milwaukee Brewers and the Atlanta Braves.
<br />
<br />Hank's journey to beat the Babe's record was not without obstacles and setbacks.  While pursuing the record and playing for Atlanta, a losing team at the time, the stands were nearly empty.  He received degrading mail that threatened his life and that of his children. He heard boos emanating from the stands. But why? Wasn't this man a great baseball player who was on his way to claiming the home run record? He was, but he was African-American, and many baseball fans did not take kindly to the thought of a black man stomping on Babe Ruth's record. But despite the racial slurs, discouraging letters, and enormous pressure to knock them out of the park, Hank Aaron remained a calm force and an admirable role model. Hank Aaron's career home run record, set in 1973, is yet to be broken.
<br />
<br /> Tom Stanton did a nice job of reviewing the history of Aaron, while adding a personal element to the textbook stats, players' names, and chronology. The reader is allowed to know Hank, to support him, to root for him, to feel for him.  A true baseball fan will love this recount of baseball history. (RAWSISTAZ Rating: 3.5)

                    <span>THIS IS THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOMERUN 715. THE AUTHOR DOES A FINE JOB DESCRIBING THE EVENTS IN DETAIL THAT LEAD UP TO THE HISTORIC MOMENT. I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY INTERESTING AND WELL TOLD. SOME OF THE INTERESTING PARTS INCLUDE THE NON- APPEARENCE OF BOWIE KUHN AT THE HISTORIC GAME, THE DEATH THREATS TO HENRY AND HIS FAMILY, THE RACIAL ISSUES OF THE 1970'S AND GETTING TO KNOW HENRY A LITTLE MORE MAKES THIS A GOOD READ. NOW IT LOOKS AS IF BARRY BONDS MAKE BREAK THIS RECORD IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. I FIND IT VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT HENRY NEVER GOT THE CREDIT HE DESERVED FOR THIS REMARKABLE FEAT AND FOR BEING A DAMN GOOD ALL AROUND PLAYER. A MUST READ FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS.</span>

                    <span>The subtitle of this book, "The Home Run That Changed America," may seem a bit lofty to those born too soon to remember this record-breaking blow. But in these pages, Tom Stanton does a fine job of interweaving the story of Henry Aaron's chase of baseball's most hallowed record with the tale of the impact of that pursuit on the larger society. Stanton's love for the game shines through in this narrative, as does his sense of shame for those elements of the public who greeted Aaron's achievement not with praise, but scorn and hatred.<p>The narrative begins in the fall of 1972 with Aaron among those  in attendance at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the color barrier in modern baseball. The bulk of the book tells the story of the 1973 season, which saw Aaron surpass Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list and finally fall one short of Ruth's magic total of 714. Over the course of that season Aaron had to endure the ravages of age (he was thirty-nine), a steadily intensifying media circus, and most disheartening of all, a vocal stream of hatred and abuse, most (if not all) of it racially motivated.<p>The retrospective distance of three decades makes it clear that if anyone was prepared to endure this great strain, it was Henry Aaron. While other players in bigger media markets like Mays and Mickey Mantle had captured the public's imagination with flashier performances, Aaron had been toiling away in Milwaukee and Atlanta, steadily building up career totals that would place him in the first rank of baseball's Hall of Fame...and humanity's as well.<p>Aaron came back for the 1974 season determined to put the quest for the record behind him as quickly as possible. This couldn't come without controversy, either. Atlanta officials found themselves embroiled in conflict with then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn when they threatened to hold Aaron out of the opening three games at Cincinnati so he could achieve the record at home. Under pressure from Kuhn, the Braves played Aaron in Cincinnati, where he tied the record. Fittingly, though, he saved the blast that put him alone in the baseball universe for the home fans. Appropriately, this is where Stanton's narrative ends. There's a brief afterword on what's happened to Aaron and the other key players (including a young acolyte of Aaron's, Dusty Baker) in the decades since. But the heart of the story is in that year and a half recounted in these pages....when, as Stanton puts it, Aaron placed an exclamation mark on Jackie Robinson's great achievement and helped further erode the barriers standing in the way of full equality for all Americans.--William C. Hall</span>
