                    <span>This is a good book, but certain types of user may find it a little frustrating.
<br />
<br />Regular or advanced users of CSS will find it very convenient.  It contains a lot of useful information and, when you need to check the syntax of a particular property, the information is easy to find, clearly written and very comprehensive.
<br />
<br />The problem arises when you don't remember all the basics.  The index structure contains references to property names, but not applications.  For example, suppose you want to put some text in italics and justify the paragraph, there is no entry in the index that says "italic" or "justify".  You need to know which properties to use, or scan the index until you see properties that might be relevant (in this case, the properties you need are 'font-style' for italics and 'text-align' for justify).
<br />
<br />So, it is a good book, but I would like to echo the message of Joshua Cogliati's review: it would be a much better reference with the addition of some basic information in the index.

                    <span>I am a big fan of O'Reilly's "Pocket Reference" books and this one was no disappointment. In fact, this guide by Eric Meyer is exceptionally well written with clear explanations of CSS terminology. The first few sections on rules, precedence, positioning, layouts, etc. helped me - fairly new to CSS - grasp the gist of CSS better than more extensive tutorials because of Meyer's concise explanations and well-conceived illustrations. Of course, the long-term value of these reference books is the alphabetical list of terms with definitions, applications, syntax and examples. 
<br />
<br />As with the other Pocket Reference books, a beginner should not come to this book for an introduction to CSS. There are many great books (some by Meyer) and web sites that get you up and running quickly. But even the beginner will find this invaluable as a quick reference book throughout the learning process.  I keep it right next to my screen when doing any web work. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>The majority of the book consists of an alphabetical guide to CSS properties.  If you need to look up what a particular property does this would be quite useful.  However, if you are trying to find a property to use and you do not know the name, this does not help.  The book is entirely lacking any catagorical index to the CSS properties.  Had CSS Pocket Reference 2nd Edition contained a two to four page index of the properties grouped by catagories such as text, layout, borders and so forth, I would have rated it better, but alas, it does not.</span>

                    <span>This is the companion to the CSS Cookbook. The pocket guide is pretty much an index of classes, elements, and allowed values, with descriptions of each. Of particular interest, though, is the front section which deals with some common layout and compatibility issues, as well as soem definitions that are used as conventions within CSS.
<br />
<br />There's not much to say about this guide expect that it lives up to its name - Pocket Reference. As a quick reference to CSS, I haven't found anything easier and better equipped, and Eric Meyer is still the guru, as far as I'm concerned. Buy a couple of copies, dogear some pages, and make your own notes on the margins. Keep one at your desk, and one in your laptop case - you'll use it more than you think!</span>

                    <span>A mistake so often made is judging a pocket reference guide in the same way you would judge a full size text.  Pocket guides should only provide a quick reference for a technology you already know, and not be looked at as a learning tool.  This reference is a boil-down of selected sections from the author's larger definitive title on Cascading Style Sheets, and there is no question that the information provided within is as informative and exact as is covered in the larger book; the light-weight pocket guide is much easier to carry when you need to verify something with CSS.
<br />
<br />The guide is designed well, with a structured table of contents which breaks the styles up into logical groups, and even an index for those quick find needs.  Each style entry provides the information needed without wasting space on the cautions and extras that a larger text typically provides.
<br />
<br />If you already own "Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition" (ISBN: 0596005253) that this pocket guide companions, this is a good addition to the set.  If not, obtain both as there are no better references.</span>
