                <span id="Label1">Software testers require people-oriented skills to survive what can often be a lose-lose relationship with developers and managers. Surviving the Top Ten Challenges of Software Testing goes beyond the technical skillsets required for effective testing to address the political realities that can't be solved by technical knowledge alone.  <P>Authors Perry and Rice compile a "top ten" list of the challenges faced by testers and offer tactics for success.  The challenges illustrate the way testing fits into the context of software development and how testers can manage expectations and improve communication with managers, developers, and customers. The text features a self-assessment for testing skills and an action plan for improving the testing process.  <P>Topics include training, acquiring management support, obtaining tools, communicating with customers, managing changing requirements, marketing the importance of testing, testing what's thrown over the wall, controlling the scope of testing, teaching developers to test, and handling the delicate situation of reporting defects.  <P>The Top Ten People Challenges Facing Testers  <P><br>Challenge #10: Getting Trained in Testing <br>Challenge #9: Building Relationships with Developers <br>Challenge #8: Testing Without Tools <br>Challenge #7: Explaining Testing to Managers <br>Challenge #6: Communicating with Customers -- And Users <br>Challenge #5: Making Time for Testing <br>Challenge #4: Testing What's Thrown Over the Wall <br>Challenge #3: Hitting a Moving Target <br>Challenge #2: Fighting a Lose-Lose Situation <br>Challenge #1: Having to Say No</span>

                    <span>Much has changed in software development and testing practices since this text was written in the late 90's. However, many of the identified challenges are still with us. I find myself rereading this book as it is a useful reference for a test manager. The authors identify dual disparate roles for the software tester. In role one, the focus is on the task of testing software, such as test planning, test design, and execution. In role two, the tester or test manager's role is more as a politician and marketer to protect the test staff and promote the value they bring to each project . The text focuses on the second role, which elaborates on what the authors identify as the top ten people oriented challenges for the software test professional. 
<br /> 
<br /> The first section of the book includes an assessment to help you identify your strengths and weaknesses in meeting people related testing challenges. The bulk of the text contains individual chapters on the top 10 challenges. The challenges are explained along with guidelines to overcome the challenge. Chapters can be read out of order and this format allows you to focus on your weaknesses as identified in the self assessment. The last section of the book describes a six step change process to implement improvements. My favorite two chapters were "Explaining Testing to Managers" and "Getting Trained in Testing." Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>When this book was written software testing was starting to consolidate into an 'honorable' profession, and the number of good books about testing could be counted on your fingers (and probably a few toes).  The discipline has matured into a profession, and there are so many excellent books on the subject now that it boggles my mind.  <p>You'd think that the top ten challenges listed in this book would have been long ago resolved and replaced with a new set. Sadly, that isn't the case.  Each challenge listed is as valid today as it was when this book was written, and except for #10 on the list (getting trained in testing), which has dramatically improved, the other nine are still there.  Read the book. Take the advice of the two authors, both of whom are seasoned professionals who give the solutions to these challenges, and move the profession forward.<p>Here are the top five challenges that I see today, drawn from the list in the book:<p>#1 today, #6 in the book: Communicating with Customers -- And Users<br>#2 today, #3 in the book: Hitting a Moving Target<br>#3 today, #1 in the book: Having to Say No<br>#4 today, #4 in the book: Testing What's Thrown Over the Wall<br>#5 today, #2 in the book: Fighting a Lose-Lose Situation<p>Your order may be different, but I am willing to bet that the list will be the same.  This book does give realistic solutions to these problems, so if you agree with the list, then you'll find this book valuable.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an excellent review of the biggest recurring problems of the software testing world.  As I read the descriptions of each of the 10 challenges, I was astonished at how many of the pitfalls I fall into on a  regular basis.  Perry & Rice don't just lay out what the challenges are  - they also discuss how to meet each one.  Each item on the list has its  own chapter with sections on the impact on testing, solutions to the  challenge, impediments to implementing the solutions, and helpful  guidelines to creating a plan of action.  This is without a doubt an  excellent book for those of us in the trenches of software testing each  day.  (One bit of advice, though - if you're looking for a book on  "how to do software testing", look elsewhere.  Perry and Rice  have other good books on the subject, but this one is really intended to  help you step back from your daily testing work and see where you could  improve on your approach to it.)</span>

                    <span>Testing has often been the  misbegotten portion of the software development process. Frequently neglected until the semi-chaotic end of the production cycle, the testing phase has traditionally been shortened to  accommodate a fixed release date. The relationships between the developer  and test groups are to some extent adversarial, but in so many cases it  often breaks down into open hostility. Among developers, it is often  considered demeaning to have to soil ones hands by actually testing the  code. With such a sullied background, it is no wonder that production code  is generally riddled with bugs.<br>   As the authors of this book point  out, all of the above are dangerous conditions. With the expansion of code  reuse and RAD tools, the development of the initial iteration is going to  be done at a faster pace than before. Since the number of pathways through  the code is operationally infinite, the only way relatively bug-free code  will be developed is by allocating more resources to testing and making the  choice and tracking of test cases a more scientific endeavor. The most  significant point of the ten made in this book is that the testing process  should be considered on an equal basis with that of development so that  both groups communicate as equals. Without that, all the fancy, efficient  tools in the world are reduced to the level of mere toys.<br>   This is a  book that can and should be read by developers, managers and yes, even  testers, as all will benefit from the simple words of wisdom.</span>

                    <span>The industry has long since passed Perry by.  I found this book simplistic in its approach, mired in problems that most software development houses  solved long ago, and dependent on overblown methods no longer appropriate  in the internet age. As for the question of how to influence, Weinberg is a  far better guide.  As a test manager, I would recommend almost any other  book on testing to members of my staff.</span>
