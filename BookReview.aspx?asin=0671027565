                <span id="Label1"><P> Fusing travelogue, historical inquiry, and interviews with Iranians from all walks of life, <i>Neither East Nor West</i> is a landmark contribution to travel writing and to cultural studies, as well as a timely illumination of a nation deeply misunderstood by most Westerners. In describing life in Iran today, Christiane Bird, an American who spent part of her childhood there, breaks the silence that has surrounded Iran's culture -- unlike its politics -- for nearly twenty years.  <P> Traveling alone and largely by bus, Bird journeys from the modern, bustling capital of Tehran to the medieval holy city of Qom, from the sacred pilgrimage site of Mashhad -- visited by more than twelve million Shi'ites annually -- to the isolated valley of Alamut, once home to the legendary cult of the Assassins. She visits mosques, public baths, Khomeini's former home, and a Caspian Sea resort, and attends prayer meetings and a horse racing meet. Along the way, she talks to muleteers and ayatollahs, Kurds and Turkomans, Westernized and traditional Iranians -- many of whom invite her home for a cup of tea. <P> The result is an astounding, insightful journey into the Islamic Republic of Iran -- in all its beauty, ferocity, and contradiction.</span>

                    <span>In some ways this might be described as a middle class travel guide to Iran. I say this because of the obvious differance between this book and one endorsed on the review page earlier called Honeymoon in Purdah (please see my review of that book) which to me was a more informal expedition/book. I feel in some ways Ms. Bird got a more realistic impression of Iran and Iranians, though I can't really fault either author. These are a very complex people whom I felt after 3 1/2 years of intimate association with them that I knew a LITTLE bit about, so am impressed that these two women learned so much about them in so little time. This book is very well researched and written and is a good source to learn about Iranian history, culture and it's people. I was very gratified to learn that Amrikayeh is not a univeral swear word in Iran, reading these books makes me want to go back.</span>

                    <span>Christiane Bird demonstrates exceptional talent and writing skills by in making her account of her journey spanning several months in Iran exceptionally interesting and informative.<P>Iran is interesting and fascinating to most Americans because we know very little about the country except that America has a strained relationship with the country and that its Islamic government and culture provide a sharp contrast to conditions in the United States. Ms. Bird dons the traditional dress for Islamic women and proceeds to travel extensively in both the urban and rural areas of this large country. Throughout her journey she is a guest in the homes of Iranian friends and acquaintances or travels alone. <P>Christiane makes outstanding use of simile, metaphor, action words and subtle humor to make her account an easy and interesting read. In the process she provides us with a rare and valuable, person-to-person insight in to the Islamic religion and the people of Iran. Her descriptions of Islam are objective and insightful. Her situation provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of women in the Muslim society. In the end she finds that the Iranian people hold incongruous feelings of both admiration and condemnation for both the Western and Iranian culture and government.<P>This book will make the "Best Reads of the Year" list of most non-fiction readers.</span>

                    <span>I've read several personal-point-of-view books about Iran recently, and I have a lot of respect for this one. I rate it as an honest book because Ms. Bird is very clear about her personal standards, background and feelings and where they come from. She doesn't pretend to be objective; she's giving one person's perspective. In particular, she includes her own reactions even when she knows that readers will find them unsympathetic. How much more can you ask?<P>I enjoyed reading it very much, and I think many others will find it an interesting view of an interesting country</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I am Persian and I found this book to be very informative, although it's not an easy read. It could use a considerable amount of editing and I found a lot of the things she said to be somewhat inaccurate. Other times it's as if it goes on rambling. She mentions over and over again how little farsi she knows and how the Iranians know even less english, so I found that while writing her conversations, she probably had to improvise a lot and I wonder if she really understood what people were trying to tell her. Overall, it's not a bad book. I did learn some more stuff about my own culture, but I think her frame of mind is still very "American"- you know what I mean. She wrote several times about how frustrated and irritated she would get with some of the culture clashes there, but if you are going to do something like this, you just have to accept things the way they are- thus not becoming frustrated or irritated. I was surprised that she travelled alone for parts of it. I'm Iranian, and even I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that.<BR>I would recommend Terrence Ward's Searching for Hassan before this.</span>
