                    <span>This book is titled ' the one- hundred best loved poems' .By whom? All the poems are by writers in English? Are there any other languages and people in the world? 
<br />Secondly. Where is the evidence that  these poems are the most loved even by English language readers? Many are certainly very popular, frequently anthologized. My guess is that today a fair share of the poems in this anthology are not widely read.
<br />Now that I have been a grump, let me say that the anthology is rich with great, and certainly some of the most loved poems in the English language. In fact some of these poems have been published so many times in so many different anthologies one wonders what ( except for the price of the volume) is the advantage of reading them here. 
<br />Nonetheless any collection of great poetry is a celebration. And there is much great poetry here . Go down the list of the major anthologies of English and American poetry, and you will find the poets listed here.

                    <span>The poetry in this book covers a period from the middle ages to modern times and is arranged in order of date.You will find well known names such as Tennyson, Keats, Wordsworth to name a few.<br>That said, I was surprised by how many of the verses I had never heard of or read before although this is called '100 Best Loved Poems'.Some of the poems featured here are quite obscure. There are some well known ones such as 'Charge of the light brigade' and 'Daffodils' but if you are looking for a book that will help you brush up on all of those half remembered snippets of poetry from your schooldays, then this may not be the choice for you. Having said that, this is a very low price for a collection of poems and if you do want something a little different, then at this price it may be worth adding to your bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>Philip Smith has assembled a very good sampling of the best poetry in the English language. We read Marlowe, Shakespeare, Donne, Jonson, Herrick, Milton, Gray, Blake, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, both Brownings, Longfellow, Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Hardy, Housman, Yeats, Frost, Pound, Millay, Cummings, Auden, Dylan Thomas, and many others.<p>The collection is as advertised: these are the best-loved poems in the English language.  These are familiar poems, poems that are accessible to casual readers of poetry, poems that continue to resonate today. Smith's compilation is fun to read and to reread. Any teacher would find it ideal for introductory English literature classes, honors high school or college.<p>What is missing? This collection excludes translations of classical poetry, poetry of the non-English speaking world, and contemporary English-speaking poets. But this little book contains enough gems to satisfy any treasure hunter.<p>This Dover edition is an excellent buy.  Just imagine, great poetry for only a penny per poem.<p>Looking for a more eclectic anthology? See 100 Poems by 100 Poets compiled by Harold Pinter, Geoffrey Godbert, and Anthony Astbury. They present what they consider (by unanimous decision, often after heated argument) to be the best poem by each of the 100 best poets in the English language. Their choices only occasionally overlap with the better known selections in Philip Smith's Dover edition.<p>One Hundred and One Famous Poems, compiled by Roy J. Cook in 1927, has long been a favorite anthology of British and American poets. It is an interesting collection, as it includes many poets that are now less familiar or even forgotten, but who were popular in the early part of the last century. Take a look at this anthology. You will be pleasantly surprised.  It has been reprinted many times and it is not difficult to find copies on the Internet.</span>
