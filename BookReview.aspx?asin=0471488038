                    <span>Author and Army Ranger Brace E. Barber shows you how to make adversity hit the deck and give you 20 push-ups. His lessons on becoming a great leader are simple - stop thinking of yourself, learn to think of others, lead by example, persist in the face of adversity and so forth - but the process by which Army Rangers learn those lessons is complex and fascinating. Barber gives you insight into the brutal training that heroes such as the late Pat Tillman, the NFL star-turned-Ranger, endure for the cause of freedom. Barber profiles ten Rangers who applied lessons from their training to overcome difficulties. Readers see the circumstances under which these lessons were imprinted and deployed. In an age when people offer excuses as readily as business cards, Rangers believe the way to succeed is to stop making excuses. That's a valuable lesson in business and life. We highly recommends this book to those leading others through the hazards of business.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Most of this book is not about leadership. Instead, it is about what it is like to be an Army Ranger. I would say 15% of the book is dedicated to the subject of leadership in the Rangers. <P>The book hits not so much at the intellectual level, but at the emotions. It does a fine job of describing the ATTITUDE of Ranger leadership. Perhaps it is implying that leadership is mostly about winning attitude.<P>The book holds the reader with its tales of harsh training every Ranger must suffer. Its training is specifcially designed to push every Ranger to their physical and psychological limits, resulting in what appears to be a near death experience to most Rangers. I found it intriguing that Rangers lose sexual appetite during their brutal training because all they can think about is their basic survival (warmth, food, shelter, and overcoming pain) while successfully accomplishing their mission.</span>

                    <span>I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the best book on leadership. From a army standpoint, being a ranger is a big deal. Anybody aspiring to be an outstanding military officer should so through a program such as the Rangers, Seals, Special Forces, Green Beret, etc.. Programs such as these certainly make or break an individual. <P>This book gives the perspective of 10 men who completed the Ranger program and their struggles to overcome their individual weaknesses. One of the Rangers spotlighted, Tex Turner adopted the statement: "As an officer, you are either a ranger or an excuse." The author embellishes this concept: "You are either wealthy or an excuse." "You are either healthy or an excuse." This simple saying can apply to any area of ones life. Am I doing all I can--or am I just making excuses.<P>I highly recommend this book. My only reservations were the authors abundant use of the F-bomb. True, it adds to the reality of the situation these men went through, but shows a lack of professionalism as a businessman/author. It is one minor aspect which would keep me from suggesting it to young readers. Also, from a business perspective, this book isn't a leader in leadership books. All in all, this book is exciting reading. It is well written. Many times I actually visualized myself in similar situations. Don't make excuses. Read this book.</span>

                    <span>Brace Barber has written a book that not only defines the necessary characteritics of what it takes to be a leader, he does so in a manner that takes the reader inside the world of the Ranger experience. Leaders follow, push themselves; lead by example; depend on others; have teh ability to endure and overcome and have vision. I found personal inspiration from the individual's in the book relating their experiences. You will, too!</span>

                    <span>I just absolutely loved the way this book read. <BR>Barber puts the reader at ground level, and drives home leadership principles through impactful, first person anecdotes. <BR>Each chapter focuses on one Ranger School graduate and highlights one of many leadership traits within each story. This book is so inspiring and gives you strength to keep pursuing your dream, no matter how far away it is.</span>
