                <span id="Label1">Ushering in the Era of the Tuna in Dallas, there is a renewed interest in "America's Team", the Dallas Cowboys. This two-disc set celebrates the glorious history of the Dallas Cowboys, from the inception in 1960, through the first days in training camp 2003. Bonus disc is the 70 minute highlight program of the NFC Championship Game of 1992, in which Dallas beat the 49ers and kicked off its Super Bowl run of the 1990s - one of the greatest Cowboy games.</span>

                    <span>The Dallas Cowboys have a history as rich as any in the NFL. From beginning to end, names like Bob Hayes, Randy White, Tony Dorsett, Herschel Walker, Troy Aikman, and Emmitt Smith fill up this DVD with spectacular highlights. With the Big Tuna sparking a renewed interest in the Dallas Cowboys, longtime and new fans will discover why the Dallas Cowboys are known as "America's Team." Disc 1 contains a compacted year-by-year analysis with special spotlights on individual stars such as Ed Jones and Thomas Henderson. Disc 2 contains the 1992/93 NFC Championship game play-by-play, a real treat for those that missed the original broadcast. This DVD has it all. Highly recommended for Cowboys fans.</span>

                    <span>This 2-disc set is the "typical" outstanding product we've come to expect from NFL Films. The first disc contains a 72-minute history of the Dallas Cowboys from their first season of 1960 through the 2002 season. A lot is packed into these 72-minutes, but of course for diehard Cowboy fans, it still leaves us wishing for more. The history is presented primarily chronologically, but there are some topics- the Redskin/Cowboy rivalry or the Cowboy image- where this strict chronology is broken. <P>The second DVD contains a 70-minute program of the Cowboy-49er NFC Championship game played on the January 17, 1993. That would be my pick for best Cowboy game of the 1990's. The game is presented chronologically and although it doesn't include every single play, it is extensive. A quality production.<P>The bonus features are primarily player profiles and some game highlights, including the Cowboys' exciting Monday Night game against the New York Giants in 2003.</span>

                    <span>Awesome! This is a wonderful DVD. Perfect for people like me (lifelong fans) who want to relive the glorious days of the past. I must admit to tearing up a bit watching Landry pace the sidelines against Green Bay in the mid 60s, and Lilly, Renfro and Staubach vs. Miami in '73 (for starters). But this DVD is also wonderful for newer fans who want to learn about the team. My wife, who more or less started following the Boys when we got married fifteen years ago, seemed to really enjoy it, and commented more than once that it filled in a lot of missing pieces for her. We BOTH learned something thanks to this production, though--in all these years, I had never, until now, heard the story of how the Cowboys-Redskins rivalry got started. Thought I knew, but didn't, not until now... Anyway, this production is tops. Script, audio and video are high quality. Well executed, as Landry might've said.</span>

                    <span>This DVD is greatness. Any fan of "America's Team" needs to have this in their DVD library. From the humble beginnings in 1960 to the present, this DVD does a great job of capturing the history of the Cowboys. There are many player and coaches interviews from other sources that are used very well to put together the story. And the behind the scenes aspects of the team are fun to hear.</span>
