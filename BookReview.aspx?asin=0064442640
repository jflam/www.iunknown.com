                    <span>It is time for Biscuit to have a bath.  The Girl In The Purple Sneakers has everything all set.  Everything except Biscuit who has other things he would like to do.  This is also the First book where his friend Puddles shows up.<p>Biscuit is reluctant to take his bath, but after making a mess and some puddles of his own, it is finally time to get clean.<p>This is one of the earliest and best Biscuit books.  My daughter loves it and I can use it to illustrate that when things need to be done, we will get them done even if she resists.<p>More great illustrations and text that my daughter likes to illuminate with her own story telling and hand gestures.</span>

                    <span>My 18-month old daughter adores this Biscuit book. (And now, some others as well.) The pictures couldn't be cuter, and the text is interesting and there's just enough of it to keep her engaged. It's a very fun, simple story, but she definitely "gets it." I think what makes it appealing to her is that it's got a real narrative element to it, as opposed to most of her books, which are just pictures and words, or nonsensical rhymes that don't really have a point.</span>

                    <span>My 3-year-old loves the Biscuit series. This book takes Biscuit and his little girl owner through an unwanted bath for Biscuit. In usual Biscuit fashion he resists doing what he is supposed to (which may be why the  Biscuit series appeals so to older toddlers--they can relate!). The little  girl is always patient and sweet, even when Biscuit makes a mess or gets  her wet or dirty she continues to treat him nicely. I believe this is a  nice lesson for a little one, and the easy-to-read format makes it fun for  them to make "Bow wow" and "Woof" sounds along with the  main character. When my 5-year-old started to read the Biscuit books were  popular with her because she could feel a sense of accomplishment when she  could read it herself.</span>
