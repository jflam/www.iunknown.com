                    <span>First of all you are not going to become a recognized authority or guru in 60 days as the title suggests.  Second you probably can figure out without reading the book that to become a guru you need to write a book.
<br />
<br />OK that's the bad news.  The good news is that Bly is a good writer.  He should be he does it for a living at least part time.  So the book is an easy read tightly written, succinct and to the point.  Mr. Bly gives the reader a lot of important tips on how to get close to guru-ship besides telling you to write a book.  If you are interested in being a consultant, doing seminars or an intellectual just looking for publicity, Mr. Bly gives excellent insight on how to do just that.  I would definitely recommend this book on that basis.

                    <span>Bob Bly's book covers a large number of promotional techniques, yet provides more than enough details on each.  What is particularly great about this book are the comparisons of old techniques, like printed newsletters, to newer ones, like e-zines.
<br />
<br />From his years of experience he provides opinions on which techniques are better to use and under which conditions to use them.
<br />
<br />He covers several of the secret weapons that he uses for his own firm.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone in business, and it should be considered required reading by all consultants.  Also, any book on direct marketing by Bly is highly recommended -- particularly on Business-To-Business marketing.

                    <span>I'm a reader from France, I bought this book and was disappointed. In the beginning it starts pretty well, but then, it totally misses the point by giving lame advices such as: write a book, write a newsletter etc... it is very basic, over simplistic...<p>BTW: the title is misleading: "Become an authority in 60 days or less"... Please mister Bly, tell us how to write a book in 60 days!!!<p>Then, the final blow: Bob Bly uses this book for his own self promo and tells us how important that is to build your guru status. Fine. Then, he mention how great his website is...<br>Before you buy his book, please check the author website:<br>www.bly.com and see for yourself !<br>It is not very impressive, to say the least... It is very badly made and presented. Bly photo is almost a joke...<p>This book has a catchy name but fail to deliver anything more than self-promo 101...</span>

                    <span>Don't get me wrong, the book overall is full of useful information. It was worth the buy. BUT no real explanation is given in how this "recognition as an Authoritive figure in your field" can be obtained in "60 days or less".  These words are part of the title which is what absolutely grabbed my attention and pursuaded me to purchase the book.<p>Guess I was expecting a suggested "plan of action" along with a recommend "time line" for those actions. The Contents page refers to  "The Action Plan" on page 32. Here you do find an overview of "the plan" which lists the major items that should be attempted, but thats all that given. In later chapters the author even points out how some of the items listed may take months or (in the example of "write and publish a book) could possibly take a couple of years. Many other items noted would be difficult (but I suppose, not impossible) to accomplish within 60 days.<p>But all of the items listed as being "required"  and the details and explanations given are very good, and explained clearly. The book's title is perfect if the words "In 60 Days or Less" were to be removed.<p>So in summary "this book tells you should and need to to do, except how to accomplish the tasks in '60 days or less ', BUT the book is still worth the read.</span>
