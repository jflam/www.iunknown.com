                    <span>I am using this book to implement a Perl web application using mod_perl on a Linux box - the other book I am using is O'Reilly's "Writing Apache Modules". So far, I have found most everything I needed between those two books. It is very helpful to have a book dedicated to the Apache Server, nothing more and nothing less.<P>If I would understand Regular Expressions better than I do, I actually would have found everything I needed - that's when I sent an email to the author, who answered me first in a meeting break and then again in his lunch break ... wow.<P>One little thing: I almost would have bought this book in a bookstore before I actually bought it from Amazon. The reason I didn't back then was that it says "Covers Windows 95 and Windows NT Platforms" on the cover - it should read "Covers UNIX/Linux and Windows 95/NT"! The book covers a lot of UNIX!</span>

                    <span>This is a 600-page tome that gives you just enough information to make you very dangerous, and a bunch of non-sensical dialog that could have been left out. The book is also full of embarrassing errors and glaring contradictions. My favorite, in the mod_perl section is, "...when using mod_perl to run CGI scripts you cannot use ScriptAlias" followed very shortly by "You should also have a ScriptAlias directive..." The author probably knows a lot about Apache, but unfortunately is ineffective at teaching, a drawback particularly for novices reading his book. Too much is left out of this book, and too much is erroneous for you to put your put your faith in it. Try a more professional outfit, like O'Reilly's Apache: The Definitive Guide.</span>

                    <span>I've read about 3/4 of this book and found it easy to understand and helpful. But I wanted to mention another book, Professional Apache (Wrox, September 1999), which for some reason, doesn't show up on any amazon searches. I'm relatively new to programming, so I'm not able to evaluate all the details of Professional apache, but it is more up-to-date and (in my mind) easier to understand. And very comprehensive.</span>

                    <span>This book jumps around from trying to teach novice stuff to assuming the reader is about as tech saavy as the author. He might be tech saavy but he is not a good teacher. I am still trying to find a good Apache guide. Maybe best to just bug my friends.</span>
