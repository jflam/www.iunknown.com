                <span id="Label1">If there's anyone qualified to write a self-help book on success, it's Jack Canfield, who's worked his way from scraping by as a teacher to holding a Guinness world record for having seven books simultaneously on <i>The New York Times</i>&#174; Best Sellers list. <P> As a coauthor of the Chicken Soup for the Soul&#174; series, he's sold more than 80 million books, and now lives "in a beautiful California estate" with his days of dining on spaghetti and tomato paste long behind him. "All you have to do is decide what it is you want, believe you deserve it, and practice the principles in this book," he says, and success is yours. <P> His advice is straightforward (examples: "reject rejection" and "surround yourself with successful people"), but rather derivative, with quotes from the likes of JFK, Colin Powell, Aldous Huxley, and fellow motivation author Napoleon Hill.Canfield's definition of success is primarily monetary, and he includes plenty of anecdotes depicting average folks who saved themselves from the brink of bankruptcy after following his principles. He could tone down the braggadocio; readers don't need to know that he's stayed in resorts in Hawaii, Italy, Australia, and Morocco. Despite those gripes, his cheerleader-caliber enthusiasm should benefit anyone looking to improve their lot in life. --<i>Erica Jorgensen</i>  <p clear=left>  <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="cc6600">Amazon.com Exclusive Content</font></b>   <p clear=left>  <a name="canfield-video"></a> <img src=http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/graphics6/canfield_jack.tiff.t.gif align= "left" border="1">&#160;Jack Canfield, creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, reveals secrets to success with 64 timeless principles in <i>The Success Principles</i>.

                    <span>It's almost impossible not to like this book-- it's direct, pulls no punches, and is all about taking control of your life.  Even if you get one gem of an idea every 30 pages, you're still going to come out ahead.  If everyone read the first 2-3 chapters about taking responsibilty and quitting the blame-game, we as a society in general would vastly improve!
<br />
<br />As Mart Spitz  said, "Everyone wants to win an Olympic gold medal, but how many people want to train every day?"-- this book is going to teach you HOW to train, but you still have to do the work.  I look at Jack Canfield and think-- when I'm as successful as he is, maybe then I can dismiss the principles. Until then, why not give it a shot?
<br />
<br />My copy is a library book, but is certainly worth buying-- I'd even pay full cover price!
<br />
<br />(This book is much much MUCH better than The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness by Stephen Covey.)</span>

                    <span>Simply amazing! Why? Because Jack will gently take you by the hand with his simple but very powerful techniques that can change your life. 
<br />
<br />This excellent book is about 64 easy to understand principles, that get fast results and that are easy to learn. It's packed with personal experiences, real stories and powerful quotations to empower and inspire you to live your destiny.
<br />
<br />Jack will help you clarify your mission, set powerful goals, increase your self-esteem and self-confidence, get out of your comfort zone, commit to excellence and change your limiting beliefs. He will give you instructions to reach your mission and your goals: act as if, hire a coach, how to create your dream team and other practical and down-to-earth advice to unleash the power within you.
<br />
<br />These principles are universal. They worked not only for him but for thousands and thousands of people throughout the world. They will work for you as well.
<br />
<br />If you liked "The 7 Habits" and Stephen's great principles, you will love "The Success Principles" from Jack Canfield. He knows what he's talking about. He will teach you how to get from where you are to where you want to be.

<br />I was totally wrong.
<br />
<br />I learned a lot of new concepts and learned how to implement

<br />The book tells you in a very easy to understand, how to start

<br />If you were an incoming student at Hogwarts, Star Fleet Academy, or and early learner to be a Jedi Knight, this book would be required.
<br />
<br />This is the book I have always wanted for my Life Coaching clients.  Heck, this is the book I would have loved thirty years ago and am grateful for now.
<br />
<br />More poignantly, I want my 11-year-old grandchild to read Success Principles. I bought a copy for him and he and his mother are working with it slowly.  
<br />
<br />Here's what I said to him:
<br />
<br />"When you read the book carefully, you will be able to make real magic in your life.  You will be able to design and create the life you want. This is true shape shifting. 
<br />
<br />"Like at Hogwarts, you will make mistakes and stinking messes. But if you stick with it you will learn just like Harry and his friends, just like his teachers did before him. 
<br />
<br />"It will lead you to ways to fulfill all your heart's desires."
