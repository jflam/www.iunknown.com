                    <span>I found this slightly unorthodox way of learning vocabulary words to be entertaining and practically painless. My children (8th and 5th graders)and their Gifted and Talented Program teachers have been enthusiastic about using the book. I especially appreciate the author's humorous treatment of this compilation of words likely to be tested, and the fact that he has updated the book periodically to keep pace with changes in the SAT. I would recommend it for any student-in school or not- interested in expanding his or her vocabulary.</span>

                    <span>When my daughter was in the 10th. grade, she was homeschooled.<br>We purchased a set of curriculum, which of course, included <br>English. I wasn't satisfied with the vocabulary portion of it,<br>so I used this book. I gave her 10 new words each week and we<br>both had so much fun learning them! The illustrations are great<br>and they really do help you to remember them. Every week when<br>tested, my daughter always got 100% correct. A few years later,<br>my son was homeschooled for the 7th. grade. Out came the book <br>again! I also use it to look up words, before reaching for a <br>dictionary. Having a good vocabulary (and using the words you<br>know correctly) is very important and I would recommend this<br>book for everyone.</span>

                    <span>My teenage son shared with me that this book was going to be a great study guide in preparation for the SAT.  I was intrigued by his comments so I decided to review the book.  Where was this book when I took the SAT in bell bottoms and a T-shirt with the peace sign on it?  Thanks Charles ... a book with a "common sense" approach.  A must buy for the serious SAT test taker!</span>

                    <span>I guess the best way to judge the use of a book like this is to see if there is a pay off.  I am a reading teacher and have used this book with my students for many years.  My students leave my class to go on to take the 7th grade Duke SAT with outstanding success.  Teachers at the junior high and high school level are astounded by the vocabulary and definition retention level of my students.  This book not only exposes the students to 500 great words, but it also gives the students a tool to use in learning other--hard to remember---definitions. For my students, this book becomes a "how to" book ---"how to" remember the meanings of words even when they are used in isolation--without context clues.  The proof of the value of this book is in the results that my students have had with the Duke SAT, PSAT and the SAT.  It's hard to argue with results.</span>
