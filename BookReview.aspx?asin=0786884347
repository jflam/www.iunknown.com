                    <span>I read at least a book a week and it is rare that I find a book that knocks my socks off. This book is a collection of really fun and creative ideas (written in story fashion) that couples have used to keep the romance alive in their relationship. <P>There are other "romantic idea" books on the market but their idea of romance is rather commercial and plain. This Michael Webb is more like the Martha Stewart of romance. Sure, some people might hate him for being so creative and inventive but you really have to give credit where credit is due. <P>As Michael points out in his book, you shouldn't expect that every single idea will work for you. Afterall, that's not romance - simply doing what everyone else does. But his tips and ideas will give you a goldmine of inspriration.<P>I liked the book so much I went out and bought 10 copies to give out as wedding presents. Some of the couples told me it was far better than most of the far more expensive gifts they received.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a book a few months ago on dating ideas and one of my coworkers highly recommended this book. I reluctantly bought it and began leafing through it. I was sceptical at first and now I am hooked.<P>What I appreciate most about this book is that the author really does appear to be a true romantic -- someone who openingly and willingly expresses his love and emotions. <P>So many people consider themselves romantics but in reality they do and buy things more to impress others than to show their love. How is calling FTD and ordering a $75 bouquet romantic? It took very little thought and no effort. All it does is show that you are willing to spend money for someone. I loved the author's idea of having his wife's bridal bouquet recreated and dried for their anniversary.<P>I initially wanted the book just for dating ideas and there were plenty of unique ones like the Quarter Date and the Millionaire Date. But soon I was inspired by this book that romance is not limited to dates and special occasions. So many of the ideas in the book can be "anyday" expressions. In fact true romantics I have come to learn are romantic mainly on everyday -- not on special occasions when it is "obligatory."<P>I was wanting to do something special on the anniversary of the day we moved into our first house (the book shares a lot of unconventional holidays you can celebrate). There were a lot of ideas in the book I could have used but I opted for the "Love Builds a House" idea. We had such a wonderful time that I think I will make it an annual observence.<P>I had some friends who were having problems in their marriage. They were about to file for separation. They said they lost the "spark" and all the love was gone. I bought them each a copy of the book and suggested they just do one simple idea a week for one month. After two weeks they told me they were staying together permantently. They rediscovered romance -- what they thought was only important in the courtship phase of their relationship.<P>If you are looking for a book of ideas simply to impress someone else with your credit card spending habits then you should buy a different one. If your desire is simply to seduce someone (these ideas are magical enough that will certainly do that too) you have the wrong motive. If you think that the only reason for romance is to end the night in the sack, then you will never be a romantic. <P>But if you think romance is opening your heart, sharing your emotions, cherishing and honoring the one you love - this book is for you. If you believe that time and experiences shared are more important than expensive gifts that never really last, then buy this book. If you want a lifetime of love, then get this book today.</span>

                    <span>Being an author, romance expert and relationship coach I'm always on the look out for good romance how-to and relationship books to read and recommend to others. I recommend The RoMANtic's Guide for its easy creative romantic tips and inspiring examples of willingness to keep love and romance alive. The ideas you get in Webb's book can quickly enable you to achieve a five star rating for romance in your relationship. <P>The book is filled with affordable thoughtful romantic ways to dote on anyone anywhere at anytime using just about anything you can imagine, like snow (free) and Kool-Aid (very inexpensive). Variety and creativity are some of the most constructive gifts we have been given. However, those gifts are seldom used to improve love relationships--their power and ability to evoke positive change is merely taken for granted by most individuals, but not by Michael Webb. <BR> <BR>Love is a lot like auto racing. Nobody starts with intention of coming in second place. Adding The RoMANtic's Guide to your bookshelf is one more way to keep you and your honey Racing to Win in the Relationship Race. Every pit crew has more than one good mechanic. If you want to keep your relationship running on all cylinders, reading more than just one good romance/relationship book will surely help keep you and your loved one in Victory Lane. I'm glad to have The Romantic's Guide on my creativity crew. Get yourself a copy of The Romantic's Guide today. It's one more way you can rev-up your relationship for good.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book opened my mind to a whole lot of romantic possibilities. It's full of suggestions maybe we used to do, but somehow forgot to keep doing. Of course, I adapted some of the suggestions to my circumstances. I like the idea of surprising my wife with little reminders while I'm away on business trips or the idea of mailing cards to her office to remind her during the day how much I love her. I tried the suggestion of hiding sticky notes, but she looked at me like I had lost my mind. She enjoyed receiving cards with clues leading up to a big date.<P>The author has two things going for him--his desire to never stop being romantic, and his creativity. He can see romantic opportunities in unlikely places. And the real message is, if you think of something romantic, do it.<P>I highly recommend this book. Even if an idea seems silly, try it. You'd be surprised at how many of the suggestions can make an ordinary day special.</span>

                    <span>I saw Michael Webb on[tv]and had to buy this book right away. All the bookstores were sold out and I was grateful that Amazon[.com] still had some in stock.<P>I was charmed by Michael Webbs ideas on [that show] but even more so reading his book. It is obvious that he doesnt just make up ideas to fill pages of the book, but he comes up with these awesome ways of showing love for his wife because he really cares. <P>The book not only gave me great ideas, it make me more dedicated in my relationship so I could be more like Michael and his wife.</span>
