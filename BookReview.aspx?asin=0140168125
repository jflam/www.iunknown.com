                    <span>   This book is very sad, yet beautiful. It tells the autobiographical story of Jack Kerouac, who is now forty years old, famous for writing On the Road, and has a problem with alcohol. 
<br />
<br />   Jack in this book, feels he is on the brink of madness. He has a hard time accepting the negative forces in life, such as death, and other people's insanity. He is much too sensitive for the world the way it is. He is a man who loves animals, feels a strong tie to his family, and saves insects. He also loves people very much. 
<br />
<br />   This novel almost seems like a horror novel in the parts where Jack describes his mental anguish. He never wanted to be famous, to be the 'king of the beats' and all he wants is some peace of mind, yet he has people following him around all the time. Even the atmosphere at Big Sur becomes oppressive. 
<br />
<br />   The writing is beautiful and poetic, and hauntingly honest. The book ends with a poem echoing the sounds of the sea at Big Sur. </span>

                    <span>I stumbled onto _On the Road_ in my high school's library in Fresno in the mid-70s. Even at that time, the book struck me as very dated. I enjoyed reading it because I was very curious about all the places Kerouac had visited. Barely sixteen years old, I had seen very little of my own country, let alone the world. Any information I could get about the outside world was of interest to me, and I spent hours and hours studying the maps and population charts in my father's auto atlas.<p>Years later, I discovered that that obscure book I had read in high school was actually quite a famous one. For years now, I have been meaning to find another copy so that I can read it again and see what my perceptions of the book are now as an adult. Instead, I recently purchased a used copy of _Big Sur_ at a flea market.<p>I know I'm gonna take a lot of flack for this, but I think Kerouac is hugely over-rated. I suppose his work has value as an artifact of Beatnik life in the 50s and early 60s, but I just can't see it being appreciated as especially great by future generations.<p>In my opinion, much of the appeal surrounding Kerouac is based on hype. Something about the stream-of-consciousness style of his writing gives a first impression of profundity that just isn't there upon further reflection. His studied shunning of commas and apostrophes, and his love affair with parenthetical asides (many sentences have two or three with no break between them) (kind of like this) (I wonder how he convinced his publisher to let them stay) add to the obfuscation, making me wonder if he had lawyerly ambitions early in life.<p>Kerouac's own words describe this hype best as this excerpt from the book shows:<p>"But he's got this young kid he brought back from Reno called Ron Blake who is a goodlooking teenager with blond hair who wants to be a sensational new Chet Baker singer and comes on with that tiresome hipster approach that was natural five or ten and even twenty five years ago but now in 1960 is a pose, in fact I dug him as a con man conning Dave (tho for what, I don't know)." -p 51 in Grafton Books 1986 reprint, paperback<p>Kerouac's character development seems about on par with Fast Times at Ridgemont High. None of the characters have any real depth. And it's hard to take his relationship with Billie seriously because we don't learn enough about her to decide whether we even like her or not.<p>Perhaps the most inane part of the book is the two or three pages he spends expounding the Beat theory that all Americans suffer from a nagging guilt whose source they don't realize is the simple fact that they don't wash their behinds with soap and water after they defecate. I find little of any value to be learned from this supposed insight.<p>The book may have some value for those seeking to gain insight into alcoholism. Then again, his dig at those "ignorant people who don't drink" in the quote below gives me the impression that Kerouac expects everyone to make the effort to understand him and his disease when he hasn't made any effort at all, as far as I can see, to reach outside of himself and understand anyone else:<p>"It's all caught up with me again, I can hear myself again whining 'Why does God torture me?' - But anybody who's never had delirium tremens even in {their} early stages may not understand that it's not so much a physical pain but a mental anguish indescribable to those ignorant people who dont drink and accuse drinkers of irresponsibility." -p 95<p>Many people who have never touched a drop of drink face problems at least as difficult as those Kerouac had to deal with through no fault of their own. In addition, most of them have to hold down a job and face other responsibilities that care-free Kerouac was able to avoid for the most part.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Kerouac's grittiest and most stubborn work:<p>In a 20th century American tradition, along the lines of Bukowski and Fitzgerald, this is Kerouac's most painfully autobiographical book, documenting not just the later stages of his substance abuse, but chronicling an even more deleterious demon that took his soul:  fame.<p>This novel acts as a dreadful counterpoint to 'The Dharma Bums', a novel of contemplation and release, and its overlooked sub-theme of Kerouac's recognition of his own 'wine-stained teeth'.  'Big Sur' twists the Buddhas of old into vast valleys of craggy and vicious DTs inside his heart.  As such, this novel describes more than just alcohol, or more than the icon-making industry of fame - this is a novel of where the old words got Kerouac, and all his senstivities and insecurities.<p>Much of the old pantheon is here:  Ginsberg, as the floatsam Irwin who barely figures into the picture, and Dean Moriarty - AKA Coady, the friend now turned antagonist, who - fresh from his two years in San Quentin - 'feeds' Kerouac his mistress in a self-destructive drama to end his own failing marriage.<p>I've always enjoyed Kerouac's novels for their emphasis on character, rather than 'plot', and the storyline of this novel functions as many of his other works:  a geographical tension - in this case, the isolation of the cabin at Big Sur versus the urban psycho-sprawl of San Fran; and, coupled with that, the personal tension of of lust and loneliness trying to convert itself into 'love', as in 'Tristessa'.  The storyline here lacks the verve of 'On the Road' and the slow, spiritual gallop of 'The Dharma Bums'.  'Big Sur' unravels rather than tells:  it depicts a kind of mosaic of panic in which the pieces become disassembled until ending in the falsely optimistic final chapter.<p>This novel is unquestionably important to the Kerouacian Divine Comedy.  Stylistically, it relies on a manner of dream-convulsions to portray poor Ti-Jean's mind's eye, and it does so without the finesse that is the Kerouac poise.  Yet, this book languishes with an essential truth of Kerouac's own literary epic, offering a chronological statement that cannot be divorced from everything else.  Does it condemn fame, love, religion?  Does he condemn himself?  Instead of pushing for Paradiso, Kerouac takes Dante's slown-train into the depths.<p>Not simply a novel of destruction, this is a novel which wrecks regret, self-criticism, and identity upon the shores of Big Sur.  It's importance is its place within the mind of the man who wrote it.</span>

                    <span>Though not my absolute favorite Kerouac novel, I can honestly say once again that I loved every bit of it(if you want some of my overall favorite Kerouac work, check out On The Road or The Dharma Bums). It was, though, one of the quickest flowing books to read. Big Sur grabs you and drags you vigorously through the psychotic barriers of Kerouac's impending insanity, and will not let go until you have completed the extremely intense final chapters. Kerouac also included at the end of the book a poem entitled "Sea" that he wrote while observing the ocean at Big Sur.<p>Read Big Sur. It is an amazing work of literature, and is guaranteed to catch hold of you from the very first page. And if you enjoy this, do not stop there. I recommend anything with Jack Kerouac's name on the cover. Take my word.<p>Also recommended: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez</span>

                    <span>This book was written after all the damage had been done, and you can feel it as you read the book. Jack tried for years to get his writing out and by the time it was published he was well on to the state of mind you read in "BIG SUR". <br>   I really think this is a brilliant book, you get to experience a bit of the torment he put himself through to get away from the critics that called his work childish. You even get to hear about Neal Cassady ten years after "ON THE ROAD".<br>   A book well worth reading, slowly, Jack had a tendency to run paragraphs and sentences together, a technique he uses quite a bit in this book.</span>
