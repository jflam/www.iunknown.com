                    <span>"The Leader in You" is one of the valuable books, written by Dale Carnegie, but I believe that "How to win Friends and Influence people" is much more important to read, because it leads the reader to find the leader in him, in different social relations, and not only on the business terms. "The Leader in You", in my opinion, is considered a review of "How to Win Friends and Influence People". So if you are interested in reading "The Leader in You", don't buy it, but buy "How to Win Friends and Influence People", as it will attract your attention more. In the "Leader in You" you get introduced to the best ways that you should use in order to be a successful leader. 
<br />After reading the two books, I believe that they carry on the same themes, which are to be nice, moderate, and to praise people in order to get what you want. Through these ways and through many other ways, Dale Carnegie gets the reader to deal with people in a very successful way, so that they can make other people want what they (the leaders) want, and by that way they can be successful leaders, as they will always get what they want and they will always have people helping them, not because they fear them but because they love dealing with them, with their leaders. It is a book that helps any person to be a leader, not through power and evil means but by nice and precise attitudes towards others. 
<br />
<br />When I first read that book, I got the impression that it is contradicting the Machiavellian way of thinking. Machiavelli, in "The Prince" argues that a successful leader should always try to be feared and loved by people, and if the leader failed to be loved and feared, then he would better focus on one character, which is to be feared. 
<br />On the other hand, today, the perspective of being a successful leader is totally different, and that is obvious when you get introduced to Carnegie's perspective, as his argument proves that in order to be a successful leader, you have to be loved but not feared. Also, through his two books, which I mentioned above, you can learn how people think and how you can deal with them to get what you aim for.
<br />
<br />Finally, I got very impressed by "The Leader in You", but because I read "How to Win Friends and Influence People", I found how they are very much typical, and I found that "The Leader in You" is considered a great book, but "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is much organized, and is better written than "The Leader in You". That is why I would recommend that you would better buy "How to Win Friends and Influence People".

                    <span>The Leader in You: How to Win Friends, Influence People and Succeed in a Changing World by Stuart R. Levine and Michael A. Crom is, by all considerations, an excellent book.  Following in the fashion of Dale Carnegie, Levine and Crom tell readers in a concise, straight-to-the-point manner the truth about leadership.  This truth is that good leadership truly equals good communication.  <br>Some of the key aspects to valuable communication skills resulting in effective and successful leadership are motivating people, expressing genuine interest in others, listening to learn, and respecting the dignity of others.  In each chapter, Crom and Levine make extensive use of examples, usually coming by way of business success stories, or even excerpts from anecdotes of the lives of well-known individuals or important CEOs such as Denis Potvin of the New York Islanders hockey team, or Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart.  Personally, I found these examples extremely helpful and motivating throughout the course of reading The Leader in You, for through them Crom and Levine show how the principles they tell the reader are effective, and truly are.  <br>Furthermore, The Leader in You is a valuable read to anyone who seeks success both in his or her professional and personal lives, not just the business executive or the worker climbing his way up the corporate ladder.  I found this to be the case because the tenets Levine and Crom give the reader really concern fostering lasting and trusting relationships with others, not just shortcuts to getting ahead in the company.  I have learned valuable information and lessons about talking a walk in the other person's shoes, the importance of being personally happy before I can ever hope to be professionally successful, and what it truly means to be a good listener.   This is a book that will have a lasting effect on many aspects of my life, and I would without a doubt recommend it to anyone, for there will undoubtedly be a takeaway for everyone in any walk of life.</span>
