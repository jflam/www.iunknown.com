                <span id="Label1"><P>Weekly advice and support from a nationally renowned running guru.</P><P><B>John "The Penguin" Bingham </B>is a nationally renowned running guru. His columns in <i>Runner's World </i>magazine (circulation 550,000) inspire slow and mid-pack runners to take pride in their running, to know that all running is good running. He has been instrumental in the "Second Running Boom." As his fame grows, his books sell faster. <I>The Courage to Start </I>and <I>No Need for Speed </I>have sold more than a hundred thousand copies. </P><P>This weekly logbook is a complete updating of its first edition -- new layout, essays, advice and photos. It's still full of the Penguin spirit, which hundreds of thousands of runners embrace. Co-author <b>Jenny Hadfield </b>is John's personal coach, and she adds her excellent training advice to John's Penguin wisdom. Waddle on!</P></span>

                    <span>I liked the old Penguin Brigade Training Log a lot, but this new 2nd Edition is even better. It has space to record your basic training details -- where you ran and how far -- but also space to record the weather, your diet, heart-rate, cross-training, sleep hours, weight, and mood. It tracks your goals on a daily, weekly, and yearly basis. I like the new I-Rate system of rating your personal effort separate from the objective measures of mileage.<P>It keeps me focused and inspired every day, without fail. The new photos are beautiful, too. Really nice package.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this in a package deal along with "The Courage to Start". I am enjoying the book but the Training Log could be much more practically oriented without sacrificing the motivational advice for new adult athletes. The entry slots are small, though I do give the author credit for organizing them on a week by week format. The log's organization is limited by the two questions: what did you do? and how did it feel? Questions or entry slots which gave more guidance or were more specific would be a great addition. (What are your running goals? how many days/weeks/months till you plan to achieve that goal? Weather conditions? Pace? Areas for improvement? etc.) <BR> I found the advice included in the essays to be pretty limited, nothing more, and probably less, than what you get when you surf the web for running info. What's more, the quality of the pictures are really amateur. It's great that there's something out there for us "adult onset athletes" who run for the joy of it. It would be nice if the log book were truly inspirational instead of looking like something that your next door neighbor put together for the local running club.</span>

                    <span>This is the ONLY running log I have ever kept consistently, and I have discarded many others, too many to count. Bingham's font is large enough for older eyes to easily read; he allows you to chart your miles both weekly and yearly; and the pictures show real-life, real-looking people, not some bronzed babe in tight running regalia who probably never runs any farther than the distance to her hairbrush and makeup. Bingham knows the true penguin runner, and he hath delivered unto us a usable journal, amen!</span>

                    <span>I started running at the age of 40 and I wish this log book had been around when I started. I think it is a terrific book for beginners as well as seasoned runners. I have purchased four of these books as gifts. One of them was for me! I have had other log books but this one makes it fun to keep track. There is plenty of space to make notes and it is undated so you can start the book whenever. Lots of great pictures of "Penguins" and middle-of-the-pack runners and terrific quotes that are geared for you to read on the days when your mental outlook needs a pep talk. The back of the log contains additional info from Bingham, penquin testimonials, special notes for women runners, and training tips. Now lace up those shoes and go have fun!</span>

                    <span>I loved John's first book, The Courage to Start and I find myself going back to it again and again for that needed lift on those tough days...and we all know about those days. This Training Log is a nice companion to his book. With uplifting tidbits of 'wisdom' to cheer you on (I loved the one about thinking of your shoes as giant erasers, erasing some indiscretion be it food or drink), and pictures of 'real' people running and loving it (not like those you see in Runners World where you wonder if they were ever fat in their life, lol). I would encourage anyone to get this log book, since logging in your thoughts (nothing says it has to be times...thank goodness)helps you along your journey on this waddle pace we like to call running. Waddle on dudes!</span>
