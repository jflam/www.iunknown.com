                    <span>I love this book..It has great information on organizing your closet, updating and refining your wardrobe, and making your closet filled with "ready to wear" outfits and separates.<P> It was written by a professional wardrobe consultant and stylist. The great thing is that her tips can be tailored to each individual..be she a professional working women, stay at home mom or combination of the two.<BR> <BR> Her chapters on closet organization were the best..its easy to see how your closet can get crammed and filled with seldom used things..like your prom dresses, wedding dress, off season coats etc. She is correct when she says that you use only 20% of your wardrobe..and motivates you to get rid of the 80% that is cluttering your closet. It made me want to revamp my whole closet!!<P> Less helpful, were the chapters dealing with styling for your figure type. But that is hard to do in written form for most women. We need concrete examples...its better to just go to the store and try on bunches of stuff and see what works for your body shape.<P> Also included in the book were worksheets and lists to help you write down your style and things you need. I didn't find these very useful but i certainly appreciate the idea. All in all, I found this book to be very helpful..i have already culled out many clothes in my wardrobe that don't work for me and I appreciate having extra space in my closet. Plus, I look forward to shopping trips where i can be more selective of what i choose. Great book!!</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be extremely refreshing. Not only is it full of practical information, it also teaches the reader how to appy this information to their own life. I felt as it this book was talking directly to me. As I went through the steps outlined in the book, I felt as if the author were with me. The book anticipated my questions and offered guidance when faced with difficult wardrobe management decisions. <P>I have recommended this book to numerous friends and we all found it to be a pleasant surprise. After years and years of fashion books focused on a small population, this book talks to everyone. It allows the fashion weary to start slow and build a complete, versatile wardrobe. <P>I especially like that so much of the book begins and stays at home. As you know, so many of us would like to start over, but this is not practical. By shopping in our own closets, my friends and I were able to become reaquainted with pieces that have not lost their style or value. These pieces have taken on a second life. <P>Thank you for a wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>I was a little disappointed with this book. I am in my late 20's and I felt that the information was geared more toward older women. The styles presented were also a little more conservative than I like. Also, I felt some of the information was pretty basic. I agree with what another reviewer said about it being the kind of stuff you would have learned in Home Ec. <P>I would recommend this book for mature women who have not been shopping in many years and would like to update their wardrobe to find flattering styles. Not that I'm a fashion maven, but I was looking for a book to help me develop a distinctive personal style. IMO, this book just sticks to the basics.</span>

                    <span>from Marisa D'Vari, author of Building Buzz: How to Reach and Impress Your Target Audience (www.BuildingBuzz.com)<BR>....<BR>What I liked best about Andre's book was reinforcing the often-ignored notion that to most people, you are what you wear. In a simple yet edifying and entertaining voice, she shares valuable success secrets with her readers about how they can project the right image for any business or social situation. Thanks, Mary Lou, for reminding women people have to "see and trust you" before they can really hear and understand you.</span>

It really did not help me at all as a mature woman, needing to stay in style for my international career travel. I am going to return it to Amazon.</span>
