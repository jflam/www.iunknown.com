                    <span>This is a very nice introduction to the C# language using Visual Studio.NET. Although the book is referred to as a "Core Reference" it is not a reference in the typical sense. Microsoft Press also publishes a "Step By Step" book on the same topic which is a basic introduction for the inexperienced programmer. This book is a more advanced tutorial, more suitable for a programmer with Java or C++ experience. However, it is not a complete introduction to the language. Several major topics are missing including regular expressions, inner classes, and, most surprisingly, I/O. The book does cover a wide range of features in .NET and does a nice job of explaining how to use these features in Visual Studio.NET. The first half of the book is an introduction to C# starting with the basics and going up to threading and debugging. The second half of the book covers topics such as creating windows and web forms, ADO.NET, XML, and web services. The section on windows forms is the most complete while the other topics are covered lightly. Overall, the book is generally well written and well edited. I found no obvious mistakes. The book is in hardcover and comes with a CD containing all the code and a DVD with a 60 day version of Visual Studio.NET. The book is not as complete as the O'Reilly C# book but because it is more fully integrated with Visual Studio, may be more useful to most developers.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best Visual C#.NET books available in the market at this moment. It is a good mix and balance of tutorial and reference material, explained in a clear way. Visual C# is the brand new general purporse language that you can use to write any kind of application. Mr. Williams teaches you the language first, and then he shows how to use the .NET libraries with your applications. So you get an excellent foundation before dealing with the .NET framework.<P>The narrative is very easy to read and understand, and it will help you to see that the learning curve for C# is almost the same as VB.NET. This is the language of 21st century and with this book you will be a proficient C# developer in a short time, trust me. <P>I am a former VB6 user and moving to Visual C# with this book was a wise move and an easy one. Highly recommended!!</span>

                    <span>Overall I think this book makes a good reference. In chapter 7, I like the point about being careful to invalidate the enumerator if the underlying data gets changed. However, be aware the example has a "lapsed listener" problem. When the enumerator object is no longer needed, how is it supposed to be unsubscribed from the Changed event? If it never gets unsubscribed, then the garbage collector will not be able to remove it from the heap, thus you end up with a memory leak. Using System.WeakReference is one way to solve this problem.</span>

                    <span>I have read in the reviews of this book that it's geared towards the intermediate/advanced developer. I disagree! This book is orientated towards the beginner. If you're a seasoned professional in a language such as VC++, then I recommend that you bypass this poorly written book as you'll be done with it in a few weeks!</span>

                    <span>I've been reading this book becuase I needed a book that also talked about how use the parts of visualstudio like the windows forms controls and making web services. There's about 1/3 of the book on windows forms after the part anout using the language. i also have another book about just the c# language, but this one is good too. The way it automatically adds new infos to the online help is good too.</span>
