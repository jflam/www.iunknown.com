                    <span>What can I say?  This book is probably the closest Chinese book involving the art of parallel-argumentation that a person will ever get out of a Chinese book.  
<br />
<br />I love this book.  Plus, Lau really adds desert by his five highly detailed appendixes.  Way to go Lau!</span>

                    <span>Having read the Analects, I wanted to read further in Chinese philosophy. It was recommended that I pick up the Lau translation of Mencius, as it was widely considered the best.
<br />
<br />Even as a reader approaching his thinking for the first time, I was able to get quite a bit from reading the seven books. They were thought-provoking and crisp. I was interested in the notions of morality and good as treated in his analogies. This point is the famous difference between Confucius and Mencius and alone makes this book valuable reading. 
<br />
<br />The Penguin edition may well be the best available translation and I am sure that the essays at the beginning and end are useful for more knowledgeable scholars. Unfortunately, as a reader largely unfamiliar with his life and work (beyond knowing his role as a student of Confucius) these essays assumed a level of knowledge beyond that which I actually possessed. It would have been helpful for me if the introduction had been more concerned with basic context setting.  
<br />
<br />The appendices bound with the book contain essays on dating events in the life of Mencius, early traditions about Mencius, textual notes, history as depicted in the text, and the use of analogy as argument.</span>

                    <span>Compared to other Chinses philosophy classics, the Mencius is not that good.  It has many boring conversations, and just pales in comparison to the Analects.  I wouldn't say it is totally not worth reading, but I would suggest that this be towards the bottom of your "to-read" list of Ancient Chinese Philosophy.  Read the Analects, HsunTzu, Han Fei Tzu, Tao Te Ching, and Lieh Tzu fist.   I also recmommed A Collection of Wisdom by Rodney Ohebsion, which contains lots of great material from many of these Chinsese texts.</span>

                    <span>For those who don't know, Mencius was a disciple of Confucius' philosophy - probably the most famous. He helped spread it by adding his own flavour to the theories. This book presents them. It is easier to read than the Analects, in my opinion, as it presents much longer and more coherent paragraphs many of which are like stories. As a result, less time is spent getting acquainted with the background.<p>One of the key features of Mencius that separates him from Confucius is the book of Mencius has a lot of philosophical argument and rhetoric that is quite sophisticated. Mencius was a keen maker of illustrations in arguments. This is the book that contains the famous argument taht human nature is fundamentally good because a person seeing a child on the edge of a well about to fall in will initially be compelled to run and save the child.<p>The translation is great and makes the reading easier. There are useful appendices at the end which give the background in a logical way (eg a section on Mencis' view of history).<p>A great find!</span>

                    <span>Very few people in the West have heard of Mencius.  However, in East Asia he is known as "the second sage" of Confucianism -- second only to Confucius himself.  The eponymous _Mencius_ is a collection of his sayings and dialogues with disciples, rulers, and rival philosophers.  It is unfortunate that this work is not more widely read outside of Asia.  It is more accessible than the often cryptic _Analects_ of Confucius.  Furthermore, Mencius is arguably a deeper philosophical thinker than Confucius.  Buy this book and you'll get a fine translation of a classic of world literature and philosophy.<p>Mencius is most famous for his claim that human nature is good.  He illustrates this by asking us to imagine a person who suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well.  Anyone, Mencius claims, would have a feeling of alarm and compassion at this sight.  This feeling is a manifestation of our innate tendency toward benevolence.  Mencius is aware that, despite having this innate tendency toward virtue, most people fail to act in a benevolent manner.  But he claims that this is due to bad environmental factors, as well as a failure to cultivate one's "sprouts" of virtue.  (Lau translates "sprout" as "germ," a minor infelicity.)<p>Lau's _Mencius_ is probably the best complete translation of this work in English.  It also includes extensive supporting material:  an interpretive introduction, a glossary, and appendices on events in the life of Mencius, early traditions about Mencius, the text of the _Mencius_, ancient history as understood by Mencius, and Mencius's method of argumentation.  <p>James Legge also did a complete translation, _The Works of Mencius_, which is a little dated (it was completed in the late 19th century), but it is still a good translation, and includes the Chinese text, along with extensive notes.  I did a partial translation of the _Mencius_ for _Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy_.</span>
