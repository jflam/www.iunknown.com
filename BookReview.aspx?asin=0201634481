                <span id="Label1">This latest release of <I>Interconnections</I> is a competent update of a networking classic. Radia Perlman explains hundreds of details about getting computers--and computer networks--to talk to one another smoothly, accurately, and efficiently. Perlman, inventor of the spanning-tree bridging algorithm, covers the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model, bridges, switches, hubs, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), plus connection-based and connectionless networks. She also does a great job of explaining the underpinnings of internetworking protocols, including packet format, addressing, routing (both generically and in terms of RIP, RTMP, OSPF, and other protocols), and security. There's plenty of IPv6 information here, mostly from a theoretical vantage point.<p> The best parts of Perlman's approach to her subject are the little thought experiments that explain why various aspects of internetworking behave the way they do. For example, Perlman talks about Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) discovery by presenting four different hypotheses for figuring out MTU. For each possible solution, she discusses strengths, weaknesses, and real-life considerations. She applies this method to dozens of other problems and phenomena, making <I>Interconnections</I> a very close approximation of learning by experiment. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model, bridges, switches, hubs, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), and internetworking protocols.</span>

                    <span>Interconnections, Second Edition did something I didn't think was possible: it was better than the First Edition! <P>I personally like Radia Perlman's style. She writes in a way that flows for easy reading. Her material can appear to be technical, but unlike most technical material, you actually WANT to read more! <P>What I found most profound about this book is the fact that all major protocols are covered. There are comparisons performed between the protocols, such as IPv4, IPv6, CLNP, IPX, DECnet, etc. I have never seen this type of comparison anywhere! This alone is a wealth of knowledge that I can't underestimate.<P>Since I find myself also performing design work on behalf of numerous customers, the insight into why a choice was made during a protocol design is very interesting, and quite the learning experience. <P>Finally, Radia's humor is amazing. Her truth and personal opinions (and lets face it, with her history and influence on this industry, she is one of the few that has any right to criticize others in this industry) of how standards were derived is insightful and just plain fun to know! <P>I would recommend this book to anyone that wishes to know more about networking, to get a nice comparison of the differening protocols, and to learn a nice historical perspective of why things are as they exist today...</span>

                    <span>If you want to understand how things work at the data link and networking layers (layers 2 and 3) then this is the book for you. The author makes very clear the differences between bridges, routers, and switches - something that the marketing literature does not make clear :). She has a very readable and detailed descriptions of the most important protocols used in layer 2, especially the spanning tree algorithm used by bridges - as you might expect since she invented the algorithm! The descriptions of layer 3 protocols are also good, though not quite as readable.<P>The book contains a good mix of introductory concept oriented discussions and technical details. The author explains the technical, commercial, historical, and political ideas that lead to different protocols - adding context and colour with her own well thought out opinions. You can also find details at the level of packet layout information for many protocols. Really good stuff.</span>

                    <span>The networking universe is not purely TCP/IP. There is a ton of wacky stuff out there that even your friendly Cisco instructor likes to gloss over. Who uses CLNP or DECnet, anyway? And Ethernet just works, doesn't it?<P>Well, people do use them, Ethernet doesn't just work and one day you'll need to know what the hell is happening on your multi-vendor multi-protocol network, whereupon Radia Perlman will save your hide.<P>When I was recently posted abroad I had to decide which technical books to put in storage until my return and which to bring with me. I had about 150 such books, but I could take three at most. I took two: Perlman and Stevens TCP/IP vol 1. I've not missed the others yet.</span>

                    <span>Perlman does a fantastic job of writing about a topic she's obviously passionate about. Her ability to convey complex networking topics simply makes this book an excellent introduction to the subject, a great guide for people who don't need to be experts (i.e. marketing folks), and a technical text book. This book is both incredibly informative and entertaining, spiced with some of her own views, annecdotes, and history of networking. A great read, can you believe I would say that about a networking text?</span>
