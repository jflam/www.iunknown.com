<br />I met Michael Morris at a writers conference in 1999 way before he had any books out. He looked like a young John Grisham, working in a job where he interacted with Washington D.C officials. 'But, what I really want to do...' he said, with his head bowed, as if he were suddenly shy 'is write'. I looked at him and thought, 'Who doesn't, you're one of a million'. Two days later, after Michael and his wife returned to their home in the deep south, I picked up his new manuscript and began to read...and was stunned...this guy was gifted! I called my agent and said, 'You have got to sign this guy, this book is a winner.' She did. And that book, A PLACE CALLED WIREGRASS went on to win the Christy Award (like an Emmy ...for writing). Michel and his family remained friends with my family and while I was working on my forth book FLYING BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS: Flight Attendant Adventures on a Wing and a Prayer, he was working on his next novel. Then he called one day and said 'There is this song on the radio you have to listen too...it's called LIVE LIKE YOU WERE DYING and it's my story.' I said, 'That's great Michael, maybe you should call Tim McGraw and tell him that. Ha Ha Ha.' (I was joking because no one we knew...knew how to contact Tim McGraw') A few days later, Michael called and sounded in shock, 'I didn't have to call Tim McGraw,' he said, 'his people contacted me. Marsha, It's like it was meant to be.' LIKE YOU WERE DYING is a true story, not just for the father of Tim McGraw..but for Michael Morris as well...maybe that's why it's ringing in the hearts of so many people. And now, as this his third book sells around the world - and he is writing his forth, I don't think Michael Morris is one OF a million, but, one IN a million.

                    <span>First time reviewer. I have to say that this book is not at all "sappy." I very seldom read fiction but devour non-fiction. The song is the reason I picked up a copy of the book. This book is not War And Peace but it is not a trite little book. There is enough truth in here to make me buy copies for my four children. As a father I completely understood how the character felt torn between work and family. Maybe this is a book that more men can relate to - who knows. Bottom line is that the book is a good read.</span>

                    <span>I tried reading this book over a dozen times and could not get pass the first 10 pages.  This was a selection in my book club and none of the members liked the book either.  In fact we did not even bother discussing the book.  I love other books written by Michael Morris, but this one was just too sappy to make it worth reading.</span>

                    <span>This book is as good as the song. I loved the book as much as I loved hearing the song the very frist time that I heard it. The man who wrote the book was on the radio talking about it and I bought the book that day. By 10 o'clock at night I had finished it. This book is a fast read and since it's set in Atlanta I loved it even more! This book ties in the song but is a whole lot more too.</span>

                    <span>We've all heard this song, at least if you listen to the radio at any point of any given day. However, I had never heard of this book. A friend recommended it and I'm glad that she did. This is not some little fluffy book like I first thought. It's a story about life and love that left me thinking about my own dreams. A well written book that is not to be missed. I predict that it will be a 'sleeper hit' that will become a bestseller because of word of mouth.</span>
