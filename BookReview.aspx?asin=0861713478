                    <span>This is Bhante G's uncensored "career" autobiography. It starts from his poor home village Henepola and ends when he is made Chief Sangha Nayaka Thera for North America. Lot's of conflicts with other monks, lot's of intresting events. Many things has been happening to this little monk.
<br />
<br />If you expect to read from Bhante G's internal meditation experiences and spiritual development you will be gravely disappointed. He mentions his own meditation practice shortly only three times. No mentions of great effort in meditation, no lonely retreats, nothing. 
<br />
<br />For meditator this book is not inspiring. It potrays Bhante G. as a career monk. After reading his previous books I somehow expected more. Bhante G. if you read this, consider writing short meditation autobiography.</span>

                    <span>This is an American success story.  Bhante G. started out as a a boy monk who was born in a poor village in Sri Lanka.  When he grew up, he got a Ph.D.  He started a legendary monastery.  He became the Chief monk in North America of his sect.  He rides around in cool cars and sleeps in palaces  He uses the latest G4 laptop.  And, he returned to his village with a hero's welcome.    Bhante G. says that this is the fruit of his karma in this life and in past lives.   He has written many books.  He has appeared on Larry King.  He has given retreats and taught in Universities in every part of  the world. 
<br />
<br />I was interested in Bhante G.'s spiritual growth, but I didn't learn very much about it in this book.  I did learn that  he has decided not to pursue enlightenment in this lifetime.
<br />Overall, it was very interesting.  I read another book about a CEO and I am going to write a report about how they are similar.

                    <span>This is the story of a Buddhist monk who was born and raised in poverty in Sri Lanka, and through dedication to the teachings of the Buddha became one of the great figures in Buddhism in the United States and the world today. This is an inspirational, charming and delightfully accessible book about a good life, well lived. However, for anyone who expects to find a story full of easy living and religious perfection, this is not the place to come! Buddhist institutions are made of people, and those people are subject to the same anger, fear, pride and jealousy as anyone else is. Bhante tells many stories of his difficulties with entrenched Buddhist institutions. There is no perfection there.<p>Despite the fact that this is a kind of life that very few of us can relate to, so much of it is terribly familiar. Part of the beauty of this book is that it shows that we are all not so very different, that in the end we are all people, we all have problems, and that we all face the same challenges as human beings. The main reason that I love this book, however, is that what we are left with is the image of a good man who has lived an extraordinary life, but that this kind of life is within reach of all of us. Bhante G. does not, in the end, seem like a religious icon, so much as he seems like the better person in all of us.</span>
