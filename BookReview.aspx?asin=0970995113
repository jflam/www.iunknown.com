                    <span>The Dining and Lodging Guide is not, and was never intended to be, a guide to finding and driving Route 66. There's many good books and maps for that. INSTEAD, it is a valuable resource for finding places to eat and sleep while on your Route 66 journey.<p>Full dislcosure time...I am a member of the National Historic Route 66 Federation, and a Route 66 author and artist.  I had NO part in developing this dining and lodging guide...that was done by volunteers.<p>But, even though I have been researching Old 66 since 1981, I have found  several editions of this frequently updated guide to be very useful, and never travel the Route without it.<p>So, if you want to know a good place to stay in Vega, TX, or eat in Springfield Il, make sure this guide is in your glovebox!</span>

                    <span>Maggie Kaspersetz's review is very misguided. We doubt that she purchased the Dining & Lodging Guide. If she had, she wouldn't compare it to two sources that are travel guides and don't evaluate or even list places to stay and eat. We ask that you dismiss her evaluation as illogical.</span>

                    <span>Don't waste your money.  This book was useless.  I just returned from my trip on Route 66 and never once found this book useful.  I suggest Route 66 Adventure Handbook, by Knowles and highly recommend Traveling Route 66, by Freeth.  The last a great traveling companion helps figure out  mileage and what to see.</span>

                    <span>On a recent trip a few weeks ago from Chicago to Needles, CA on Route 66 we used this book extensively.  All motels and restaurants listed in the book were exactly as promised.  We were never disappointed. If you prefer to sleep and eat at NON-franchised establishemnts - you need this book.  There are franchised motels listed, but there are several Mom n' Pop motels & cafes still operating.  Even if your not traveling the Mother Road, most places are just a very short drive off of the boring interstate highways. Look for these places - you WILL enjoy the change of pace.</span>
