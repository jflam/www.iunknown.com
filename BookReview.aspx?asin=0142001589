                <span id="Label1">While the trial of Hitler's fallen elite at Nuremberg has been thoroughly documented, the interval between the Nazis' capture in May and June 1945 and the start of the actual trial in late November has until now remained shrouded in shadow. With Interrogations, acclaimed historian Richard Overy opens a new window into the Third Reich, providing an intimate glimpse of the savage dictatorship in its death throes. More than thirty transcripts of the interrogations are reproduced here for the first time, allowing us to hear the voices of the newly captured "Hitler gang"-including G&#246;ring, Speer, and Hess-as they squirmed under the Allies' glare. <i>Interrogations</i> is the stark and disturbing history of defeat; it lays bare as never before the human weaknesses that made the Third Reich possible.</span>

                    <span>"Interrogation: The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945" is a disturbing and enlightening book. It collect the transcription of the interrogations, put to different Nazi leaders, very soon after they were captured and before they were submitted to trial.<BR>The book address in the first part, the main issues with which the Allied were confronted, in order to mount a trial for the War Criminals. British, American and Russians, the French were incorporated later, had very different points of view and criteria as how to perform this. Who were to be indicted; which should be the charges; which will be the legislation used; who should preside the Court; who will conduct the defense; etc. These and other substantial points were being discussed even before the end of the war.<BR>As soon as the peace was signed, all Intelligence forces started to search for the Nazi leaders. Some were captured without problem. Some committed suicide before being caught or immediately after. They were disseminated in very different kind of prisons and receiving different treatment. Finally agreement between the Allies is attained and a common list of War Criminals produced. Once they were all rallied in one prison, they were subjected to interrogation, with a standard protocol and rules.<BR>The second part of this work centers on the transcriptions of these interviews.A very rich material emerges here. Curiously, much of it was not used in the trials, so it is little known to the great public.<BR>From this notes, Overy, wisely select and present very significant excerpts to the reader. He grouped them thematically and adds some personal comments. Different personalities and strategies from the defendant are shown: Göring boisterous and unremorseful; Hesse faking madness; Ribbentrop trying to look confused, overwhelmed by Hitler's power; Speer pleading some guilt and penitence. A gallery of dubious characters trying to survive blaming Hitler and deflecting their guilt. The depositions of the responsible of the extermination camps are devastating: they really can not grasp the horror of what they have done.<BR>A book to read in order to have some understanding of a dark period of Human history.<BR>Lastly, the hardback edition is a very beautiful object in itself, first quality paper and printing is used.</span>

                    <span>This is clearly an essential book for anyone interested in the Third Reich, the Holocaust or Shoah. Simply put, in their own words, rationalizations, justifications, and mystifications of the "Elite" leaders of the Reich, on trial at Nuremberg. Apparently well-treated, some were seemingly quite frank about their coming under the Führer's hypnotic spell and seeming to lose their own will, few apologetic and even fewer aware of the need to explain to the next generation of Germans what had transpired during the 13 year, not the 1,000 year, Reich. At least Dr. Goebbels, the master propagandist, had the foresight to spare his descendants the psychic pain and murdered his whole family before taking his own life.<P>It is acknowledged that Hitler placed into prominent positions persons with little or no background or experience in their positions of authority or domains (Ribbentrop was a champagne dealer, Heydrich a disgraced WWI Naval officer who became head of the SS non-Reich territories and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, or Czechloslovakia), placing his utmost confidence in them. And how could their have been people with "experience" in his ultimate aims, the domination of Europe and extermination of European Jewry? He had many men scurrying to act as they knew what they were doing, learning on the job, so to speak, and that, if anything, rings clear. Do you, the reader, remember a first job where you feared it would be found out you were a pretender, a fraud, a newbie? Imagine being given an entry-level job in command of thousands of slave laborers, displaced persons to be worked to the last pfennig of their worth and then destroyed, fed only enough to eek out that last pfennig of work...on the gate of many of the concentration camps (Konzentrationslagen) one sees the inscription ARBEIT MACHT FREI. I have seen the gate at Sachsenhausen, just north of Berlin, and used by the Soviets and East Germans as a prison for many years after the war. Usually this is translated as "work will make you free." I have understood a different meaning, a distinctly Germanic one. Arbeit--Work; Macht--Power; Frei--Unconfined....from my 1939 German dictionary. For, as we know, freedom is an American concept. Those three words were, at best, double entrendre or propaganda. As understood by Germans in the SS, a wholly different meaning was conveyed.<P>In a country where the Abitur (high school diploma) was looked upon as we in America might look upon a Master's Degree today, men of only elementary education took up the leadership in many aspects of the classless German society which Hitler sought to create. Of course, few such men went through the indoctrination of the Labor Service, mandatory for all young men issued spades to drill with instead of guns, the Hitler youth, or the concept of the Lebensborn (children born out of wedlock for the Führer).<P>All of these schemes, when shone under the light of day for the world to see, were doomed to failure. Yet the Elite seemed never to grasp this fact. They pursued their aims with whatever efficiency was possible, a German tradition. The trains ran in a timely manner nearly till the absolute end of the war, even after the massive bombings of major cities and bridges. Hugo Boss continued to design revisions in the war uniforms to account for shortages in quality material. <P>This is an essential book for a library on the 20th Century--not a "read" but a true reference work. What Germany and the European Union aspire to, and will become, has passed through the mind of Adolph Hitler and his collaborators, into the minds of the descendants of the "Täter" und "Opfern" (German for the perpetrators and the victims--to which the Germans now include the victims of Allied strategic bombing of civilian population centers).<P>As sure as the Persian Gulf Wars I and II were initiated in our national interest, understanding of the perpetrators of the various atrocities, and, as we know, in some cases exceptions, of the all-important period from the Treaty of Versailles to the end of hostilities in May, 1945 in Europe are part of the prologue to the 21st century. Some find history dull and heavy, but like the Law, history has a long grasp.<P>Read this book. More than once! My highest recommendation.</span>

                    <span>"Interrogations" by Richard Overy is an important book concentrating on the question of prosecution of the perpetrators of Nazi crimes during the WWII during the Nuremberg Trials. The book additionally claims a few insights into the character of Hitler political and military leadership, organization of Nazi state, character of Hitler's minions and the effects of these structures of German people. <P>First half of the book concerns itself with some legal questions facing the Nuremberg trials, dealing mostly with the ambiguous nature of the tribunal as both legislative and judicial authority, questions of legitimacy of the trial and reconciliation of French and Russian "rational" legal traditions and precepts of Anglo-Saxon common law. Additionally, political problems and disagreements between the Allies on the nature of persecution (although not punishment) are presented in some detail. Later, main defendants and their careers are introduced and the narrative moves to the trial itself.<P>In the second half, one finds affidavits and interview records for major defendants dealing with the nature and character of leadership and decision making in Nazi dictatorship. Most of them deal with the enigma of Hitler and his hold on military, economic and ideological character of Nazi state. Familiar arguments of "psychological" hold the superhuman strength of Furhers character, and the personal nature of the power structures in Nazi Germany are presented. <P>Overall, I find the sections dealing with the nature and legal aspects of persecution the most interesting. Unfortunately, the book suffers from the duality of purpose; one could not expect the exhaustive treatment of both the legal issues facing the Allies and nature of War in the same volume. Ad-mixture of primary sources as the Appendix is useful, if however diluting of the main points. One has a feeling that those were added to increase the size of the book, since they lack extensive indexing and other research tools one expects from the professional book in history.</span>

                    <span>'Interrogations' brings some new light to the mode of thinking of many of the top Nazis. I have read both 'Nuremberg' by Persico and 'Nuremberg Diary' by Gilbert, and I feel that these books can all interplay with one another. 'Nuremberg' is the overall story of the trial and its main characters. 'Nuremberg Diary' takes us behinds the scenes, so that we see more of the psyche of the Nazis. And finally, this book, 'Interrogations', is a worthy prequel. These are the pre-trial interviews, an area that has been overlooked in the main by chroniclers of the war crimes trials. Here we get testimony concerning Albert Speer's alleged plot to kill Hitler and his cronies; the testimony of Robert Ley, which is often overlooked as he committed suicide before the trials began; and the mystery of Hess's 'amnesia.' Also, some sobering testimony from extermination camp guards, discussing how they hated working in the crematorium because of the smell, but they got used to it enough that they could eat a sandwich while working.

This is the first I have read that takes you into the hearts and minds of the criminals responsible for the death and destruction during WW II. The what, where, and when have always been known. This helps to explain why they did what they did. <BR>There is also strong similarities between then and now. ...</span>
