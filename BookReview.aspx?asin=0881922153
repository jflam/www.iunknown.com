                    <span>Picked up this book in a book store because I though it looked good. It was. I have to admit that I was already in the thrall of the scablands of eastern Washington but this book really brought it together. There is an interesting biographical drama as a separate story. The basin by basin description of the columbia valley that follows can be skipped over, used as a tour guide, or cherry picked. Or, like me, you can read every page. First go see the dry falls and the excellent interpretive center there with its satellite photographs and topographic maps. Then read this book and marvel at what Harlan Bretz was able see from eye level. You will never look at Eastern Washinton the same way again. A steal at ten bucks!</span>

                    <span>This book excellently explains why the eastern half of the State of Washington and the lower Columbia valley are so curiously carved. It also shows how a truly observant scientist works, even though his vindication may be slow in coming. While some persons might wish for more color photographs, I believe the black and white format, particularly in the Grand Coulee region, better shows the power and scope of the floods that carved these otherworldly channels from bare lava rock. The drawing of a typical Bretz flood has to be seen firsthand to be believed. Another exemplary book on the geology of the West. Don't see Grand Coulee or the Columbia Gorge without reading this book.</span>

                    <span>I've lived in the Walla Walla River Basin for a little over a year. After reading this book, the surrounding area became more alive. This book tells of fascinating events that took place several thousand years ago that created many of the local landmarks. It makes my travels more interesting and personal as I recognize features described in this book. If your a highly educated geologists searching for some real meat, this book is not for you. For the rest of us, this book is written in easy to understand terms. If you live in the Northwest, it's a must read.</span>

                    <span>I'd like to give this book a higher rating, but I can't. Great subject, should be brought to the attention of everyone even vaguely interested in the forces that shape our landscapes, and a fascinating account of the Bretz "saga". Like Wegener, Bretz was ridiculed in his time for his outlandish theories; unlike Wegener, he lived long enough to see his theories dramatically confirmed. On a recent trip to the US I had the opportunity to drive across WA, ID, and MT, and was entranced by the coulees, Dry Falls, the scablands, and the stranded lake shores above Missoula.<P>So what's my gripe? Simply that, while the authors have done a commendable job of making the whole story accessible to lay readers, they haven't really done their subject the treatment it so richly deserves. The writing (shared by three authors) is uneven, tends to be repetitious, and would have benefited from tighter editing. The chapters describing Bretz and his battles with the geological establishment are the best and most readable; those describing the details of the post-flood geomorphology (sensibly ordered from Lake Missoula to the sea) are more ponderous. The photos are also a big disappointment - I would happily have paid extra for a book with up to date and well-produced colour photos, rather than the grainy monochromes which have been used throughout. Buy the book, marvel at the story, and imagine what it would have been like to watch the floods from a secure piece of high ground, but keep your eyes open for the day when the authors (or someone else) produce a livelier and more readable update.</span>
