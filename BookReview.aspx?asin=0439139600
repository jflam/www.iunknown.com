Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup.  He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years.  He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard.  But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards.  And in his case, different can be deadly.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Harry is growing up and Rowling is getting even better at her craft.  This, in my opinion, is the best of the series so far.  These are timeless books, books for all ages.  Being over 60 years of age, I must admit to enjoying them as much as my preteen grand children.  I admit they are probably overly hyped, but in lieu of their popularity and in lieu of the author's skill as a story teller, perhaps this hype in justified in the case of these books.  As with the others, I actually feel rather sorry for those who do not get a kick out of these stories.  They seem to have lost some of the spark in their lives, as we can see from their reviews.  Thay being said, I do recommend these highly for kids of all ages.</span>

<br />The Author's Skills Have Leaped.  I always said the first 3 Potter books were like "brain candy". Light and Easy to read. The story was simple and sweet and it was just all around fun. The 4th book is noticably different. The author's skills have much improved. Discriptions, Content, Overall Plot twists --everything.  As Harry Potter become more and more adult within the story, so does the writing style. 
<br />
<br />This was a great book with an involving story that managed to make every detail matter in the end, as well as many details from the first 3 books. I started the 5th book the very next day. I'll read it again some day.

                    <span> I loved it! I'm going to tell YOU about the greatest book of all time! Well, like all Harry Potter books, the main character is Harry Potter. He goes to Hogwarts, bla, bla, bla. But this year at Hogwarts, Harry is in the Tri-Wizard Tournament! But this is what's weird, Harry couldn't enter because he's too young, didn't try to enter because he knew that he was too young, but he was chosen to compete against the other players. I'm not going to tell you any more because I want you to read the amazing book. Danielle</span>

                    <span>The Harry Potter books are entertaining, but really they aren't that great.  If you want to read some really good books I recommend The Lord of the Rings series, A Wrinkle in Time, and Mrs. Frisby and the rats of NIMH. </span>
