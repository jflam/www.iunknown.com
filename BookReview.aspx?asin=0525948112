                <span id="Label1"> Jean Sasson met Mayada Al-Askari on a trip to Baghdad in 1998. One year later, Jean learned that Mayada had been taken without the knowledge of her family from the tiny print shop that she owned, and imprisoned in the notorious Baladiyat Prison&#151;headquarters of Saddam Hussein&#146;s infamous secret police. <P> Mayada&#146;s story both past and present is truly incredible. Her family was one of the most distinguished and honored families in Iraq. One grandfather fought alongside Lawrence of Arabia. The other was the first true Arab nationalist (admired greatly by Saddam Hussein). Her uncle was Prime Minister of Iraq for nearly forty years; her mother, an important government official.  <P> From personal meetings with Saddam Hussein and Chemical Ali to raising two small children as a single mother, Mayada&#146;s life was at once privileged, yet carefully balanced. But life can shift quickly in Iraq and Mayada finds herself thrown into a small cell with seventeen other women. The shadow women. The women rally around each other to share their unbelievable stories and in so doing gain the strength to survive. The names of the shadow women are scrawled in charcoal onto the cell wall in the hopes that one day one of them will make it out to tell others of their existence. This is Mayada&#146;s courageous story, but also that of her sisters.</span>

                    <span>I was against the war in Iraq in 2003 but after reading Jean Sasson's excellent book, I wrote a letter to President Bush stating that for the liberation of the Iraqi people alone from Saddam Hussein, it was worth it. Jean Sasson does a marvelous job blending Iraqi history with the Hussein regime and the life of Mayada. This book about Mayada's life opened my mind to see how evil Hussein was and how he ruled Iraq with an iron fist. Both Jean Sasson and Mayada are brave women who deserve big kudos for getting the horrible truth out about one of the most despicable dictators in modern times. This book is worth every penny for the eye-opening aspect alone, but the book is written so eloquently that it truly is one of those books that you can't put down. I finished the book in a little over one day. I highly recommend this book for those who were against the war because like me, it made me realize that the liberation of an entire country from true evil is just simply the right thing to do. Jean Sasson and Mayada are true heroes in my book!</span>

                    <span>No matter which side you come down on, with respect to the US/UK invasion of Iraq, you will be more than happy that the cruelties, as played out so vividly in this book, are no longer a fact of Iraqi life. For this, you can thank the coalition overthrow of the brutish mega-tyrant, Saddam Hussein, and his extended family of murderous thugs.<P>Jean Sasson has gifted us a tightly woven account of Mayada Al-Askari, a divorced woman of extraordinary lineage, leading an ordinary life in Baghdad. Mayada's life was simple: pursuit of the betterment of the lives of her children, while living in the midst of Iraq's latest, darkest period. <P>I was struck by Ms. Sasson's ability to place me within the virtual company of Mayada, and the "Shadow Women", while weaving Mayada's memories (as if Mayada herself were talking) with the fragility of the moment, amid the mind piercing horror of the hell that was their jail. No surprise that virtually every reader (will) feel a genuine out-pouring of emotion for the women, and all innocent Iraqi's who were subjected to the same wanton terror. I was surprised most by Ms. Sasson's ability to place me within the prison cell and torture chambers. She forced me to experience the despair and filthy stench that has nothing to do with the physical conditions, and everything to do with the depths at which humans are too often willing to sink, for too many self-serving, psychotic and sycophantic reasons... Even so, this book is really a celebration of a group of women who pulled together within the depths of evil, to ensure the victory of at least one of them, and to enable her to share their collective ordeal with us. Of some of them, I am truly in awe.<P>Get this book, and read it... Give it to a friend. We Americans are a criminally self-indulgent lot. We owe it to ourselves to experience, and understand, the insane cruelty that can obviate our unhealthy striving for ever more "coveted" comforts, and replace them with knowledge that, what (can) be taken away has far more to do with connections to ourselves, our families and intimate community of friends, and less with our SUV's and window treatments... The level of connections made by the "Shadow Women" was as astounding and heart-warming as it was wrenching and piteous. I hope Ms. Sasson is able to find these women and give us an accounting. She is also a remarkable woman, and I trust this is as important to Mayada and herself as it is to her readers.<P>BTW... This book reminds us once again, the daughters of lions are lions too.</span>

                    <span>Jean Sasson has given a voice to one of the most oppressed groups in the world today - Arab women. First with Princess and now with Mayada. After reading this book, it really makes it seem laughable the so-called "tortures" that US soldiers were doing to Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib. Saddam's henchmen would not have even used their methods to warm up. They went straight to beatings and electrocution.<P>The book was carefully written and moves very quickly. There are no slow spots. It was very revealing of the kind of lives people live under a brutal dictatorship such as Saddam's. Unfortunately, there are others just as bad, if not worse. Just ask the North Koreans.</span>

                    <span>As a huge fan of Jean Sasson, I keenly anticipated the release of Mayada, Daughter of Iraq. It was definitely worth the wait. This heart wrenching, eye opening book, tells the story of Mayada, an affluent Iraqi, and her experiences in prison in Iraq. A must read for all, especially considering the current circumstances. As usual, Sasson wrote with incredible flair. The magnificent descriptions really made you feel like you were there with Mayada, and made everything so real. I recommend this book to everyone, it is absolutely spectacular.</span>

                    <span>Mayada has to be one of 2004 top reads. Exploring the jail cells and treatmeant of Iraqians Mayada is a very touching story which will fill your heart with different emotions. Jean Sasson has yet again conjoured a wonder of a book. The book is put together so well and it even has a glossary if you dont understand the words. Mayada has all the cons of the Iraqian government and what Saddam and the government used to do (Uday who is saddams son used to let go of a tiger at busy restaraunts). Bizarre! Its starts off with Mayada, a newspaper journalist being imprisoned at Baladiyat where the guards torture people for days on and even killing them in the process (RIP JAMILA). She was imprisoned for accusations of herosy. This book is well put together but some parts seem fake and untrue and the ending wasn't good enough considering it had such a good story. So in all the only major con of this book is the bad ending(which cost it a star)</span>
