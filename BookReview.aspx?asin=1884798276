                    <span>Just because I'm educated (J.D., M.S.W.) doesn't mean I'm organized! This book helped me get over my clutter-induced guilt and on to the freedom of orderliness (NOT an oxymoron, as it turns out!), and to do so with smiles and laughter along the way.</span>

                    <span>I never thought of myself as a "Queen of Clutter;" rather I viewed myself as the "Keeper of Important Stuff." Only problem was, everything seemed important until I read "Love It Or Lose It"! The book's material was presented in a compassionate, yet direct, way that gave me the courage to look deeply at what was causing me to keep my clutter. It helped me realize that I was holding onto 'things' from my past as if they were actually the 'life' they once represented. Now I view them for what they are, release what is no longer needed, and by doing so, give myself the gift of freedom and space within my own soul that I now choose to fill with joy. <P>In Hawaii's culture, we believe all things are embued with sentient energy which holds our "mana," or spiritual essence, once it becomes ours. This belief made it difficult for me to 'release' certain things until LILI encouraged me to continue sharing my good and mana. Now, I rejoice knowing others are benefitting from things I still hold close but no longer need. <P>Mahalo, Mrs. Bedrosian and Hemphill, or thank you as we say in Hawaii, for bringing this light-hearted yet powerful 'life guide' to our world. I, for one, am eternally grateful for the future space and freedom I shall enjoy!<P>Iwalani Tseu<BR>O`ahu, Hawaii</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a quick, entertaining, well-organized, and useful resource in my quest to bring light and space to my home. It's full of practical guidance, and one of the best tips I received was the concept of trading time with friends to clear spaces, move items out of the house that never seem to make it past the garage, or run errands that are just no fun to do by myself. Most of all... it's nice to know that so many other people feel the same way about their clutter, and are facing the same issues as a result of it. Definitely a keeper, and a great gift for the clutter-challenged!</span>
