Real-world programming scenarios and easy-to-follow, step-by-step exercises offer the fast and clear instruction readers need to begin creating stable, efficient business-level objects and system-level applications. Readers also get code samples on a companion CD-ROM to study and reuse in their own projects. </span>

                    <span>One of the best C# tutorials available. Also quite a nice intro to OOP as well as the Visual Studio.NET programming environment.<P>If you are new to programming, coming from a non-OOP language such as Visual Basic 6.0 (or previous) or even a long-time coder who needs a quick into to the C# language, you should be able to find something for you here in this book. The first half of the book teaches you the basics of the C# language and how to program using the Visual Studio.NET programming environment. The second half introduces basic Windows programming, some ASP.NET as well as ADO.NET and even XML. <P>Obviously, Windows programming and using the .NET framework are very complex topics and no single book can possibly cover everything, but for the newcomer, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better starting place.</span>

                    <span>For once an MS Press step by step book has exceeded my expectations. This book does an execelent job of explaining C# from three perspectives. New to programming, C or C++ experience, VB experience. It explains the changes from the latter two and points out how this is an improvment.<P>As an experienced programmer, I've been able to skim chapters I already understand. There is a guide at the front that suggests chapters that I'd be interested in.<P>I also like the chapter format, that gives you a estimated time to complete each chapter.<P>I was scouring for a C# book that was going to give me as much info as I could get, without dropping the typical [money] for a computer book. This is definately the best one I found. I can refer back to it as a reference, and it touches on the other .net technologies too.</span>

                    <span>If you are familiar with Java, C++, Objective C, or SmallTalk, then this is a good starter primer for C#. This is particularly good for experienced Java developers that want to jump in, and get started on C#. The second part of the book is a solid primer on Windows Forms and other Windows specific bits of .NET. <P>I recommend this title.</span>

                    <span>I don't know why Amazon dumped all the reviews of this book, but this is the only book I'd take the time to re-review. Perhaps this is a newer edition, but I found no significant errors in the original. I believe samples work in both framework 1.0 and 1.1. Sharp and Jagger have produced an exceptionally readable, instructive, useful book that is the only one of eight I've read that I can honestly say I was sorry to finish. Every exercise was well written, taught me a major feature I needed to know, and made me eager to do more. The exercises are so well written I can refer back to them as guides to writing my own code but this is not primarily a reference book. I even got a reply to an email from John Jagger via his website. I'd buy anything along these lines he cares to publish! It's not the only book you may need, but should be among the first you read after you grasp the basics of the C# language and are ready to use Visual Studio.NET.</span>

                    <span>The book is wonderful if your new to C# .net and want a guided tour. However, even though the book goes over alot of examples the code samples are made to illustrate a point of the chapter and no reference on how the application was made is given. What I done to get the most out of the book was read it from cover to cover first and looked at what the code examples was trying to illustrate. After I read the book then i went thru each example and reviewed the code and tried to make my application work like they had without using their code. Others learn differently but thats the only way I could get anything from this book. I like the Chapter quicknotes. If you take those postit note tabs and put them on those pages they make a great reference.</span>
