                <span id="Label1"><P> In 1998, when Amazon.com began to recruit employees, they gave temp agencies a simple directive: send us your freaks. Mike Daisey -- slacker, onetime aesthetics major -- fit the bill. His subsequent ascension, over the course of twenty-one dog years, from lowly temp to customer service representative to business development hustler is the stuff of both dreams and nightmares. Here, with lunatic precision, Daisey describes lightless cube farms in which book orders were scrawled on Post-its while technicians struggled to bring computers back online, as well as fourteen-hour days fueled by caffeine, fanaticism, and illicit day-trading from office desks made out of doors. <P> You'll meet Warren, the cowboy of customer service, capable of verbally hog-tying even the most abusive customer; Amazon employee #5, a computer gamer who spends at least six hours a day locked in his office killing goblins but is worth a cool $300 million; and Jean-Michele, Daisey's girlfriend and sparring partner, who tries to keep him grounded, even as dot-com mania seduces them both.  <P> Punctuated by Daisey's hysterically honest fictional missives to CEO Jeff Bezos, <I>21 Dog Years</I> is an epic story of greed, self-deception, and heartbreak -- a wickedly funny anthem to an era of bounteous stock options and boundless insanity.</span>

                    <span>Read this as amusing fiction if you must, but don't mistake it for history. The author's exploits at Amazon.com made him a legend in his own mind but never really fooled anybody for long - except perhaps himself. If hindsight has granted the author a new perspective on his journey, it's one distorted by self congratulation and lacking in honest introspection. One might even call it payback.<P>To really understand this book you need to do continual translation. A desperate lateral move, under threat of termination for slacking off, was apparently a "promotion". Getting caught lying about goofing off gets recast as a clever ruse to get ahead. A department name ("Business Development") does false double duty as a job description, when in fact the poor schlub did nothing but customer service email for every day of his 21 tortured dog-years. Who but an overheated venture capitalist would buy this package? Calling a chronic underperformer an insightful social historian doesn't make it true.<P>In the upside-down dot.com world where crushing losses became pro-forma profits and the "new economy" briefly replaced common sense, is it any wonder that such a book would emerge? Step through the looking glass with Mike if you choose but look closely; it's a funhouse mirror to begin with.</span>

                    <span>How interesting to write a review about Amazon.com for Amazon.com!<P>This is a surprisingly well-written book about the inner workings of Amazon during the heady pre-.com bomb days and the effects the potential for insane amounts of money can have on otherwise normal people.<P>Quite insightful and semi-degradatory (but only semi) toward Amazon itself, which comes off as nearly the antipothesis of the warm and fuzzy side it tries to present to the public. Instead, Amazon is shown to be the same as any other massive company intent on massive growth: overwhelmed, overworked, understaffed, etc. <P>Which isn't that big of a surprise when you think about it. I mean, who really thought a company this size and this fast growing didn't have some real velociraptors at the helm? <P>The big is genuinely funny though and presents some great commentary on the mentality of the time. Definitely worth the read and kudos to Mr. Daisey.</span>
