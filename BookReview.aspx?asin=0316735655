                    <span>Since it first premiered in 1975, "Saturday Night Live" has been immortalized with tv specials, rip - offs, movies and dvds. But not one person involved with the show has come forward to tell the stories that emerged from behind the stage. Until now.<P>"Live From New York: An Uncensored history of "Saturday Night Live", as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests" is as engaging as it is informative and witty. With commentary from hosts, writers, cast members and even Lorne Michaels himself. The cast commentary is especially compelling. The stories that influenced were the ones concerning the infamous and controversial moments surrounding "SNL", like when Nora Dunn refused to appear on the show because Andrew Dice Clay was hosting, and when Sinead O'Connor tore up the picture of the Pope. And Victoria Jackson's commentaries on Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks is acid - tinged intrigue at its best. There are also touching tributes to John Belushi, Chris Farley, and Phil Hartman. It is not without flaws. The newer cast members could've gotten more of a say, and Eddie Murphy contributed to it as well.<P>But I still think this is an enjoyable book. It;'s perfect for anyone who ever dreamed of saying, "Live From New York, It's Saturday Night!"</span>

                    <span>...but ultimately fascinating document of our generation's most beloved variety program.<P>The stories are told primarily by those involved, in their own words, verbatim, including cast members, writers, hosts and producers. Some surprising tidbits include an almost universal dislike of Chevy Chase, Nora Dunn's harsh treatment of co-stars, and Eddie Murphy's grudge against the show (he is the only cast member who would not appear on the 25th anniversary special and is not interviewed in the book).<P>The book reads like an interview. There is almost no narrative from the authors. It's like reading a filmed documentary where the camera switches back and forth between the interviewees. This format fails only rarely, and the comments are usually placed somewhat in chronological order, and occasionally are lined up together, highlighting common viewpoints between participants where they exist.<P>Most of the memorable, gossipy events are covered, such as Nora Dunn's exile from the show when Andrew Dice Clay appeared, Jean Doumanian's brief stint as producer that almost got the show cancelled, Norm Macdonald's ousting as Update anchor, Sinead's unanticipated Pope-bashing, etc., etc., etc.<P>A fascinating read that will make you look at the show in a different light once you finish it. May also make you feel a bit misty-eyed, as you link SNL memories with memories of where you were and who you were as you witnessed them live.</span>

                    <span>My favorite bit of commentary is from the shlub named after a German onion.<P>ALAN ZWEIBEL: "It's like when I was doing Garry Shandling's first series, we wanted to have Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop on. I said, 'Of course we'll fly you out', and she said, 'Well, what about Lamb Chop?' What *about* Lamb Chop?!? She says that Lamb Chop gets a seat. I swear to God, I almost threw my back out giving her the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't insane. I laughed and she said, 'Lamb Chop doesn't sit in the back'. I said, 'If I'm not mistaken, are we talking about the same Lamb Chop? Because, you know, it's a sock! It's a sock with a button, okay?!?' And it ended up we didn't use her because it was too insane."<P>Chevy Chase said something that had me prostrate on the goddam floor for 2 hours. (Regardless of the fact that Chevy was a dope-addled creep.) Terry Sweeney says to Chevy: "Is there anything I can do for you?" Chevy: "Well for a start you could lick my balls."</span>

                    <span>Normally, I'm not the type of person that reads any books, let alone a 600 page book that is all transcripts of people talking. All in all, this book doesn't seem that exciting.<P>Contrary to what one might think, it's a truly fascinating saga of one of the most beloved shows ever to grace television.<P>You delve in from the beginning, hearing the contradictory stories of who came up with the idea for the show and who knew what people to get Saturday Night Live on the air. <P>There are stories and recollections from every aspect of the show imaginable. The producers, the writers, performers, hosts, network executives, etc. Seemingly, everyone that has ever been involved with the show, (with the exception of Eddie Murphy), is avaialbe to tell the tales of behind the scenes of the most famous sketch comedy show.<P>The most beautiful aspect of the interviews that make up the book, is that nobody holds anything back. Everyone there tells what they see/saw as the truth of the matter at the time.<P>You get to find out what happened backstage when Chevy Chase and Bill Murray ran into each other as Chase came back as host. Joe Piscapo and the rules of Sinatra impressions. The drugs, the sex, the bitterness, the love, the hatred, the demise of so many people throughout the history of the show.<P>Some of the most fascinating and interesting peope are the ones you'd never expect. Conan O'Brien, Tim Kazursky, Lorne Michaels, Jeneane Garafaolo, Dick Ebersol, etc. all have wonderful ways of pouring out their hearts and minds about what it truly was like in studio 8H for the past 30 years.</span>

                    <span>For anyone who was in New York City in the early- to mid-seventies, it will probably be remembered as a period of darkness and danger. Crime was rampant, every union went on strike every other week, and the threat of fiscal calamity was ever present. At its darkest moment, when "Ford to New York: Drop Dead" hit the headline, something astonishing exploded from NBC studios: Saturday Night Live. Somehow this one show made urban life a little more bearable, and a television legacy was born. And, somehow, New York had saved itself.<P>Authors James Miller and Tom Shales collected nearly thirty years worth of quotes and interviews, and amassed them in this terrific book, "Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests". For a hefty volume (over 600 pages), the book is a very quick read. While a good deal of time is spent honoring the deceased cast members, the tone never gets maudlin nor nostalgic. In fact, it was refreshing to remember some of Belushi's, Radner's, and Hartman's antics. Not surprising, drugs and ego clashes abounded. Talent + money + 1970s = celebrities on controlled substances, after all. What was interesting were the comments by the guests. Buck Henry has a great story, but I won't give it away here. "Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests" is a fascinating look at one of the bright moments in an otherwise dark milieu.</span>
