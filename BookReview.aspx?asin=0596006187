                    <span>I can go on and on about what this book contains, but others have already done it. I'll just cut straight to what I think of Photoshop CS One-on-One
<br />
<br />If you really want to understand how Photoshop works, this is the book for you. It breaks things down to a level I can understand. I personally like the many illustrations provided, so that I can understand and follow along the many different options you can do to an image. I hate it when a book goes on and on about how to do something, and it has no screenshots or pictures to show me what it is I'm reading. This book is quite the contrary. It will guide you along step by step, explaining certain terminology in case the you are a beginners like me, who doesn't understand a lick about photo editing.. I received this book yesterday, and I am still learning new things I can do with Photoshop. Qute frankly, I know a whole lot more right now than I did yesterday, thanks to this book.
<br />
<br />I give this 4 stars just because it requires some reading and that I'm a slow reader.</span>

                    <span>I have 4 books on Adobe and almost gave up on the program. This book saved my efforts. This book is clearly written. The illustrations are top notch and most of all, the writer actually knows what he is talking about. Warning,,,, many books written for PS are written by MAC users and their snobbery comes out in their material when they make reference to us Windows users. This guy teaches as if he uses both MAC and Windows. Also, the CD and the hands on lessons are excellent. I really can't say anything bad about the book. Thank you Mr. McClelland for an excellent job in putting together this book. I encourage everyone to buy it first before another book.</span>

                    <span>It is probably my fault, but this book will teach you how to manipulate and correct photographic images and nothing about how to use photoshop to create web designs and layouts. I am not talking about HTML. I want to design the comp a website with photoshop. :-(</span>

                    <span>I am a Photoshop instructor at a community college in Wells, Maine and I have to say this book is exceptional! From start to finish it provides the reader with easy to follow tutorials (with humorous personal anecdotes to help keep it "real" for the students), exceptional images available on disk to work along with and quick summaries at the end of each chapter.
<br />
<br />I have found that not only can a novice Photoshop user easily pick up the book and learn the ins and outs of the program ... But a seasoned veteran can also learn a few new tricks as well. Sometimes it may simply be different approaches to the same problem, other times it is a new feature offered only in later versions of CS. 
<br />
<br />Whatever the reason is that you need assistance with photoshop, I suggest this book to be your first stop. More likely than not it will be your last. </span>

                    <span>I have just finished the "Adobe Photoshop CS One-On-One". This is my first time that I am working on Photoshop in my life and I know so much on this software. Deke make this book in a comfortable way that even if you are a green-Photoshop-worker you could start from this book that give you the starting point and the engine spark of the beautiful world of Photoshop. Deke thank a lot of this book it's was worth the time of reading it. Know I can really run on this software because I have the basic-plus to do it.</span>
