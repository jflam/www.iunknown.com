                    <span>I had high hopes for this book, but after reading it I realized how I got fooled by Peter Montoya's marketing plan for himself. He has branded himself as "the" guru of personal branding so that he can sell whatever he writes. In that regard, this book is a living example of how to manage a personal brand; however, in terms of substance it is quite a dissapointment. It is full of superficial observations and suggestions that even my mom could come up with. Peter, thanks for teaching me that if I want to be a successful brand I need to differentiate myself by being indispensible expert. That was such a revelation. But if you like Anthony Robbins, you might also like this. I am so glad I bought this used. </span>

                    <span>The Personal Branding Phenomenon by advertising professional and trainer Peter Montoya is a solid guide to using the process of "Personal Branding" to advance oneself and one's career by enhancing a personal ability to influence others. Personal Branding involves taking control of how an individual is perceived, including the perception of the personal values, abilities, and personality traits that other people associate with the individual in question. The Personal Branding Phenomenon presents Eight Unbreakable Laws behind great Personal Brands, such as The Law of Specialization - that a great Personal Brand focuses on one area of achievement, and trying to be a jack of all trades makes other people think that you are a master of none. The Personal Branding phenomenon is very highly recommended reading for anyone seeking to improve their skills and abilities to affect others and to enhance the emotional, financial, and social qualities of their personal and professional life.</span>

                    <span>Having been a broker and worked in the securities industry for more than a decade, I have a fairly sound perspective on selling intangibles.  In so many cases, the first sale is yourself.  <p>Montoya provides a practical and motivating roadmap to establishing a credible and attrractive brand that can provide the basis for a secondary sale of virtually anything - from stocks to services to widgets.  Anyone who knocks on doors, cold calls or represents a product will find value in reading and heeding the Personal Branding Phenomenom -- from the entry level salesman to the executive looking to jumpstart a career.</span>

                    <span>This book is great! Montoya is so insightful.  After reading this book I will never look at my life the same.  I think this book is a must read for anyone who wants to take their business or life to a different place.  The information is so powerful I bought several copies to give to my employees.</span>

                    <span>I had high hopes for this book, having recently attended a seminar put on by Peter Montoya's agency - but at best it is a blatant sales pitch  for Mr. Montoya's advertising agency.  After looking at the glowing reviews listed here, I was at first surprised to see a review from a "Topher" - the speaker at the seminar I attended was named "Topher".  A coincidence?  Possibly. Until you notice that almost all of the reviews come from Southern California - the very location of Mr. Montoya's agency.  Amazon.com readers might be better served if some one other than Mr. Montoya's "friends" actually wrote some reviews.</span>
