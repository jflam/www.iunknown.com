                    <span>After reading Graham's personal history I was dissapointed that there was nothing else written by her. This book fufills that dissapointment. She provides all sorts of views about Washington even though she doesn't agree with them all. There are articles written by Nancy Reagan, Henry Kissinger, Alice Roosevelt, and many, many more. A great read for anyone interested in Graham or Washington.</span>

                    <span>I am not completely finished with this book, but wanted to post a review urging all who are interested in the history of our country to read this.<p>Mrs. Graham has gathered articles from many people associated with the govenment and also some who were natives of Washington and in the social scene.  Some were White House employees.  She has written an introduction to each article which is helpful.<p>There are many interesting stories never seen before.  I especially liked the articles of behind the scenes preparations for the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1939 by White House employees.  Eleanor Roosevelt's article is different than the one she has in her book as it does not include the stop at Hyde Park.<p>Mamie is presented as a difficult taskmaster by the White House seamstress.  All good reading.<p>I don't know if young folks will enjoy this book as much as I did, but they should give it a try.<p>Only objection.  There were not enough pictures!</span>
