                <span id="Label1"> With endorsements from two of the largest and most influential public speaking groups -- the National Speakers Association and Toastmasters International-- this book is written by an award-winning speaker and storyteller. Stories add depth and interest to any presentation. They get an audience listening, add a change of pace, teach without preaching, provide a context for information, and create a bond between the speaker and the audience. This practical, down-to-earth guide will teach readers how to use stories and humor to support their speaking objectives.  From the apparently "spontaneous" story that's planned well in advance to an entire presentation that is a story, the author demonstrates how professional speakers use stories and humor, and shows how readers can use these elements to add polish and appeal to their own speeches and presentations. Readers will find a wealth of step-by-step ideas, tips, worksheets, and exercises to help you make effective use of stories. They'll discover how to create the critical elements of successful stories, learn how to see with a storyteller's eye, master techniques like foreshadowing and pace to create interest and drama. They will even find out how to become a likable narrator, keep their presentation balanced, and fresh - even when called upon to repeat it often.  This is an ideal reference for professionals and novice speakers who want be remembered by their audiences. <B>Part of the Essence of Public Speaking Series.</I></B></U></span>

                    <span>I ordered this book to get some useful hints to improve the building and telling of (funny) sorries. I recieved a motley collection of what sorries supposed to do and general knowledge on sorries and humor.<p>Let me give an example for the whole book on the basis of her advice on using humor. In the chapter which is dedicated to the usage of humor itself you will find such interesting topics like:<p>- How to make a speech<br>(After reading the book so far I have no idea. Perhaps it might be a little bit early to talk about a speech before you described at least the basics of humor.)<p>- What is humor?<br>(Oh, here we are ... But after finishing the section I still have no idea. Maybe five quatations of about three lines each are not very much and by the way wasn't at least a related topic of the book developing ideas on my own? Shouldn't that also be true for the author?)<p>- Why all the interest in humor?<br>(I actually want to use it. Who cares?)<p>- Key differences: The humorous speaker, the humorist, and the comedian<br>(A chance to fill another two pages)<p>- Humor that works and humor that doesn't work from the platform<br>(One of her recommendations: "Never Tease Anyone in Your Audience". Never bore anyone reading.)<p>- Male and female differences in humor<br>(Never thought about that ...)<p>- Who laughts when<br>(Only a collection of generalities on different audiences but might indeed be helpful - unfortunately with a little bit more than two pages quite short.)<p>After all I can warmly recommend the book to somebody who has no idea of telling a storry and has the time and wants to go to the trouble of finding a few well hidden useful informations. But as a book on presentation techniques for advanced people who are at least able to speak to two others sitting around a table, it's not worth the money.</span>

                    <span>This is a valuable book for the public speaker who would like to enhance the speaking style by the use of stories and humor. It provides practical tips and exercises to make effective use of stories in public presentaions. Stories have always been used in our society not only to add flavor and appeal to presentations but also to instruct and inform the audience.  The first few chapters of the book deal with the importance of the use of stories for our generation and what follows is a clear road map for story-tellers out of the rich experience of the author and many other accomplished public speakers like herself. This handy guide with eleven chapters deals more with stories than with humor. Each chapter provides a summary and some exercises at the end. The basic nuts and bolts provided by the author here have been very useful to me in my teaching and preaching.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most valuable books on public speaking that I have read.  Before you buy a book on one liners, joke book or how to keep them laughing. Read this book and find  out how to develop your own personal stories. I took it page by page and found that I had an amazing number of stories to develop.  As she says: Your own stories will ring true. I know a CEO of a large company that starts each speech with a very dumb joke that he seems to think works.  He must pay a lot to his speech writer. In real life people laugh at old jokes that are O.K., but they are still old.  I have been crafting my own stories after reading this book. It makes me sound like a more interesting person than I am. It has got to be a lot fresher material, Im the only one that lived it.  I bought a bunch of joke books early on and I wish I could get my money back.  They become boring so fast. The only story worth telling is one that is relevant to your point. That is where this book comes in.  The book details so many aspects of humor. How to use humor. Where it comes from. Shaping stories. The best in the Essence of Public Speaking Series.</span>

                    <span>Author's comments: Bore no more!  A step-by-step guide for finding, developing and sharing great stories.  In addition, the section on humor offers important rules for using humor effectively and appropriately.  Great storytellers sense the inherent drama in life's daily activities and work to heighten it, taking ordinary moments and transforming them into extraordinary insights. This book is a must for clergy, speakers, teachers, presenters, parents, sales people, association executives, business people, therapists, and anyone who wants to improve his/her communications skills.   Includes:  ways to find great stories, how to build characters and drama, use of significant detail to make your stories "sing," presentation techniques, practice techniques, tips for stage presence, when to use humor, where to find humor, how to deliver humor and who laughs and when. By exploring the tools of fiction writers, I encourage my readers to awaken the theatre of the mind.  Once our audiences experience our stories, they will never be the same.  Using the techniques in this book faithfully, you too can tell compelling stories!</span>
