                    <span>This book caught my attention when it received rave reviews from major newspapers, magazines, and critics when it came out (which you can find on the Internet). The writing is interesting and moves along smoothly. James MacGregor Burns knows his material well. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of FDR.
<br />
<br />The theme and emphasis of this book is that the three Roosevelts came from very elite and rich of the elite and rich, and yet battled concentrated wealth and attacked the plutocrats. Because of this theme, the book is slightly geared to that perspective. 
<br />
<br />The book begins with the solemn scene of President Lincoln's funeral procession, which Theodore Roosevelt as a child watched from an upscale residence. The book then shows how Theodore Roosevelt was influenced by Lincoln's presidency. 
<br />
<br />Despite coming from an elite social class (and young Theodore Roosevelt did view himself as elite), he rejected living only the life of comfortable luxury to do what he thought was right. On the one hand he was rich, educated at Harvard, an intellectual, a writer, mixed with the elite class, and conservative. On the other hand he was progressive, a tough guy, a rough rider, and created government for the benefit of the country as a whole. His intellectualism (masked behind his tough guy persona) brought him into contact with smart ideas of good government. 
<br />
<br />Theodore Roosevelt acted boldly in some circumtances, while in other circumstances he acted compromising (like a skillful politician.) This was very much in the model of Lincoln who moved at first to only protect the union, seemingly acted in a compromising way (like a skillful politician) until the war seemed to be under control, and then made his masterful move to abolish slavery - a truly magnificent achievement.
<br />
<br />Many aspects are Theodore Roosevelt's presidency are not mentioned, such as his vibrant policies in foreign affairs. That is beyond the theme of this book, which emphasizes his very progressive views, which laid the groundwork for the New Deal.
<br />
<br />The book shows that Franklin Roosevelt followed the path of Theodore Roosevelt. Like T.R., FDR was born into a rich, elite social class. He entered politics, became under-secretary of the Navy, and then governor of New York. T.R. was in FDR's wedding to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was from T.R.'s family circle. And he used masterful political skills as president like T.R. (and Lincoln), except that FDR took the power and achievements of the presidency to an all-time high, transforming that office into the "imperial presidency." 
<br />
<br />FDR's presidency is covered fairly well for a concise biography like this. Readers wanting a more thorough understanding should read Conrad Black's "Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Champion of Freedom" or William Leuchtenburg's "Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal."
<br />
<br />The book shows that Eleonor Roosevelt was a tireless champion of issues for ordinary people and the disadvantaged. She took up causes that her huspand politically could not. She championed the anti-lynching law when FDR had to be silent or risk losing his political coalition. She astounded a group of impoverished workers on strike by showing up to their gathering to show her support. Here was a well-dressed lady of the highest education and refinement showing up without security to show her support for their cause. 
<br />
<br />The biography of Eleanor Roosevelt is where the book really shines. There are no other concise biographies of her that rise to this level of excellence.
<br />
<br />All three Roosevelts (Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor) made "The Time 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century" list. FDR was ranked the runner-up most important person of the 20th Century. (Einstein and Gandhi were the other two of three people singled out for the top spot). 
<br />
<br />This enjoyable book is a great way to learn about the three Roosevelts. Just keep in mind that the theme of the book slightly overemphasizes their progressive/liberal aspects and omits other aspects. Recommended, especially for the Eleanor Roosevelt biography.
<br />
<br />If you want a superb biography of the Roosevelts that is somewhat concise and a pleasure to read, this book is for you. 
<br />
<br />In response to the reviewer who states that Burns is a New Dealer and biased, I say that it is not true. Burns is very fair and accurate in this book, and I feel he is very professional and unbiased in his approach to history. For example, I read a newspaper article where he said that Ronald Reagan was a great or near-great president because Reagan was a transformational leader. You would never hear a biased New Deal liberal say something like that. Also, I never read anything to suggest that Burns is a New Dealer. That was a little before his time. He's a historian. His biography of George Washington is also very good.
<br />
<br />On the back cover is a glowing review of this book by David Gergen, a Republican and a former advisor to presidents Nixon and Reagan. Also on the back cover are glowing reviews by historians/biographers Robert Dallek, David McCullough, and Blanche Wiesen Cook, who each wrote a book on at least one aspect of one of the three Roosevelts.
<br />
<br />"The Three Roosevelts" is simply a terrific book and a great way to learn about the three Roosevelts without having to read three lengthy biographies. I highly recommend it to anyone from high school age and up. It also strikes me as a book that would make a great gift.</span>

                    <span>This novel was immensely informative and entertaining. I am an English teacher who reads a lot, and I could not put it down.  I loved the descriptions of leaders such as Huey Long and Gerald Smith and the isolationist movement.  It was also impressive that it was so well-balanced and avoided sensationalism and cheap shots.  The authors did not take sides or make quick judgments.  You must read this book.  My two favorite sections were the descriptions of the New Deal and the class struggle in New York during TR's time.</span>

                    <span>James MacGregor Burns and Susan Dunn, Democrats by conviction, give an unequal account of the life of three Roosevelts by dedicating most of their biography to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. MacGregor Burns and Dunn show their audience how these three patricians left behind a relatively easy life to descend into the arena of politics. Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt had to overcome their prejudices about other classes, religions, ethnicities and races to get an understanding of the issues at hand and, at times make, painful compromises to get things done. MacGregor Burns and Dunn explain to their readers that the three Roosevelts have ultimately left an indelible imprint on the psyche of the nation by each setting an example of transformational leadership. On the domestic front, the country has been working on the best possible reconciliation of the respective interests of business, labor and consumers as well as the rights and duties of its respective races and ethnicities. Abroad, the country has weighed the pros and cons of an interventionist policy on a case-by-case basis to safeguard its vital interests, and to advance the cause of a world that espouses the values of responsible democracy and capitalism.</span>

                    <span>An interesting fact of American politics - that many of our Presidents came from the "upper class" of American society - is the central premise of "The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America."   In this book, co-authors James MacGregor Burns and Susan Dunn examine the role played in American history by arguably the most influential "patrician" family of the twentieth century - the Roosevelts of New York. <p> "The Three Roosevelts" is essentially a book containing short political biographies of Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt (TR) became one of our greatest Presidents. Early in life, his sense of "noblesse oblige" caused him to choose a career in politics rather than a life as a member of the wealthy elite.  He was elected, in turn, state representative; then governor of New York,  as a Republican.   He was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the McKinley Administration.  Three years later, he was elected Vice President of the United States, and succeeded to the Presidency  when President William McKinley was assassinated on September 14, 1901.   His seven years as Chief Executive were some of the most successful of any Chief Executive up to then. <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was a young man who appeared to have little of his cousin Theodore's intellectual acumen, driving ambition, or ideological bent. Franklin followed his famous cousin into politics, but unlike his cousin, Franklin became a Democrat.   Like Theodore, Franklin's political career advanced steadily. In rapid succession, he was elected State Assemblyman, then State Senator.   By age 31, he had been appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Woodrow Wilson. <p> In 1921, FDR was stricken with polio, which paralyzed him from the waist down. In 1928, after a seven-year hiatus from politics, FDR was elected Governor of New York. His two two-year terms were highly successful, but by then FDR already had his eyes on the biggest prize of them all: the Presidency. <p>From 1929 to 1932, during the early years of the Great Depression, FDR proved himself a capable governor of  New York.  By 1932, after three years mired in the Depression, Americans were ready for a change. They elected FDR - the man promising Americans a "New Deal" - as President of the United States. <p>The vast majority of "The Three Roosevelts" is taken up with an account of FDR's "transformation of America" during the Great Depression. Here, Burns and Dunn portray Roosevelt as a man employing a pragmatic approach to governance... try whatever works! Congress passed a body of legislation that was tremendous in scope. For the first time, the Federal government actively intervened in American life in an effort to make life better for all. The modern welfare state was born. <p>The third of the "three Roosevelts" - Eleanor (ER) - was an integral part of her husband's political success.  After her marriage to FDR, Eleanor remained indifferent toward politics, although she steadfastly supported her husband's political ambitions.  As FDR's political career progressed, so did Eleanor's interest in politics. In fact, she was much more of an ideologue than Franklin. Burns and Dunn imply that Eleanor grew to have a tremendous influence on Franklin, possibly pulling him more and more to the left of center during his Presidency. <p>On April 12, 1945, after thirteen years as President, years which saw the United States struggle out of Depression and stumble into a world war, Franklin D. Roosevelt died.  He had helped build the modern welfare state, and had guided the United States to a position of victory in the Second World War. <p>In the years following FDR's death, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to be a major influence on American politics. Through her nationally syndicated newspaper column "My Day," ER continually interjected her ideas and opinions into the national debate. She was appointed as an American delegate to the first organizational meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Later she would serve on a UN commission that authored the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. She championed the cause of equal rights for all Americans, and was vocal in her support of the new nation of Israel. <p>When "The Three Roosevelts" appeared in bookstores in the spring of 2001, I eagerly bought a copy. This was the first book I'd seen in over twenty years that was written by James MacGregor Burns, the historian best known for his two volume biography of the 32nd President - "Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox" and "Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom."   <br> <br>My hope was that Burns and co-author Susan Dunn would provide a penetrating examination of what caused this trio of extraordinary individuals to leave behind the values and traditions of their 19th century "patrician" class, in favor of a progressive and at times socialistic political agenda.   It is a question left largely unanswered.   "The Three Roosevelts" remains a book very long on biographical information and very short on historical analysis. <p>The authors show an almost complete lack of objectivity toward their subjects. Burns is well known as a liberal "New Deal" Democrat, and his political bias shows on practically every page. He is ably abetted by Dunn.   The result:  "The Three Roosevelts"  is practically a paean of praise to TR, ER, and especially FDR.   Criticisms of the "three Roosevelts" are few, and even those are largely muted.    Burns and Dunn's unabashed, gushing admiration of the "three Roosevelts" is annoying, and limits the usefulness of the book as an objective study of these fascinating characters in American history.</span>

                    <span>Trodding the well worn path of assessing the administrations of TR and FDR, and the historical significance of THE THREE ROOSEVELTS naturally means covering some very familiar territory. Teddy the extroverted outdoor adventurer; FDR - complex, secretive, manipulative, and Eleanor the activist. So what's new? The authors offer the view that without the three, the course of 20th century US history would have been vastly different. "The genius of these three leaders lay in their recognizing the needs of the people early on, sensing their political mood, mobilizing their support, and then - above all - acting" The common theme then is that the THREE ROOSEVELTS "charted the course of progressive reform in America." They brought "transformational change".<p>It's a nice try and the book does explore some possible common motives that drove these three activists. Family, culture and the social environment all have some role to play. As a result the biographical sketches provided on each is sufficiently detailed. The problem with the theme is that the two men - their personalities, the way they governed, and their administrations - were more unalike than similar. TR was somewhat puritanical, FDR something else entirely; TR's side of the family was traditionally Republican while FDR is an icon of the liberal democratic tradition; FDR governed through "brain trusts", of personal followers (the first example of modern-day "cronyism" some argue) wheras TR delegated and relied heavily on a very strong cabinet.<p>Overall the author's portray all three in very favorable terms, moreso FDR and Eleanor; not as much time is spent on Teddy. Negative views of FDR's latter terms, such as in THE NEW DEALER'S WAR by Thomas Fleming, will not be on these author's reading lists. Contrary to such books, here FDR is not seen as weak or ineffective following his 4th term victory in 1944.</span>
