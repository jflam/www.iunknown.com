                <span id="Label1">This book is the next best thing to personally talking one-on-one with Coach John Wooden. Together with longtime friend and fomer L.A. Laker Jay Carty, John Wooden, ESPN's "Greatest Coach of the 20th Century," shares life-building principles that you can apply to enrich your own life and that of others. Coach Wooden One-on-One consists of 60 daily devotional readings. Each one begins with a page of treasured thoughts from Coach, followed by a page of Jay Carty's comments that expand upon them. Each reading is made even more memorable by opening and closing passages from the Bible-the book that has shaped John Wooden's life more than any other.</span>

                    <span>I am impressed that John Wooden put his highest priority on the character of the players entrusted to him. He would never allow his players to criticize one another and took personal responsibility as a coach for his students' improvements. <P>He says that Love as described in 1 Corinthians 13 is the most important goal for life's center. What great wisdom this 90+ year old wise one leaves for us.<P>The Cross of Christ was held secretly in his palm as he led every game. What humble man who made sure that this book would not place him on a pedestal; but rather, the LORD of Love as the core teacher and Top Coach of all of life! <P>Truly impressive!</span>

                    <span>Coach Wooden is a man I have admired as a sport's fan. I was in college during Coach Wooden's unbelievable run as the coach of so many NCAA championships while at UCLA. But, what I didn't know, until reading this book, what an amazing teacher he was to his students (athletes) and to those who had the priviledge of spending time with Coach away from the court. Coach Wooden shares his thoughts, his philosophies, his heart in this very well-written book. But the added bonus is that the reader gets a chance to hear from one of his assistance at UCLA, who adds some light into this man's dedicated life. Jay Carty, former college basketball star and LA Lakers' player,and author of several inspirational books, shares his humor and wisdom along side Coach Wooden. The tandem is irresistible. You won't want to buy one - you'll want to buy several to share with others who are fans' of basketball or participants of the game of life.</span>

I also bought this book as a gift for college students. It's been a popular gift among my friends.</span>
