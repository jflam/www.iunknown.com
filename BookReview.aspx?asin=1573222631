                <span id="Label1">Chang-Rae Lee, named by <I>The New Yorker</I> as one of its 20 writers for the 21st Century, has confirmed his place in that company with <I>Aloft</I>, a masterful treatment of a man coming to terms with his own disaffection. In two previous novels, <I>Native Speaker</I> and <I>A Gesture Life</I>, Lee, a Korean-American, writes of lives being not what they seem: in the first, the protagonist is an undercover agent; in the second, the two halves of Franklin Hata's life never quite come together. Both novels won numerous awards, including Best First Novel, the Hemingway PEN Award, the American Book Award and the Asian-American Literary Award, among others.  In <I>Aloft</I>, Lee revisits alienation, a fractured family, mixed heritage and the quest for identity.<p>  Jerry Battle, 59-year-old widower and father of two, retired from the family business--the unmistakably earthbound Battle Brothers Brick and Mortar--buys a small airplane because "From up here, a half mile above the Earth, everything looks perfect to me." All is not well below. Jerry knows it, saying<p>  <blockquote>...the recurring fantasy of my life... is one of perfect continuous travel, this unending hop from one point to another, the pleasures found not in the singular marvels of any destination but in the constancy of serial arrivals and departures, and the comforting companion knowledge that you&#146;ll never quite get intimate enough for any trouble to start brewing.</blockquote><p>  His view from aloft saves him from the gritty reality of the detritus of life--and from life itself.<p>  This high-flyer must come to earth, however, when he finds that his daughter is newly pregnant, diagnosed with cancer, and refusing treatment; his son, who is running the company, has piled up enough debt that bankruptcy is imminent; and his father has gone missing from his assisted living facility. Jerry can no longer say, with impunity, "Jerry Battle hereby declines the Real." Lee takes us on great side trips into the pleasures of food and recreational sex; his wife Daisy's death; his longtime lover Rita's almost endless patience, weaving long, Miltonic sentences that start in one place and end up miles away--flights of fancy--trailing clouds of insight and poignancy.  With <I>Aloft</I> Lee just keeps getting better. <I>--Valerie Ryan</I></span>

                    <span>The writing in this Chang-Rae Lee novel is some of the most beautiful prose you'll ever come across. Metaphors and the like abound at every turn, and the words flow like water over smooth stones. And as if that weren't enough, Lee has given us a great story. Jerry Battle is the main character in this riveting tale of suburbia, race relations, assimilation, and insight into the human heart. His name alone is loaded with meaning. "Battle." And that's exactly what he does: battle himself, his ideals, and everyone else. My only reservation with this stellar read was some of the details regarding the flying of the plane. Other than that it was excellent---on the same level as Perrotta's "Little Children" or McCrae's "Bark of the Dogwood." Two other books dealing with suburbia, assimiliation, dysfunction, and the kitchen sink.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Without giving too much of the plot away, chang-rae Lee has written the 21st century American novel. Jerry Battle is the quintessential American male in today's suburbs. Partly out of place because he is not a blue blood, he is in a bind of trying to preserve or pass down his work ethic to his children, who have grown up comfortably because of battle's successes. Battle notices things society has said are politically incorrect, most notably people's races. Battle's grapples with himself, the ennui which he finds himself in, rita, his son and his besieged daughter, is presented in ways that oftentimes cuts right through in unexpected parts of the novel. To novice readers, this may seem incoherent. it is not. It is brilliantly placed -- as if to signal that beneath the potemkin calmness of the suburban life -- one cannot escape these problems.<P>More impressively, the book has been ridiculously criticized as having been written too smoothly. The prose is flawless--the novel is not as coherent as it should--these highbrow critics assert.<P>They are mistaken.<P>The genius of the novel is in its prose. By telling the embattled--and in the end a hopeful and optimistic--take of Jerry Battle--with sentences and paragraphs that are technically brilliant and flawless while still leaving something to be desired--or a bit of a troubling aftertaste--Chang-Rae lee shows us he is a brilliant wordsmith who used the medium and his prose to both serve as metaphors for the embattled jerry battles everywhere, facing external and internal turmoil beneath a facade of perfection.<P>The 21st century's Great Gatsby. I had never heard of this author before, but I am going to buy his other books.</span>

                    <span>Chang-Rae Lee has written an inspired novel that is eloquent in its lonely disengagement, which is what most of us experience, if we're honest, with our own heartbreaking families.

                    <span>What's most amazing about this story is the simple fact that Korean-born Lee has nailed it. So what's "it," you ask? Well here it is-- the ebb and flow of American "innerdom," that booming bass drum that reverberates at the base of our consciousness and alters it's intensity as we plod through the motions, and emotions, of daily existence. <P>The metaphor of the title is not lost. Inside the head of Jerry Battle,(like all of us), looms a quiet storm beyond the sunshine. The trick is to remain outside of the black clouds as long as humanly, (and humanely), possible. Much like Frank Bascombe in Richard Ford's seminal novels, Battle is the American everyman. Jerry wants nothing more than to stay away from the storms of strive, bad news and overbearing commitments, all the while knowing that attaining anything remotely close to that would mean he's lived a failed life. Life is best when it takes cares of itself. What Jerry wants is to enjoy his dreary existence as enjoyably as he can. But stuff happens. Always. And personal drama demands our attention, physically and emotionally. Best to stay aloft. <P>But, while one can stay aloft past the point of decency, the soaring ride can last only so long. Still, the stolen moments feel good while you're living them. While I don't know how universally human this trait is, I can sure vouch that it's certainly alarge part of the American self.<P>Ultimately, it may be argued that Lee has "simply" performed a great imitation of the best on the shelf, but even if so, Aloft is an undeniably credible piece of work to say the least.</span>
