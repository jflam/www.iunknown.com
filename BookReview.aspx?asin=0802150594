                <span id="Label1">Mikhail Bulgakov's absurdist parable of the Russian Revolution.  <P>A world-famous Moscow professor-rich, successful, and violently envied by his neighbors-befriends a stray dog and resolves to achieve a daring scientific "first" by transplanting into it the testicles and pituitary gland of a dead man. But the results are wholly unexpected: a distinctly and worryingly human animal is on the loose, and the professor's hitherto respectable life becomes a nightmare beyond endurance.  <P>As in The Master and Margarita, the masterpiece he completed shortly before his death, Mikhail Bulgakov's early novel, written in 1925, combines outrageously grotesque ideas with a narrative of deadpan naturalism. The Heart of a Dog can be read as an absurd and wonderfully comic story; it can also be read as a fierce parable of the Russian Revolution.</span>

                    <span>Bulgakov established himself as one of the most talented comic writers from Russia - if not one of the most talented, period. This, one of his early works, showcases his love of satirical farce, focusing this time on the attempt to reform that which needs no reformation.<P>The story is simple enough on the outside: A doctor takes in a wounded stray dog, gives it a prissy name, and treats it to a life of luxury. Then, when the dog least expects it, the doctor turns around and implants a human pituitary gland and pair of testicles in him. Gradually, the dog develops into a monstrous... human?! Exactly.<P>This is not a book to be taken at face value. It's vaguely funny if you know nothing about Russian (esp. Soviet) history, and *hilarious* if you've done your homework. Bulgakov's rousing, snide commentary on the controlling government he despised was extremely controversial when it was first written, but nonetheless an invaluable addition to the world's literature.<P>As an aside, get the Mirra Ginsburg English translation, which is arguably the best one available--the Michael Glenny translation reads like a translation, and sacrifices some of the comedic affect of the story.</span>

                    <span>Mikhail Bulgakov, best known for his brilliant novel "The Master and Margarita" was steeped in the theatrical craft. When his books were censored, he wrote a wild, heartfelt letter to authorities in Soviet Russia, asking that, if they were not to be allowed to publish his work, would they then assign him to work in theater, even as a lowly stagehand. In one of Stalin's capricious moves, Bulgakov was, indeed, assigned to work as an assistant director at a Moscow theater.<P>Meanwhile, Bulgakov continued to amass what must be one of the world's great hordes of literary work unpublished in the lifetime of an author. "Heart of a Dog" is probably his most viciously anti-Soviet, anti-Proletariat work, and it reads like a cross between Orwell's "Animal Farm" and Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" but with Bulgakov's intense sarcasm and humor thrown in. The book is so dramatic, it's almost impossible to read it without seeing it run like a film or play behind your eyes as you read it.<P>A professor (whose Russian name is a play on the scientist Pavlov) adopts a mongrel dog. The dog Sharik (Fido, Rover...) is grateful! His life on the street has been hard, he's been kicked, scalded with hot water and he is starving. The professor feeds him well. Ah, he's gaining weight and healing up. What a nice man! A god, even, well, to a dog. But wait a minute! The professor, noted surgeon that he is, is preparing to operate. He seizes the dog....<P>And then we see the results of the professor's cruel experiment. A dog gets a human brain portion and begins to develop as a human. But he isn't a nice friendly, tail-wagging human. Oh, no. He's low, a cur, yes, a dog of a man who chases cats uncontrollably, pinches women's bottoms and drinks like a fish (oops mixed metaphor there.) He demands to be registered and get papers like a human being in Soviet society. And the authorities are anxious, even rabid to assist him. Sharikov takes a first name and patronymic that is so inappropriate, so hysterically funny that you have to laugh out loud. Then he gets a prominent job as a purge director, eliminating those counter-revolutionary cats from Moscow's pure Communist society. That is, until the professor cooks up a plot.<P>This is a gem of a book. Bulgakov shares Orwell's deep hatred of totalitarianism, but unlike the delicate satire of Orwell, Bulgakov writes with massive belly laughs of deeply sarcastic humor and over-the-top jokes. He's a dramatist at heart, and this book shows his theatrical thinking, where exaggerated movement and stage props play as much a role in exposition as dialog. <P>This is a true small masterpiece and should appeal to just about anyone. It would be a very good book for a high school or college literature study. It is really wonderful, and prepares the reader for Bulgakov's wildly out of control masterpiece "Master and Margarita." Don't miss this book for anything!</span>

                    <span>Placed within the boundaries of post revolutionary Russia (October revolution 1917) this novel with its dark atmosphere pierces deeply into bones of a reader, leaving him amazed and stunned with a size to which can escalate human stupidity, and evilness and unintelligent behaviour by following the paths of some greater revoultion, of some welfare for all.<BR>By walking the alleys of Moscow, professor Petar Petrovic Preobrazensky comes across a wanderrer dog, and after feeding him, he performs an operation on him, in which he combines part of a dead man body (dead man is alchocolic, violent, and member of communist party)with the parts of a dog.<BR>What is caused by operation is already presented in some other novels like 'Frankestein' but here (considering that this is Bulgakov and all...) is totaly unexpected. Dog starts to transform, slowly at first, into a human being whose parts he now posesses. What becomes apparent in the process are all the bad thing one can have when "suffering" from a posession of a human heart. He losses all nobility of a dog, ant transforms himself into a man that he used o be before, with all negative sides that remained.<BR>Association with the president of House Comitee Svonde, will lead to major problems.<BR>Bulgakov uses his famous, fluid style, not allowing break beetween narration and dialogue, though short this novel keeps his reader glued to his chair, and doesn't allow him to leave mists of post revolutionary Moscow, mists of human spirit (in which was believed that by mere act of revolting (violent), all became different than it used to be, neglecting the fact that people that used to live under empire are the same people the now live under Lenin)<BR>Though somewhat flawish on some places, with weak links between objects and verbs, with holes in some spaces, that should (or could) be filled with more detailed narration, this novel stands side by side with the rest of Bulgakov's work.<BR>Thumbs up!</span>

                    <span>It's just something about those Russians. I guess because they've had to put up with so much turmoil, for so long, historically; or it could be those long Russian winters; but for whatever reason they have produced a steady stream of excellent satirists for the past two hundred years. Refer to Nikolai Leskov's LAUGHTER AND GRIEF, for a mid 19th century examination of the phenomenon from someone who first noticed it. Leskov's narrator, Vatahvskov, states in a conversation amongst his colleagues that the feature most singular in Russian society is "its abundance of unpleasant surprises." <P> Which brings me to Bulgakov and to HEART OF A DOG, for it is a novella full of "unpleasant surprises," both happening to and instigated by, Bulgakov's singular literary creation, Sharik (aka Mr. Sharik, aka Citizen Sharikov, aka Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov, commisar of cat control, etc.) Bulgakov takes an absurd situation (think of Gogol's "nose" wandering around the streets of St. Petersburg for comparison) and crafts it into a wonderful parody of the societal madhouse that was 30s Moscow under the party's intolerable decrees. His is a portrait of political correctness run amok. Citizen Shvonder, the representation of all things banal about the collectivist mentality of the era is the Bulgakov's primary target in this regard. His jealous rage at the fact that professor Phillipov is living the high life, while he and his ilk are sharing one room apartments, remains comically ineffectual. It was Bulgakov's way at getting back at all of the party appartchiks that were in fact causing him a great deal of consternation and physical hardship at the time. <P> A reviewer who was critical of this work as being too much akin to a Chagall painting was drawing an accurate analogy. Yet, coming from a perspective in which magical realism has become an accepted literary technique, I don't consider that a drawback. It is part of the same Russian tradition. The fanciful and the grotesque have long been an integral part of Russian fiction. Bulgakov is simply one of its more famous and adept practitioners.<P>BEK</span>

                    <span>This book is fantastic. Bulgakov had something to say and he said it outright. As all those busybody do-gooders out there in the world march down the road to becoming oppressors, this guy stands in the ditch and spits at them as they pass. I laughed a lot.</span>
