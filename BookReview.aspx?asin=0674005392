                    <span>In response to Tabsaw's "brilliant" book review, I would offer a more balanced perspective.  Yes, the slave narratives provide interesting reading, but what evidence is there that these are historically accurrate?  In fact, a quick review of how the WPA collected these narratives should give an clue as to their reliability.  Most were done by whites looking to support their perception of slavery in the 1930's.  The people interviewed were elderly and their stories written down by their white interviewers.  Gee...no chance for embellishment or mistakes in that process!!  And Tabsaw just assumes that the white recorders were able to keep their bias out of the narratives as they transcribed them!!  Hey..show me a single interviewer who is able to do that!!
<br />
<br />Johnson's book, on the other hand, is an excellent work of scholarship.  He does cite his sources (that is what those numbers mean at the end of sentenses or paragraphs, genius!!), and had Tabsaw taken the time to look in the section called "Notes", he would have discovered that Johnson is relying upon a wide range of primary and secondary sources to tell his tale.  The picture he paints is one of horror and dehumanization.  Slaves were treated like animals with little regard given to their well-being.  Johnson takes the reader inside the slave market where the smells, sounds and conditions of slavery cannot be ignored.  It is a compelling and disturbing read.
<br />
<br />In a larger sense, Johnson's work is also a commentary on Southern life as a whole during the 1800's.  The enslavement of fellow humans required a new and different social structure.  The patriarchial society that ensued brought with it profound implications for relations with women, property rights and behavior.  Johnson makes it plain that the slave culture came to dominate Southern life. 
<br />
<br />I recommend this work highly!!  For anyone interested in what the process of slavery was like, this is the place to start.  Once finished with the book (which I doubt Tabsaw actually read cover to cover because of the simple-mindness of his review), one will have a clear picture indeed of what life was like for slaves awaiting their purchase and the interactions that occurred with the white owners.  The slave narratives are interesting reading, but background knowledge is necessary for an informed arguement.  Johnson's book provides the needed background and helps put those narratives in context.  READ THIS BOOK and see what life was like in an antibellum slave market.

                    <span>Slavery in our country's history was grievously wrong, wrong, wrong...but this book was dry, dry, dry.  It left out very basic details and was bogged down in the author's repetitive, plodding musings.  My mind would drift trying to get through one paragraph (and the paragraphs are quite wordy.) I wanted to soak up this book and its information.  Unfortunately, it was just too dull and overwrought, and I came away knowing merely a bit more about the New Orleans slave market than I did going in.</span>

                    <span>This is a well-written book on an interesting subject.  The author keeps the subject moving by the way he has the book organized.  It follows in the path by which a slave went from one plantation to the slave market in New Orleans to a new plantation in the Lower South.  I enjoyed reading the narrative.</span>

                    <span>this book was assigned to me as a summer reading book for my advanced placement american history course... after reading the first chapter, i was automatically interested. i wouldn't exactly say i couldn't put the book down, but having to read it was more like an interesting leisure activity instead of a boring read. johnson's use of citing people who reappear throughout the book was very useful because it was more obvious that the horrors of the slave market were true statements from real slaves instead of a general statement without a citation. i strongly recommend this book to people of all ages!!!</span>

                    <span>In a book that argues that the slave trade itself fundamentally defines American slavery as a whole, a focus on the brutality and inhumanity of slavery would be expected.   The tragedy of individuals torn from their families, kept in inhumane conditions in the slave markets, and sold to strangers who likely would physically abuse them is certainly one focus of Soul By Soul.  However, Walter Johnson has gone much further than that in defining the slave markets as central to our understanding of slavery.  Through creative interpretation of numerous personal and business documents drawn from slave dealers and owners, the court transcripts produced when their bargains went awry, and the haunting memoirs of slaves who either came through the markets themselves or had relatives who did, Johnson shows that the act of buying a human being was profoundly important to the Southern mind in ways that transcend economics or dynamics of power.  It is thus not possible to dismiss Johnsonï¿½s interpretation with the argument that the majority of slaves never passed through the tradersï¿½ hands, so their experience with the market was negligible and therefore of less importance than Johnson would suggest.  This is a book less about the experience of black slaves in the market than about the effect those markets had on the white psyche.<p>Johnson sees southern whites as consumers, ready to be marketed to in the modern sense.  Traders knew this and were prepared to advertise their wares in ways that would allow those consumerist impulses to be satisfied.  The purchase of a first slave for a man just starting to build his fortune was an act of hope; the buyerï¿½s dreams of prosperity rested upon the slave whom he had chosen, in a sense transferring dependence from the slave to the paternalist himself.  Wealthier buyers could impose their own fantasies upon their purchases; domestic slaves could bring respectability to a household by relieving the masterï¿½s wife from physical labor.  Slaves could also establish a masterï¿½s reputation among his peers by being ï¿½stubbornï¿½ or ï¿½unrulyï¿½ slaves whom the master could break, establishing his power. They could also embody sexual fantasies, allow a white man to create a role for himself as a paternalist, or simply reflect well on their owner by being ï¿½good purchases.ï¿½  Much as a man may express his desired appearance to others by purchasing a certain model of car, and judges others buy what they drive, so did slaveholders define and judge themselves according to the quality of slaves they owned.<p>Similarly, just as slaveowners defined themselves according to their actions in the market, they also defined slavesï¿½ humanity according to their market value, using racial and physical markers to determine the abilities of their purchases.  However, the human nature of their property inevitably led to slave owners being dissatisfied with their purchases; slaves seldom fulfilled the materialist fantasies of their buyers.  Violence was the surest response, as slave owners expressed their disappointment with ï¿½faulty products.ï¿½  Slaves could be returned for failing to perform as the traders had promised, but more often they were simply whipped.  Presumably, slavesï¿½ common experiences drew them closer to one another, as Johnson argues.  However, his sources show that slaves frequently judged each other in ways reminiscent of the slaveholdersï¿½ own criteria, that is upon skin color, intelligence, attitude, etc.  Arguing that they automatically united against whites is perhaps sensible, but not supported by Johnsonï¿½s sources.  This however, is one of the few flaws in Johnsonï¿½s otherwise insightful analysis.</span>
