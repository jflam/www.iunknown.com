                    <span>The author intends and succeeds to introduce basketball fans of all ages to the beauty of basketball.<BR>No matter you are 12 or 70, this book helps you understand fully what the game is, teaches you about the history of the american basketball, gives you precious info about positions, different leagues, how to watch a game, famous players, network, newspapers and web sites.<BR>It may be not an interesting book if you bought it for scrimmages and other technical info, but I don't think that was the purpose of the book. It's just a brilliant introduction to the basketball game. <BR>Don't buy any other basketball book before reading this one "court to court". It pays you off. <BR>I highly recommend it to basketball lover.</span>

                    <span>Buy Basketball for Dummies instead. <BR>In search of a book which would get me up to speed about a sport which I had never played but which my sons have become increasingly passionate about, I bought and read both. You would be and idiot to buy The Complete Idiot's Guide to Basketball. <BR>The author appears to be more preoccupied with telling you how wonderful he and the players of his (long bygone) era were. The references to today's players are painfully few. His snipping asides against the work ethic of today's players should have no space in a book of this sort; it serves only to make him sound whinny. His writing is practically devoid of humour and his descriptions of plays and strategies are fairly tedious. The game just does not come alive under his pen. Had I been an absolute newcommer to the sport when I read this book, I would have encouraged my boys to take up more exciting sports like synchronised swimming. FOrtunately, I had watched several live and taped games and had my children's interest to help me realise that there was much more to basketball than I could find in the pages of this book. <BR>Try again Mr. Frazier</span>

                    <span>this book is a must for folks that respect the basics of Basketball.and who better to show&tell than one of the Greatest players of All-Time in Walt Clyde'Frazier.he was a great defensive player&scorer.also he knows that Wilt Chamberlin was the Greatest Player ever.he breaks everything down.</span>

                    <span>Classy Clyde Frazier covers the fundamentals of basketball: the vocabulary, the role of each position, the basics of offense and defense, and a few common set plays. His writing is fun to read if a bit dumbed-down (hence the title). He draws examples largely from his playing days, but knows well and comments aptly on players of all eras. He draws the distinctions between college and pro ball and includes women's and high school ball, but properly focuses primarily on the NBA, where the game is played at its highest level. He shows you what to focus on when you watch a game and demonstrates how each player's skills come into play in the course of offense and defense. This book will enhance the novice's appreciation for and enjoyment of the game; from what I have read of Digger Phelps' "Basketball for Dummies," I'm glad I read Clyde's book instead.</span>
