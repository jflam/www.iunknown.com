                    <span>Howard Schultz's narrative of the Starbucks story is fascinating and strikes an emotional cord on several occasions such as when he learns about his dad's cancer and when he almost lost Starbucks to a private investor.
<br />
<br />Though he seldom talks about most business issues in depth, he conveys that Starbucks success is because of his ability to successfully deal with people and sell them his dream.
<br />
<br />He is no coffee purveyor (he leaves that to Alfred Peet of Peet's Coffee and Tea and the original Starbucks Owners), but is an entreprenuer who saw a business opportunity and passionately pursued it...very much like Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com: Get Big Fast by Robert Spector). Btw, his childhood experiences are eerily similar to that of Sumner Redstone (Autobiography: A Passion To Win).
<br />
<br />Bottom line: a lively read and inspirational to entrepreneurs or otherwise.</span>

                    <span>This book is as much of a story about trusting yourself as it is business.  Unlike other entrepreneurs with a history with their product, he stumbled upon his.  Schultz eventually buys out his partners, the original coffee guys.  Even if you don't like Starbucks (I still root for independent coffeemakers), it's a good read.  I'm glad to know that the company has health benefits even for part time workers and other employee perks.  This information is what stands him apart from so many other top decision makers.  Yes, it's possible to make a lot of money AND treat employees well.  Starbucks' success is obvious on every city block.  Schultz does fluff the book a bit but overall it's a good view on how Starbucks became what it is today.</span>

                    <span>Being an entrepeneur and small business owner, I was really excited to read this book. I mean, what an incredible story, that of Starbucks.  Howard Schultz, I am sure, is an amazing person to meet, he's accomplished truly amazing things.  But it seems like he spends a lot of time in the book telling us just what an amazing person he is!!! Too many exclamation points, too much sugar, too much fluff, egads, I needed a shot of insulin after reading this book.  I'd recommend a more substantial business book, rather than this self- back slapping tome............ </span>
