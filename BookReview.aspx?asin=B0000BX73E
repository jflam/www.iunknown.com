                    <span>If you are primarily a Word and Excel user, this upgrade is just not worth it.  In fact, I find the typical autocorrect-type (assumes the programmer knows better than you how you want to format your document) additions more annoying than improvements to the program.  This is overall a very good package, but I just wish Microsoft would leave it alone. </span>

                    <span>In mid-August I purchased a new 3-Gig P4 mid-range Compaq laptop with Windows XP Pro, a trial version of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works pre-installed.  Using the documentation provided on Amazon.com I purchased the upgrade version of Microsoft Office 2003 Pro on amazon.com.  Here it is the mid-November and I'm still trying to get the trial version to "covert" to the upgrade version I purchased.  No documentation seems to exist, online or otherwise, and I dread the possibility of spending hours on hold to Microsoft.</span>

                    <span>Let me tell you, I've used every version of Office that's been released since 1995, and this edition is by far the best one yet.
<br />I was quite dissapointed with Office XP, luckily lots of problems have been fixed in this new version. First of all, all the programs that come with office load MUCH faster. It use to take nearly a minute to open word or excel, now they open in under 30 seconds.
<br />Also, they have reintroduced Publisher as part of the main packages. Publisher, since I am a student who makes lots of paper creative design projects, was one of the most useful programs on my computer before the upgrade to Office XP. I was devastated when Microsoft pulled it from Office. I suppose I wasn't alone because it's back and better than before.
<br />Along the same lines, Outlook has received it's first major update since 2000. In fact, it is now easy enough to use that I actually have picked it over Outlook Express (a personal first).
<br />Overall, I must say that Office 2003 makes Office XP look like a train wreck of a program. I must recommend Office 2003 to anyone who uses Office of any edition, but especially to those who use XP because they have no idea how much they're missing.
<br />Welcome to the future of Office.</span>

                    <span>If you use Access 2002 or earlier in your websites, don't buy office 2003 because Access 2003 is not supported by anyone including bCentral, a Microsoft Company.  I changed providers to bCentral after being told they did, then found they don't, plus not to mention cannot connect to their servers most of the time. As with any MS product, always errors.<p>It has been a complete nightmare, I uninstalled 2003 and reinstalled 2002 and all my databases that I opened with 2003 are screwed up.  It will take me months to fix a 1500 page website that is Access driven.  Time I learned PHP or MySQL.</span>
