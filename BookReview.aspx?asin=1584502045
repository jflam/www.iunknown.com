                    <span>While I do not doubt that Gregory Snook is a very talented programmer, the code shown in this book and on the accompanying CD are proof enough, I believe that this book is of no use to anyone except for the most experienced professionals who have weeks of time to burn learning about Terrain Engines. I am not the most experienced programmer, having only worked with C++ and DX for 4 years now, but the problem with this book is not in complex concepts, but in content. All of the fundamentals of creating and rendering terrain are covered, but the example code and the engine (Gaia) on the CD are overly complex for any sort of educational book. Possibly every single library that Snook referenced has special wrapper functions and classes around them, making an examination of any code snippet next to useless unless the reader has spent days going through dozens of wrapper classes learning all of Snook's syntax. While I do enjoy owning this book as a conceptual reference, I am afraid that it is next to useless as an aid in practical programming scenarios.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a native english speaker. But I used to live in US for a while. And also Andre Lamothe's books make big senses to me.
<br />
<br />With this background, I conclude that the author of this book doesn't know how to explain something. For example, while explaining quadtree, he doesn't talk anything about setting up quadtree for a terrain data. Instead, suddenly he talks about moving objects around quadtree. Even worse, that moving objects around quadtree doesn't make any sense either. Even worse, he says "oh my terrain engine works". I really don't know what he wants to show us.
<br />
<br />It's almost like "focus on terrain ..." book written by a high school kid. 
<br />I'd rather dig internet for terrain handling algorithms than buy those two books.</span>

                    <span>Beware purchasing this book.  It's written in such a way that only makes sense if you wrote it, particularly the code (a maze of jargon completely lacking in any clear explaination).  And believe me, sticking with it until you can understand it does NOT help.  Not only are the methods overly-complicated, they are also piss-poor in terms of performance and flexibility.  Three months later, and I'm still angry I bought this book.</span>

                    <span>The book is exactly how the title describes it. It is developing a 3d terrain engine and if that is what you are looking to do then this is well worth the 30 bucks, in my opinion. The author is an experienced programmer and it shows through the code. The design of the engine is elegant and if you learn nothing else from the book you will at least walk away with a better understanding of engine design.<p>The book not only shows you the theory behind terrain programming but also resource management, scene management and integrating pixel and vertex shaders. This book seems to always be laying around open on my desk.</span>

                    <span>I got this book not knowing anything about terrain programming.  However, after reading it I felt very comfortable with the subject and was able to use and extend the gaia engine.  The thing I like most about this book is how packed with information it is.  Many other books are so watered down that they never delve into deeper issues on the subject.  This book, on the other hand, was very potent and informative.  I also gained a great deal of knowledge on aspects of game engines such as resource managers, and render queues.  All in all, this is my favorite book on game programming.  I highly recommend it!</span>
