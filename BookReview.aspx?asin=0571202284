                <span id="Label1"><div>The definitive book on animation, from the Academy Award-winning animator behind <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i><br><br>Animation is one of the hottest areas of filmmaking today--and the master animator who bridges the old generation and the new is Richard Williams. During his more than forty years in the business, Williams has been one of the true innovators, winning three Academy Awards and serving as the link between Disney's golden age of animation by hand and the new computer animation exemplified by <i>Toy Story</i>. <br><br>Perhaps even more important, though, has been his dedication in passing along his knowledge to a new generation of animators so that they in turn could push the medium in new directions. In this book, based on his sold-out master classes in the United States and across Europe, Williams provides the underlying principles of animation that every animator--from beginner to expert, classic animator to computer animation whiz --needs. Urging his readers to "invent but be believable," he illustrates his points with hundreds of drawings, distilling the secrets of the masters into a working system in order to create a book that will become the standard work on all forms of animation for professionals, students, and fans.<br></div></span>

                    <span>As I said in the title, from beginners to pros, there's something new for everyone to learn in here.
<br />
<br />None of this stuff is `elitist' or only applicable to specific cases, it's all rock-solid animation basics which every animator needs to know. Whether you're into traditional 2d, stop-frame or digital content, you need this book.
<br />
<br />Richard Williams has toured the world teaching animation to packed theatres and lecture halls, and his own hand-written notes form the core of this book. None of this is cribbed from other sources, so you can be sure that what he says - he means, and has found useful himself.
<br />
<br />I read this through in one sitting, over a few hours - and got all fired up to pick up my pencil and hit the lightbox. This is seen as an animator's `bible' along with the works of Preston Blair and Disney's `illusion of Life'.</span>

                    <span>I can only agree with everyones assessment here on Richard Williams book.I cannot imagine a better illustrated guide(or should I say bible)to live by for animation.I feel like I have my very own original drawings by Richard in my book they are so well reproduced.
<br />
<br />I live in Australia and this is the best book by far,I am so glad I discovered it.
<br />

<br />Clear, consise writing backed up by drawings that only on a true master can achieve - there is nothing more to say - if you are into animation you must have this book - end of argument - end of story!</span>
