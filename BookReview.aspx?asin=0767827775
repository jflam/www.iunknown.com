                    <span>NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA is an epic and lavish production, deliberatly paced (almost to the point of boredom), rarely seen nowadays. The performances, particularly the leads, are excellent. The detail in costuming and settings are remarkable. The story of the last years of Russia's Tsar and family is depressing, somewhat like peering down a sprialing drain to an inevitable tragic end. A great deal of historical material is touched upon in this movie, making it difficult to keep the story on track withen 3 hours running time. The movie leads the viewer to want to read the Robert K Massie book, which is even better (and highly readable). The DVD is the best edition of NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA available to home audiences. The wide screen picture and sound (possibly mono)are excellent.The DVD restores aprox 15 minutes of footage not seen sinnce the movie's early roadshow presentations. Also included for the first time is composer Richard Rodney Bennett's great intermssion music. More chapter stops should have been included. A trailer and a bland "making of" featurette are included. Definitly worth watching, true fans of epic movie productions may consider purchasing this DVD.</span>

                    <span>My beef about the film is that they took liberties in telling and condensing the story when it wasn't necessary. In Tobolsk the family lived in the Governor's Mansion - not a log cabin in the woods. Yekaterinburg looked like some Spanish town rather a city in the Urals. None of the movie was filmed in Russia or Finland (for obvious reasons). The execution involved eleven people - in the movie they cut down the number. Other scenes were outright inventions.<P>None of the church or religious scenes came off right. They seem more Catholic or Anglican than Orthodox.<P>Nicholas was taught English from the age of 8 by a Scottish teacher, Mr. Heath. He had an accent in English, but it wasn't identifiable as "Russian". They all would have sounded 'upper crust' so the accents were fine for me.<P>Suzmann and Jayston were superb. Suzmann was a little too glamorous and Hollywood looking for the role, but she pulled off the characterisation well.<P>I don't know if it's well known, but the Romanov family walked out on the premier because of the changes made to the story.</span>

                    <span>N&A, though over thirty years old, still plays with the bravura and sweep that a big historical film epic should and that we expect. It has ripened well with time and has lost none of its power. The fall of the Romanovs and the rise of the Soviet Communism would be an extraordinary cinematic undertaking in any age, but few contemporary film makers would attempt so ambitious a project. A shame really; our present epics are more about CGI instead of ... well, anything, and certainly not serious subjects like history. Looking at a film like Nicholas and Alexandra should make us realize how mainstream movies gave audiences credit for intelligence decades ago - and how they need to start doing so again.</span>

                    <span>Wow! That pretty much sums up what i have to say about this movie, I liked it very much. This is a true classic, the movie tells the story of Russia's last Tsar and Tsarina very well. You get a feeling of sympathy for the family and you begin to feel every emotion along with them. Everything from the happy birth of the heir Alexei, to the trials of war and revolution, all the way till their end. The cast picked to play the characters were really great and I swear Michael Jayston(Nicholas)looks exactly like the real tsar. Janet Suzman,(Alexandra) plays a truly loving and devouted wife and mother, just like the real Alexandra. The four daughters are also great and play the real girls just as charming as they really were. Rodric Noble,(Alexei)plays the Tsarivich well also. They make you feel as if they are the real family.<BR>I have seen both the VHS and DVD versions and i must say that the VHS tape is terrible. There is so much cut out, so many moments that contribute to the story of the last Imperial Family of Russia. I would buy the DVD, it is full length and even gives you a behind the scenes look into the making of the film. This is a great movie, I would really encourage everyone who loves the Romanov story to buy this DVD.</span>
