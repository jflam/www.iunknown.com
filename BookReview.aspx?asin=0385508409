                <span id="Label1">With Russia on the brink of a populist revolution, the least important thing to most residents of St. Petersburg in January 1917 might have been who stabbed to death an unidentified couple on the frozen Neva River. Yet solving that mystery is pretty much all that keeps Alexander "Sandro" Ruzsky, chief investigator of the city police, from despairing over his medley of personal torments, in Tom Bradby's doleful yet evocative novel, <I>The White Russian</I>.<p>  It turns out that the dead woman on the ice used to work as a nanny to Tsar Nicholas II's children, until she was dismissed for stealing unspecified property. Her male companion, a Chicago criminal and labor agitator, was knifed 17 times and had in his coat pocket a roll of banknotes marked with tiny ink dots. A code of some sort? If so, who was he communicating with secretly, and to what end? Although Ruzsky, the black sheep son of an aristocratic family, just returned from a three-year Siberian banishment, finds his investigation hampered by the tsar's secret police, he slowly unpeels the layers of a conspiracy that involves not merely homicide, but also avarice, politics, and long-sought vengeance. The stability of Russia's monarchy may depend on Ruzsky's success in this case, as may the investigator's hesitant relationship with a star ballerina, whose cloaked past makes her a far more intriguing, and more deadly, companion than Ruzsky realizes.<p>  While <I>The White Russian</I> introduces readers to St. Petersburg's exotic and economic extremes--tenements of Dostoevskian squalidness, gilded ballet theaters full of garrulous royalty--it is a rather less ambitiously atmospheric story than Bradby's previous novel, 2002's <I>The Master of Rain</I>. Yet it boasts a similarly tumbling pace, emotionally torn and credible characters (including a "neurotic and hysterical" Tsarina Alexandra), and twists and dubious allegiances enough to leave readers wondering at Ruzsky's solution until the closing pages. At once a chilling crime yarn and a cautionary tale about the sometimes painful exigencies of love, <I>The White Russian</I> is a literary cocktail with a decided kick. <I>--J. Kingston Pierce</I></span>

                    <span>I read a lot of historical fiction. The two things that draw my attention & garner my enthusiasm are (1) authentic historical setting & details, and (2) a plot & characters more interesting than a mere "history book". In his first novel "The Master of Rain" set in 1920s Shanghai, Tom Bradby delivered on both of these in spades. As a follow-up to this impressive debut, "The White Russian" does not disappoint.<P>Set in St. Petersburg during the first stirrings of the Bolshevik revolution, this book rings with impressive authenticity. The detachment of the Tsar's regime, the role of the secret police, the aristocratic class & their sense of entitlement, the desperation of budding revolutionaries, all of these ring true. A great setting for a murder mystery, as the story's hero, a discredited police inspector, finds two bodies on the frozen river outside the Tsar's winter palace. As the book begins, Inspector Ruzsky has no idea the complex & twisted path his investigation will take before the killer or killers are finally revealed.<P>This author is a major new talent in historical fiction, & has twice now mastered all the elements of an engrossing story that transports us to another time & place. Where to next, Mr. Bradby?</span>

                    <span>Tom Bradby's The White Russian is an intriguing historical thriller set in the dying days of Tsarist Russia in early 1917. The book's strength is its writing; Mr. Bradby does an excellent job in evoking the desperate milieu of this jittery city on the eve of revolution. And most, but not all of his characters are well realized and thus quite believable, including his hero, Inspector Sandro Ruzsky, his deputy Pavel, and the enigmatic Maria Popova. <P>The story starts conventionally enough: two bodies are found on the frozen waters of the Neva on New Year's Day, brutally murdered. When the Okhrana quickly become involved, it is clear that these killings have a political dimension. And when the trail leads back to the Tsar's household, it is clear that these murders are bound up in the events of the day, including the swirling rumors and plots to depose the Tsar. That's a great story line, and Bradby uses it well to illustrate the historical novel aspect of this book. With that backdrop, he can explain the vying political forces, the role of the Tsar's secret police, the role terror played in late 19th century and early 20th century politics in Russia, etc. And all of this is extremely well done; these issues are so integral to the story that its not as if you are being force fed history. You learn about these issues as the story line naturally progresses.<P>My only complaint about The White Russian is that I found the villainous Vasilyev (the head of the Okhrana) to be a less well realized character than some of the others, and for that reason, I thought the denoument a little bit of a let down. But that's a quibble that should not deter readers. Overall, I thought this was a very entertaining read. <P>If readers have not read Bradby's The Master of Rain, his earlier novel set in Shanghai, I also recommend it heartily.</span>

                    <span>It is New Year's morning in 1917 in frigid St. Petersburg, the capital of old Russia. The February revolution that will sweep Tsar Nicholas away is only weeks away. The Bolshevik revolution of November, 1917 (October in the old Russian calendar) will take place within the year. Russia, particularly St. Petersburg, is consumed by strikes, speculation, food shortages, and a growing disdain for the Tsar. The city is awash in rumors of the debauched relationship between the recently assassinated Rasputin and the Tsarina Alexandra. The wave of nationalistic fervor that marked Russia's entry into WWI in August 1914 has been replaced by despair, dismay, and finally indifference as a haplessly incompetent officer corps leads the Russian army into defeat upon defeat at the hands of the Kaiser's army.<P>As the sun rises on New Year's day two bodies are found on the frozen river Neva within sight of the Imperial Palace. One man and a young woman have been brutally murdered. Sandro Ruzsky, St. Petersburg's chief police investigator is called to the scene. Sandro is the scion of a Russian noble, Nicolas Ruzsky, the Tsar's Deputy Finance Minister. Sandro's decision to join the police rather than take up the military career embarked upon by his father and his ancestors has caused irreparable harm to the father/son relationship. The rift is further heightened by the blame Nicolas has always placed on Sandro for the death by drowning of Sandro's youngest brother. The boy's death years ago continues to haunt both father and son.<P>It is Sandro's first day back on the job after a three-year exile/posting to Siberia courtesy of the Okhrana, the Tsar's secret police (the KGB of its day). Sandro's exile resulted in the break up of his marriage to his wife Irina who left Siberia to take up on affair with an aging, corpulent Grand Duke. Sandro is more than a bit tired, drunk, and hung-over as he steps onto the ice. Sandro is accompanied by his assistant Pavel. Sandro's exile was caused in no small part by Pavel's actions but Sandro took all the blame onto himself on the theory that Pavel, a person of lesser birth, would have suffered a fate worse than Sandro's. This action of course leaves Pavel devoted to Sandro.<P>These two murders are followed in rapid succession by other, equally brutal murders. It is Sandro's job to solve the murders which may or may not involve members of the Royal family. Sandro's investigation is impeded at every step of the way by the Okhrana. Nothing is quite what it seems and no one is quite who they seem. Allegiance is a duty owed only to oneself, or so it seems. Sandro's investigation takes him across Russia to his family's summer home and then on to the Crimea. The story line is inexorably linked to the dramatic events unfolding across Russa. As events proceed Sandro rediscovers the love of his life and this tortured relationship forms an emotional cornerstone of the book along with the examination of Sandro's relationship with his father. <P>It would be unfair to reveal any more of the story line. One of White Russian's strength is the development of the plot and its characters. A little bit is revealed on each page. It is fair to say that this book is more than a simply murder mystery. Bradby's characters, particularly those of Sandro and his father evoke a time and place where honor in the face of adversity counted more than either convenience or love much to the detriment of both men. This notion of honor and duty is at once the cause and resolution of the rift between father and son. <P>In a fast paced manner Bradby conveys with dexterity the feel of a city lost in a fog of war and insurrection. Everyone sees the revolution coming but like an out-of-control train no one seems willing or able to do anything about it. <P>Bradby takes us into the minds of the entrenched nobility, striking workers, and revolutionary students. One can feel the revolution approaching as the book reaches its climactic moments. It is the inevitability of the coming revolutions that serves as the conceptual underpinning of both the murders and the resolution of the story.<P>This was an enjoyable book.</span>

                    <span>I wasn't sure about "White Russian" when I started reading it. Historical mysteries are not the easiest books to write and, from my point of view, a novel in this genre can turn only two ways - a great one or a bad one. Also, as I am Russian, a foreigner writing about my countrys' past... well, let's just say, that some books about Russia, I've read were laughable in there depiction of the country.<BR>Luckily, all my suspisions were proven wrong. <BR>The book starts with two bodies found on the ice of Neva river on the first day of 1917. St. Petersburg is a frozen city on a brink of revolution. The government is in dissaray, as people think not of how to prevent a revolution, but how to save themselves when it comes. In comes Alexander "Sandro" Ruszki - the Chief Investigator. He is one of those officers, who will hunt down the truth whatever it takes. And pretty soon the trail takes him to rather high places...<BR>But the book is not just a mystery - it's a story about people, who got caught in extraordinary moment in history - about love, honor, trust and hard choices you sometimes has to do to survive.<BR>The recreation of the place and period is near perfect. There are some minor issues, but I don't think that any reader outside of Russia will notice them. <BR>This is a very strong book, weaving a story around the real facts and persons. If you are interested in Russia, it can give you a good insight into its past and the Russian people.</span>

                    <span>THE WHITE RUSSIAN by Tom Bradby (Bantam, 17.99)<BR> Tom Bradby has written several novels in widely varied styles. First he wrote a couple of thrillers, SHADOW DANCER and SLEEP OF THE DEAD, then he moved onto his breakout book THE MASTER OF RAIN which was his first book published in the United States. MASTER takes place in 1926 Shanghai. This historical mystery was nominated for last year's Steel Dagger Award and was very well received. Now he returns with another superb historical mystery. This time we go to St. Petersburg, Russia in 1917 on the virge of revolution.<BR> Two bodies are found on the frozen river, Neva. Sandro Ruzsky, chief police investigator, is assigned to the case. He manages to discover the identity of the bodies- one being a former member of the imperial household and the other is an American gangster. What is their relationship and who killed them? To answer these questions Sandro must visit the Palace of the Tzar in St. Petersburg, as well as the cities of Yalta and Moscow. The key to the murders might also lie with the ballerina, Maria Popova, a love of Sandro's. There are issues in Sandro's past that also need resolution including his relationship with his father, a Minister of the Interior, as well as his estranged wife and their young son. <BR> There are several different types of novels in this book. In a sense, I wasn't sure where the author was going. He probably didn't know himself. Initially the plot is a straightforward police procedural with the backdrop of the historical location and era. However, as we began to explore Sandro's relationship with Maria, the love story of DR ZHIVAGO comes to mind. Finally, the historical events take over the plot and given the explosive nature of the politics at that time, this is actually quite appropriate. The depth of the characters, the complexity of the murders and the rich historical detail make this another exceptional work by this highly talented and versatile author.</span>
