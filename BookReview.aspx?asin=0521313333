                    <span>Peter Harvey's book is dull but extremely useful for those wanting help in learning about the history, practices, and divisions of Buddhism.  If a comprehensive, encyclopedia-like reader is wanting you are needing, then this book is your answer, although I would advise taking "no dose" while reading it.  Harvy sets forth a historical explanation for all elements of Buddhism and presents the sanskrit form of names and terms.  I personally found Harvey's review of Tantra and Zen Buddhism to be particularly helpful.  Too often, books and documentaries emphasize the sexual aspects of Tantra and the meditation of Zen without clearly stating what each denomination believes and, more importantly, why they believe such things. Also, before this book, I had trouble finding where to begin in learning about Buddhism, and this book leads its reader by the hand and into the most important issues of Buddhism, escaping the confusion caused by a western interest in Buddhism since the 1960's.</span>

                    <span>Excellent introduction for the beginner, and/or anyone who wants to increase their historical and conceptual knowledge of Buddhism & Buddhist beliefs and practices.  There are tons of books out there regarding Buddhism,  it's different strains, texts, and interpretations.   Many of these books seem to me to be "California Zen Pop-Buddhism," while others are 50 years old, very dry, and esoteric.  After patiently skimming through various chapters at the bookstore, I realized that I had finally found a well-written book on this subject.  I will also look into other works by Peter Harvey.</span>

                    <span>Most books available on Buddhism on bookshelves at the popular level leave a great deal to be desired.  Either they are written by people who have had no contact with Buddhism, culturally or by practice (or at best very little  practice of the wrong sort) thus taking a literalist approach to translated  Buddhist scripts or they are too specialist, providing a view of Buddhism  based on only one school or a narrow emphasis, often hawking for  influence.<p>Professor Harvey has both contacted Buddhism culturally and  continues to make an honest attempt to put Buddhism into practice.  An  introduction to Buddhism is one of the best overall introductions to this  vast subject now available, superseding equivalent good books which are by  now up to 50 years too old.  Harvey combines scholarship including a  knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit along with sensitivity to the contexts in  which the various scriptures can be seen.<p>In the forest of competing  books out now, this one can be recommended without reservation.</span>

                    <span>Harvey does a wonderful job of introducing the reader to the Buddhism of the Buddha.  Then he takes you through the development of Buddhism country by country, showing you how mythology and cultural influences were then  added to give us the different denominations we have now.</span>
