                <span id="Label1">The Third Edition of Directing the Documentary, like the previous two, guides the reader through the process of making a work for the screen.  This includes the real problems of researching and focusing a documentary film or video idea, of developing a crew, of directing the crew and participants, and of maintaining control during shooting.  It guides the reader through the complex evolutionary process of post-production, when the film's true characteristics can really begin to emerge and assert themselves.<br><br> Up-to-date with examples of significant new films and new projects, it is written in conversational, non-technical language, treating the reader as a colleague in search of clearly explained knowledge.  The author, a veteran filmmaker and teacher shares anecdotes from his own professional experience where they usefully illustrate ideas, principles, or pitfalls.<br><br>*A Focal classic<br>*Includes examples from well-known films and projects<br>*Features projects that guide the reader through all phases of creating a professional-quality documentary</span>

                    <span>This book is the most comprehensive book I've seen in this field. The author begins with a basic coverage of camera operation, lighting, sound, etc. Then, he goes in depth to documentary idea, organization, planning, budgeting, dealing with the crew, dealing with the "talent". The editing section was a surprise bonus for me. I've learned more about editing from this book than from any other book I've read. The author is obviously a great filmmaker and a great teacher. Many other books about filmmaking or video production contain a lot of extraneous words that are entertaining at best and insulting at worst. This author treats the reader as an intelligent person with a serious desire to learn about making documentaries.</span>

                    <span>Rabiger is simply one of the basics for any willing filmaker. His insigth and the way he handdles documentaries goes beyond anything that I have seen before. I belive the most impotant thing on the book is his emphasis on the human side of this kind of films.<BR>The last chappters of the book really fall a little, but I belive it is an excusable flaw because of the high quality of the rest of the book. Thanks to Mr. Rabiger I am very ahead of the rest of my documentary class in production, language and structure.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book, especially for those who are new in the field. Among other things, Michael Rabiger guides you through a brief history of the documentary genre, helps you discover your creative identity, acquaintes you with the film vocabulary, and introduces you to the genre through a variety of projects that you are encouraged to undertake. Directing the Documentary is definitely a textbook (no wonder it's one of the "must read" books at the Department of TV Documentary in Goldsmith's College in London) and Michael Rabiger is an excellent teacher. Lacking the pretentiousness of many other teachers, he uses simple language to describe various aspects of the documentary and never underestimates his reader / student. A lover of the genre himself, he knows how to make you feel confident for having chosen the documentary as a career. He never patronizes you and all the advice that he gives is given with a friendly and generous tone. Mr Rabiger is a thoughtful and sensitive teacher, but also an excellent author, or "storyteller," as he prefers to call the documentarist. His words flow, like in a good novel, making you want to read on and on, while at the same time they are so pregnant with meaning that they make you stop and think about them. Having read his book, and being a student myself, I would like to say a warm "thank you" to Mr Rabiger for his sensitivity and generosity as a teacher.</span>

                    <span>Rabinger has a superbly no-nonsense approach to his subject matter, and the book covers every aspect of the life of the documentary film. <P>Parts include: Historical Background, Preproduction, Production, Post-Production, Technical Basics, Projects for Developing Skills, and Career Track. For every area covered he hits the relevant steps and highlights the important issues.<P>The appendices and the annotated bibliography are superb, and the book is worth the price just for these additions.</span>
