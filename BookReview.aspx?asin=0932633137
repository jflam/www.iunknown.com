                    <span>In a world where there is strong emphasis on project management skills and design skills, this is a welcome book that emphasizes that requirements must come first. The process of defining requirements is vital to success and, with good requirements, quality is assured. I recommend this book to anyone who works on solving problems or in building systems of any kind. Gause and Weinberg are excellent in presenting complex concepts in an entertaining and informative way. <p>There is a human tendency to want to rush into solutions as soon as an opportunity surfaces. And... the result is usually not what was needed. Then, there is a rush to "add quality" to the result by fixing the flaws. This is costly and often fatal to the project. This book takes the reader down a different road. A road of first defining the objective that is to be attained and being sure that all parties understand and agree to the requirements. If you only have a few books in your business library, this should be one of them. I shared my copy with so many colleagues that I finally had to buy another copy.</span>

                    <span>Like Weingerg's other books (and I have read them all -- most more than once), "Exploring Requirements" is about human nature, the way we react as individual beings to problems we encounter.  Anyone looking for a canned methodology or "step-by-step" process to enable a system definition or design may be disappointed.  But anyone who reads this will never react to any type of communication the same way again.  <p>This is definitely not a technical book, nor even an IT book.  It should be required reading for anyone whose job involves communication -- and that's just about everyone in business today.  I have recommended it to all my managers and direct reports over the years since it was first published.  I have also recommended it to trainers in public speaking and executive presentation skills.  The writers' style is at once entertaining and instructive.  Unless you are looking for a "cookbook," you won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I have developing requirements and implementing manufacturing systems for 20+ years.  The last 2 years I have been using the Ivy Hooks methodology (see her book) with great success.  I agree with Ivy that every requirement must have a rationale and a verification method...and this was not discussed in EXPLORING REQUIREMENTS.  Only valuable thing I found was list of questions to use at beginning of project. This book is ok in that it points out the human side of requirements..but I am a believer in Ivy's methodology.</span>

                    <span>The authors define development as the process of transforming someone's desires into a product that satisfies those desires.  Their book deals with the early stages of the process.<p>It is easy, they say, if readers focus on five critical words: desire, product, people, attempt and discover.<p>Then why is it, to borrow statistics used by Microsoft at their Project 2002 product that 74 per cent of projects in the United States are either behind schedule or fail at a cost to industry of $74 Billion a year?<p>If you watch how people successfully develop systems, the authors say, you will observe that the process of developing requirements is a process of developing a team who:<p>1.	Understand the requirements.<br>2.	Stay together to work on the project.<br>3.	Understand and practice teamwork.<p>The project, the authors say, will probably fail if one of these conditions is not met.  Team members must develop and concentrate on three critical, but often ignored human aspects of the process:<p>1.	A clear understanding of the requirements by all members <br>2.	A sense of teamwork <br>3.	The required skills and tools to work effectively as a team.<p>This conversational book is written to be read in modules or front to back.  Either way, the exercises and tools provided should help rank your project with the successful 26 per cent.</span>

                    <span>"So, what do you want it to do?"<p>It looks like such a simple question. But this query - posed every day about Web sites, other software, indeed about buildings and cars and furniture and all sorts of designed objects - is one of the toughest questions that can be asked of an organisation. It triggers the requirements process. A thirteen-year-old book by Donald Gause and Gerald Weinberg, "Exploring Requirements" shows how to manage that process. Most Web developers and managers haven't read it, and should.<p>Like the man startled to find he had been speaking prose all his life, most of us have taken part in a requirements process, and many of us don't know it. Requirements analysis is actually a life skill that can be applied particularly often in your working life. If you've had an architect design renovations, or a friend build you a PC, or a large consulting firm build you a business reporting system, then you've been on the end of a requirement process, formal or informal. If you've ever designed or built something, and seen a disappointed look on the recipient's face, you've experienced requirements failure. If you've ever had a client rave about how great a Web site is, you've achieved requirements success.<p>Like that other classic, DeMarco and Lister's "Peopleware", "Exploring Requirements" makes ample use of large numbers of measurements collected over many years - like the numbers showing that programers are quite good at producing what they are actually asked to produce, if only they are asked to produce it. This data allows Gause and Weinberg to enunciate a simple principle: you'll quite likely get what you want, as long as you say what it is.<p>Saying what you want, though, takes surprising amounts of both discipline and technique. It requires people to think about their own needs in a ruthlessly structured way, to listen to others' needs, to understand how their business is now and imagine what it could be in five years' time. No wonder that success in IT-related requirements processes is rare, and that failure is the norm.<p>The continued popularity of "Exploring Requirements" springs partly from its authors' simple but thorough style: they explain the key challenges concisely and clearly. Their breadth helps too: their chapters cover everything from holding effective meetings to scoring client preferences to measuring ambiguity. Context also plays a role: Gause and Weinberg always explain why their preferred solutions work better. <p>And the book shows a sense of fun, notably in its periodic anecdotes about fictional and slightly dysfunctional requirements processes for a pair of products called Superchalk and Do Not Disturb.<p>But the enduring strength of Gause and Weinberg's book can only be fully explained by their willingness to talk about requirements at an emotional level - about what a tough, confronting, challenging task it is for so many of the people involved, and about the perils and delights of having one person understand what another person is thinking, hoping and sometimes hiding even from themselves. Mindreading is tough, and Gause and Weinberg aren't afraid to admit it.<p>For instance, Gause and Weinberg include an entire chapter on setting expectations, teaching designers to identify the possible and the impossible early so as to minimise a client's disappointments.<p>Their last substantive sentence demonstrates perhaps most clearly their focus on the emotional challenge of requirements work:<p>"The purpose of requirements work is to avoid making mistakes, and to do a complete job. In the end, however, you can't avoid all mistakes, and you can't be omniscient. If you can't risk being wrong, if you can't risk being inadequate to the task you've taken on, you will never succeed in requirements work. If you want the reward, you will have to take the risk."<p>Understanding other people is hard - hard enough to justify reading 300 well-written pages about it. These are the 300 pages to read.</span>
