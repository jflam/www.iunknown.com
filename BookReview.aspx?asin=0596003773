                <span id="Label1"><i>Java Peformance Tuning</i>, 2nd edition provides a comprehensive and indispensable guide to eliminating all types of performance problems. Using many real-life examples to work through the tuning process in detail, JPT shows how tricks such as minimizing object creation and replacing strings with arrays can really pay off in improving your code's performance.  Tuning J2EE applications bears many similarities to tuning J2SE apps, but important and specific considerations apply. For this reason, <i>Java Performance Tuning</i>, Second Edition includes four new chapters: a new chapter on J2EE application tuning in general followed by chapters on tuning JDBC, servlets and JSPs, and EJBs.   <i>Java Performance Tuning</i> offers common-sense advice about what to tune and what to leave alone, emphasizing techniques that provide big performance gains with minimal code restructuring. It gives you crucial guidance that helps you tune without destroying your program's architecture. Blindly changing things in an effort to make a program run faster is a great way to create buggy, unmaintainable code. <i>Java Performance Tuning</i> teaches you to work efficiently and effectively, resulting in code that is robust, maintainable, and fast.</span>

                    <span>This book is diverse in it's approach to java performance tuning. It is very good at describing common bottlenecks in detail and providing concrete examples of how to write better performing code.<P>It has good coverage of topics including Object creation, I/O and sorting. It illustrates efficient ways to write loops and switches and provides insight into the performance costs of exceptions and casts. 'Java Performance Tuning' also shows how to implement class specific collection classes among other topics.<P>It takes a comprehensive look at the java profiling tools available and gives illustrated advantages of applying specific techniques. Performance results are contrasted for the various JVMs (JDK1.2 with and without JIT, JDK1.3, Hotspot 1.0).<P>'Java Performance Tuning' has improved my programming and will sit on my shelf as an excellent reference I know I can turn to if asked to tune a Java application.</span>

                    <span>I found this book most rewarding; it covers many aspect of performance tuning Java for applications, and it does so in a well-written, clear and orderly fashion. The author starts by covering the fundamentals of performance measuring and tuning, reiterating and reinforcing what is already known to the serious programmer but most likely overlooked by the novice. The other half of the book proceeds to dissect the behavior of Java application and the JVM in order to gain insights into the tuning process and the to be avoided pitfalls. The items covered here are crucial to developing robust and effective java programs, especially for those writing infrastructure and server like applications.<P>For the novice, the ordered scientific approach to demystify the myths of Java performance and the concise advice given is more than welcomed. As for the experienced developer, the second half of the books deals with those issues of real concern: threading and distributed computing<P>Overall I found the book to be enlightening and I certainly recommend.<P>For those with deep interest in java performance I recommend a complementing book: Java Performance and Scalability, Volume 1: Server-Side Programming Techniques by Dov Bulka.</span>

                    <span>Java Performance Tuning would be a good book to have if you have a seriously performance intensive application or for someone who just really dug performance issues. But it wouldn't be of interest to most people. Most programmers should be able to do all the performance tuning they need to do with a program like Optomizeit.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book, with something like 300 tuning techniques covered. Some techniques are more hairy than others, but the breadth and depth is astonishing. I did extensive research before buying this book. I found that it was in the top 3 editors choice for Java book at Javaworld a couple of times, in the top 20 Java books readers choice at JDJ a couple of times (note that is all "Java" books, not "Java Performance" books), it was the choice of a comparative review of Java performance books, it had good reviews by every professional review I could find, and finally, after having read it, it is one of the few Java books I keep handy as a reference.<P>Looking down at some of the other reviews here at Amazon, I see most people agree with me too. There are some nitpickers. I had to laugh at sudiptokanti, he seems to have decided the book was too dangerous for him. Certainly there are suggestions in the book of hairy performance tunes, as there are many more of perfectly good best practice tunes. And, as the author points out, you should not be using these techniques except after you have identified a bottleneck. sudiptokanti seems to have reviewed the book as if it is a development guide rather than what it is: an excellent guide on performance tuning your applications.</span>

                    <span>Newbies, please take the author's sugessions with a big pinch of salt, please do not go ahead and rewrite JDK classes as author says, and about 'ensuring that the defragmentation procedure does not disrupt your own use of disk sweet spots' - ask the author how. I must confess some parts of the book (a very small part though) are informative, and that alone earned the second star in this review, else I would have had no compunction to stick it with a single star.<P>It would not take more than a casual browse-thru for an experience java developer to call the bluff, I'm concerned that some newish practitionars might end up in deep water following these suggestions.<P>Firstly, this book comes nowhere near discussing any J2EE performance topics, though nowadays it's difficult to find plain vanilla java implementations. The author did devote a whole chapter on distributed computing, I expected to find discussions on tuning parameters for EJB deployment descriptors there; nope, he decided to discuss server-object implementation of CORBA and RMI instead, he compared them, compared different communication layers and other stuff, in short he explained to you everything about the components you have no control over! This book in most cases concentrates on topics only of academic interest, except for some discussion on code styles I found next to nothing to take away from this book.<P>Author has given enough number of tables with performance comparisons to fill half the space for the book, but understand that these results are only indicative of what might happen for a particular program on a particular system, I'm not even going to the detail to tell you that in some cases the results and table heading say completely different things (e.g. Table 7.2 Speedups using Exception-driven loop termination actually compares timing across different switch approaches), that reminds me, I have to compile a 'don't do' list to be used along with this book<P>Do not<BR> - replace JDK classes: it would be unfair to say that the author himself has not warned you against it, but let me also quote him "For optimal performance, I recommend developing with your own versions of classes rather than JDK versions whenever possible." I find it outright funny, I almost can't believe (except for the fact that the rest of the book is in keeping with it) that he is actually suggesting something so ridiculous as this, I wonder whether somebody in Microsoft listened to him before they got into a legal tussle with sun about copyright.<BR> - depend on optimizations with -O<BR> - compile to native machine code (go use C++)<BR> - get hooked on to native method calls: to quote the author "say goodbye to 100% pure java certification, and say hello to added complexity..." so it's not that the author has no idea of what he was talking about... still those siggestions? makes the book thicker ;-)<BR> - reuse Exception objects<BR> - get hooked onto the concept of comparison by identity, in short do not make significant modifications to your codes to get a comparison by identity, do not define a 'public static final Integer ZERO = new Integer(0)'<BR> - use WeakReferences<BR> - converts Strings to char arrays<BR> - write exception-terminated loops<BR> - and a lot of other things<P>I gather I have made my point, do not buy this book unless you want to write blazingly fast applications those do not work right and is a nightmare to maintain.</span>
