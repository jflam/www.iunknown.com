                    <span>Neyer and James have supplied an invaluble source book to anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of baseball's great (and some not so great) pitchers.  Neyer is a much more honest student of the game than James and therefore is a good influence on the master of stat manuipulation.  James proved in his fine book on baseball managers that he can produce a good volume of baseball history when he shows some interest in the game as it's actually played on the field.  And bravo to Ron Neyer who, while being a stat hound himself, from the beginning of his career has shown much more respect for the reality of what goes on between the lines than James who has consistently manipultated stats to support his prejudices.  James is smart enough to ally himself with Neyer who he recognizes as a man who could tear away the veil of lies that the Historical Abstract books hide behind.  In the case of this book, it's a very happy collaboration.  Real baseball history is alive on every page and there is very little of the stat obseseed comparisons of eras.  The Negro Leagues are undervalued of course but I've accepted that's just the way it will always be.   </span>

                    <span>"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" has this to say about the Earth:  Harmless
<br />
<br />But don't worry, the next edition will include much more information.  Earth will be listed as "Mostly Harmless".
<br />
<br />In "The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers", you will learn about Jack Morris that he threw a fastball and a slider, added a change in 1982 and dropped the change for a forkball "after 1982".  And that in 1982 someone said his fastball was clocked at 94 mph. And that's it.  The words "split-finger" don't appear, despite a reference on p.50 to Roger Craig teaching the pitch to "most everybody on the Tigers' staff." One guy he taught it to won 254 games and pitched until 1994, but you'd have to make the connection yourself. Mostly harmless, indeed.   
<br />
<br />A lot of the modern stuff is merely rehashes of information in annually produced "Scouting Notebooks", with idiosyncratic quotes   like the only quote about Denny McLain, which comes from Ted Williams who never faced him and managed him when he was a wreck of his former self.  
<br />
<br />These guys are great writers.  I've been reading James for 22 years and Neyer as long as he's been writing.  Nearly every one of their other books lies dog-eared and broken-backed in my bathroom from countless re-readings.  But the data in this book would have been better left to a website where it could be updated and corrected as time went by, and there could have been more articles on near-great pitchers and more description of how pitches were thrown and developed, as well as the authors' thoughts about the pitchers, rather than just "Fastball Slider Curve".  
<br />
<br />But really, if Neyer feels good about writing a book "describing" Kaz Sasaki's pitches without mentioning that he called his splitter "the fang", well, that's his choice.  </span>

                    <span>I make no bones about being a loyal Bill James-ite, so when I found out he and his old running buddy Rob Neyer (now of ESPN) were working on a book about pitchers and pitches, I knew it would go immediately to the top of my "must buy" list.
<br />
<br />Now, a word of warning: "The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers" IS A REFERENCE BOOK!  If you're looking for a book with nothing but the interesting, thought-provoking, often caustic, always entertaining essays that are R.N.'s and B.J.'s bread and butter, there are a few (and they're very good).  But at its heart, the book is a reference volume, listing the pitches and pitching styles of pretty much every significant pitcher in Major League and Negro League history (and many of the less significant ones too).
<br />
<br />But be that as it may, the reference material is probably more entertaining than most prose by other writers.  It's the sort of book that, if you like baseball history, you can open at random and find something you a) didn't know, and b) will find funny, intriguing or just plain enlightening.  One example: if you've ever read "Ball Four", you know that one of the running jokes is about Seattle pitcher Steve Barber and his arm ("it's not sore, it's just a little stiff" -- notwithstanding that he probably spent more time with the diathermy machine than he did with his teammates).  Wonder why he was so racked up?  Turn to page 126 in Neyer/James -- Barber was a fastball/slider pitcher who threw ACROSS his body, absolutely the worst combination of pitch selection and pitching motion if you want to keep your arm healthy.  I could cite 20 more examples easily.
<br />
<br />So thank you, Rob and Bill, for filling a gap in the baseball research library, and making it fun to boot.  I know when I'm drafting pitchers in my all-time fantasy league at Legends of Baseball, I'll be glad to have this book by my side.</span>

                    <span>I judge a book not by what it doesn't have, but what it DOES have. And this book has all the things you'd expect in another great book from Bill James or Rob Neyer.
<br />
<br />It has information you can't find anywhere else and probably never thought you could. Where else could you find accounts of exactly HOW all these pitchers pitched, all in one volume? It's the result of a decade of research by the two authors and their assistants.
<br />
<br />In additional to the basic information, there are the usual essays, plus the usual Bill James digressions and asides. It's all very well organized. There's no trouble knowing where to find what you want.
<br />
<br />And, as usual, it makes you THINK, and it makes you realize things that are relevant not just to baseball but to everything. One of the opening chapters focuses on how much the subject depends on linguistics and vocabulary, and how we might think a source tells us something but it doesn't really, because we don't understand the meanings of the words and phrases that are being used. Usually this is because the language has evolved over time, but sometimes it's because the language is used arbitrarily or sloppily. This is true about "knuckleballs" and "sliders" and "curves." But we readily realize that it can apply to anything.
<br />
<br />The introductory chapter includes some duelling between the authors about things, some of which would seem to be "facts" but which are hard to pin down. It's interesting to see how much remains debatable about such a seemingly straightforward subject, even after years of research, and how much it will forever be arguable.
<br />
<br />Especially interesting is the material about how the mechanics and strategy of pitching have evolved over the years, and WHY. In most instances there were specific reasons and fairly clear dividing lines for the major changes.
<br />
<br />My one criticism would be that the content is indeed a bit erratic. One of the book's purposes is to catalog any noteworthy idiosyncrasies of a pitcher's style. But I notice that on some of the guys with the very most famous idiosyncrasies, you find nothing or almost nothing. For example, there's nothing about what Al Hrabosky was famous for, and almost nothing about Luis Tiant's hilarious mannerisms.
<br />
<br />Still.....highly recommended for Bill James/Rob Neyer fans, and for anybody who enjoys interesting baseball material that's unlike what you've ever seen.

                    <span>A huge disappointment. I expected more of a comparison of pitchers maybe by era or some more depth to the text maybe focusing on interesting hi- and low-lites of their careers combined with the usual stat analysis that sabermetricians are known for.<p>Basically, all this book is  is a list of pitchers in alphabetical order and reads like a textbook, or an old scouting report, rather than what should have been a fascinating journey of the pitchers who made it to the bigs.</span>
