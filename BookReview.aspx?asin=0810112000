                    <span>This is a sublime little tale, saturated with humor and pathos. Erofeev (both author & narrator have the same name, heightening the autobiographical tone of the book) is the Dante of the Moscow commuter rail. He stumbles from bar to bar and a purgatory of the 'thirteen varieties of Soviet vodka.' Then, it's onto the train, which takes him some thirty stops from Kursk station and 'The Hammer and Sickle' to the 'end of the line' at Petushki (which I'm told means 'flowers' in Russian) where he is to meet his Beatrice. <P>But (unlike Dante) Erofeev never seems to arrive. As he downs more and more hooch, the story becomes progressively more blotched and incoherent. It culminates in the Passion of Erofeev, in which our poor hero is driven up against the wall of the Kremlin (though whether its the Kremlin in Moscow or Petushki is unclear) and left screwed. <P>This is a story about mercy. Read it. It is easily one of the best books I've read in the past year. Then pass the word along, because it deserves to be better known.</span>

                    <span>Ah, this book...a cherished one for me, pilfered from a friend who's father studied under Nabokov (but later given back). I read this under the serious spell of Knut Hamsun and this book is similiar to "Hunger" but perhaps more humorous. It's about an unemployed, alcholic cable fitter who is fired for charting diagrams of his comrades "idleness" correalated with the days they get drunk. Thrust into a serious drinking binge he is stuck on a train trying to reach Moscow and in between we have flashbacks of him trying to buy vodka before restaurants and stores have opened, giving us recipes of cocktails made out of aftershave ("Aunt Clara's Kiss) that brings on hallucinations and incredible verbal pyrotechnics full of literary ramblings and political rumblings. The whole time his hallucinations are marked by a pair of overcoated angels egging him on or chastising his behavior as he mixes up his route on the train forgetting to disembark and actually heading away from his destination. He finally does reach Moscow and the novel closes like a hand over a movie lens as abruptly as it started. It is a startling book, not only the best of the samizdat novels (works distributed like fanzines secretly during the communist regime) but by far the most dazzling comic novels ever written about desperation and alcholism. It is an incredible book and after reading it you will never have patience for another Bukowski book again.</span>

                    <span>Moscow Circles (J.R Dorrel) is a better translation than Moscow to the End of the Line (H. William Tjalsma). It's more faithful to the original. I've read them both and prefer it by quite a bit. Moscow Circles is a little hard to find though. Moscow to the End of the Line is still a great read if thats all you can find. This is probably my favorite Russian book!</span>

                    <span>MOSCOW TO THE END OF THE LINE centers around Venichka, an alcoholic cable fitter who has only recently been fired from his job. The book is not really a "story." It consists instead of Venichka's rambling monologue as he indulges in one huge binge while taking the train from Moscow to Petushka, supposedly to visit his girlfriend and their young son.<P>When Venichka boards the train at Kursk Station in Moscow, his speech is fairly lucid. As his journey progresses, however, he becomes more and more drunk and his monologue degenerates into incoherent babble, accompanied by hallucinations.<P>Venichka is definitely not a shy speaker and he'll talk to anyone who will listen. He's also willing to expand on just about any topic available: politics, social reform, religion, angels, music, literature, love, philosophy, mathematics and, most of all, alcohol.<P>I know some readers see this book as satire while others see it as a commentary on Soviet Russia. Perhaps I'm too politically unsophisticated, but I didn't see it as either one. I saw it as a brilliant and classic tale of the tragedy of alcoholism. No matter how one interprets the book, however, I think most poeple would agree it's certainly a masterpiece, not only of Russian literature but of world literature as well.<P>MOSCOW TO THE END OF THE LINE is a short book, more novella than novel. It's not divided into chapters; breaks in the monologue occur at the different stops along Venichka's journey. The breaks are not always natural stopping places, however, and, I think it's best to read this book in one sitting.<P>I don't read any Russian at all, so I can only guess how extraordinary this book must be in its original language. Even in translation it's exceptional and the juxtaposition of the poetic and the profane provides a heady mix that's as intoxicating as are Venichka's alcoholic "recipes."<P>MOSCOW TO THE END OF THE LINE is a book I'd recommend to anyone who loves great literature. I enjoyed it thoroughly.</span>

                    <span>I am Russian, and I am not so fluent in English, so beg you pardon. I highly recommend this book, together with Bulgakov this is the most lovely and admired writer in my country.</span>
