                    <span>This is an important book for women who choose to work from home or who decide to start a home-based business. A big, big minus to working from home is the sense of isolation and lack of daily networking opportunities. It is critically important to maintain visibility, and that takes a concerted effort! Publicity must be part of the strategy for success - and it especially important for home-based businesses. I'm not talking about advertising; I'm talking about community visibility - personal publicity that lets potential customers and clients know who you are, what you do, and why they should buy from you or work with you. The women in this book are a good example of how even a small amount of the right publicity can produce a big, big payoff. Certainly all home-based operations will not hit the one million mark. But that's not a bad goal to keep in mind! (Reviewed by Marion E. Gold - author of the "Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU" and "TOP COPS: Profiles of Women in Command)</span>

                    <span>Jeanne Torrence Hauer really put together quite an inspirational book.  Each of her sixteen subjects were unique in their own experiences.  She presents them in such a way that I did not want to put the book down.  This is a must read for anyone who is looking to change the path their life is taking or would just like to be entertained by the successes of others.  This book would make a good gift.</span>
