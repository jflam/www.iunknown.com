                    <span>We used this book as a textbook for a second flash course in our multimedia program and overall I would have to say that this book is an excellent introduction to some more advanced techniques in flash mx 2004. I especially like the short tutorial approach that these books use - quick and handy. My only beef is that there isn't anything solid on components or xml, so that is why I say it is an introduction to more advanced topics. Topics like creating your own pull-down menus using tweening and actionscript (not components), attaching sounds, and stuff that requires using export for actionscript. If you are not sure what I am talking about then this is probably the book for you! Otherwise maybe consider something like "Flash MX 2004 actionscript" by Macromedia press. </span>

                    <span>I develop web applications (PHP, MySQL and some Javascript) for
<br />our company and I was looking for an Actionscript 2.0 book after
<br />reading "Show Me! Macromedia Flash MX 2004"from Que. I bought
<br />this book because of the great reviews here.  Am I disappointed?
<br />
<br />Well, the content is good but the instructions are somewhat
<br />repetitive. I was used to other books showing the code first,
<br />then explaining what it does and moving on from there without
<br />repeating previous instructions.  
<br />
<br />This book handholds its readers like they're babies (I don't 
<br />want to use the word "dummies") and this book could have been
<br />halved if it didn't treat its readers as such. I mean  how many
<br />times do the authors have to say, "Select the first frame of the
<br />root Timeline, and open the Actions panel" or "Create a new line
<br />after your last line of code from the preceding task".  There
<br />are other texts repeated this way. It wastes space that could 
<br />have been used for other tips (i.e. real and faked physics for 
<br />advanced animation).
<br />
<br />If I were a non-programmer, this books scores 5 but since I'm 
<br />not I'd have to say its a 4. Personally, it could be 4.5 but I'd 
<br />have to take the 0.5 for the repetitive instructions.
<br />
<br />If know you know how to program already, I suggest you look for 
<br />other Actionscript 2.0 books here that rates 5 (I'm sorry I 
<br />can't recommend any as this is my first Actionscript 2 book but 
<br />not the last one I hope).</span>

                    <span>Chun and Garraffo did an excellent job in creating a book that could be used in and out of a classroom setting.  It is also a great reference tool if you need to brush up on something you once learned.  Having come from a marketing background, this book is very easy to understand and can truly teach someone how to develop an entire Flash site.</span>

                    <span>Out of 4 books that I purchased to learn Flash, this is certainly the one with the most attractive format -- the formatting of screen shots and text in the "Visual QuickPro" range is superb. I wish all books were as readable as this one. These books read well chapter-by-chapter, but are also very useful as a reference. The balance and quality of Windows and Mac screen shots is also very good.<p>My minor criticisms are:<br>- Obviously, the book isn't as comprehensive as the Flash MX ActionScript Bible by Robert Reinhardt. So as a reference, I like having this other book handy as well;<br>- The book doesn't always mention whether features are only available in Flash Player 7. For example, there is no mention that the ContextMenu class which is nicely described in chapter 4 requires Flash Player 7 to work.<p>Overall, this book offers excellent value for money.</span>

                    <span>I've just built my first flash website after watching "Learning Macromedia Flash MX 2004" by Lynda.com and wanted to learn more about Flash. Saw this book on Amazon and bought it. It's probably the best educational book I've ever read: straight to the point, almost every tip was a tip that you knew mattered. The lessons are numbered step by step and don't drag you off into "help me I'm bored land." An excersise files CD is definitely a plus. That's pretty much it. I won't say I'm an advanced "Flash Guy" after reading this book, but I'm much more comfortable with what I'm doing now. I've gotten two more sites built, a bunch of friends who want me to build them a site, and a wedding site(for a friend) to build - hmmmm maybe this hobby could end up being something more?</span>
