                    <span>Compact book with lots of good information. The added Cd-rom, that is included, with a business plan that can be edited in WORD is an added benefit.  I will be looking into some of the other books offered from this author/publisher.</span>

                    <span>This series of papers glued together in sequence (I refuse to call it a book), is a complete waste of time. I knew all of this information right around the tenth grade and I'm sure everybody else did too. You've gotta be kidding!!! Where's the beef?? </span>

                    <span>I have never written a negative review of a book before - but I was so disappointed in the investment I made in this book, I felt compelled to let others know. 
<br />I got the impression that the author made a few minor changes to a book about running a restaurant, slapped on a new title and released it. I feel this book is far too expensive to be anything less than the source of specialized information it is advertised to be.</span>

                    <span>The book is great and the most updated on the subject - but the CD rom included with the book is superb and a very nice added bonus! It contains a full 50+ page business plan in Word for easy editing with financial statements, over 50 customized forms for your use in PDF format, and a check list of thousands of items you need to open - these are all bonus items included on the CD ROM !!!<br>We have looked at other business plans and software and all were over $100.00 - this is a great value - my only comment is the book is so packed with info. the type size is a little small for my aging eyes...</span>
