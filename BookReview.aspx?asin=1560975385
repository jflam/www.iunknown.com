                <span id="Label1">Jules Feiffer, Art Spiegelman, Chris Ware, and the late Al Hirschfeld talk with each other about their art.  Four of the greatest cartoonists of the 20th Century come together to talk about their lives, careers, influences, passions and preferences in art, literature, comics, film, theater and more, reflecting the rich well of their 200+ years of collective experience as artists in a series of once-in-a-lifetime conversations and interviews. Maus author Art Spiegelman chats with the late, great Al Hirschfeld and interviews fellow Pulitzer-prize winner Jules Feiffer, who is also interviewed by <I>TCJ</I> founder Gary Groth and chats with young lion Chris Ware. The only thing more extraordinary than these conversations taking place at all is to have so many of them between two covers!<P> If that weren't enough: The issue also includes essays and criticism on a broad range  of topics&#151;including <I>The Simpsons</I>, Lyonel Feininger, Phoebe Gloeckner, Milt Gross, Ben Katchor and William Blake&#151;written by the Journal's finest critics, such as Donald Phelps, Robert Fiore, Bill Blackbeard and R.C. Harvey, as well as short "Pass It On" essays on rising cartoonists you need to know about and a massive tribute section to Hirschfeld and Bill Mauldin, from their peers and admirers in the fields of art, literature, film, politics, theatre and beyond!<P> Last but hardly least is our "Cartoonists On" section, boasting of comics-form essays, short stories and vignettes from today's finest cartoonists&#151;including the likes of R. Crumb, Chris Ware, Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, Arnold Roth, Phoebe Gloeckner, Bill Griffith, Gary Panter and dozens of other cartooning English-language cartoonists, as well as new work from European and Japanese comics greats for the very first time&#151;on the topic of "The Shock of Recognition" (the event, experience, or work of art that had a profound effect on them and their art).</span>

                    <span>Another gorgeous special edition from the Comics Journal. As usual, it is a visual marvel: 10" by 10", with excellent design on the cover and throughout. You wanna hang these things on your wall. Unfortunately, this long delayed collection of essays and comics is the worst yet and may spell the end of the special editions. <P>The book features essays and interviews with several generations of cartoonists, but Chris Ware--the most exciting cartoonist of his and maybe any generation--gets interviewed only along with Jules Feiffer and we learn little about Ware or the important work he does. An inept essay about Ware--in which the essayist substitutes breathless exuberance for critical analysis--does little to fill the gap. The other "cartoonists"--Hirschfeld, Spiegelman, Feiffer--are fine but the interviews are a little dull. Besides, these guys have done the bulk of their work in magazine illustration (including most of Spiegelman's later stuff) so one wonders if the magazine is about comics or merely cartoony art. <P>In the same vein, a chaotic and seemingly purposeless essay about the Simpsons doesn't even make a nominal connection to comics. The writer doesn't let us know much, except pointless bits of trivia he mistakes for erudition and that he doesn't think the new shows are as good as the old ones. But not all the essays fall flat; Tom Spurgeon, with typical insight and thoughtfulness, lets us know what makes Phoebe Gloeckner (sp?) tick and gave me newfound appreciation for that soulful, subversive cartoonist. <P>Gloeckner, the Hernandez brothers, Bill Griffith and Ho Che Anderson all contribute wonderful pieces, putting the oversized square format to good use (though considering the eminence of the artists none of it is especially salient). But those are about the most prominent names here; neither Ware nor Bagge nor Crumb nor Seth contribute anthing and their absence is palpable. Fewer artists contributed this time, so the editors compensated by giving the cartoonists who did show up more space. Many of the remainder of comics are unremarkable if not clunky, though a strip about two pretentious English boys writing their own comics was ironic in a lighthearted way refreshingly foreign to comics. <P>In any case, it's a gorgeous book; it's just not a whole lot of fun to read. Design brilliance and airy substance aren't odd pairs to anyone who's ever "read" Adbusters, but frankly I expected more from a magazine that tries to wear its brain so prominently on its sleeve.</span>
