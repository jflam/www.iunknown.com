                    <span>Hanson has emerged in my mind as one of the best political commentators since George Will. His phenomenal knowledge of the history of Western civilization and its military actions brings great breadth and depth to his observations of current affairs. His lifelong connection to the farmer's soil gives him a far more realistic and credible world view than the academic elite from which he frequently tries to distance himself (a remarkable feat for a Professor of Classics).<BR>This book is a compilation of essays written during the three months after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. I fully expected that there would be dated material and some degree of redundancy, since they appeared originally in different venues. Neither fear was realized. His reliance on universal patterns of human behavior makes these commentaries even more relevant today, after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, than they were at the time they were written. I could find no instance where his predictions about either Administration actions or military and political outcomes did not come to pass.<BR>His writing style is very clear and flows easily. His frequent allusions to military battles over the past two millennia may leave some readers with a feeling that he is being pedantic. But his sense of humor and bluntly stated (often politically incorrect) opinions make the reader's experience a joy.</span>

                    <span>Victor Davis Hanson first came to prominence about 15 or so years ago, when he published a book on Greek warfare that included a forward by eminent British historian John Keegan. The book revised what was known about Greek warfare somewhat, and was considered very good. Since then he's been a military historian, and chronicler of the experience of farming, and written on Greek culture and history. Of late, however, Hanson has branched out and become something of a social critic and pundit, opining on a series of things. He has a sharp tongue, a sharper wit, and a nasty ability to deflate the reputations of those he sees fit to target. This latest, short volume, is a compilation of columns he wrote, mostly for National Review Online, in the four months immediately following September 11 of last year. They are by turns incisive, penetrating, bitingly humorous, and entertaining, with the occasional one that's irritating. The one I liked the least was the author purporting to interview an ancient Greek soldier as if he were still alive, and just retiring, about the war in Afghanistan. All of the General's responses are actual quotes from something the man wrote. I didn't feel the article was successful, mostly because the questions and answers didn't quite match, as if this were a print version of the Conan O'Brien bit where he conducts the fake interviews with people, and they say outrageous things.<P>That being said, I enjoyed the book a great deal, and would recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Victor Davis Hanson combines the historical perspective of the scholar with the practical, down to earth experiences of the common man. [He's a classical historian and a farmer.] The result is a narrative that "rings true." His book helped me come to terms with what is happening in our world because I understand better the thinking and motivations of the players. He answers the questions - why is terrorism happening?, and why are we doing what we're doing to defeat it? He gave me a clearer understanding of the beliefs of the Islamic Fundamentalist Fascists, what is at stake for our society and why we need to protect and defend our way of life. He also reminded me of the goodness in our country - of the values including: integrity, moral courage, fairness, respect, responsibility, compassion which we hold dear. While our country isn't perfect, he again reminded me that there's no place else I would want to live. I shared his book with members of a book club I belong to, and one person said, "If the administration had made the case for defending ourselves like Mr. Hanson did, I would have had a greater understanding and appreciation for the actions our country has taken since 9/11." I purchased a second copy of this book so I could pass it around to book club members, church members and friends. It is truly an OUTSTANDING book!!!!!</span>

                    <span>Wow, this book was something else. Powerful and full of insight, Hanson offers a unique perspective on American situation after 9-11. What he eloquently expresses in this narrative is what many Americans feel inside but rarely hear from the media or academia. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, although those inhabiting liberal politically correct sensibilities might themselves appalled (a fact that makes this read ever-so more enjoyable). What if America reacted the same way the did in 1941 as they did in 2001? This book offers a couple of parodies that show today's reaction absurd. Hanson documents some people's responses to 9-11 that will make most sick. This account speaks with clarity and resolve in addressing what the US much now do. A great read, one that is hard to put down!</span>

                    <span>Today, with all the arguments for and aghinst the war in Iraq, on the eve of the Iowa caucus where all the canidates can agree on is their lothing of the president we tend to lose sight of the horrible, and evil attack that claimed over 3,000 of our country men. Hanson's book is critical to see that the current self-hating attiude of America liberals is far deeper rooted than the current occupition of Iarq. Hanson wrote his work in real time, as we prepared to go into Afganistan and bring to justice those that are enemies not only to America and the west but to their own people as well; the greatest killer of muslims is muslims. Hanson hits this fact while also asking why we left Hussian in power to begin with, why we give the PLO-a terrioist organization-over 100 million a year to nation build and only see it spent aghinst Isreal. while reading this, I also picked up Richard Nixon's No More Vietnams, an intraging look at how we lost a war we should have won. Although, as another reviewer pointed out, Hanson tends to simplify the middle east (a much more complete view can be found in Benerad Lewis)and is a neocon, his book shows the seperation that is forming in America between the classes in how they view America and the world. as a senior in high school prepareing to enlist, I found that Mr Hanson's view of the world is simplistic; however, it is not wrong. what is worng are the self proclaimed humanists like Gore Vidal who apolgize for Bin Lidan, who make excueses for murders and who condemm those that seek to bring them to justice. So, for the readers who see it now, understand that the book is a look at a segment of the American psych in 2002 and, thus, is useful to learn about our national character and the willingness of America to use force. ($20 says the adminstration read this book:)</span>
