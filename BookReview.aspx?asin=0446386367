                    <span>Copious strategies for becoming a salesmanship champion fill the pages of Tom Hopkins' book. This is a handbook for those who are eager to become sales masters, but are asking themselves, "What do I do next?" "How do I deal with a procrastinating client?" or "How can I effectively present my product?" Hopkins conveys instructions and suggestions through a variety of sales conversations. The author, a master salesman, is obviously enthusiastic about helping others succeed in sales. His strategies, which are based on seminars he teaches, include steps for organizing and writing a successful sales presentation. He also provides strategies for closing sales. The information could be more compact and less repetitive, but it is logical and sometimes even funny. We from getAbstract recommend this book to people involved in all levels and aspects of sales.</span>

                    <span>How to Master the Art of Selling is a book that must be read by anyone planning on entering the sales profession, and everyone currently in sales. No matter how good a salesperson you believe yourself to be, your sales skills can be sharpened by the information contained within the pages of this book. Tom Hopkins has been a master salesperson for many years. He has taken the time to compile all of his proven sales techniques and list them in an easy to follow format. Since I read this book, my sales have increased dramatically. Even though I have read this book from cover to cover many times, something new is gained every time I read it. You don't have to be in sales to benefit from the knowledge that is in this book. What you are selling does not necessarily have to be a product. It could be a point of view or an idea. How would you like to be able to talk someone into or out of something? You will be able to, if you follow the guidelines that are in this book. You will have a better understanding as to what people think about when they make decisions. Mr. Hopkins calls the people who have mastered the techniques in this book "champions". He says, "you know the champions when they walk through the door." If you want to be a champion,</span>

                    <span>I am a VERY successful media salesperson and was introduced to this TAPE SERIES right out of college. I had NO clue of how to sell and this tape series gave me the solid foundation upon which to build. After a few years I read "How To Win Friends And Influence People" and after I put both of these works together, it was MAGIC! I am the most successful salesperson in my industry and I constantly have clients "BEGGING" to give me all of their money. The interesting thing is that money is not the reason that I am in sales. However, I have more money than I could possibly spend! And, when I asked a close associate why she thought all of this was happening, she and I sat down and figured it out. The answer was that the principles of both of these works have become such a part of me that I hadn't realized how Effective, Unique and Valuable they were. At one point I said to her, "Doesn't everybody treat their clients this way" and she said- THAT'S IT! You really DON'T get it! That's why you're SO GOOD! It's not an act. You're sincere and the fact that you actually care about them really comes through and sets you apart so much!<BR>Enough said.</span>

                    <span>I notice a lot of negative reviews by people who aren't worthy to shine Tom's shoes. This book made the careers of many sales professionals, and deserves to be treated with respect. I went through several copies in the early 80's, replete with underlining. Of course there has been progress in selling since them! Does that mean that we need to diss those who have contributed to the advancement of this profession?<P>As far as substance, Tom explains each of the stages of salesmanship in simple, but not simplistic, terms. It is as good an introduction to the field as any you are likely to find. It is up there with Zig's best. And, I might add, Zig and Tom would pay homage to Frank Bettger, Elmer Wheeler and other pioneers who blazed the trail.</span>
