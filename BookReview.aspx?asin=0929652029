                <span id="Label1"><B><I>This book is best suited to those business leaders who have a burning desire to win.</I></B> It's a book with a compelling message about the resurgence of business process thinking for competitive advantage. In an easy-to-read format, the book outlines why and how thoughtful CEO&#146;s and leadership teams can manage enterprise business processes as the means to transform their good companies into great ones.  <P> Spanyi's book is a must read for business leaders searching for ways to manage the business in a more integrated manner by applying 21st century BPM techniques, thinking and technologies. <I>Business process thinking</I> is the prerequisite for executives to take advantage of powerful new BPM technologies. The book is, however, less about tools, templates and technologies and more about the set of <I>values, beliefs and business practices</I> needed to navigate through challenging economic times. Indeed, that&#146;s why Spanyi says BPM is a team sport--<I>Play it to Win!</I> And to win, leaders must manage the cross-functional teams throughout the organization who must work collaboratively to create enduring value for customers and shareholders.  <P> Much of what has been written on BPM is mechanistic and technical. Several of the works are long and tough to digest, and the links to strategy, organization design, people issues and technology are lost in the details. In a fast-paced and engaging manner, Spanyi describes how BPM can provide a robust framework enabling an organization to achieve <I>strategic focus, organizational alignment and operating discipline.</I>   <P>Spanyi proposes that organizations need to consciously work on transforming the <I>mental models</I> of the executive team from the traditional functional paradigm to a customer-driven model that is based on business process thinking. The book provides insight into why change initiatives like reengineering, continuous improvement and Six Sigma, when implemented piecemeal, are not nearly enough to achieve dominance in today's turbulent business environment. BPM is needed to provide the context for both change initiatives and the application of emerging technology, so that change programs can be deeply and fully integrated across the organization. <P> The book is written such that the initial reading can be done in less than the time it takes to fly from Dallas to Boston or from Toronto to Miami. A quick read can acquaint the reader with the essential concepts. Readers can then consume the book more carefully a second time, and combine its reading assignments to gain a more complete background and understanding of this vital subject (all the readings can be acquired through the book&#146;s Web site).</span>

                    <span>This is a book that explains Business Process Management in business terms. The book can be introduced to someone with little or no background of BPM concepts. I have been struggling on how to package BPM to help our organization grow. Someone has finally put together a nicely written, short book that can be completed in a few hours on the first read. I would suggest reading this book two or three times and Business Process Management the Third Wave before presenting this to your organization/company. The move from functionally based stovepipe organizations, departments, applications and systems is in the very near future. I would consider this book to be the cliff notes or readers digest version of Business Process Management the Third Wave written by Howard Smith and Peter Fingar (A MUST FOR ANYONE SERIOUS ABOUT BPM).</span>

                    <span>We know that to be successful, our organizations have to become "customer driven" and that means improving our business processes across the enterprise.  But business processes are boring, and so are most business books.  This one is an exception.<br>Mr. Spanyi makes a strong case that if people collaborate better, the organization can reach its goals - despite the tough economy.<br>Want to attain that "shared thinking" so necessary in cross-functional teams? This book provides real advice that any business person can use.  Best of all, its clear and concise.  So, if you are faced with improving the performance of your organization, I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>In this book Mr. Spanyi's thought leadership is some of the clearest and timeliest I have ever encountered in a business publication. An expert himself, he has (happily) the expert's ability to reduce complex subject matter to an elegantly simple and instructive message. I recommend this book above all others to anyone who may be curious about what it means to be entrepreneurial in the 21st century, which is to say, everyone who must consider their business in light of customer requirements.</span>

                    <span>The recent history of business publications has seen a plethora of ideas for addressing the dual challenges of accelerating change of pace and complexity of operation. In his book, Spanyi clearly presents his ideas on how to successfully create and implement Business Process Management (BPM) on an enterprise-wide basis for current and future business success.<p>He restates and drives home the eternal truth of developing a strategic plan and using business process thinking to get company wide buy-in. He details and explains mistakes of the past and presents his BPM approach as a blueprint for future success. His ideas for implementing strategic cross-functional process design and elimination of traditional barriers such as turf wars are as intellectually stimulating as they are practical and represent a potential formula for success.</span>
