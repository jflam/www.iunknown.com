                    <span>Solaris Internals is a must read for system programmers and anyone interested in Operating System Design. The book is loaded with important information and splendidly organized into 4 major sections. Each section is well thought out and walks you from subject to subject, with serious technical depth. I found myself writing test programs throughout the book and am certain I've learned a great many things. <P>Part One deals with traps, interrupts, callouts, contexts, and lock primitives and goes where the Sparc/SparcV9 Architecture Manuals did not. <P>My favorite section was Part Two (Solaris Memory System), it left me with a clear understanding of _everything_ related to memory: HAT, TSB's, TLB, MMU, phys mem organization, page table hashing, paging, page scanner, address spaces and segments, seg drivers, slab allocator, watchpoints, multiple page sizing, memory managment strats, to name a few subjects...<P>Part Three deals with threads, processes, and IPC. It has a large and very useful section on the Kernel Dispatcher and scheduling. <P>Part Four deals with everything 'file system'; DNLC, pn lookups, mmap, direct io, aio, fs cache, vnodes, vfs, etc. It contains useful details of useful Solaris features, which are easy to overlook in system manual pages.<P>Finally, Solaris Internals contains many data structure diagrams, charts, and tables -- the diagrams alone are enough to make the book useful! <P>A well written and _useful_ book ;)<P>--joey</span>

                    <span>I strongly recommend this book to Solaris application programmers and system admins who are interested in performance tuning.<P>This book covers a broad over view of the Solaris kernel subsystems (except I/O, devices, and networking). It has a lot of insideful information for system performance tuning. Howerver, if you are interested learning programming the kernel, this books is falling short in practically every topic it covers -- it has excellent over view, but nothing in depth (except locking). Nevertheless, it's an excellent companion book to the Solaris source code which everyone can obtain a free license.<P>This books is very well written. Unlike the other System V Unix internal book which loading up /usr/include/sys include files and called it kernel internal, these authors actual discuss each kernel component.<P>Although this book is falling short in depth, it's still a very useful book for solaris programmers and system admins. Strongly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book will teach you everything you want to know about Solaris. It is an excellent Operating Systems book and can be used as a reference or text. It digs into the guts of the kernel and intimately presents the fine details of Solaris operation.</span>

                    <span>Very nicely written book. It's hard though sometimes to understand, and sometimes difficult to follow as the author does not sometimes follow a logical and gradual approach in explaining the topic, like in the case of VMM. However, the book is a must have for someone interested in knowing how Solaris works. If you are able to understand the book cover to cover, you can claim full understanding of Solaris Internals.</span>
