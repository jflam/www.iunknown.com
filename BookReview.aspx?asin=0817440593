                <span id="Label1">An updated bestseller, this book of extraordinarily beautiful photographs of nature contains state-of-the-art instruction on how any photographer can aim for equally impressive results every time a camera is focused on the great outdoors. Even highly skilled photographers are often baffled by the problems facing them when they work outdoors. But with this exceptional field guide in hand, every photographer-beginner, serious amateur, semi-pro, and pro-can conquer the problems encountered in the field. Using his own exceptional work as examples, the author discusses each type of nature subject and how to approach photographing it. Specific advice and information cover selection of equipment and lenses; how to compose a shot; how to get close ups; and other tips covering a range of techniques to enrich various types of nature photographs.</span>

                    <span>Quick summary: excellent - buy it.  For more detail, read on.  
<br />
<br />Possibly the best book about photography I've ever read.  It doesn't just describe nature photography, but also goes into many technical details about how to obtain the picture *you* want to obtain.  Many of these details are fundamental to all types of photography (exposure, lighting, etc.), so there is something to be gained for everyone.
<br />
<br />However, as the title of the book clearly indicates, the bulk of the text is dedicated to photographing in outside lighting - it *is* nature after all - so you might want to consider another book if your primary interest is indoor studio photography. 
<br />
<br />In terms of experience level, I think anyone from an amateur photographer just starting out to the seasoned pro will find useful tips and anecdotes in this text.  I've been using an SLR camera for many years but I'm amazed at how many things I've learned from this book.  
<br />
<br />One small drawback is that the author only uses Nikon cameras and hence most of the equipment related advice is for Nikon branded equipment.  He does occasionally mention Canon equivalents, although the charts and comparisons of sizes, weights, etc. are only for Nikon.  Still, I use a Canon camera and found this to be only a very minor annoyance.
<br />
<br />The book has so many excellent photographs (185) in it that it would be worth buying for the pictures alone.  However, as long as you're buying a book of pictures, why not throw in an excellently written text describing in great detail how the pictures were taken and how to obtain similar results yourself?
<br />
<br />It also has all sorts of interesting mini chapters - one is even included on how to take aerial photographs and includes advice on the types of planes and pilots to rent!  A section I think I'll find especially handy lists some of the author's favorite shooting locations and what you can find there by month of the year (mainly in the United States).  
<br />
<br />The book was published fairly recently (2000), but still deals exclusively with film (mostly slide).  So those of us using the newer digital SLR's will want to skim past the sections on choosing a film type, push processing your film, etc.  However, it's kind of fun to read over these sections and realize how much easier things are now with digital.  No more waiting through a whole roll of film to change your ISO, much faster ISO speeds with good results (I frequently use 1600 for macro work with no problem), no need to *buy* film or process, etc.  After you've read the book, go out and buy yourself a Canon EOS 20D or equivalent and you'll see what I mean.  ;-)  The only time I wished the book discussed digital is with regard to the number of stops film can accurately reproduce (about 5).  It would have been nice to see the equivalent information for digital, and some sections on digital exposure tips and tricks - but I suppose this is for the next version of the book.
<br />
<br />Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book was in it's day a great book worthly of a 5 star rating but time has a way of making material irrelevant. Probably half the book deals with photography lessons that time won't change but the other half deals with equipment and how to use it. Having been published in 1984 all the equipment information in it has become outdated. <br>  The book was written before digital photography was even a dream,eg: TTL flash metering was the new thing, but  we have gone through D-TTL and now have I-TTL flash sysems out. <br>  There is simply no reason to purchase a book that is simply so far out of date, a great book in it's day, but that day and come and gone.</span>

                    <span>Although written for film photography rather than digital, if you need to learn the basics of exposure and lenses and the general process a photographer must go through to take great photographs instead of just snapshots, this is an excellent guide.
<br />
<br />The basic fact of the matter is that good photographs are produced in this order
<br />
<br />1. Photographer's "eye"
<br />2. Good equipment, handled expertly
<br />3. Post processing
<br />
<br />Digital photography differs from film primarily in the last category. This book's focus is on the first two, without which good photography is not possible. Look elesewhere for books on Photoshop, but look here to learn how not to need it so much.</span>

                    <span>Since getting into photography about three years ago; I have read a dozen books that supposedly taught me exposure, aperture, shutter speeds; in other words the fundamental basics of all photography.  This book is the only one that actually made me see what everyone else was awkwardly trying to say.  I don't know John Shaw's work or if he is even a decent photographer but I can tell you if you need a mentor in this art we call photography; buy this book, curl up and prepare to open your eyes to the building blocks of all photographers.  I refer back to this book every couple of months and I am always surprised at how much I still learn from this one simple book.  I am sure many of you think you're a great photographer, so did I.  I am just now beginning to learn why some pictures are great and what will enable me to take my pictures from privately loved to accepted greatness!  Thanks John Shaw for all your work, it has truely helped me!</span>

                    <span>I won't dwell on this topic, but I've consumed many photogrpahy books in recent years and John Shaw is an excellent writer that gets his point across. I wish I had read it earlier than I did because it is fantastic. He writes exceptionally well and drives his point home from multiple angles. He starts with the essentials like exposure and.... I just can't say enough about the way John is able to communicate photographic concepts and photography in general. The best I have ever read. Second to John's book is, Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs With a Film or Digital Camera by Bryan F. Peterson; Bryan is also excellent. If you buy two books, buy these.</span>
