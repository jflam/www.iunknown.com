On its surface, George Lucas's story is a rollicking and humorous space fantasy that owes debts to more influences than one can count on two hands, but filmgoers became entranced by its basic struggle of good vs. evil "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away," its dazzling special effects, and a mythology of Jedi knights, the Force, and droids. Over the course of three films--<I>A New Hope</I> (1977), <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> (1980), and <I>Return of the Jedi</I> (1983)--Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and the roguish Han Solo (Harrison Ford) join the Rebel alliance in a galactic war against the Empire, the menacing Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), and eventually the all-powerful Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). <I>Empire</I> is generally considered the best of the films and <I>Jedi</I> the most uneven, but all three are vastly superior to the more technologically impressive prequels that followed, <I>Episode I, The Phantom Menace</I> (1999) and <I>Episode II, Attack of the Clones</I> (2002).  <p>  <B>How Are the Picture and Sound?</B><br> <table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=3 width=155 align="right"> <tr> <td><hr noshade size=1> <font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="336600"> <b>Thanks to a new digital transfer, you've never seen C-3PO glow so golden, and Darth Vader's helmet is as black as the Dark Side.</b> <br> </font> <hr noshade size=1></td> </tr> </table> In a word, spectacular. Thanks to a new digital transfer, you've never seen C-3PO glow so golden, and Darth Vader's helmet is as black as the Dark Side. And at the climactic scene of <I>A New Hope</I>, see if the Dolby 5.1 EX sound doesn't knock you back in your chair. Other audio options are Dolby 2.0 Surround in English, Spanish, and French. (Sorry, DTS fans, but previous <I>Star Wars</I> DVDs didn't have DTS either.) There have been a few quibbles with the audio on <I>A New Hope</I>, however.  A few seconds of Peter Cushing's dialogue ("Then name the system!") are distorted, and the music (but not the sound effects) is reversed in the rear channels.  For example, in the final scene, the brass is in the front right channel but the back left channel (from the viewer's perspective), and the strings are in the left front and back right.  The result feels like the instruments are crossing through the viewer.<p>  <B>What's Been Changed?</B><br> The rumors are true: Lucas made <I>more</I> changes to the films for their DVD debut. Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has been added to a scene in <I>Jedi</I>, Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) replaces Clive Revill with slightly revised lines in <I>Empire</I>, Temuera Morrison has rerecorded Boba Fett's minimal dialogue, and some other small details have been altered. Yes, these changes mean that the <I>Star Wars</I> films are no longer the ones you saw 20 years ago, but these brief changes hardly affect the films, and they do make sense in the overall continuity of the two trilogies. It's not like a digitized Ewan McGregor has replaced Alec Guiness's scenes, and the infamous changes made for the 1997 special-edition versions were much more intrusive (of course, those are in the DVD versions as well).<p>  <B>How Are the Bonus Features?</B><br> <table align=left   cellpadding="5"                                 <tr>                                 <td> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/aplus/starwars/lucas-hamill-30.jpg" border=0  align=top></td></tr></table>  Toplining is <I>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy</I>, a 150-minute documentary incorporating not only the usual making-of nuts and bolts but also the political workings of the movie studios and the difficulties Lucas had getting his vision to the screen (for example, after resigning from the Directors' Guild, he lost his first choice for director of <I>Jedi</I>: Steven Spielberg). It's a little adulatory, but it has plenty to interest any fan. The three substantial featurettes are "The Characters of <I>Star Wars</I>" (19 min.), which discusses the development of the characters we all know and love, "The Birth of the Lightsaber" (15 min.), about the creation and evolution of a Jedi's ultimate weapon, and "The Force Is with Them: The Legacy of <I>Star Wars</I>" (15 min.), in which filmmakers such as Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron talk about how they and the industry were affected by the films and Lucas's technological developments in visual effects, sound, and computer animation.<p>  The bonus features are excellent and along the same lines as those created for <I>The Phantom Menace</I> and <I>Attack of the Clones</I>. Each film has a commentary track, recorded by Lucas, Ben Burtt (sound design), Dennis Muren (visual effects), and Carrie Fisher, with Irvin Kershner joining in on the film he directed, <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I>. Recorded separately and skillfully edited together (with supertitles to identify who is speaking), the tracks lack the energy of group commentaries, but they're enjoyable and informative, with a nice mix of overall vision (Lucas), technical details (Burtt, Muren, Kershner), and actor's perspective (Fisher). Interestingly, they discuss some of the 1997 changes (Mos Eisley creatures, the new Jabba the Hutt scene) but not those made for the DVDs.<p>  There's also a sampler of the Xbox game <I>Star Wars: Battlefront</I>, which lets the player reenact classic film scenarios (blast Ewoks in the battle of Endor!); trailers and TV spots from the films' many releases; and a nine-minute preview of the last film in the series, <I>Episode III, Revenge of the Sith</I> (here identified by an earlier working title, <I>The Return of Darth Vader</I>). Small extra touches include anamorphic widescreen motion menus with dialogue, original poster artwork on the discs, and a whopping 50 chapter stops for each film.<p>  <B>"The Force Is Strong with This One"</B><br> The <I>Star Wars Trilogy</I> is an outstanding DVD set that lives up to the anticipation. There will always be resentment that the original versions of the films are not available as well, but George Lucas maintains that these are the versions he always wanted to make. If fans are able to put this debate aside, they can enjoy the adventures of Luke, Leia, and Han for years to come. <I>--David Horiuchi</I></span>

                    <span>A long time ago, in 1977, George Lucas and his team of creative artists presented the world with the most successful, most popular and most imaginative work of science fiction ever to grace the screen- Star Wars. Originally a six part saga, Lucas decided to begin with the last installments (episodes 4,5 and 6). EPISODE 4: A NEW HOPE introduced the characters that have been a part of American culture for more than twenty years- the adventurous, pure-hearted Luke Skywalker, the mercenary but loveable Han Solo, the elegant Princess Leia, the wise Zen master Obi Won Kenobi and the evil, black-clad Darth Vader.<P>Although to many intellectuals, Star Wars appears to be trivial fantasy, with flat, underdeveloped characters and razzle-dazzle special effects in a story without any meaning, there is more to Star Wars than meets the eye. Interviews with George Lucas have proven that he suffused the story with symbolism and classic aspects of mythology. In one level, it is a coming-of-age story and in another a saga of good versus evil. Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), an orphan without knowledge of who his father was, has lost his aunt and uncle in the hands of the overpowering military of the Empire. Obi Won Kenobi, a former pilot, guides him in the Zen way of the Force- a mysterious, spiritual cosmic force. A message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) via the robotic R2D2 and C3PO sends Luke and his friends on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped princess who is in the hands of the evil lord Darth Vader.<P>Their journey takes them to a wild tavern (Mos Eisley) where alien outlaws gather for drinks. Here they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who assists them on their mission by providing his ship the Millenium Falcon. The hairy, ape-dog hybrid Chewbacca is his sidekick. Although Princess Leia is saved and the powerful space station Death Star destroyed, the seemingly happy ending to this first film hides an ill omen- Darth Vader is not defeated.<P>The special effects are striking, particularily on DVD, and the sound, the cinematography and the scenes that were cut due to time (such as Han Solo meeting with the alien mob lord Jabba The Hut) are included. George Lucas's masterpiece is at its finest.</span>

                    <span>George Lucas' first installment in the hugely popular STAR WARS franchise is generally regarded as the greatest movie ever made. Why? Well, what's not to like? From the opening shot of the Blockade Runner accompanied by that great theme tune by John Williams, you know you're in the unique world of the STAR WARS universe. Before George's action-packed THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, A NEW HOPE was known only as STAR WARS. Audiences had never seen anything so original and amazing. Now, the series has entered into the fanboy culture all over the world. In comparison, Episode 4 seems somewhat tame compared to ATOC, but it's still an astounding adventure filled with great characters and amazing music.<BR>From Hero Luke Skywalker's symbolic journey from his home Tatooine to the moment of victory at the finale, we are greeted with a myriad of fantastic characters, especially Han Solo, played by a pre-Indy Harrison Ford and his mate Chewbacca. And the ultimate incarnation of evil, Darth Vader. And that, more than anything, is what made TPM so hollow. While the action was good, the lack of good characters is disappointing. But AOTC has regained much of the sense of adventure that this film started off. <BR>Lucas' grand vision illuminates the entire film, with inventive creatures and events. Several scenes that are my favorites are Obi Wan's conversation to Luke about the Clone Wars and Vader, Solo's disposal of Greedo, Obi Wan and Vader's last battle and the battle of Yavin. One of my all-time favorite films, STAR WARS is THE great adventure.<P>Directed by Irvin Kershner, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK moved away from the high-sprited antics of the first film and took a step towards the dark side. The Empire is preparing to seek revenge on the Rebel Alliance, C3P0 gets blasted to bits and Luke Skywalker finds out that Darth Vader is his dad! Even John William's score is much darker in tone than his previous efforts. But the film is an excellent adventure that many fans consider to be superior to the original. Mark Hamill returns as Luke, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as the sardonic Han Solo. And we are introduced to the wise Yoda, who trains Luke about the ways of a Jedi. The action ante is upped considerably, with exciting chases through asteroid feilds, battles between the imperial fighters and the AT-ATs and Luke's rescue mission. And the Bespin Duel, where the confrontational battle between Vader and Luke ends with one of the most shocking revelations in movie history (Even if it's somewhat un-surprising for future fans who watch all the completed films in sequence).<P>RETURN OF THE JEDI isn't as good as the previous two, but still has it's moments of exciting action. Episode VI starts off where EMPIRE left off, with Luke and Leia rescuing Han Solo from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While the film is less exciting than it's counterparts, it does have some good action, including the rescue on the desert skiff, the speeder chase through the forest of Endor, the dark final battle between Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Luke and the destruction of the second Death Star. The lightsaber fights are some of the best in the Star Wars cannon and Princess Leia is hotter than ever! John William's score is even more exciting than ESB. The one thing that's somewhat grinding is the inclusion of the ewoks, but the rest is good-natured fun. <BR>If I were to place the Star Wars films in order from best to not-as-good, they would go THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, A NEW HOPE, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE PHANTOM MENACE. I hope George decides to do parts VII, VIII and IX, because they can bring back all the great characters that make these films so enjoyable. <BR>This presentation is very impressive, with added scenes and improved SFX. We see more of Jabba the Hutt, there are some great additions including the amazing Bespin City and the added scenes at the end of JEDI. A classic trilogy, and a must-buy when it gets on DVD. I'm waiting...</span>

                    <span>I just recently purchased a DVD player and knew that the Star Wars Trilogy would have to be in my collection ASAP. Of course I've these three movies many, many times, but for some reason I never tire of seeing them again. The first one brings back many childhood memories (my brother had a Star Wars themed bedroom!) and it's comforting to put it on just to have as background noise when my apartment gets too quiet. I guess that is the true meaning of a classic movie - you love it so much that it becomes a part of yourself. <P>The added interviews and such on this DVD were pretty insightful to me and the bonus disc of "never before seen" footage from making the three movies had me giddy with delight! <P>I can't imagine anyone not wanting to have this set in their collection!</span>

                    <span>The Star Wars legacy was directly stolen from The Lord of The Rings novels, which were publised in the 1950s. It's shameless, I tell you, shameless! <P>First there's Luke Skywalker, who has to leave behind his friends to face the evil all alone. But he gets to take along a little droid named R2-D2. This is obviously based on Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Lord of the Rings. Then there are the wise Jedi Masters, Yoda and Obi Wan Kanobe. These two characters were obviously based on Tolkien's Gandalf. <P>Han Solo is a carbon copy of Aragorn. Princess Liea, the warrior hottie, is a ripoff of Eowyn in the Lord of the Rings. Chewbacca is just a ripoff of Gimli. And what about Boba Fett, the mysterious loner who is loyal to no one, who is only out for himself? This is just a ripoff of Gollum. The Death Star is really Mount Doom. Darth Vader is Saruman, and The Empoeror is Saruman. <P>And then there's Lando Calrisian, who is stolen from J.R.R. Tolkein's character King Theoden. You know, the cowardly ruler who bow's down to the bad guy, then finds his courage to fight! The storm toopers are just Orcs. And the most shameless ripoff of all is the Imperial Walkers in Empire Strikes Back! They are just like the Mumakil monsters in Lord of the Rings. <P>I can't believe how George Lucas become so filthy rich through thievery!!</span>
