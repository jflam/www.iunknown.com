                    <span>If that phrase means ANYTHING to you, you'll absolutely LOVE Kill Bill, Volume 1. The fourth film by pop-culture sponge/Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino is a bloody stew of Kung-Fu, Anime, Samurai, Blaxploitation, 80's Brian De Palma, Spaghetti Westerns, Ennio Morricone, and just about every other bizarre influence you could possibly imagine, all mixed together and served up piping hot. Or should that be totally cool...?<P> Uma Thurman stars as the Woman with no name; Honestly- Her name is bleeped on the few occasions anyone in the film utters it. Let's just call her The Bride. The Bride is a former member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS, an elite squad of female assassine, headed up by the titular enigma, Bill.) who apparently don't take kindly to her retirement. The girls bust up The Bride's Wedding, killing everybody, before Bill himself delivers the coup de grace to the pregnant Bride- A bullet to the head. Since it wouldn't be much of a revenge film otherwise, The Bride isn't quite dead; She languishes in a coma for four years before coming to, and when she wakes up, she's got bloody deeds on her mind- A literal Death List, comprised of Bill and his DiVAS.<P> Kill Bill, Volume 1 chronicles the start of The Bride's vengeance, as she faces off against Viper-turned-housewife Vernita Green (Viveca A. Fox) and Yakuza head-honcho O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), leaving Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Bill (David Carradine, whose face is never actually shown) for Volume 2, due February 20th 2004. The film is almost literally awash in blood- People in the audience I saw the film with were covering their faces, like the blood might get on them or something. It's been a long time since I've seen such a violent film, and I certainly can't recall any mainstream films that contained such carnage. (Still, it seems the MPAA made their mark on the film- There's a long black-and-white sequence during the House of Blue Leaves segment, which sees The Bride face off against an army of Yakuza thugs in a huge sword fight; I suspect it was made black-and-white to avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating. It was a little annoying, and I hope that scene is presented in color for the DVD release.) Fans expecting Tarantino's usual snappy dialogue will probably be a little disappointed- Kill Bill is almost a silent movie; There is literally almost nothing but fighting and killing for two hours. I'm not much of a fan of Viveca A. Fox and Lucy Liu, but they did a good job in their respective fight scenes, and Thurman is a revelation as The Bride- Sexy, funny, and deadly all at once. I especially enjoyed Chiaki Kuriyama as O-Ren Ishii's bodyguard, the giggly, schoolgirl-uniformed, Go-Go Yubari. Her fight with The Bride is a definite highlight of Volume 1. Fans of seventies grind-house cinema will get a big kick out of seeing Sonny Chiba's appearance as sword-maker Hattori Hanzo, who fashions The Bride's weapon of choice.<P> It's a good thing Tarantino decided to split Kill Bill into two seperate films- After two hours, I was drained and burnt-out. I don't think I'd have been able to take any more in one sitting. But the shocking final line of dialogue, spoken by Bill himself, has me counting the days until Volume 2.</span>

                    <span>The guy is very creative in displaying a story in a very original structure and media. Kill Bill is a cult movie fan's greatest dream come true. Everything is in there from good old Western Coybow movies to the cinema of the east slapped together. For the sterotypical "white" person who only consumes the blockbuster hits of what ever popoular trend is out, this movie may appear silly or confusing to a degree of laughter. Thats the beauty of this movie, it shows us which movie watchers are out there. In the theaters I caught a lot of white people laughing at the asian sequences of the film and they were also dumbfounded by the special appearances of the actors from Wild Zero, Ichi the Killer, Battle Royale, and Suicide Circle to name a few. (i was hoping to see Tekashi Kitano) The only special appearnce of a star they would know is "David carra..whats his name...? the guys from that Kung-Fu show...yeah." A lot of people failed to see the element of honor that was displayed in both films between characters which was a very beautiful element. The action sequences were directed very well so that it made up for a lot of the actor martial arts flaws such as akward positions and hyper extended punches, so there are little moments killed. <P>One sad thing though is that Kill Bill Vol.2 had a trailer for the 2002 film HERO, which is now going to hit theaters here that did it injustes. They stated that the movie was presented by Quentin Tarantino, but I've overheard many reactions of people thinking that it is directed by Quentin Tarantino rather than the truth (Zhang Yimou). Plus the trailer gave the art film a false representation of an epic war film, many may be disapointed. So are movies like Kill Bill building bridges with Hollywood and Asia or are they just going to jokingly stereotype Asian films and cuture in an unfair way? Fans and crowds shall tell in time. <P>Oh and by the way, I don't want to sound like "white" people are not cool, I use the term "white" for the typical stereotyping day by day american. As far as stereotypes go, sometimes people enjoy becoming part of it and making it obviously true. I look forward to one day the stereotypes are non existant and everyhting in around our lives is understood for what it is and not what it looks like on the surface.</span>

                    <span>Great movie I have to say, paying respect to crazy asian cinema. My only gripe is Uma Therman being in the movie. I would have like to see Quinten dig up and unknown actor or maybe some B movie or expoitation actress. And although I like Lucy Lu I can think of a hundred different asian actresses that would have fit the role better. ANyway, great movie! If you like this movie check out any movie by Takashi Miike like: Iche the Killer, Dead or Alive, Dead or Alive 2, Dead or Alive Final, Audition, Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl.... any one of these movies makes KILL BILL look like a Walt Disney film!!</span>
