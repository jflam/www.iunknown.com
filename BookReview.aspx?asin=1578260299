                <span id="Label1">Known as the PJ's and the CCT's, the pararescuemen and combat control technicians are the elite forces of the United States Air Force. PJ's, whose motto is "that others may live", routinely go in harm's way to bring back downed pilots and crewmembers. CCT's, "first to fight", are responsible to enter hostile territory ahead of the rest and establish safe landing sites for arriving forces. Their self-sacrificing efforts are heroic. Their training is intense, exciting, and before this book, little known. Now for the very first time, their powerful training techniques are brought to light in this profusely illustrated and documented presentation. You've heard of the SEALs. . . . now meet their blood brothers! Includes sections on: stretching, weight training, calisthenics, running, swimming, rope climbing, entrance requirements, plus special dramatic coverage of water survival training, from both above and below the water line!</span>

                    <span>I'm confused by the other reviews. One complains that the book doesn't give the numbers of sets & reps to do. Sure it does, starting on pp. 176 -- both repetition sets and timed sets, week by week as actually done in the Indoc course.<P>Another reviewer complains that the review only gives the basic guidelines that the Air Force sends you when you apply to the school. Well, no, the book gives you that (identical to the Navy's BUD/S Warning Order for SEAL candidates, BTW) *and* it gives you not only the PT sets & reps for the course week-by-week, but also the weight training circuit (pretty easy to follow with equipment in a normal gym, though you may have to do some substitutions for different machines). It also has a calendar showing the running times and types (intervals, etc.) and swimming distances used for each day of the 9 weeks.<P>What could prepare you better for a course than actually doing the workouts that you'll do in the course?</span>

                    <span>During my first year of AFROTC, we worked out to the above mentioned 12 Weeks to BUDS. That was grueling in and of itself. I purchased this book to prepare for field training, and so far it's pretty decent. People have complained "where's the workout" - it says in the book that they compiled the information so you can mix and match a workout that is good for you. And you don't have to be a physical trainer to do this - the sets are there, the combinations of exercises are there - you simply have to do them. Finish this workout COMPLETELY and I guarentee the book will live up to what it says "you will be in the best shape of your life." Oh, and don't forget the running...</span>

                    <span>While I have respect for the Air Force SOF community, I found this book to be poor overall. Specifically, it includes heavy use of machines for strength training. How any "elite" unit could utilize weight training machines such as Nautilus or Cybex is beyond me. Machines have little use in a serious strength program and are far inferior to free weights or even calisthenics. Machines remove the critical neurological components of strength such as balance and proprioception. I would have liked to have seen a book totally without machines and just focused on running, swimming, stretching, obstacle courses and calisthenics. <P>If Air Force SOF units formally utilize machines for their strength training, it makes me lose respect for them. They need to go back to basics.</span>

                    <span>Already A paratrooper in the USArmy I have met many PJs and CCTs. Following my desire to be one (a PJ) I purchased the book and have followed the work out for about 7 weeks so far and the results are more than satisfying. <P>It is a very simple no nonsense book with deatail of the running and swimming in the PJ/CCT Indoc course. What I really appreciated was the detailed break down of the work out with weights and aerobic strength training. what the book lacks in glitz and glamour it certainly makes up for in content.</span>

And it full-filled my needs and exceeded my expectations. I am now on my second week of training with their workout plan and I am loving it and experiencing the change.
