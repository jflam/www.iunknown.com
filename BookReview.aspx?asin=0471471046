Gaynor<BR>    Former CFO, SVP-HR, CIO, and Reengineering Leader<BR>    The Seagram Spirits and Wine Group    <P>"Mark Lutchen offers up some important guidance to the CIO on how to bring IT into the mainstream of the business and how the CIO can make the transition from tech guru and administrator to a full member of the executive team."<BR>     &#150;Marinus N.

He recognizes that IT costs are a major line item in any corporate budget and that these costs must be viewed as a means to building a business rather than an end. He knows that this happens when CEOs and CIOs communicate effectively.

                    <span>"Managing IT as a Business" is an interesting read. I think a lot of the concepts can be applied to marketing, HR and finance organizations as well. That being the case, this book is indeed a "survival guide", relevant for all the enabling business units that report into the CEO/COO.</span>

                    <span>In the fall of 2003, the Harvard Business Review published an article advancing the proposition that "IT doesn't matter." The article's author suggested that because IT was now a commodity, and everyone had it, it no longer conveyed any distinctive competitive advantage and therefore, strategically, did not matter. In fact, at many companies, IT doesn't matter as much as it should - not because it is a commodity that other companies also use, but because most companies don't get every potential benefit from their IT. To advance your business agenda effectively, make IT a real part of the business. Author Mark D. Lutchen shows managers, particularly CEOs and CIOs, why IT is not fully a part of business at the moment, and what it will take to turn IT into a competitive, strategic asset. We recommend this useful, well-written, clearly organized book to anyone whose job involves decisions on IT budgets, organization, investments or strategy.</span>

                    <span>This is a fabulous book for experienced or aspiring IT managers whose goal is to prepare for ascension through the ranks, especially to the CIO level. In simple yet rich language, Mark presents a clear picture of the future of the IT organization and the competencies needed in the CIO and senior team heading up this professional services operation. The examples and case studies are rich with insights. In short, this book is pragmatic and weighty, yet also highly readable and I dare say outright enjoyable. I highly recommend it as a must read for anyone who wants to develop an effective IT career roadmap. Thank you Mark Lutchen.<P>Joe Santana,<BR>Co-author Manage IT</span>

                    <span>Managing IT as a Business provides a readable, pragmatic approach to the challenges of the IT 'black box'. Too often these books attempt to 'dumb down' the reader with bromides directing managers to 'just do this' or 'that' to bring about success. Mark successfully brings the pieces of the process together (using actual cases for added focus). He provides direction to show Managers how to get maximum overall value for the IT dollars invested. An IT 'Tour De force' and a must read!</span>
