                    <span>The Milepost provides the Alaska and Yukon bound drivers with all of the support (lodging, gas stations, dining, vehicle repairs, medical, etc.) and sight-seeing information needed to have a safe, comfortable and informative journey. It details this information on mile-by-mile basis which allows the traveler to know the joys and potential hazards of the trip. It also provides this same detail for all of the major roads that lead to and from the Alaska Highway - within NW Canada and throughout Alaska. Also a necessary reference for the traveler who flys to Alaska and rents a car in Anchorage or Fairbanks. It also provides history and trivia of many of the little towns in the Alaska Wilderness. Alaska adventurers should also consider getting the book, Discovering Denali if they are going to explore Denali National Park.</span>

                    <span>There are lots of miles of roads in AK, and driving them can be a bit boring. Unless you have the milepost to guide you. There are interesting things happening all along the roadside, and a long road trip will whiz by when you are aware of what you are seeing, or can anticipate what is coming up around the bend.<P>Well worth the investment.</span>

                    <span>I found the Milepost to be better than having no reference material at all (the maps are the most useful feature). Its best use is in finding RV parks and gas stations but the method of reporting services available at the RV parks is somewhat hit or miss and is not always accurate or reported in any sort of consistent format -- except on the keycodes on the maps. One key piece of information that is only grudgingly made available are the months that the parks are actually open for customers.</span>

                    <span>While not TERRIBLE, this book is fairly useless. Certainly it is not worth its asking price. <P>I was convinced to buy it by a friend who had used it to get around Alaska 25 years ago. But after a month of traveling around the state, I ended up feeling ripped off. In my travels around Alaska, I found numerous free vacation planners or free travel guides as good or better than this turkey. <P>The book has numerous problems. In most cases, historical or cultural information is missing completely, or described in the most perfunctory way. And even when there's actually something of interest, thousands of disguised advertisements for paying businesses clutter the text, making it hard to find.<P>The book is more or less a business directory, and its community descriptions seem taken straight from census data. <P>25 years ago, it MAY have a good resource (though I'm not even convinced of that.) But it seems to have become obsolete. If you really want the information it's peddling, wait till you get to Alaska to pick up a free guide, or hit the internet.</span>
