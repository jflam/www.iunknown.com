                <span id="Label1">"[A] mammoth epic of the islands, [a] vast panorama, wonderful."<br>THE BALTIMORE SUN<br>America's preeminent storyteller, James Michener, introduced an entire generation of readers to a lush, exotic world in the Pacific with this classic novel. But it is also a novel about people, people of strength and character; the Polynesians; the fragile missionaries; the Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos who intermarried into a beautiful race called Hawaiians. Here is the story of their relationships, toils, and successes, their strong aristocratic kings and queens and struggling farmers, all of it enchanting and very real in this almost mythical place.<br></span>

                    <span>Michener, the supreme storyteller, created some really memorable characters in this monster of a novel. The genre of blockbuster historical novels can seem somewhat dated (viz. the mammoth novels of Mitchell, Ferber, McCullough, Caldwell and Follett) but they are definitely delicious if you get a taste for them. Dated or not, Hawaii is a gripping tale of not-so-angelic missionaries, struggling immigrants and early Polynesian settlers. The characters are absolutely unforgettable.<P>I particularly liked the section of the book where the missionaries run headlong into the traditions of the Polynesian people, whether insisting they wear confining clothing in the tropical heat, or that they should quit their charming and practical tradition of dancing, swimming and surfing in the buff. The missionaries stubbornly eat dried apples shipped to them across the sea, and scorn the richly nutritious native fruits and vegetables unfamiliar to them. They wilt in their long underwear, donned by the season. They try hard to bring a foreign world to their religion in the belief it will benefit the people, but when two vastly different cultures clash, it is inevitably tragic. Michener writes about this clash in vivid, sometimes shocking detail.<P>This book has been filmed, used as a basis for a musical but nothing compares to reading the original. I couldn't put it down.</span>

                    <span>You can't look at this like it's one book. It's a journey through time, and with each quantum leap a new tale begins. James Michener does an awesome job -- if you saw the movie -- it's only a small fraction of the novel. Once you get past the initial geology lesson, you can't put it down. It's interesting how -- though written in the 1950s -- Michener is sensitive the the racial cocktail that makes Hawai'i special: such as when white missionaries spurn the services of a Hawaiian mid-wife (with tragic results), or the amazing feats of bravery performed by Hawaiian-Nisei soldiers on the battlefields of Italy. <P>If you're traveling to Hawaii -- you must read this book. It will give you a better appreciation for that wonderful place and it's wonderful people. Just start it early, because the plane ride isn't long enough to read it all.</span>

                    <span>I first tackled "Hawaii" as a young boy, partly for the<BR>adventure, partly for the violence, and partly for the<BR>naughty parts, probably what attracts boys to read lots of<BR>books. It taught me a lot about the history of the Pacific,<BR>despite being historical FICTION, as my parents often reminded<BR>me. True, but excellently written historical fiction. Mr.<BR>Michener can write historical fiction like no one else, once<BR>one gets used to his style.</span>

                    <span>I wish I could give more stars. This is the greatest book ever written! It fairly and accurately tells the story of Hawai'i. You can learn so much about the people, history, and religion of these wonderful islands. It isn't portrayed as a sunny vacation spot for rich americans, it's shown in it's true beautiful form. I am very thankful thank Mr. Michener wrote this wonderful novel!</span>

                    <span>Early in the book, Michener tells a story of how man first arrived on Hawaii. The story is incredibly exciting and dramatic. What makes it so interesting is that his story couldn't possibly be too far from the truth. <P>Hawaii is so distant from any other island. How could anyone have found it except by sheer luck? It's just fascinating to think about the extraordinary circumstances that must have arisen to compel a sufficiently large group of primitive people to leave their home and venture far out to sea.<P>I first read this book about 16 years ago when I was a freshman in college. I stayed up all night reading it right in the middle of finals week, but I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have read most of Michener's books but still rate Hawaii as his best.<P>It is always interesting to follow Michener's overlapping generations of characters. As the protagonists age, we gradually get to know their offspring. Each generation is a wild card. Some children further the good intentions and fortunes of their parents and others set the whole community back generations. The smooth transition between generations is the main reason it is so hard to stop reading.<P>In classic Michener style, he frequently changes perspectives (native Hawaiian, American missionaries, Chinese, Japanese) and the reader can't help but feel compassion and understanding for each side of a conflict. Not that Michener is afraid to cast blame. Because he portrays each side so honestly, his political message has more credibility and is even more effective.</span>
