                    <span>This is a great book. Vine Deloria is an interesting author and he brings across good ideas. <BR>As for the few people who believe that they hold no responsibility because their ancestors imigrated after 1900, well that's not true. Everyone hold responsibility, because Native Americans are still being mistreated. As late as the last half of century Native women were being sterilized without being told what was happening. <BR>Our bones and cultural are being dishonored by "scholars" And all those people who want to help Natives. They treat them like little children. If that's not disrespect...<BR>Deloria brings out what so many want to keep hidden. <BR>All of his books are worth reading.</span>

                    <span>So that there's no misunderstanding, I think Vine Deloria Jr is a great man. Not a perfect man, not one who's right all of the time, but a man who means well, and has done great things for Native Americans. My feelings about Custer Died for Your Sins are similar. It's a good book, this Indian Manifesto, and has the power to do great things, still, decades after its publication. But it's not perfect. If you're a Caucasian reader, you're going to get angry. Parts of the book simply aren't meant for you, and those parts that are, are very inflammatory. This is intentional. Deloria is a master of making people furious, in order to make them think. But it's also intentional, I think, because Deloria is, understandably, himself a bitter and angry man, in many ways. The book's passages on people of mixed descent are good examples. Deloria issues the blanket statement that Native/Caucasian people are, in fact, just White people with a royalty complex. He does this to make you angry, and he does this to make you think; he wants you to understand what you are doing when you claim tribal descent or affiliation, and he wants you to be sure you're doing so with the proper respect. But he's also doing it because he's annoyed, and very tired of White people who don't have said respect. He's making a mistake, though, in his implicit assumption that, somehow, being Caucasian is the default, and that to be a Native, one really should be a wholeblood. The book is also tinged with seeming contradictions (like one chapter devoted to the idea that Indians must solve their own problems because they are and should be responsible for their own lives; and then the chapter on how anthropologists are largely responsible for the problems of the modern Native American, a chapter where tribes play a largely passive role), but most of these are resolved when you consider both the complexity of the issue, and the complexity of the book. All in all, this Manifesto is *not* the place to begin one's exploration of Native issues, but it's one that *must* be read somewhere along the way.</span>

                    <span>This is an all around good read. While there are problems that I had with the book the fact remains that I enjoyed it greatly as well. When I first read I said to myself "Hey this is great finally a Native American's perspective. Than I looked at the orginal publication date...1969. <P>Thats my only problem while it is witty and funny the issues discussed are at time too far in the past for me to understand. All I have to go upon are my own preconcived notions taught to mein history class. Mr. Deloria on the other hand was right there when all of this stuff was happening and for that reason this bok deserves some serious study. <P>He basically has three main points <BR>1. That the programs set up by Whites to help Native Amerixcans have actually hurt them in the llong run(be sure to read his rant agienst Anthropologists and missionaries)<BR>2. There are still Native Americans east of the Mississippi(Some readers will not be aware of this even today)<BR>3. The Native Americans have power but they are kinda like the Democratic Party they just can't organize(htis hasn't changed much even today) <P>Overall-I loved it, its a good book to see where Native Americans were in the 60s and how things have changed(or not changed) in the lat 34 years.</span>

                    <span>This book is, despite the hype and recommendations of academics, very poorly argued. He writes well, but is very inconsistent and many of his comments about whites, Christianity and The Church are nothing short of bigotry. Too many people confuse Deloria's quips and sarchasm with intellectualism. He is far from being an intelectual.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>What impressed me most about this book was its emphasis that imperialistic exploitation is not a dead relic of a past we Anglos are ashamed of and wish to forget. The fun continues, and it makes little difference what we call it: manifest destiny, bringing civilization to the primitives, or new world order.<P>Another point: we've been long overdue for a Deloria-style criticism of Anglos who exploit Indian folklore and beliefs. I refer to those who claim esoteric knowledge from Native shamans and all the rest of it. What such folks, including the anthropologists and social scientists who pretend more objectivity, never ask themselves is: do I have any right to make a profit and gain a reputation from the people I claim to have learned from? What do they get out of it? Does it benefit them or harm them? (The claim that Indian people don't need any kind of concrete benefits because they aren't "materialistic" is particularly nauseating.)<P>At one point, while contemplating doing some interviews with local Indians about their experience of being blinkered, baffled, and b.s.ed for 250 years, I reread parts of this book--particularly the "we want to be left alone" parts--and decided that I lacked the temerity even to ask for such interviews. Deloria suggests that no research of any kind be done that isn't approved in council and that doesn't clearly demonstrate some use to the Indians themselves. I would also suggest to other Anglo readers that before they involve themselves in matters indigenous they be very honest about their motivations--particularly where any notions of being "helpful" might occur. Our "helpfulness" has been genocidal and even now perpetrates stereotypes, as Indians may tell you if you're genuinely receptive to the feedback.<P>Books like this are a good reminder that the true primitive is he who goes on colonizing others--intellectually, religiously, economically--without having the courage to look at his own dark side as it flourishes in the here and now.</span>
