                    <span>First of all, the book assumes you have passed the SCJP v1 certification, where AWT was a major topic and threads weren't. If you have taken the second version, you will know more about threads than what this book tells you. However, that is a problem that can be ignored if you know it.
<br />
<br />A bigger problem is that there are so many typos in the code examples. Ofthen they will not even compile, comments are misleading, and text describing them is insufficient or wrong. 
<br />
<br />Also, when they are discussing something that I already know (like threads), I can see that the explanations are bad. They are not necessarily wrong, they just lack the necessary context for the reader to understand what is being said. Without that context, what is said is actually wrong at times.
<br />
<br />After two chapters, I gave up adding corrections when I saw an error. After three, I stopped saying "No!" when I found something that was actually wrong. 
<br />
<br />I have stopped reading after the RMI section, because I found the Sun description to be better. Maybe the remaining chapters can redeem the book, but I doubt it. 
<br />
<br />I think it could be a good book, but it needs thorough review, and it should have been done before publication. The quality simply isn't good enough to warrent the price.

                    <span>I bought and read the book for SCJD. However, after I got the assignment from SUN, I found I can't pass SCJD only by using this book because this book just gave me a rough idea and rough sample code about what is SCJD. To successfully pass SCJD, I recommand you go to javaranch.com with this book.</span>

                    <span>Where is the Zero star option when you need it?!? I bought this book because I read reviews and some recommendations from people here. I think that it's a terrible book. Let me explain: the examples given and metaphors are just plain horrible, and it gets more confusing trying to follow what the author had in mind than learning from Sun online docs. It's full of typos and mistakes. Spelling checker anyone? The explainations of NIO are not requested by the exam so another useless topic in the book that I suspect was added to populate the volume and justify a higher price. The topic on lock on records which is very important and appears in every exam given by Sun is not described in much details neither. The index at the end is just useless (so many words are missing.) Most chapters are not related to the exam (why is there a thread chapter in there since you are supposed to have learned that from the K&B book for the Prog exam already?) I found so much more info in the archives of the JavaRanch forum and for free, that I would advice everyone to do the same and browse this wonderful Web site instead of wasting trees and your money on that book as I unfortunatly did.</span>

                    <span>The primary reason I cannot recommend this book is that it fails to properly address the point of its existence. For example:<p>  o   The authors devote a chapter to threading, even though the the prerequisite SCJP exam covers this topic.<p>  o   The authors devote a chapter to NIO (New I/O), even though Sun explicitly prohibits the use of NIO on the exam.<p>  o   The authors presume that the SCJD student knows Swing, even though Swing was removed from the prerequisite SCJP exam.<p>You can verify these points at Sun's training website:<br>http://training.sun.com/CA/catalogue/courses/CA-CX-310-252A.html<p>Finally, the book is full of typographical and other errors.</span>

                    <span>I am preparing for SCJD & believe me it is one of the best book on market. Javaranch.com is another great resource apart from book. Buy it if you are doing SCJD. You won't find many good books on SCJD apart from above one.<p>BTW: I have SCJP, SCWCD & SCBCD certification to make a point.</span>
