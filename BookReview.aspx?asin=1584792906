                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for those seeking to utilize stone decoratively and functionally around their homes!  It is beautifully illustrated, well written, and thorough.  I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in taking advantage of the beauty of stonework in their residence!

                    <span>I was quite surprised at all the material this books covers. Anyone planning a custom designed home or remodel could certainly find great inspiration and clever ideas not usually seen in homes in the USA. Additionally, the in-depth info on various natural stone products is a real education.  The last part of STONE has a helpful photo index of illustrations of the various types of stone. Since many ceramic tile products attempt to emulate natural stone, this book and especially it's fine examples of mosaics would be quite inspirational for those who work with manmade tiles as well as natural stone. I find the elegant pared down interiors in this book quite refreshing, a breath of fresh air. As a fan of classic, enduring architecture, I am pleased that this book promotes the idea of a home as a structure expected to last centuries--an unusual concept in the States.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I am in the middle of building a new home and am using quite a bit of stone. Let me tell you, it is quite nice to walk into the tile showroom and know more about the material than the people selling it to me. "STONE" covers it all...everything you need to know and more. I am actually reproducing one of the bathrooms featured in the book in my own home. There are hundreds of beautiful photographs that not only give you ideas for using natural stone, but also for the home's architecture and interior design. It is truly several books rolled into one. Anyone planning to build or remodel a home with stone countertops, floors, showers, walls, venthoods, backsplashes, fireplaces, etc...etc...etc... should get this book. Avid do-it-yourselfer's will find the step by step stone installation section invaluble.</span>
