                <span id="Label1">This fourth edition covers the basics of marine biology with a global approach using examples from numerous regions and ecosystems worldwide. This introductory, one-semester text is designed for non-majors. Authors Castro and Huber have made a special effort to include solid basic science content needed in a general education course, including the fundamental principles of biology, the physical sciences, and the scientific method. This science coverage is integrated with a stimulating, up-to-date overview of marine biology.</span>

                    <span>I have begun to use the third edition of this book in my introductory marine science course. I have to say that the Castro and Huber have taken a professional, effective approach to covering a diverse subject. The book takes a typical approach. Part 1: The nature of science and the physical environment. Part 2: Life in the marine environment, starting with physiology and moving on to diversity. Part 3: Ecology, covering basic principles and exploring various arine habitats. Part 4: Man's impact on the sea. Things that I like about this book include: the excellent illustrations, both photographs and diagrams; box readings on special topics; and the chapter self reviews. Things that I do not like include the failure to put the various groups of animals in evolutionary relationships. There are two chapters on marine organisms, vertebrates and invertebrate. This arrangement fails to recognize the over all diversity of these groups and frequently unrelated groups are piled together for no reason but convenience. I think perhaps a simple appendix of cladograms of the various groups would address this. There is also a companion web site that I have not had the time to explore.<P>In all, it is an effective introduction to marine biology. I am enjoying incorporating it in to my class. I also think that it would be a fine choice for persons who want to study marine biology on there own. It is written at such a level that a person with a high school education can understand it with only a few references to the glossary or other books.</span>

                    <span>I am a high school student and this is a college course, and the only reason I am bought this book was because my school can't afford to supply the students with it. This book is great and is going to almost guarantee me a passing grade in my Marine Biology class. Although this is just an introduction book it is full of information and it is and interesting subject to study. Coming from a student I recommend this book to any Marine Biology teacher. This subject is overall fun and even if you are expecting to be something non-related to this subject when you choose your career this is still very educational.</span>
