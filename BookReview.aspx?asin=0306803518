                    <span>This book is an exceptional work, and I must first point out that while it is crammed full of factual information, intimate conversations, the overall scheming and intra-party politics in the formation of the SS and the constant power struggles, this book is by no means a dry, statistical type of read, only suitable for the determined historian. It is not always easy to keep track of the major (and minor) personalities and their constant intrigue and subterfuge at all levels, but the author does a masterful job of balancing the, at times, overwhelming amount of information with a very personal and intimate flair keeps the reader awake and engaged in the story as it develops.<P>Mark Werger, an author of many books on the SS, recently stated this was easily in the top 10 of best books he had read, and I can see why. When you finish this book you will have a much more throrough understanding of the SS thanks to the painstaking and meticulous research performed by Gerald Reitlinger. It is so informative you will probably never part with it if you are truly interested in the subject.</span>

                    <span>As the title suggests, Reitlinger follows for the reader the inception and budding organization of the SS and other police or civil branches within an increasingly-menacing police state in Germany. The reader must read carefully through the first fifth of the book to avoid confusing names and relationships, but ultimately the actors are well defined. Every conversation or statement from the main characters is routinely cited from firsthand accounts. The book includes an extensive bibliography and a biography of dozens of characters in the upper echelons of the Nazi military, SS and civil bureaucracy. Reitlinger weaves a remarkable tapestry of places, names and events until we have a better understanding of the inner workings of the Nazi government, their secret orders of exterminating Jews and Slavs and other "sub-human" races, the often public denials of the concentration camps by members of the highest rank, the contests for power under Hitler, and the seductions and betrayals between officers and agents(like a nest of vipers) at the heart of the German Reich. An important scholarly addition to any WWII library, this book details the most insidious plots and conversations among history's most brutal mass murderers, the corruption of their officers, and the incredible processes of armies within armies, states within the state, and secret intelligence forces within the police and other ministries.<P>Well-written, consise, and highly credible.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a very accurate description of the facts, the tactics and the people who ruled the destinies of the Third Reich. The story of the SS is in fact the story of Nationalsocialism. The author displays a wide and precise knowledge of the events, and offers a complete vision of it, both global and detailed. The analysis spreads from the NSDAP takeover, the rise and fall of the Sturmabteilung (SA),the development of the Schutztaffeln (SS) and the Intelligence Services before the war, to the II World War, the role of Waffen SS (Armed SS) and the finally apocalypse which came over Germany, all through the period 1922-1945. It's really worth while, for instance, the acute descriptions of the RSHA (Reichsicherheitshauptamt-Reich Main Security Office), the SD (Sicherheitsdienst-Security Service) as well as its transformations through the war, the role they played with the SA in overthrowing constitutional legality of the Weimar Republic. In this book you can also realize who is who in Nazi Germany, the account of all the dramatis personae such as Himmler, Heydrich, Kaltenbrunner, Muller, Schellenberg, Ohlendorf,..., as well as the Waffen SS generals, their rank and position in the widest and most complex totalitarian organization ever created, except perhaps the KGB. To draw a conclussion, a wonderful exposition of what the SS was in its origins and what it became: a Staat in Staat, a State inside a State. Definitely, a non replaceable book.</span>

                    <span>It's been over thirty years since Gerald Reitlinger's 'The SS. Alibi of a nation, 1922-45' was published and yet it still remains one of the most informative and important books on the subject of Nazi Germany and the SS. In 1945-6 the Nuremburg court ruled that the SS was a criminal organization and membership itself was a crime. Reitlinger argues that this was a mistake- in criminalizing this one organization, the court all but absolved the other bureacratic agencies that contributed no less assiduously to the 'Final Solution,' and provided a nation that willingly followed Hitler with the ultimate scapegoat. Throughout the book the reader is introduced to lesser known, though no less responsible, members of Hitler's Reich- Martin Luther, Walter Schellenberg, and Gottlieb Berger are just some of the every-day bureacrats that allowed such terror to reign supreme in Germany for twelve years. Truly a great work of history.</span>
