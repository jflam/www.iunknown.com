                    <span>When I first found out about this book I thought it had a snowball's change in hell of being even a half decent book (being a pretty ambitious topic).  I've changed my mind after actually reading the book, and found it to be an excellent introduction to writing a FPS game engine.  Granted, it's not DOOM3 but the end result is a simple, complete working engine; which is quite an achievement in my opinion.
<br />
<br />One caveat though, even though the book is fairly simple and not exactly taxing (a tribute to the author) it is certainly not a beginners book.  You should already be fairly comfortable with C++ and DirectX 9 to get the most out of it and be prepared to study the source and MSDN documentation (a good habit to get into anyway).
<br />
<br />The book covers most of the major parts of a FPS engine at a reasonable level, resulting in a well designed, modular engine that can be expanded on quite easily.  The main value of the book, however, is the design of the engine which should help a lot in developing your own engine (since most books cover the therory in exhausting detail but ignore the overall engine design - if you're looking for detail, this may not be the book for you).
<br />
<br />After reading this book, the following books may be useful:
<br />
<br />1. Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0 (excellent intro to DX9).
<br />
<br />2. 3D Game Engine Architecture : Engineering Real-Time Applications with Wild Magic (nice and detailed - I recommend all David Eberly's books).
<br />
<br />3. Real-Time Rendering (doesn't get better than this). 
<br />
<br />4. Game Programming Gems (buy all of them, now).

                    <span>I would recomend this book to anyone wanting to create a fps. This book has helped me put my ideas together and point me in the right direction for creating my own engine and game. This book is definatly worth every penny.</span>

                    <span>I'm about half way through the book now and the code that comes with the book is top notch. I even heard the author saying he went through all of the code removing the error checking before releasing as to make it easier to read. Its well maintained, simple and clever. The code is also definitly encapsulated well so you can bring it to other projects easily if you'd like with little dependencies. <p>Warning to those who are intermediate directx users - the first 2-7 are mostly directx basics and you will most likely skip this to get to the meat. <p>Although there's nothing incredibly complicated in this book, I think it gave me a healthy dose of not over estimating myself. The author only spends time on the what is required to complete the project and reuses his code a lot (i think the initial linked list was reused about 100 times in total) So if you ever find yourself making projects that always fail half way through - this is a good book for you.</span>
