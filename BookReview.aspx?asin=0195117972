                <span id="Label1">Part of the multivolume Oxford History of the United States, <i>Grand Expectations</i> spotlights the United States at the center of the international stage during the post World War II years. The book opens on country very different from the U.S. of today--racial segregation was law and more than half the nation's farm dwellings had no electricity. With England, Germany, and Japan ravaged by war, the U.S. entered a period of prosperity that soared to unimaginable heights in the 1960s. Though Patterson ends his book with the downfall of Nixon and the beginnings of a troubled economy, he concludes that the U.S. in 1974, "remained one of the most stable societies in the world."</span>

                    <span>Patchy yet ultimately worthwhile overview of post war United States history to 1974. As part of the Oxford History of the United States though it lacks the literary finesse of some of the other volumes in the series, namely James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom and David Kennedy's Freedom From Fear, which dealt with the preceding period 1929 to 1945.
<br />
<br />Unlike Kennedy's brilliant work, which had a more flowing, cohesive narrative, this book is more a collection of self-contained essays, most of which could be read in isolation. Nevertheless it makes a creditable stab at interpreting a turbulent period of rapid change in US and world history and placing it in some sort of proper context, always a difficult skill for an historian writing about still relatively recent events. The book is scrupulously balanced and fair-minded. It at most has a slightly liberal slant, yet is conspicuous in examining most events from opposing standpoints. The Eisenhower administration for example is praised for ensuring international stability when the cold war could easily have turned hot. Yet domestically, Eisenhower's innate conservatism drove his reluctance to "rock the boat" and address nascent problems of race and class issues in a period of sustained economic growth, thus ensuring such issues would become critical in succeeding decades.
<br />
<br />The Grand Expectations of the title is Patterson's dominant theme. In international and world affairs they refer to the United States' post-war sense of destiny in maintaining the peace and security of the world and of stemming the perceived Communist conspiracy of world wide domination, which was allied to a can-do attitude that led political leaders and the populace to believe anything was achievable. These expectations became eroded and undermined in the morass of Vietnam. Likewise, domestically the US experienced unprecedented economic growth from the late forties onwards, growth which brought with it increased expectancy across racial, class and gender lines for social and economic equality. Such expectations lay at the heart of the upheavals of the sixties and the growth of the civil rights movement.
<br />
<br />Faced with such a contentious period of history, Patterson's book deserves much credit in taking such a middle of the road stance as it does. The result is a work which is more a synergy and synopsis of existing research on the period. I don't think much primary research was undertaken. There is a heavy reliance on statistics in some chapters, while some of the earlier portions of the book are written and edited in a surprisingly sloppily manner. The book indeed takes about 200 pages to get into its stride. When it does, particularly in dealing with the Johnson and Nixon years and the civil rights movement, it doesn't fail to impress. Overall I'd recommend it, but only just.

                    <span>I had to read this book for my economics class.  I had to choose it, it was actually one of the most informal books I've ever read. I don't read much, but this encouraged me to read more.  Patterson explained it well. I say it explained most of all America's downfalls. Everything that went wrong with our poor decision making. What I thought was very eye catching is in trhe end he make a positive statement.  I'm not saying everything was negative in the book, not at all, but it makes you think.  I will have to read more of Oxford History Volumes.</span>

                    <span>James Patterson has assembled the most comprehensive survey of contemporary American history.  With the Cold War as the backdrop, he guides the reader through a tumultuous period that took in two wars and the Civil Rights movement.  He amply describes the nature of these conflicts and the impact they had on American society.  The leading figures are brought into focus, as well as the crucial events of the periods such as the Cuban Missile Crisis.  He weaves in a wide variety of cultural issues such as religion, noting how it has influenced successive administrations.  He ends the period with the downfall of Nixon, who appears throughout the book from his involvement in the House anti-American investigations, to his vice-presidency under Eisenhower to his subsequent presidency.  It is a well-rounded account and a wonderful addition to the Oxford History of the United States.<p>What was most interesting to me was the powerful influence religion had on our society and the conflicts that arose during the Civil Rights movement and the Age of Aquarius.  Patterson noted that Americans remained the most devoted church-goers throughout the troublesome 60's.  The church became the rallying point of the Civil Rights movement, and also served as the bastion of white supremacy.  Such contradictions made for volatile conflicts as each side felt it had the moral upper hand. The seemingly all-pervasive drug culture may have captured the public's imagination, but by and large America remained a nation of social conservatives.<p>Patterson provides good overviews of the Korean and Vietnam wars, tying them into the ideology of the Cold War.  He shows the seamless pattern that ran through these conflicts, as well as other conflicts in which the US found itself embroiled in during its effort to defeat communism. The costly battles left millions of Asians dead and no clear victories, tarnishing the reputation we had achieved after WWII as the champion of democracy.  He illustrates how each president from Truman to Nixon tried to avoid these conflicts, but somehow could never shake the "Losing China syndrome."  <p>It is a well-documented book covering a tremendous amount of ground.  Patterson steers clear of polemics, opting for a well-balanced assessment of the era.  Naturally when one takes on such a broad subject, certain discrepencies do arise, but there are no glaring errors, and the book has a narrative grace that leads the reader effortlessly through the tumultuous events.</span>

                    <span>I read Patterson's book in order to improve my general understanding of the period (1945 - 1974) that he describes.  Even though I had lived through those years, I realized that my knowledge and understanding of what happened then were somewhat cursory at best.  I finished the book somewhat disapppointed.   For one thing,  even though my knowledge of the era was limited, I easily noticed a number of  surprising errors.<p>     In one egregious example, Patterson devotes a page (p. 276) to describe how `On March 1, 1954, the United States tested the world's first hydrogen bomb..'.  He goes on to tell us how fallout from this test sickened crewmen on a Japanese fishing boat, and led to a public outcry.  However, as he could have learned from an ordinary World Almanac, the United States tested the first hydrogen bomb in 1952, not 1954.  The test he describes is actually the notorious Castle Bravo test, which did in fact occur on March 1, 1954.  (The use of lithium deuteride fuel in this test led to an unpredicted secondary reaction, which in turn led the bomb to yield 15 megatons rather than the expected 6, thus endangering the Japanese fishermen, etc.)  <p>     At another point (p. 669) he preposterously tells us that the phrase `acid test' dates from the mid 1960's and stems from the use of LSD during that time.  He would have been well-advised to consult an ordinary dictionary before making this  claim - unless, in fact, it is merely a very subtle joke on the reader.   <p>   I also noticed his somewhat uncritical description of an April, 1972 bombing attack as `killing an estimated 100,000 North Vietnamese troops' (p. 758).  One can only speculate on how many NVA soldiers Patterson thought were wounded in this attack, which must have marked a turning point in the history of warfare.<p>   What I found especially unsettling about this sort of thing was Patterson's claim  (p. xii) - a claim I have no reason to doubt - that a number of eminent historians `read every word' of his manuscript.  One wonders - didn't any of these historians remember hearing people say `acid test' before the age of LSD?   (Subsequently, after whatever fact-checking the publisher found appropriate, the book appeared as Volume X in the Oxford History of the United States, and went on to win the 1997 Bancroft Prize in History.)<p>   So why, given its obvious unreliability with respect to facts, have I given this book four stars instead of one or two.  In the first case, I make allowances for the sprawling unmanageability of the period, and of recent times in general.  In the second case, the writing is reasonably balanced and judicious - though Patterson seems to be a liberal, he is neither hysterical nor shrilly self-righteous.  Thirdly, the author has made a valiant effort to include and integrate coverage of foreign and domestic politics, the economy, social trends, popular and high culture, and so on.  Finally, the book is very readable, though not nearly up to the literary level of its predecessor volume in the series, David Kennedy's distinguished Freedom From Fear: The American people in Depression and War, 1929-1945.</span>
