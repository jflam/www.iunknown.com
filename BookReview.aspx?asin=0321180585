                    <span>Ben Forta's deep experience and practical application overflows from the pages of this book that I highly recommend.  Of the dozens of computer books I've ever read, this one kept me astounded me with its perfect-sized chapters, handy reference and cross-reference segments, and the well-written pages.  Not only is Ben Forta a good writer, he's an outstanding teacher.

                    <span>If your preparing for the CFMX exam, you might be thinking that as long as your asked questions about code that you've programmed in before (cfquery,cgi variables,etc...) then you're going to pass. And you would be right for thinking that, but the problem is that the exam is so very comprehensive of the entirety of the ColdFusion language. If you don't know at least the basics of things like LDAP, verity searches, flash remoting, WDDX, and XML, then your taking the test on shakey ground. And those are things that alot of ColdFusion programmers may have never used simply because of the type of web apps. they write. That's why you need this book, to learn all the features of CF you have never needed to know, and also to review those concepts you have mastered.<p>You can take sample exams generated from questions in this book on Ben Forta's website. http://www.forta.com/books/0321180585/<p>I also highly recommend the CFMX Exam Buster by CentraSoft. http://www.centrasoft.com  The format of the sample tests are EXACTLY like the certification exam. There were no suprizes when I took the real thing.<p>If you go through Forta's book and do some sample exams, your almost guaranteed to pass.</span>

                    <span>This book does a good job of giving you information on every possible topic of the certification exam.  I used the original study guide to take and pass the first exam.  This book includes just about everything in the first book, and goes into topics that are relaevent for MX (i.e. CFCs, XML, Flash intergration, etc.).  If you want answers in a few pages vs. a few chapters, then buy this book.</span>

                    <span>With this book and some real-world experience in ColdFusion you should be able to pass the Macromedia exam without a problem.  Don't get me wrong - the exam isn't easy - but Mr Forta covers all of the relevent parts in focused chapters that cover what is needed to pass the exam and excel in CF.  After getting an Advanced level certification last month, I find I'm still using this book as a reference on day-to-day stuff.  Highly recommended.</span>
