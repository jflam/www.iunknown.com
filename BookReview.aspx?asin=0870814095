                    <span>We picked up a copy of "The Explorer's Guide to Death Valley" and found this book to be a fantastic resource for our visit!  The book is very comprehensive in nature, with detailed descriptions of drives along ALL the roads in the park.  It turned out that during our visit in March 2005, a large number of the roads through the park were closed due to storm damage from this winter's record rains, so the book was truly a godsend in figuring out alternate routes through the park.
<br />
<br />Another great feature is that the authors tell you pretty accurately the condition of the roads (most of the roads are unpaved), including such important details as washed out areas, how steep are the grades, and the like.  We also really appreciated the details on what mining ruins were to be found at the end of the bumpy drives.
<br />
<br />We found the information in this book to be very accurate and honest, helping us to decide what we wanted to see in our way-too-short visit to the park.  This book is a great one-volume source for seeing the most when you visit Death Valley.  Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>That was what people have thought that the name Death Valley had come from.  A settler who had enough of what this land had to offer.  And upon his exit, he muttered those words.  This is all a theory, but this book will take you into the past and give you an all-around trip though a beautiful land that most people portray only as a barren wasteland.  With descriptive writing and great photos, this book is A MUST for all of those who want to make the trip!</span>

                    <span>It would take years of visits to Death Valley to enjoy all the trips outlined in this book, and without this book, you won't get as much out of them.  This book really made my recent trip to Death Valley a success.<br>One suggestion: get a map to use with this book.  The book itself has only tiny outline-maps of the various trips described imposed on small silhouettes of Death Valley. A map will help you get an overview of where you are and where you want to go.  A map will make it easier to plan your itinerary.  I used Tom Harrison's excellent map of Death Valley, which you can score at outdoor-oriented stores. When you pay your user-fee at the park, they also will give you a simple map.<br>Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>As I was studying this book,when I was writing important<br>secrets with in the book's Repitoire in my journal.The <br>place itself is amazing to know how much of Death Valley that<br>we never knew before.Not only the book,but the place itself,<br>must have a lot hidden secrets and the geography of the place<br>that makes it astonishing.The book is really a piece of <br>ancient art,especially Death Valley itself.<br>Throughout, the captivity of Death Valley, the stunningly<br>beautiful sceneries. The amount of plants, flowers, and the <br>nature of it, can really bloom out in fantastic shades and colors. I always thought, that Death Valley is a good National<br>Park to visit, but not to live in. I felt the amirition of<br>the book's scriptures based on the National Park, as <br>overwellming, and someday I wsh to to become an American<br>Female Archeologist and explore more of Death Valley. There<br>are still more to be discovered, that remains a mystery. <br>That's what Death Valley means to me. The place itself <br>remains a mystery.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book with a few, minor flaws.  The book tells you at what mileage markers you can find specific landmarks, so you shouldn't have any difficulties finding old mines, ghost towns, etc., whether on a paved or 4X4 backcountry road.  The author includes a brief history of each mine and ghost town, though they sometimes leave me with more questions than they answer.  However, in a book that attempts to cover as much as this one does, such shortcomings are inevitable.  Indeed, one gets the impression that the author wanted to include more anecdotes, but the publisher wouldn't allow it.  People interested in botany and geology should find this book especially useful, while those interested in wildlife will find this book to contain only basic information.<p>There are a few minor inaccuracies...for example, an abandoned camp along Butte Valley Road is listed as being abandoned since the early 80's, but a marker at the site says it was abandoned in 1988.  Also, though the book covers most roads in the park, it hardly mentions a few, including the (difficult!) road from Eureka Valley to Saline via Steele Pass.  This omission won't be a problem for most readers, since the vast majority will stick to the paved roads.  And the author writes about the paved roads with the same detail and enthusiasm as the unpaved ones.<p>Some remarks are downright mysterious and leave the reader hungry for more.  For example, when describing the features of a particular road, the author says "a few maps show a 'Marble Bath' but no one can agree on where or what it is."  Well...?!?  Has the author seen this landmark?  Can he tell us what SOME people think it is?  Give us a hint!<p>While the book is very good at telling you exactly where to find major landmarks, there are no maps.  Even though the book describes in words where to turn, what route to take, etc., a map would be most helpful.  This omission can be rectified by visiting your AAA travel center.<p>But don't let these flaws stop you from buying the book.  If you're going to Death Valley, and especially if you're taking an unpaved, backcountry road, this book is an invaluable resource.</span>
