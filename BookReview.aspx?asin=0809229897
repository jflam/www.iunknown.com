                <span id="Label1">Hard to believe anything other than luck and maybe fate, never mind a book, can make someone fall in love with you, but oddly enough, Leil Lowndes seems to offer the advice that can do just that in <I>How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You</I>. The sensation of falling in love comes from a chemical secreted by the nervous system, phenylethylamine (or PEA, as Lowndes calls it, as in "Scientists tell us only PEA-brained people fall in Love"), and the trick is to trigger the manufacture of PEA in your potential love partner, giving him or her the sensation of being in love. Lowndes offers 85 techniques for "Hunters and Huntresses" to capture their "Quarry." Much of what the book offers is common sense--the power of eye contact and compliments--but it's presented in a new way and with such detail that it seems that it can't help but work.<p>  Following some of her advice will have you treading that fine line between nice and obsequious, and at times, this book may sound offensive to some, advising the reader to play what may sound like games. Lowndes is aware of this, and she offers some caveats, but still it is hard to get past advice such as, "Show him you're smart, but remember--not <I>too</I> smart" or "Watch your Quarry's reactions to outside stimuli, then show the same emotions." In all fairness, Lowndes doesn't play favorites: her advice to men and women can be equally appalling. Yet, the relaxed style of this book, presenting solid wisdom with a bit of scientific support, makes this book appealing, and, who knows, maybe it will make <I>you</I> more appealing, too! <I>--Jenny Brown</I> </span>

                    <span>This book has what it takes!  I bought this book and read it cover to cover, I found what I thought was Mr. Right we fell in love, had a baby together, and then he changed!! it eventually ended bad. However, that is by far not the books fault. Leil has spent many hours observing people and the never ending game of dating. And she has found the fool proof do's and don'ts of the 'game'. If you are serious about finding someone to fall in love with, get this book. But please make sure you choose wisely when finding Mr. Right.  I will definately use this book again on someone else more deserving of my love.       </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book is loaded with practical techniques, with numerous examples both from real life and from scientific experiments.  The bottom line is - the techniques work.  
<br />
<br />Even though the book is geared toward making people fall in love - the bottom line is that it is about establishing rapport with people you'd like to have around, so many of the techniques can be used by anyone in daily life to establish and maintain harmonious relationships.  After all, letting know someone that you appreciate them and letting them know what you genuinely like about them, will help in any relationship - amorous or professional.
<br />
<br />There are degrees of bonding you may want to have with different people and it's up to you how deep a bond you desire to develop with someone.  It is also useful to know what we do that gets people hooked and attached, so that we don't do it with people we don't want to chase us.  Sometimes people unconsciously do the "right" thing with those they don't want, and the "wrong" thing with those they do want - so it's good to be conscious of the effects of one's behavior and influence upon others.
<br />
<br />An entire section of this book deals with - oh, I prefer to call it "a balance of energy exange" rather than what seems to be a popular phrase, "one's market value".  It is an important issue, not just for attracting someone into your life, but also for maintaining harmonious relationship on a long-term basis - again whether the relationship is amorous or professional.  The successful long-term relationships are based on mutual contribution to the relationship - the qualities and "assets" each person brings into a relationship may be different, but they will have to balance out in some way.  
<br />
<br />The book does have some lovely techniques for developing deep level or rapport and intimacy fast, by using one's verbal and non-verbal language to shift gears from "I" and "you" into "we".
<br />The material covered in this book is not all-encompassing, though.  You can learn much more from the field of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.

                    </div>
                    <span>I thought this was an interesting book and it makes a good point - dating and "falling in love" are just games, like on catch27.com.  But that's a little depressing at the same time.  It disturbs me to think that rather than "falling in love" with someone naturally based on personality and attraction, people can be manipulated into "falling in love" based on certain actions that cause chemical reactions.  So it's hard for me to rate this book...it makes good points that are likely true, but I don't like what those points ultimately add up to: love isn't what you think it is.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I had read a few books about courtship or heterogenous love, but not one solely on making love or having sex. I dont mean this book belongs to the later group. However, on top of the useful but common techniques (separate for hunter and hunteress), the last few chapters devoted to making love and having sex really makes it outstanding above the rest. The table which the author used to tell the contrast (and thus differences on what men and women think about good sex) between female porn and male porn is hilarious but true (to the detriment of my self esteem). However, the most important message for me rests on the author's suggestion to read romance novels published by Harlequin. The few pages 247-251 (that 5 pages worth the price of the whole book) of a partial story the author used to elaborate (in a choregraphy format) the perfect setup to turn on a woman and drive her crazy really brought me to a level far beyond my previous reach. I tried it the day after I completed this book and the effect was so amazing.  
<br />
<br />In short, a must read. I am sure that this book will open a new horizon for many "common male" like me. 
<br />
<br />p.s. In order to avoid any bad impression that I or the book is sheerly sex related, below please find some of my favorite techniques mentioned in the book.
<br />
<br />No. 33 Employ Empathizers: Dust your discussion with phrases like "I see what you mean." "Yes, you were right." "I can related to that," and the all time favorite, "I understand."
<br />
<br />No. 59 "How do you feel about that?": Whatever she is discussing, simply ask that. Go ahead, force yourself. 
<br />
<br />No. 65 "Tell me about it.": Beg her to tell you about it. Then listen - like a woman listens. It makes you a more loving man in your Quarry's eyes.
