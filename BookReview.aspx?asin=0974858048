                    <span>I ordered this book primarily because Microsoft Press was not going to release their version for some time and I needed to learn the product.
<br />
<br />I found the information to be very informative and well written.
<br />
<br />I am looking forward to the release of the Advanced version which is due shortly.
<br />
<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who needs to learn about Small Business Server 2003.</span>

                    <span>Let me give you the example of what he consider's "Best Practices" "BEST PRACTICE: Rumor has it that, in Radmond, this area is called RUP (Ryhmes with pup, like puppy).  If you call Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS), you could say RUP and arrr-wuuu-wuuu, but your coworkers who overhear the telephone call might look at you kinda funny"
<br />
<br />Isn't this hysterical?
<br />
<br />If you're looking for bad jokes like this, then this is the book for you.  It is full of them.
<br />
<br />I didn't pay almost $60 for this book for this.  You can buy mine on Amazon Marketplace.
<br />
<br />About 1/2 of this book seems to have practical and accurate technical information, but you have to wade through all of this "cutsie" filler to get to it.  And when you do, you sometimes don't get enough to really understand the issue.
<br />
<br />I guess it would be ok for a beginner with a bad sense of humor and a lot of time on his/her hands.</span>

                    <span>Being a computer network admin I have read many technical books over the years and almost all of them could put you to sleep.  However, Harry's style is much more like a conversation than a dry lecture.  The only other technical author I have found like that is Mark Minasi.  This book does an excellent job of covering the important SBS topics and it offers many recommendations for other resources to help you learn and support the product.  I learned a lot and I am looking forward to his advanced book in this series as well. </span>

                    <span>I work for an IT integration firm for small businesses where we frequently roll out SBS 2003 - but I wouldn't professionally consider myself "the guru" of SBS 2003. 
<br />
<br />I bought this book hoping to pick up a morsel or two of practical information, not to find some earth-shattering information or technique unknown to me. Sadly I was still disappointed and became quickly frustrated at this "guide to using the SBS wizards" and the relentless ego-boosts by the author and his seminars.
<br />
<br />I guess the book jacket nails it on the head as "delivering another useful book for resellers in the small business technology community..." -- key is resellers! 
<br />
<br />If you're an integrator looking for an authoritative guide of the best practices for SBS 2003 in real-life scenarios for businesses with around 35 employees, you should pass on reading this book - since you already know or could quickly figure out everything this book might teach you!
<br />
<br />This book is probably PERFECT for lots of folks out there - but for us professionals, we can only hope the yet to be published Volume II from Mr. Brelsford will be more helpful.</span>

                    <span>This book is an introductory and intermediate book and claims to be nothing else. That said, this book is done right and not only has users complete step-by-step procedures as if taking a lengthy SBS-specific class (of which there are none) but allows the newbie (and perhaps even a few gurus) to successfully standardize their SBS deployments. Weaved into the step-by-step actions you will find tremendous SBS cultural wisdom, such as why the Wizard behaves the way it does and how that Wizard evolved over eight years and four major release cycles. Brelsford, in his sometimes humorous way (yes - a light-hearted computer book - GASP!) is the only writer who could achive this given his book cited direct involvement in the product as a writer and active consultant since its 1997 inception. I look forward to many more Harry books on SBS to come (he indicates in this work that an advanced book will be out this fall - can't wait)
