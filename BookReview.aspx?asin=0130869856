                    <span>The book covers all aspects of GDI. The aspect I liked most is that it explains API function calls from a developer's perspective, highlighting bugs, discrepances or misunderstandings present in Microsoft GDI documentation. At the beginning it covers the internals of windows explaining how components are interconnected and showing the tools used to understand it.<BR>I liked the coverage of Bitmaps (loading and saving to disk, filtering and alpha blending), the detailed explanation of routines we take for granted (like simple lines, regions or fonts)...<BR>All the examples consist of a series of C++ reusable classes wrapping functionality</span>

                    <span>I've been looking for a book with this kind of practical information and depth for a long time. Unlike many books or references for Windows GDI, this one offers practical wisdom and useful examples. Mr. Yuan does a good job describing the background and architecture of Windows graphics systems. Buy this book if the MS docs leave you wanting, or you want to learn the how and why behind the APIs. I'm an experienced Windows programmer since the early days, and I find this book very valuable.</span>

                    <span>After spending several weeks going over the contents of this book, I do not recommend it to the beginning or intermediate readers. Feng Yuan insight into the Visual C++ environment is excellent; however, he does a very poor job with organizing and explaining the topic to the average reader.<P>I had a hard time following his technical jargon; it was no different than reading the MSDN help manual, which was really cut and dry. If it was his intent to write this book as a reference manual to demonstrate the features of GDI or for the advance developer (who probably doesn't need it to begin with), then he did a very good job. However, developers, like myself, who is just getting into GDI it just left me chasing the bandwagon.<P>The sample code had little or no comments; it was difficult trying to match his explanation to the code sample because he would write the explanation in its entirety and then provide the code sample at the end. Feng, if your reading this, please provide the code explanation in the context that it is being referenced. I had a hard time referring back to your code sample while following your explanations.<P>If you are a developer of C++, I recommend Kris Jamsa who does a very good job of organizing and structuring his books. If only Kris wrote a book on GDI, I would have opted for it than this one.</span>

                    <span>I can't speak to the strengths and weaknesses of the entire book as cited by other reviewers, but it's clear that text rendering was the author's primary motivation to explore the depths of GDI. Chapters 14 ("Fonts") and 15 ("Text") deserve to be expanded into a volume of their own. If you're a developer seeking a thorough understanding of the way Windows deals with text, from the low-level details of the TrueType font file format to the undocumented quirks of the higher-level GDI APIs, you simply can't do any better than Yuan's book.</span>
