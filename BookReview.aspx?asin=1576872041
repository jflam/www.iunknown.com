                <span id="Label1">Sellout "Brand" or just plain "Bland"? In <I>Lovemarks</I>, advertising giant Saatchi & Saatchi CEO Kevin Roberts delves deep into what mysteries lie behind the long-term success and unwavering customer loyalty for a can of Coke or a pair of Levi's, ultimately concluding that Love is the answer, and without some emotional connection to a product, it will dry up like a generic raisin in the sun. Enter Lovemarks, the new marketing buzzword, which will likely be bandied about at board meetings as vigorously as <I>The Tipping Point</I>. <p>  But before Roberts can get to what in fact a Lovemark means in the worlds of advertising and marketing, he takes us on a virtual tour of his CV. There was his first post at Mary Quant in London, then the gig as New Products Manager of Gillette International in the Middle East, on to CEO of Pepsi in Canada, and later the same role at Lion Nathan in New Zealand. The list goes on, and so does Roberts--on and on--about his achievements and experience building brand awareness and shaking things up (he famously machine-gunned a vending machine at a presentation for a spot on the evening news). More importantly, he succeeds at blasting away the smoke and mirrors that might prevent a creative genius (or an ordinary consumer) from seeing what makes Superman the most beloved super-hero of all time. <p>  Despite the somewhat egocentric approach to taking us there (he is, after-all, a pretty smart guy), we arrive at Roberts's point beautifully, and see what he sees: "That human attention has become our principle currency." And that, in these times, forming long-term emotionally charged relationships with customers is the only way to make a product weather the long haul. And while Roberts speaks to us in a spirited, conversational manner (that makes <I>Lovemarks</I> a pleasure to read), the design of the book seems to work against him, as convoluted typography and a general lack of layout consistency give the book a visually amateurish look. <I>--Christene Barberich</I></span>

                    <span>I love this book. I run a web design / graphic design / multimedia company and i think this is a good book to INSPIRE my people, and my friends. I will order more! to give away ;-)
<br />
<br />I love the style (okay i am biased toward right-brain-type of books), I love the pictures, I love the idea.
<br />
<br />Mystery, Sensuality, Intimacy : hmmm seems like we have a good "frameworks" of Lovemarks. Love and Respect axis idea is brilliant.
<br />
<br />At the back cover of the book: "The idealism of Love is the new realism of business. By building Respect and inspiring Love, business can move the world."
<br />
<br />Book that inspire people are rare. and this is one of them. i love this one sentence: 
<br />
<br />I was born an optimist. I always looked for opportunities where others faced up to threats or weaknesses.I believed if you were going through hell, the only option was to keep going.
<br />
<br />If you are related to IDEA/ADVERTISING/DESIGN world this one is definetely for you. If you are not, this one still worth buying!!!
<br />
<br />***** Note to Review reader: I believe that credibility of reviewer is key to analizing a book reviewed with a lot of bias (some give 5 stars, some give one), check out the reviewers' other review book for source of reference, if you find none, be careful, some people are just spitting for other purposes....</span>

                    <span>I agree with tom peters and seth godin & now kevin roberts that design is exquisitely important in just about every area of our lives.
<br />This book is not only filled with wonderful content, it is beautifully designed. Some may say so what, this is a book, give me content. But a book that is a joy to read sinks so much deeper into the grey matter...
<br />
<br />As for the book itself - the main idea is that a lovemark is more (far more) than just a trademark. Is it a brand that produces loyalty beyond reason in it's customers/clients/users. And to do that one has to consider the love vs respect axis.
<br />Check out http://www.lovemarks.com/about/loverespect.php (if this is allowed)
<br />
<br />Low love & low respect = products
<br />Low love, high respect = brands
<br />High love, low respects = fads
<br />High love, high respect = lovemark
<br />
<br />Simple, but oh so effective.
<br />And of course only the customer/client/user gets to decide if your offering is worthy of lovemark status.
<br />Read it.

                    <span>This book is inspired. And it's NOT just for 'ad-folk' (they're a dying breed), but anyone who appreciates how much influence the advertising world has on popular culture. Love and Business in one breath? It's a simple premise, but super-powerful. Just see how beautifully the examples in this book elucidate the idea, taking it beyond ideology to reality. If you want a how-to manual, look elsewhere. Lovemarks is for big-picture people with imagination and savvy, who aren't bogged down in cynicism, and who aren't afraid to take a leap. Lovemarks make a difference. They are the future. If you're anywhere near business, you'd better wake up and smell em.</span>
