                <span id="Label1">The Gagudju aborigines of northern Australia represent the longest unbroken culture in human history, having passed along their traditions for 40,000 years. Now, however, it seems the Gagudju are experiencing their final generation, as young members of the tribe have gone off to practice the ways of modern civilization. In this fascinating and often beautiful tape from <i>National Geographic</i>, tribal elders of the Gagudju display some of their rituals before they become lost to history. As the aborigines coexist closely with nature, the tape also features considerable footage of the exotic animals in the Kakadu National Park, home to the tribe. The aborigines have hunted the vicious saltwater crocodile, and have passed along many legends about the birds and lizards found in this amazing environment. One young aborigine, the son of a tribal elder, works today as a park ranger at Kakadu, and the tape follows his efforts to reconcile the traditions of his ancestors with his life in modern society. As one would expect from <i>National Geographic</i>, this tape features astonishing nature photography as well as solidly researched material on the Gagudju people. The scenes of the elders trying to pass on their lore are touching, as is the mention that one elder often cries at night because he realizes he is the last of his people, as the younger generation no longer undergoes the initiation rituals. This tape would be worthwhile for the gorgeous photography alone, but it is also an intelligent last look at a vanishing culture. <I>--Robert J. McNamara</I></span>

                    <span>As Christophus Colombus once said:<BR> "Life has more imagination then you could dream of in your entire life." <P> True if you are not fully living the dream of life itself. For australia's aborigines, they beleived of themselves as being life itself, creating it, shaping it throughout their entire life.<P> This astonishing film is half documentary half story telling. the documentary part of it, extremely well documented, follows the rhythms and story line of the actual presentation of the aborigine's mythological "Dreamtime". Three facets of this films are weaved in a sublime way: the screenplay, the music and the storyline are one. Now, that I know about the aborigines, I can't help myself from wanting to be truly human again! They are cheer inspiration and hope. Would you dare to dream??? I DO!</span>

                    <span>This documentary is a glimpse into the lifestyle of Australian aborignes that is fading from existence. It ties the remaining population of a small tribe with the land, showing ritual and some ceremony used to keep the balance in life. I found it interesting to hear the aboriginal names of the animals who shared their environment, as well as learning about how each animal came into it's current form. The scenery is beautiful, as are the people and their disappearing artwork.</span>
