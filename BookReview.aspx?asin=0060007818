                    <span>    1949 was the year my Father started to teach me all about the game.  I was ten.  It couldn't have been a better year for baseball.  I can remember almost every day.  We spent a lot of time at the Stadium, watching that great season unfold.  He taught me everything he knew; stood me on the seat so I could see the great DiMag run around center like a deer.  He told me:  "I want you to watch that man, watch everything he does.  Someday people will ask you about him."  It was a great season.  It was, and still is, a great team.

                    <span>David Halberstam wrote this moving narrative on the 1949 pennant race, which took place when baseball was king, TV was an infant, and each league had just eight teams.  The author shows that the New York Yankees were hobbled by injuries to key players (including Joe DiMaggio) for significant parts of the season, while a somewhat healthier Boston Red Sox team fought for the pennant with a slightly weaker roster.  Readers feel the excitement as the late season pennant race came down to the last two games of the season at Yankee stadium - with Boston needing one victory there to clinch the pennant.  The author takes a nice look at the major figures in this pennant race; Joe and Dom DiMaggio (on opposing teams), Ted Williams (harassed by parts of the Boston media), Allie Reynolds, Johnny Pesky, Yogi Berra, etc.  Readers get a feel for the personalities, the pennant race, and the state of life and baseball in that bygone era.  These were two great teams that could have been even better had their front offices not refused to integrate two years after Jackie Robinson arrived in Brooklyn.       
<br />
<br />Halberstam used lengthy interviews with surviving players to write this highly engaging narrative decades after the fact.  I give the book just four stars due to some factual errors noted by previous reviewers (and stats guru Bill James). Still, this is an engrossing narrative about baseball when that sport was clearly on top.

                    <span>Mainly about the pennant race between the Yankees and Red Sox that year, focusing on the players that made it happen. Much is written about DiMaggio and Williams, of course, but Halberstam also deals with some pretty strange characters, like Ellis Kinder, a Sox pitcher who won 23 and lost only 6 games that year, who could only relax the day before working by getting drunk. The book is interesting and nostalgic--but real, too. Among the better baseball books out there.</span>

                    <span>This book doesn't just talk about baseball, but explores the psyche of the men who played and formed the game. An incredible history lesson of the times that will give a deeper understanding of just how great and how heartbreaking baseball really is. 
<br />
<br />Even if you aren't a fan of the Red Sox or Yankees or if 1949 isn't a part of your life, this is something for any student of the game. Of course, baseball is the main theme but it also ties in how much our culture is and was affected by it.  And if you just want to learn more about DiMaggio or Williams, Halberstam offers great insight into the legendary players. 
<br />
<br />Even today, when it isn't the most popular sport in America, baseball still has sociological implications on society. I am definitely getting this for my dad.</span>

                    <span>This very easily readable book is about the pennant race between perennial rivals Yankees and Red Sox. Half way through the season the Yankees lead the Red Sox by at least ten games but the Sox make an amazing comeback. The last game of the season will decide who will play the Dodgers in the World Series....<p>Besides being a beautiful account of the 1949 season it is also a nice biography of all the players involved. An ailing Joe DiMaggio, a young Yogi Berra, a brilliant Williams and Kinder <p>and Doerr. Great names from a great era.<p>With this book Halberstam again has shown that in America serious historians can also write about baseball, America's national pasttime.</span>
