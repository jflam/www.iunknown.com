                <span id="Label1">The future of computing-the future of business<br>   Rapid technological innovation is moving us towards a world of ubiquitous computing-a world in which we are surrounded by smart machines that are always on, always aware, and always monitoring us. These developments will create a world virtually without secrets in which information is widely available and analyzable worldwide. This environment will certainly affect business, government, and the individual alike, dramatically affecting the way organizations and individuals interact. This book explores the implications of the coming world and suggests and explores policy options that can protect individuals and organizations from exploitation and safeguard the implicit contract between employees, businesses, and society itself. World Without Secrets casts an unflinching eye on a future we may not necessarily desire, but will experience.</span>

                    <span>Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, summed up the privacy debate with his now famous remark of "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it". In World Without Secrets: Business, Crime and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous, author Richard Hunter spends 300 engrossing pages corroborating McNealy's observation.<P>The reality is that with advancements in computing and networking, personal privacy slowly gets chipped away, and as Hunter sees it, will ultimately deteriorate. Hunter details in each chapter how the age of ubiquitous computing, where everything short of the food we eat has a network address, can be monitored. Such technological advances creates a world where everything is known and all information is available; a world without secrets. <P>World Without Secrets takes a look at the implications that we are now facing with technology. A cynical reader may think that the author is no more than a Chicken Little for the digital age; yet in page after page, and chapter after chapter, Hunter details examples of how technology can be both innocuously used and offensively manipulated, resulting in the potential for huge privacy breaches. <P>While most books on privacy and information focus on how corporations use and misuse personal data, World Without Secrets adds an interesting twist and provides insights into what Hunter calls Network Armies; which are groups of virtual communities, sharing a similar goal. Hunter sees these Network Armies as starting points in the digital revolution. <P>The only downside to the book is that while Hunter does not provide any type of answer or resolution on how to better enable privacy in the digital age. Perhaps there is no answer. <P>World Without Secrets presents a new look at the issues of privacy and technology. Those who are paranoid may feel vindicated, and those who never understood the implications of technology and its repercussions on privacy may feel violated. Either way, World Without Secrets is a fascinating and timely book.</span>

                    <span>"World Without Secrets: Business, Crime and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing" - Reviewed by Stephen Lafferty<P>The title of Richard Hunter's book refers to the growing availability of information about the personal lives of consumers living in capitalist democratic states. The book begins with the assumption that "very little of consequence can't and won't be known about anyone or anything". Hunter approaches the subject of the erosion of personal privacy from two angles: the business and the governmental/police justifications for retaining information on individuals. His argument, that citizens in democratic countries had better take responsibility for the power of surveillance technologies while they still can, emerges from the discussion of the increasing possibilities for deriving behaviour patterns from recombining archived data.<P>Hunter's first point, that people adapt at a slower rate than the<BR>introduction of new technologies, is underlined using examples of<BR>Amazon.com and Acme-Rent-A-Car of Connecticut. Neither set of<BR>consumers, when they began relationships with either company, realised that information collected about their shopping habits and movements would be sold to third parties or used for law enforcement purposes.<P>Hunter then goes on to demonstrate how organisations that create and retail information, such as Microsoft and record companies, are responding to threats being posed by self-organising groups using the Internet to communicate. Hunter calls these groups 'Network Armies' and provides an analysis of how such groups coalesce and fight their cause, using examples of the Open Source software movement and Linux vs. Windows, Napster and digital distribution of music and the anti-capitalist protestors in Seattle and Genoa.<P>The discussion then moves on to identifying social groups within the 'world without secrets'. Hunter and a team of researchers at Gartner identify four groups: 'Network Armies', the 'Lost and the Lonely', 'Conscientious Objectors' and the 'Engineered Society'. This analysis implies that the world without secrets is inevitable and the area of society to which you belong depends upon whether you support or oppose the authority of the leadership that passes legislation to eliminate barriers to information flow.<P>The last two chapters are dedicated to discussion of war when all<BR>enemy movements are known; and the possibility of a war in cyberspace.<P>Parts of this book were written on or after September 11th 2001 and Hunter considers the development of terrorist network armies and the response that an 'engineered society' can make to such attacks. The New York Electronic Crimes Task Force is used as a model network army for terrorist threats from cyberspace, an Internet version of Interpol with intercontinental crime-fighting agreements.<P>Richard Hunter believes that a world without secrets is inevitable.<P>He urges his readers to take responsibility for the ways that<BR>technologies are implemented through democratic means, such as<BR>building in limitations for information usage by the authorities.<P>This book makes a compelling argument for educating both the<BR>authorities and the public about the type and uses of recorded<BR>information and is an excellent introduction to contemporary<BR>attitudes towards and policies of surveillance. Readers who are<BR>interested in the freedoms that they enjoy in their societies should read this along with Simson Garfinkel's 'Database Nation' and Michael Caloyannides 'Desktop Witness' and be careful about to whom they give their personal information.</span>

                    <span>There are a few books out there that make you think. John Dewey's "How we think", Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" and a book on the history of IP by an Australian writer whose name and book title elude me at the moment are three books that have stimulated my thoughts. This book would be the fourth.<P>It could be that I'm a "shallow Hal" but I have to agree with the other review on the point the author raised in connection with Herbert's "Dune". <P>As we gather more information and as Sandisk (or someone like them) begins to offer terabyte storage to the everyday consumer, we will see more tracking.......and I fear, that in conjunction with XML, ......knowledge will increase.<P>Read the later part of the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament to see what I am referring to. Next, go to the Maxwell Air Force base website and look up their link page to critical thinking. Take a while to learn some things about critical thinking and then read this section in Daniel and this book by Hunter. <P>Most importantly.......THINK FOR YOURSELF AND DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS. <P>McNealy is right. The frogs are already in the pot (loss of privacy) and most will never notice that they are being boiled until it's too late. <P>Hunter has done us a favor by raising this issue in the manner that he did.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book when it first came out and then recently read an insiteful, positive interview with the author of World Without Secrets in the Sunday New York Times. My feelings about the subject matter in the book were similar to that of the reviewer.<P> Interestingly, the article and the book cover lots of privacy issues concerning Amazon.com. Issues that everyone who buys a product on Amazon (or anywhere online) should be aware: especially the policies of sharing information about customers with companies that want to sell goods and services to us (junkmail!) Of course, other companies are discussed, which, in the end just frightens us even more about the amount of information about each of us that is so readily accessible to anyone who wants it.<P>The NY Times reviewer states: "Mr. Hunter is right to argue that if Americans aren't involved in resolving these (privacy) issues, the issues will be resolved without them." Hunter says:"The amount of electronically stored data about individuals is massive, detailed, and growing. We don't yet know how to manage a world in which everything can be linked to me, wherever I am."<P>With his background as a top security expert, Hunters words will shake up any beliefs you may have left that ANYTHING is private anymore.</span>
