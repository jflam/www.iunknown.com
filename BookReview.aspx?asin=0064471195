                    <span>I read this collection in its entirety aloud over our first homeschooling year with my 5th grader.  She loved it!  It is a great book for readig aloud to older children, because of the great prose and amazing fantasy story-telling.  It has interesting little illustrations throughout the book, but not too much to detract from the story.  You have to use your imagination with Narnia!  Every child should have these fabulous stories read to them (not too young, though.)</span>

                    <span> This book is a great book for kids around the middle school age, but me being a senior in high school, i do belive this book was to childish for me. i personally do not like the talking animals and the Harry Potter like theam this book has to it.
<br /> But this book is a great adventure as well as mysterious with the dragons, heros, evil vilians, monsters, lords, creatures,pirates and talking animals.
<br />Although reading this book does make you want to read the whole seven series.
<br /> I would recommend this book to children around the ages of 11 to 14. its a great adventure book for children and they will love it if they like Harry Potter.

                    <span>As a child, my dad would read this to me and my brother every night before we went to sleep.  We loved it and made it through the books many times.  Later, I went back and read them and was blown away by how deep they are.  Kids will love the books for the story, but adults will also enjoy the religious symbolism in the book. I guess that is why my Dad could stand to read it to us night after night.  These books are fantastic - every one of them has its great moments.
<br />
<br />Also, if you like these, you might also look at Lewis's lesser-known space trilogy ("Out of the Silent Planet", "Perelandra" and "That Hideous Strength").  These don't get nearly the acclaim that the Narnia books do, but are very good in their own right.  The three books are kind of a progression, but don't need to be read in order.  Also, the first book is science fiction, the second fantasy and the third a mix of sci-fi, fantasy and horror.  If you only read one of the three, read "Perelandra".</span>

                    <span>C.S Lewis' "The Chronicles of Narnia" is an extraodinary series, no question about it. This seven book set of fantasy novels is full of adventure, wonder, depth and allegory, and is a great read again and again, no matter what your age.
<br />
<br />There are many countries to explore within these books. There's the england-like Narnia with it's talking animals and creatures of Greek mythology, the Arabia-like Calormen with its verbose warriors and horrible gods, the bleak Ettinsmoor with its bumbling giants, the eastern seas with its breathtaking wonders, the western wilds and its enchanted garden, the high, balmy Archenland, and the fantastic Aslan's country. There are lots of characters to meet too. The fauns, the centaurs, unicorns, pegasus, dragons, werewolves, witches, many a talking beast and of course Aslan himself, the great wild Lion, Narnia's savior. There are kings to be crowned, feasts to be eaten, battles to be fought and lessons to be learned. A marvellous place to read about, absolutely.
<br />
<br />Throughout the stories are these beautiful, evocative illustrations and maps by Pauline Baynes, which enchance Lewis' description of Narnia, making it come even more alive.
<br />
<br />Lewis was a devoted Christian, and his faith shines through in all his written works, particularly within Narnia. Both the wonders and temptation of the Garden of Eden is captured perfectly in "The Magician's Nephew". In "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe", we see the joys, sorrows and purpose of the savior, Aslan the Lion (who is similar to our savior Jesus Christ). "A Horse And His Boy", by way of Shasta's adventures in Calormen, plays out Proverbs 16v9: "In his heart man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps". As he heads towards Narnia, the great Lion guides him to his destination, even if he doesn't know it. In "Prince Caspian" we see people who refuse to believe in Aslan, dismissing it as myths just because his appearance was so long ago, in the same way that many people dismiss Jesus and his miracles because all we have 2000 years on are his stories and teachings. In "Voyage of the Dawn Treader", among other things, we see the ever critical Eustace turned into a dragon, and only then does he see how horrid he has been. With Aslan's help, he is stripped of his scales and bathed in water, very similar to the Christian baptism and the cleansing of sins through Christ. In "The Silver Chair", we follow as the temptations and tribulations of Jill and Eustace looking for Prince Rillian, uncannily similar to the doubts and troubles of Christians struggling agaist the world. And in "The Last Battle", we see the apocalypse, the end of the world, based roughly around the Biblical book of Revelation. It's always nice to read book that work on a couple of levels.
<br />
<br />If you're going to get all the Chronicles in one go, I'd recommend this boxset over the paperback ominbus alternative. For one, the books are seperate so more than one person can be reading the series at the same time, and the thinner books are far easier to handle than a great big thick one, particularly if you're reading on the train, like I often do. Plus, a boxset always looks nicer than an unnaturally-thick paperback on the shelf, I think. The boxset is arranged and numbered in chronological order, as a real history would be. It's not my personal preference (I prefer the order they were written in), but you can always switch the books around in the box to whatever order you like (unlike the paperback, which is set in chronological order pretty much permanently unless you start ripping pages out!).
<br />
<br />A great fantasy series, a great allegory, great illustrations and great writing, all in one box. Highly, highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I know there is a debate over what order "The Chronicles of Narnia" should be read in, but frankly, I think it is silly.  I am thirteen and I read the books in the new order (beginning with "The Magician's Nephew") and thoroughly enjoyed them regardless of what order they were in.  Of course,  I already knew the story of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" before I read "The Magician's Nephew," having watched the movie (which I would not recommend--it is but a poor imitation of the book) and it was kind of cool to all of a sudden find out where the witch and the lamppost came from, but I don't know that it really matters.  I think any child will enjoy the books no matter what order they're in.  Of course, it is probably different for those who were children when the books were published--I understand their position completely; if I had grown up reading a series of books in a certain order I can see myself becoming a little ticked off when they were all of a sudden rearranged.  But, for this generation, I would say, let it go!!  There's really nothing anyone can do about it.  THEY'RE STILL THE SAME WONDERFUL BOOKS WITH WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN MORALS.  Read them however you like.  They are fabulous!!
<br />
<br />Sorry so much of this review was on the order of the books, but I felt like I should give my stance on that issue. As for the books themselves, they are all superb.  "The Horse and His Boy" and "The Silver Chair" are my personal favorites, but there weren't any that I didn't like.  "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is the most popular--and I am assuming that is because it was published first.  But these stories are legendary.  Drop Harry Potter and pick up these!!</span>
