                <span id="Label1">More than a few critics hailed <I>Spider-Man 2</I> as "the best superhero movie ever," and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch above <I>Spider-Man</I> in terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility. <I>Ordinary People</I> Oscar&#174;-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that brings <I>Spidey 2</I> to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled "Doctor Octopus," obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success of <I>Spider-Man 2</I> is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoring <I>Spider-Man</I> creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge of <I>Spider-Man 3</I>. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>I just got back from seeing "Spider-Man 2". I have to say that it definitely blows away the first film although the first film was wonderful. In the first film, we see how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man. In the sequel, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his life as a college student, a freelancing photographer, a pizza delivery guy, a nephew, and a friend all at the same time. It is a constant, neverending battle for Peter Parker. Eventually Peter succumbs to his doubts as a superhero and whether the sacrifice is worth it. That in itself was well written out and the writers did an excellent job at fleshing out the true essence of the comic book Peter Parker and bringing him out in actor Tobey McGuire however director Sam Raimi gets full credit for keeping faithful to who the characters are from the comic book pages to the big screen. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus was the best casting job. Alfred's portrayal as the brilliant physicist turned psychopath was one of the best performances I have seen from Alfred. The most chilling scene from Molina in the film was when Dr.Octopus woke up in the hospital. That entire scene in general was rather intense and brutal to say the very least. Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst were wonderful as their perspective characters but I have to say Alfred Molina was the highlight of the blockbuster smash for me. I also loved the brief cameos made by QAF's Hal Sparks, Bruce Campbell, and Sam's younger brother Ted Raimi (who played Joxer on "Xena: Warrior Princess"). The special effects were amazing although there were moments that just screamed "I am the cheese" because I could easily tell that they were computer generated. It is rare to see a comic book turned into a movie that is so well written. Sam Raimi stayed true to the essence of the "Spider-Man" series.</span>

                    <span>"I believe there is a hero in all of us. That keeps us honest. Gives us strength. Makes us noble." <BR>- Aunt May gives her nephew a clue on how to deal with his secret arachnid problem in "Spider-Man 2"<P>The best comic book movie ever. Ever.<P>The saga of Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-Man, continues as Parker has to deal with losing one of his two jobs, slipping grades (web-swinging at night is not a form of studying), a Russian landlord, Harry Osborn's drunken revenge on Spider-Man, and, worst of all, his life long crush, Mary Jane Watson, announces she's engaged to an astronaut that, adding insult to injury, is the son of J. Jonah Jameson, New York's tighest tight wad, publisher of the cities paper "The Daily Bugle", and Peter's boss. When Peter gives up being Spider-Man (thats after losing his web making abilities from psychological stress), things go from bad to worse as a new nemisis rises in the form of the six-armed mad scientist Otto Octavious.<P>Man, think you've had a bad day?!<P>"Spider-Man 2" is easily one of the best sequels made (right up there with "The Godfather II", The Empire Strikes Back", "Aliens", & "Terminator 2"). Sam Raimi's direction is at his best (yeah, that includes "A Simple Plan" & "The Evil Dead" films) and, again takes extreme care of bringing the comic book storyline to life. <P>The cast is back and is in great form (it was also great to see cameos from Cliff Robertson & Willem Dafoe). You could almost peel the angst & heartache from Peter Parker right off the screen!<P>The action sequences are instant classics, especially, the bank robbery scene & the subway car battle.<P>I could go on all day, but, go see this movie - NOW.<P>Stop reading.<BR> <BR>Go. Shoo.<P>One other thing - three words...<P>Hobgoblin. Summer. 2007.</span>

                    <span>I anxiously awaited the release of Spiderman 2. I didn't see it at the theatre. I knew I would buy it when it came out, since I liked Spiderman 1. I expected it to be good. Well, it wasn't. It lacked the "larger than life" comic book feel. The acting was bad. The script was weak. The special effects were not very special at all. There was very little of the quirky humor, which I enjoyed in the first Spiderman. I felt as if Toby McGuire was just fulfilling his contract, to do the second Spiderman. I expected more. It was a big let down. I bought it on Tuesday, the day it came out and traded it in at a local game/video store on Wednesday. </span>

                    <span>Tobey McGuire returns in this special effects loaded sequel however, I unlike some fans was disappointed with this sequel.<P>Toby McGuire once again stars as Peter Parker/Spiderman, now confronting a new enemy Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina).<P>The special effects were awesome, no doubt about that, however unlike the first one, the second half is pure nonsense and I was left unsatisfied.<P>Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus is tremendous, just like Willem Dafoe's characters as "Green Goblin" we see his rise to power.<P>(Spoilers) Yet Raimi's dumb writers in the second half of the film have him playing as a patsy.<P>Spiderman clashes with Dr. Octopus several times and actually the fights are fair, however Dr. Octopus eventually gets Mary Jane (Dunst, who really doesn't do much as far as acting) and uses that to his advantage while creating a new weapon.<P>Tobey as Spiderman again like the first film is not a strong presence, yet I know some nerds are trying to hype him up to be like Christopher Reeve but please give me a break. He will never have the same charisma as him.<P>Alfred Molina is great as Dr. Octopus, but the story seems to go nowhere and we get the same crap from the same movie, like Parker, still being the nerd recluse who is unable to go after what he wants, though this is hilarious in retrospect, but then becomes tiring.<P>The special effects and action are what saves "Spiderman2" from being a disappointment as far acting and plot go, and that wasn't a surprise was it.<P>Still though I was left wanting more, and the cheap ending and the way Dr. Octopus out of the thin blue sky has a change of hear for not killing "Spiderman" was pathetic though, that wouldn't have happened really, still I know there will be many nerds seeing the movie 10 times and saying it was the greatest movie ever, but they aint kidding anybody.<P>"Spiderman 2" is what it is a great special effects bonanza with some great action scenes, but not great character development and predictable plot lines.</span>
