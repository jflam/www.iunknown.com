                <span id="Label1">Steve Allen describes the Escalante National Monument as "a twisted, complex web of sandstone; a jigsaw puzzle of canyons, draws, gorges and washes." His guide, <I>Canyoneering 3</I>, is the latest installment in a series that helps debunk myths of desert hiking being little more than strolling over flat, sandy landscapes. Allen walks the reader through 23 hikes with necessarily wordy descriptions, proving that Escalante is as complicated as it is picturesque. The author is regarded as a legend among canyoneers; you couldn't find a better tour guide to steer you through.  <I>--Ben Tiffany</I></span>

                    <span>A much needed trail guide, but I'm concerned that those who use this book will end up trampling the fragile Escalante terrain. I tried following a couple of his routes (quite accurate), but I'm afraid after a few years these will be trodden sand pits. The maps have a lot to be desired, but that's why we bring topos', right?</span>

                    <span>Oh My God. Having delved into this book in preparation for an upcoming week in the Escalante, I am bowled over by the breadth and depth of this phenomenal book. Amazing. This covers in fine detail backcountry travel routes in the very large and very wild Escalante area. Does not even compare to any other guide I have ever seen. There is such a depth of detail... Plus Steve's enthusiasm for the southlands exudes from the text.<P>This is an extraordinary book. Emphasis is on longer adventures, but there are also good day trips. Folks looking for placid strolls down well developed trails should probably look elsewhere. Not only are there few developed trails in the Escalante, but they are not described here.</span>

                    <span>I have hiked the Escalante country several times, but, of course, nothing like Allen did in researching the terrain for this outstanding book. This guide is soooo much better than any of the Kelsey series that a comparison is inappropriate. If you plan to hike in the Escalante country, Allen's book will return the purchase price in the gas you save by using his road mileage/trailhead guides. This is only a start, Allen provides excellent historical, conservation, and geological information. His hike descriptions contain essential information about time required (and, these are reasonable estimates, unlike the grand-standing machoism of Kelsey), skill level required, and important details to keep you on-route. And, Allen lives in the area, something few hiking guide authors can report. His knowledge of the desert canyon country has been well-demonstrated in his previous guides about the San Rafael. And, he displays excellent ethics in his discussions about low-impact camping and how you can get involved in saving this gem of amazing space, tight canyons, your public land. This is a wonderful work-horse book, for the pragmatic explorer. Sorry, it only qualifies as a "coffee table" book if you are a true adventurer of delightful desert country.
