                <span id="Label1">A national bestseller, Snobbery examines the discriminating qualities in all of us. With dishy detail, Joseph Epstein skewers all manner of elitism in contemporary America. He offers his arch observations of the new footholds of snobbery: food, fashion, high-achieving children, schools, politics, being with-it, name-dropping, and much more. Clever, incisive, and immensely entertaining, Snobberyexplores the shallows and depths of status and taste -- with enviable results.</span>

                    <span>Overall, this was a good, light read. The book is, in essence, a long, witty personal essay about snobbery in America. As some other reviewers below have noted, it's slightly redundant, and it seems like it could have been trimmed down a bit to make a pithy 50 page article. But Epstein's tour though snobbery was enjoyable. <P>The book has three main parts. First, Epstein reviews definitions of snobbery, considers how it has changed over time, and then he delves into the various areas that are used by snobs today as bases of status. What follows is a summary of the book's main points: <P>The essence of snobbery is that you want to impress people, to make yourself feel superior at the expense of other people. The dictionary definition is one with an "exaggerated respect for social position or wealth, and a disposition to be ashamed of socially inferior connections; behaves with servility to social superiors, and judges merit by externals; person despising those whose attainments or tastes he considers inferior to his own." Snobs live in a world of relentless one-upmanship; his only standard is one of comparison, competition, and rivalry. The snob is always positioning himself, trying to gain ground on his superiors, distancing his perceived inferiors. A snobs high standards are tools used in an attempt to impress others, rather than as ends in themselves. Snobs respect the trappings of status: social class, money, style, taste, fashion, attainments, prestige, power, glamorous careers & possessions, memberships in exclusive clubs and groups, name-dropping, celebrities, socially favorable marriages. <P>Ironically, however, the snob's quest for status leaves him powerless, for status is not in the possession of it's holder, but in the eyes of the beholder; you cannot convey status on yourself, others must do that. Snobs hope that others will take him at his own extravagant self-valuation; he needs confirmation, acceptance, and fears rejection. For snobs, the wrong opinion, family, schools, connections, clothes, taste, or manners is more than stupid - it's a disqualification.<P>Epstein also asserts that the basis of snobbery has changed over the last century. The old WASP-ocracy, with its emphasis on lineage, Ivy League schools, exclusive neighborhoods and work at law & Wall St firms, has declined for a variety of reasons. In its place, Epstein asserts, the emphasis on taste, style, and being "with it" has increased. Consumption patterns began to replace social class as an organizing principle of society. Taste -- in politics, food, clothes, culture, opinions -- betrays social class, personal aspirations, self-conceptions. These are the remaining grounds for snobbery today. <P>Finally, why does snobbery persist? Snobbery thrives in democracies, in fact, because social mobility allows one to rise, as well as fall. The quest to rise and do better than one's parents is a central part of American culture, and the societal hope is that quest for prestige will drive people to higher levels of achievement. Fear of falling, as well, drives many to snobbery. Until we reach the day when society is fair, kind an generous, and nobody needs reassurance of their worth, then snobbery will exist. Epstein also reminds us, however, that status is a side dish of life, not the main course, and that the best way to gain prestige in a snobbish world not to care about it at all.</span>

                    <span>These days if I'm going to write a review on Amazon -- what with its annoyingly inconsistent/laughable censorship policies -- it's because I've had a very strong reaction to a specific book or recording and couldn't forbear. <P>Such is Epstein's book. It's a great read. It's original, provocative and insightful. The author has thought long and hard about the subject, and there is much here that is new. Though the author is a college lecturer, there is thankfully nothing that is remotely academic about his writing. Rather, Epstein's approach and style shares much in common with the conversational informality of Montaigne. <P>To clear up a few misconceptions perpetrated by other reviewers: <BR> <BR>1) Epstein is most emphatically not a snob. Rather, he is admirably honest about areas where he inclines to what may be regarded as a snobbish outlook, whereas genuine snobs generally lack this sort of self-insight.<P>2) This book is by no means "light-reading." While it is witty and compulsively readable, many of its insights are profound and will get you thinking about ways in which snobbery has infiltrated your own thinking. <P>3) "Snobbery," the way Epstein regards it, is by no means a synonym for "elitism," and the book is mercifully free of politically correct cant that would equate the two. <P>All in all, Epstein IS an elitist in the sense that he has the sense and discrimination to accurately gauge relative value in cultural matters, but he is far too honest to be considered a snob.</span>

                    <span>Epstein has given us a wonderful look at how snobbery has evolved through the years in America. The book breaks down into chapters based on subject grouping (A classic example is the chapter on college snobbery, where the author discusses which universities are the "hot" ones to have attended) and covers everyhting from the old-money new money class distinction, to the decline of the modern WASP.<P>Basically, Epstein takes a slightly satirical look at how the American Snob has evolved. Written from a qausi-insider perspectvie (Epstein playfully admits to fitting a number of his snob categories) the book gives us a look at how snobbism has affected our cultural history as Americans, and assures us that the snob is alive and well today in america. <P>Over all this is a fine intellectual read. Epstein's dry senes of humor keeps the book from being dry, and his "insiders perspective" makes the satire work even better.</span>

                    <span>This is a pretty good book. Not great. Sure, he pillories the major snobbish fashions of the day. Lots of fun making fun of people who are not as sensible as you or I.<P>He also does a wonderful job of showing how the basis for snobbery has changed, from WASPs and elitism based on real but arbitrary standards like the name of the school you attended, or your connections to established families --- to the modern world, warped by the arbitrary winds of fashionable status, the "hotness" of market driven mania. <P>Still, as a reviewer of great excellence, I must say that his discussion of his attempts to overcome a life of looking down on people and to enter the "snob free zone" limps along -- does he really want us to believe that such a place exists? Who would want to go there? <P>So read this book if you want penetrating insights, sound social commentary, and great amusement. If those are the kinds of things that a person like YOU finds interesting. I might even have given him 5 stars, but of course, I reserve such an award for true merit, of which I am the sole judge.</span>

                    <span>Mr Epstein's book (note the Anglo-/Francophile lack of a period in his title) has good opening chapters, but generally suffers from the limitations of his political views (how could an overview of American political snobs make only passing reference to Wm F. Buckley, of reverse-snobs fail to mention Pat Buchanan, of virtucrats omit William Bennett, of victimisation-mongers ignore Rush Limbaugh?) and from an unendingly mean-spirited tone unrelieved by sympathy (or, as the French say, '<i>rachmones</i>').<P>Without sympathy, or much attempt to explain the etiology of snobbery, his book becomes a shallow exercise in simple mockery---it is no accident that his chapter on Jewish and gay snobbery improves the over-all tone of the book: there, for once, he shows some interest in _why_ some individuals become snobs, and doesn't imply that we are looking at an inborn flaw....come to think of it, the book could have benefitted from an examination of the Calvinist Elect/Preterite divide in the origins of American snobbery---in the absence of great humility, no snobbery can match that of the "I'm saved and you're damned because God wanted it that way," of many Believers.</span>
