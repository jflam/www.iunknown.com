                <span id="Label1">Insurance salesman George "Fatty" Bowling lives with his humorless wife and their two irritating children in a dull house in a tract development in the historyless London suburb of West Bletchley. The year is 1938; doomsayers are declaring that England will be at war again by 1941.<p>  When George bets on an unlikely horse and wins, he finds himself with a little extra cash on his hands. What should he spend it on? "The alternatives, it seemed to me, were either a week-end with a woman or dribbling it quietly away on odds and ends such as cigars and double whiskeys." But a chance encounter with a poster in Charing Cross sets him off on a tremendous journey into his own memories--memories, especially, of a boyhood spent in Lower Binfield, the country village where he grew up. His recollections are pungent and detailed. Touch by touch, he paints for us a whole world that is already nearly lost: a world not yet ruled by the fear of war and not yet blighted by war's aftermath: <blockquote> 1913! My God! 1913! The stillness, the green water, the rushing of the weir! It'll never come again. I don't mean that 1913 will never come again. I mean the feeling inside you, the feeling of not being in a hurry and not being frightened, the feeling you've either had and don't need to be told about, or haven't had and won't ever have the chance to learn. </blockquote> Alas, George finds that even Lower Binfield has been darkened by the bomber's shadow. <p>  Readers of  <I>1984</I> will recognize  Orwell's desperate insistence on the importance of the individual, of memory, of history, and of language; and they will find in Fatty Bowling one of Orwell's most engaging creations--a warm, witty, thinking, remembering Everyman in a world that is fast learning not to think and not to remember, and thus swiftly losing its mind. <I>--Daniel Hintzsche</I></span>

                    <span>It's a shame that George Orwell's two best-known novels, "Animal Farm" and "Nineteen Eighty Four" are neither one his best novel. The peak of Orwell's fiction is this almost forgotten novel, "Coming Up for Air." Set in the last few years before a World War II that was obviously looming on the horizon, this elegant book memorably chronicles the life of George Bowling and his attempt to escape domesticity and the horrors to come for a few days by visiting his old home town. Every time I reread "Coming Up for Air," I wonder what Orwell might have achieved if he had lived longer and had not been as ill as he was in the ten years that remained to him. If all you've read of Orwell is his two "famous" novels, you owe it to yourself to read this.</span>

                    <span>Coming up for Air is a refreshing look at life through the eyes of an ordinary, overweight middle-aged man. I wanted to comment on how the book made me think about how we should cherish those little things in life that we take for granted, it is an old message but this book made me realize it again. The plot is plain, no suspense or excitement whatsover, what the book does however is take you back to your own childhood and helps you think about those things that were important to you then. <P>There are many other issues that the book touches on, the escapism of some, the inevitability of change, the prison that is marriage etc...<P>I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something light and sentimental.</span>

                    <span>There is a reason 1984 and Animal Farm are the famous ones this book is dull. It is the story of a man who first recounts his life before the war and then decides to take some sick leave and visit his old home. Most of the book seems to be devoted to fishing. It is sufficiently cynical but sometimes a plot is nice. Orwell should never use the Hemingway's style. Its not him. I looked all through the book and couldn't find a plot.</span>

                    <span>"Coming Up For Air" was the first novel of Orwell's mature period. It came out after "Homage to Catalonia" (his memoir of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War and the disintegration of the Republican Left in Barcelona). In this novel, Orwell has finally abandoned the Joyce-inspired experimentation and overtly "literary" feel of his earlier fiction and has begun to find his voice. "Coming Up For Air" manages, in a way that I think only Orwell could do, to be simultaneously progressive and reactionary.<P>The protagonist, a petit-bourgeois salesman named George Bowling, haunted by visions of the coming war in Europe, laments the loss of the England he grew up in before the First World War. "Is it gone for ever? I'm not certain. But I tell you it was a good world to live in. I belong to it. So do you." Bowling belongs to the Left Book Club and seems to have a deeper awareness of the world than most of his peers, but he prides himself on being a simple sort of man and looks down on everyone, Left and Right, with a sort of genial disdain. Some of his observations are quite amusing, albeit quite cynical: "Nothing matters except slickness and shininess and streamlining. Everything's streamlined nowadays, even the bullet Hitler's keeping for you... I felt in a kind of prophetic mood, the mood in which you foresee the end of the world and get a certain kick out of it." George comes into an unexpected sum of money betting on the horses and decides to use it to revisit his childhood village. Needless to say, nothing of his boyhood remains, his fishing hole has been converted to a trash dump, his first love has become a fat, dumpy hausfrau, and he goes back home to his wife after an RAF bomber accidentally releases live ordnance over the town.<P>"The bad times are coming, and the stream-lined men are coming too," warns Bowling. "If there's anything you care a curse about, you better say good-bye to it now." Orwell would go on to describe the bad times in his major novels. This one's well worth a look, both for the way we see Orwell learning to deal with the materials that made up the bulk of his major work, and as a not-badly-written entertainment as well.</span>
