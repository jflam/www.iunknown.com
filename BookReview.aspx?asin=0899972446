                    <span>This is still the best for selecting among the hundreds of miles of Yosemite trails: but for on the trail please carry (and know how to use!!) a detailed topo map and compass and for the techies go ahead and GPS but remember batteries die.<p>The federal topo maps are works of art in their own right. If on the trail descriptions are a must either photo-copy the pages as others have suggested or pick up one of the smaller Wilderness Press guides that focus on topo maps worth of the area.<p>A recent alternative to individual maps is the state CD  from National Geographic / Trails Illustrated that gives you the entire state of california on your computer in zoomable, annotatable detail: then you print out what you need.<p>In any case for keeping safe nothing beats the map and compass (altimeter is good in the Sierra also) though the books are great for armchair dreaming and making choices and every Wilderness Press product lets me hear the crunch of granite gravel under my boots like no others.</span>

                    <span>I have to disagree with the two previous reviewers.  First, as someone with no previous knowledge of the park, I did not have too much difficulty using this book.  The excellent topo map that is included helps to locate the trails in the book (in contrast to Falcon Guides, which to my disappointment, don't include topo maps).  There is also a very nice table at the beginning that summarizes the different trails (organized by location in the park) - trail length, difficulty rating, whether it is "exceptionally scenic", how likely you would see other people on the trail, whether there is water/swimming/fishing, and number of days to travel route - very useful for planning a backpacking trip!  <br>                                                              <br>Second, the details about the landmarks along the trail route proved to be useful for confirming whereabouts and distance travelled, especially when searching for potential campsite locations.  I disagree with one of the reviewers about the detail - more is better than less, especially if you've lost the trail (which we did at one point - but thanks to the description of the flora and fauna, we knew that we were in the wrong place!).  If you don't want to lug the book around, just photocopy the relevant pages and pack them in a ziploc.<br>                                                               <br>I've used this book successfully and without any major problems for a 5-day backpacking trip in one of the lesser traveled loops of Tuolumne Meadows - which by the way was certainly "exceptionally scenic" and a must-see for anyone going to Yosemite.  The only complaint that my husband and I have is that the estimated trail lengths might sometimes be inaccurate by a mile or so, because occasionally the numbers differed from those on the trail signs.</span>

                    <span>We tried to use this book to help guide our trip and find some great hiking during our first time to Yosemite.  While the book is a wealth of knowledge and information (if difficult to read in parts), it was overwhelming for us to figure out what we should do and what we should save for our next trip - which we definitely plan to take!  More specifics about what is worth it and what is not as well as more trail maps would be extremely valuable.  Even a basic overall map of Yosemite Valley or the Tioga pass would have made a big difference.  For example, the map given by the park as you enter Yosemite is excellent.<p>Perhaps this book will be more valuable as we become regular visitors to and hikers in the park, but if you are planning your first trip, I would start with a different book - or better yet, follow the advice of locals and previous visitors.  Some obvious suggestions:  Glacier Point, Mirror Lake (great view of Half Dome), Bridalveil Falls, somewhere along Tioga pass (e.g. Lake May, Tenaya Lake, Tuolumne Meadows), Mariposa Grove.<p>Have fun in Yosemite!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book to prepare for an upcoming return to Yosemite and found its contents adequate, but I wouldn't go beyond that.  For me, a good trail guidebook is a must when exploring the national parks, and as far as this book is concerned, I've seen better.  First, although the topographic map included is a nice freebee, I think most people would rather have a detailed map for each trail- or even close-up maps covering multiple hikes in the same vicinity- if forced to choose, similar to what you find in the Falcon Guide series.  I was disappointed to see there were no maps included in the book proper- the topo is all you get, and since it spans the entire park, you may need a magnifying lens to see the individual hikes, and sometimes it seems locating the roads requires microscopic vision.<p>Second, while I am aware that this book was written with geology as a focal point, I found the extensive geologic information strewn all through the trail descriptions distracting.  Some people enjoy reading such things as they hike, I suppose, but I prefer having the background in the background, in its own chapter, leaving my trail guides uncluttered.  If you're like me, you'll just get annoyed with continually having to skim and skip through the hike descriptions to find the pertinent information you're really seeking.  So if you're not particularly interested in wading through DETAILED coverage of Yosemite's geology and prefer concise, straightforward descriptions of what to expect along your hikes, choose another guidebook (which is what I would have done had I had the option).<p>In general, the book is useful and covers a substantial number of hikes in Yosemite.  It will help you to choose your treks and plan for your trip.  But I wouldn't want to lug it around with me on the trail.  Unless you're interested in all the extra details (excepting practical ones, such as useable trail maps), look for something a little less studious.</span>

                    <span>A personal detailed account of Yosemite hiking trails that not only describes the beautiful scenery, but also informs you of how Yosemite evolved thousands of years ago. It pinpoints Yosemite's historical past  right down to the flora and fona. Schaffer even included a distance and  difficulty table of each of the trails and an enclosed trail map. This book  will give any first time visitor a great idea of what Yosemite has to  offer!</span>
