                <span id="Label1">If you can't afford to let the Web get ahead of you, you can't afford not to have this guide. In this best-selling <b>Visual QuickStart Guide,</b> you'll find all the friendly, step-by-step instructions you need to start using DHTML and CSS to add visually sophisticated, interactive elements to your Web sites. Completely updated to cover the new browsers, standards, and DHTML and CSS features that define the Web today, the one thing that <i>hasn't</i> changed in this edition is its task-based visual approach to the topic. <p>Using loads of tips and screenshots, veteran author <b>Jason Cranford Teague</b> covers a lot of ground--from basic and advanced dynamic techniques to creating effects for newer browsers, migrating from tables to CSS, and creating new DHTML scripts. If you're new to DHTML and CSS, you'll find this a quick, easy introduction to scripting, and if you're a more experienced programmer, you'll be pleased to find practical, working examples throughout the book.</span>

                    <span>Jason Teague does a nice job of introducing CSS and its use with Java to create DHTML pages. Teague is stronger on design than programming, however, and that's where the book falls short.<P>JavaScript is the engine that makes DHTML work, but there is very little coverage of JavaScript basics in this book. Teague apparently assumes the reader knows basic JavaScript. So, he focuses his efforts on explaining the Document Object Model (DOM) that allows JavaScript to interact with web pages, and how to use the DOM to accomplish various tasks.<P>One shortcoming of the book is that it devotes inordinate attention to legacy web browser issues. At one time, there were three different DOMs (Microsoft, Netscape, and W3C, a standards organization). The current generation of browswers have fallen in line behind the W3C, and its DOM has emerged as the dominant model for DHTML pages. Teague spends many pages explaining how to address these legagy DOMs, which makes the discussion longer and more complicated than it really needs to be.<P>Be aware that Teague misuses the term 'DOM'. He talks of 'creating a DOM' every time one gets a reference to an object on an HTML page. The DOM is actually created by the browser when it loads the page. We access the DOM to get an object reference. I personally found Teague's use of the term very confusing, and that steepened the DHTML learning curve for me.<P>Teague's JavaScript code is very difficult to decipher, which is surprising in a book that is apparently targeted to web designers. One would expect simple, clear code that non-programmers could follow. Instead, the code violates a number of good programming practices--variable names are generally not descptive, and program logic is often knotted up in a tangle of nested 'if' statements. The drop-down menu code in Chapter 24 provides a good example of these problems. <P>But the biggest problem stems from a simple lack of formatting of the code. Teague prefers the older style of packing as many statements as possible on a single line--the code reads like a 'C' program from twenty years ago. In order to decipher the code, one must first unpack the lines to spread out the code, then apply proper indentation to figure out which 'else' statements are nested within which 'if' statements. That's a tedious, time-consuming, and very avoidable exercise.<P>I'd recommend this book for its exposition of CSS, and I'd give it a 'pretty good' rating for its handling of the DOM. But if you are diving into DHTML, use this book to get your feet wet. Then find a good JavaScript book to learn the ins and outs of manipulating the DOM and adding client-side interaction to your web pages.</span>

                    <span>This book is required reading for anyone who wants the title of web design guru.<P>It is required that you have a working knowledge of HTML and Javascript prior to reading this book, as it is designed around the much more advanced topic of CSS/DHTML. People with little knowledge of Javascript should get a Javascript tutorial (I recommend SAM's teach yourself...) first.<P>Mr. Cranford-Teague has taken the trouble to explain both the documented use and the real-world implementation of CSS. He has taken away much of the testing that is often required when designing against the CSS2 specification. (He makes mistakes so you don't have to!) His quick reference appendix of what-style-elements-work-where should be the most heavily thumbed pages of any book in your HTML design library.<P>The book is a quick, delightful read with clear, textbook-class examples of every aspect of every CSS specification out there, along with a perfect cross-browser Javascript model that should be the industry standard.<P>The book is small, and cheap enough to keep up with the latest browser platforms. I own all three versions, and so do all my associate developers!</span>

                    <span>Teague is thorough in his coverage of CSS, but there's nothing here that Castro's HTML book doesn't cover better, and the CSS appendix doesn't reference the relevant pages so it's harder to use. Teague appears to favor a hard-coded positioning approach over a more semantic style to achieve the same layout, so it's already behind the prevailing trend in design.<P>The DHTML section is short on foundations and uses object-oriented code without explaining how or why that aspect works. It embodies the worst of the Visual Quickstart Guide format: cursory descriptions (at best) for the first appearance of a bit of code, then it glosses over every subsequent use with not even a reminder. Thus it's not a good choice for someone new to Javascript or programming, and those who are familiar with Javascript and web design would probably choose another method over the bloated, API-style programming in this book.<P>If you're mostly interested in using Javascript's styles object in concert with CSS, this is a poor choice. Peachpit's Javascript book is easier to use and more in tune with web standards.</span>

                    <span>I think the previous reviews all refer to the 2nd edition. The third edition out in 2004 has a great deal more focus on DHTML navigation and Mozilla-only code.<P>The navigation scripts he provides shows his complete grasp of both CSS and javascript. Unlike the examples in sites like javascriptkit.com and dynamicdrive.com which are written by javascript gurus, JCT's scripts are hybrid models of both advanced CSS and javascript. The code and mark-up combination are so tightly written, it is absolutely necessary that every web developer gets this book. You won't find code like this anywhere else on the web! <P>Also, JCT provides excellent examples of code that shows the new directions taken by the Mozilla development team. He reveals a way of making rounded corners using only a few lines of CSS, and no graphics. <P>My one caveat is that the editors of JCT's 3rd edition did a piss-poor job of copy-checking. On the second chapter, one of the paragraphs in the tips section is duplicated word-for-word. And on page 105, the example is missing a period, thereby making it completely useless unless you spot the mistake. These are only the ones I spotted as I flipped through the book -- I am certain there are many more errors. Buyer beware!</span>

                    <span>I always buy more than two books for each subject I want to learn. If I can't dig something out of one book, I can try the other(s). Well, it was finally time for me to really learn CSS, so I went to the bookstore and picked up a couple of books on the subject. <P>The next night I went to a different bookstore to find some ASP manuals. While there, I noticed another book on CSS so I added it to my ASP pile. <P>When I got home and started reading DHTML and CSS by Mr. Teague, I found it was not only easy to understand, it was delightful to read. It was better than having a friendly person sitting next to me in a hands-on session. This is the first computer manual that I can say this about, and I have a small library.<P>As it turns out, by accident I bought two copies of the book - I was rushing the second time because the store was closing. I've decided to keep one copy downstairs handy in my computer room and the other upstairs by my bed to browse before sleep. <P>If you have a chance, pick the book up and look inside. It's so easy to use it's actually fun. You need to know HTML and be familiar with JavaScript, which the author alerts you about. I'm looking forward to getting this book grubby.</span>
