                <span id="Label1"><P><b>The complete guide to dealing with mold in your home--the asbestos of the new millennium</b>  <P>Toxic mold infestations in the home have been brought to the forefront of public awareness. Erin Brockovich's struggle to fight this health crisis and Ed McMahon's experience of this problem in his own home have further publicized the fact that mold has been linked to a host of serious health problems.Yet there are no standards for acceptable indoors mold levels and no laws requiring home sellers to disclose mold problems.  <P>Written by award-winning reporter Vicki Lankarge, this is the first complete home owner's/home buyer's guide to dealing with mold. Clearly and concisely, Lankarge acquaints readers with the latest findings about mold infestation and arms them with everything they need to know to: <ul> <li>Successfully detect the presence of mold  <li>Prevent, control, or eliminate mold  <li>Deal with mold-related health problems  <li>Understand mold's legal implications  <li>Work with insurance companies on mold-related cases  </ul></span>

                    <span>I would highly recommend Vicki's book! She is the 1st person that is not a mold victim, that has been able to capture the issue. This book is a must for every homeowner, property owner, and renter in the country! Thanks, Vicki for a truely wonderful book!</span>

                    <span>We are in the middle of a mold crisis: a contractor's shoddy workmanship has led to a wet basement and a bad growth of mold in our home. The information Vicki has provided is a real Godsend! 60 days ago we were ignorant of the problem of mold; thanks in great part to Vicki's book, we have a plan of action to remediate the mold. And most importantly, we have invaluable insight into protecting our family's health.<P>Whether or not you have a current mold problem in your home, you owe it to yourself to spend a few dollars on this book. Mold problems are going to be the "asbestos of the new millenium." You could be affected and not even know it. <P>Good work, Vicki!!</span>

                    <span>Book reads like a short story paperback, not an analytical text with charts, diagrams and pictures. Maybe the publisher did not have these additional features available at time of print. Other texts do show microscopic examples with COLOR print. At least that was my hopes in this book. <P>How are you going to know what mold looks like from just words. Maybe a few good pictures would help the cause. Right?</span>

                    <span>I am a Mold Inspector and work with Remediation firms on a daily basis to remediate molds in homes, offices, etc.<BR>I have read this book and it should be revised to correct the FALSE information given about using common household bleach to clean-up mold. Bleach is ONLY good to clean-up mold on smooth, non-porous surfaces such as glass and plastic. It is obvious that the author did NOT due her homework on the best mold remediation products available. To find out what product should be used to remediate mold, buy another book about mold, such as Black Mold - Your Health and Your Home. This book reveals the problems with using bleach products and correctly informs the homeowner on an environmetally safe and readily available product to clean-up minor mold infestations in the home.</span>
