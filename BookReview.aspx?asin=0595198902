                <span id="Label1">It is hard to imagine that today's New York started hardly 400 years ago as a tiny Dutch settlement named New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. The Dutch bought the place for US$ 25, a bargain they thought. For the Dutch, who ruled the world at that time, it was not an important place, but only a trading post for beaver and otter skins. The first Dutch governors were not very successful in developing New Amsterdam into a profitable trading or colonizing venture.</p> <p>The last governor, Pieter Stuyvesant, appointed in 1647, turned out to be the best. The one-leg governor proved to be cut from a different kind of wood as his predecessors. With an iron-fist policy he turned the colony around into a well-organized system. But it was not for long, treacherously English naval forces stole the colony, in the name of the Duke of York, brother of King Charles of England. He changed the name of New Amsterdam into New York. The Dutch fought back and recaptured the colony. In the end, however, they exchanged their northwest American property for more promising territories elsewhere in the world.</p></span>

                    <span>I bought this book to help me with a thesis paper I have been writing on early New Amsterdam. I couldn't have made a worse choice. I don't know if the text is translated from Dutch or if there were just no editors around to work on it, but either way, this book is almost totally unreadable. This shouldn't reflect as much on the author (especially if the original book is written in Dutch), but with Writers Club Press (the publisher). There is little to no evidence of any editing at all, with most of the sentences lacking any structure and heaps of grammatical mistakes. <P>Also, the book encompasses 500 years of history (1500-present), so if you're specifically interested in 17th century Manhattan you'll be disappointed. I would just re-read the early chapters in "Gotham" to get a better idea of what Dutch Manhattan was really like.<P>The publisher of this book should be ashamed of themselves for totally dropping the ball on what could have been a very interesting book if given the proper editorial consideration, and for further releasing this book and thinking no one would notice.</span>

                    <span>This is, as far as I know, the first book about the founding of New York written by a Dutchman. This means there is a lot of material used that was never published in the US. The book pays a lot of attention to the question why the Dutch were actually not so interested in keeping New Holland. Their problem was that their small nation in the 17th century was overstretched. Their colonies covered almost our whole globe. In such a situation you choose where you make the best money. For the Dutch that was what today is Indonesia. A very interesting book!</span>
