                    <span>The final volume of the tri-part Matrix movies was highly disappointing and utterly predictable. Whilst the first Matrix at least had mystery, discovery and special effects, the second and third installments have been very weak. Part II consisted of some story development, interesting new characters, a long highway chase scene, but it left confusing loose ends, many of which are not tied up in the "Revolutions". This last film is weak, lacks imagination, and adds nothing in the special effects department that we have not seen before. <P>Mr Smith is not nearly disturbing enough (some psychological element would have been welcome here), Morpheus has lost all sense of mystery and Trinity has become ... feeble. In fact, all of the major characters are sadly uni-dimensional. Neo, who was originally on a path of self-discovery has become unconvincing as The One. If he were that, he would have gotten himself out of the subway station at the very least. In addition, the hopelessness of the people against the machines isn't nearly dark enough - that should have happened in the second movie to a much deeper extent, if we are to follow the traditional trilogy.<P>The only saving grace of the movie is some fantastic performances by peripheral characters. The editors obviously thought so too, since much of the story focuses on them. The introduction of even more new characters seems superfluous, and a cynical view is that they are there to give some substance to the movie (it doesn't work).<P>Of course, Trinity becomes a sacrifice but not before setting eyes on the sun (standard fantasy saga storyline, and obvious symbolism), and Mr Smith proves to be Neo's alterego (who'd have thought it ... the path to knowing thyself is inward). Self-sacrifice is the answer, of course. <P>Although the storyline is standard, I can't help but feel that the final volume could have been more impressive and its interpretation more mature.<P>Disappointing all round.</span>

                    <span>After the cliffhanger ending of the "Matrix Reloaded", this third and final entry in the Wachowski Brothers' movie trilogy is a fantastic but controversial closer to this stunning movie series. The machines under control of the renegade program Agent Smith are fast approaching the underground city of Zion where the last remains of humanity takes its last stand against them, while Agent Smith is gaining more power by the minute. Neo is now the only one who can be able to defeat Smith for good. However, he is trapped somewhere outside the regular world and the Matrix on a mysterious train station and a very unpleasant individual called the Trainman who controls the train station can free him from there. After much hell, they manage to free Neo from the train station and now Neo must fight and defeat Agent Smith once and for all as he is the only one who can truly save humanity from total extinction. This might sound a little too close to being similar in plot to "The Terminator" but this isn't time-traveling like from those movies. <P>The special effects on this movie are amazing but at times can really go over the top. I especially love the scenery and the way the ship moves through the various tunnels. I've also felt that this movie is much darker than the last two Matrix movies and at times, it even reminds me of the creepiness of "Event Horizon" from a few years back. The massive battle scenes are just awesome and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time they occur. <P>I know Neo is one of the center characters and Keanu Reeves does such an excellent job at bringing Neo to life but from my opinion, it's Hugo Weaving who really steals the spotlight. Weaving does such a fantastic job at playing the numerous replicates of Agent Smith that he easily tosses just about everyone else on the cast into orbit around the earth. I must say, outside of playing Elrond, I will forever remember Hugo Weaving here as he can really play some frightening bad guys and this movie proves just that. Weaving is scary as the dangerous program Agent Smith. The rest of the actors/ actresses except for Bellucci (Persephone) and the guy, who played Merovingian, do pretty well. <P>As awesome as this is, there are quite a few gripes I have with this movie. First, with such a wide variety of different realities and high number of questions that the previous two left us wondering, "Revolutions" only seemed to answer a few of them yet also created a whole new trainload of new questions that are never answered. The ending even if this is the final trilogy, doesn't seem to quite give a sense of the danger now gone for good but I guess these things were the purpose. On the other hand, I can see why they didn't have so everything is answered as it would be just about impossible to have answers handed over in real life. I can also understand why it is confusing as this movie was designed to make one figure out what was going on and how fate is almost impossible to escape. Very disappointed. <P> I felt gravely disappointed with Merovingian and Persephone. We saw Persephone help Morpheus Neo and Trinity and kill one of Merovingian's henchmen but here, she was just totally dumbed-down to just a deaf mute character on here and the couple only appear for about may a few minutes altogether. I expected a lot more out of these two, whether Persephone would battle her husband or betray Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. I felt hugely disappointed with these two and felt that this movie could have done without them. I especially hated the way she looked on this movie. The repulsive outfit that she wore looked so tight that those busts looked like they would have their blood circulation cut off. Yergh! Bellucci was good in the "Reloaded" movie but here, she has brought along some of the emptiest acting that I've seen in many years. <P>The main flaw in this movie is that with such a HUGE dimensions that this movie tackles, just the two hour and fifteen minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg. I think that this movie would've been so much better had it been extended for at least another half hour or even up to over three hours long. Perhaps the movie studios are planning on releasing Platinum Extended Editions with new footage incorporated into the movies the way they did with "Lord of the Rings", I don't know but I felt that "Matrix Revolutions" length doesn't do it a lot of justice. For what it is, "Matrix Revolutions" is awesome, but it could really have been an outstanding epic finale. This is a definite must-own movie whenever it comes out on DVD but I feel that this had a lot of room for improvement and that they blew their chance at it. Then again maybe they are planning on releasing an extended edition of this movie in the foreseeable future to make up for the flaws on here. I can understand how many were disappointed with this movie but even then, this doesn't deserve the high number of negative reviews.<P>It's still a very good movie and the tons and tons of awesome action, battle scenes along with the tons of fun in this film make up for the missteps on here but the missteps are bigger than those in "Reloaded". They created a fantastic trilogy that well definitely be sci-fi classics in the years to come. Go and see this movie today. Just don't expect anything near perfection and if you can get by some of the major flaws, this is just an awesome movie. I can't wait to have all three of these movies once they are all on DVD.</span>

                    <span>I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't. It like The Matrix Reloaded wasn't quite as good as the original, but still is a brilliantly written and important piece of sci-fi literature. Although it starts out directly where Reloaded leaves off, the situation is completely understandable and not confusing to a non-Matrix person. Like the others, its soundtrack of classical music with a blend of rock gives a nice feel.<P>Mind-boggling conversations between characters sieze to get old and Keanu Reaves gives his best preformance in the trilogy. It ends strangely, with Buddhist-Christian philosophies that balnket the sad ending with a happy, touching feel.<P>My only problem with this film is that the battle scenes are to elongated, and after a while become tedious, and just blurres of flashing light and loud noises.<P>Overall, I thought this was a great ending chapter to a science-fiction masterpiece.</span>

                    <span>The first Matrix movie was revolutionary at the time. In retrospect, almost frustratingly so(I'm sure we're all tired of directors trying to impress us with bullet speed special effects). However, I enjoyed it. It was good science fiction, and the premise was interesting.<P>Now, in the second Matrix, it was painfully obvious that the directors were thinking throughout the entire process "man, in the first movie, they liked it when we did this. So lets do it A LOT!" However, despite a weak first hour, and a lackluster ending, it still eeked out an hour of entertainment (especially the incredible car chase scene).<P>And here, the last arrives, and it is not a good thing. They stopped trying to hide the fact that they were ripping off the first two movies. You see Neo fight Smith, start losing, get kicked into a wall, dramatic music plays, Smith looks triumphant. Neo gets up, Smith looks startled, Neo brushes himself on, and does a kung fu move to say "bring it on".<P>That doesn't sound familiar AT ALL, does it?<P>I was almost chuckling at the absurdity of it. It looked like they were trying to duplicate the lobby scene of the first film, only have it with programs who walk ON THE CEILING! The movie tries, and fails to be cerebral. The first film kept it more down to earth, and later on, it tried adding the mystical aspects to the approach, and it fails. And the ending is frustrating in itsself, only serving to remind those of us who didn't pick it up that Neo is supposed to be a Christ-figure.<P>I won't get started on the acting... basically, this film loses all acting, plot, or originality that the first had, and the second had to a lesser extent. This is the lowest wrung of a series which got worse at each attempt. I'm not giving it 1 star just because there are a few action scenes and plot points that aren't COMPLETELY contrived. But not many. I can't recommend this film.</span>
