                <span id="Label1">Beginning with broad NT concepts and then focusing sequentially on various key systems, Solomon dissects NT with a surgeon's care and a software engineer's thoroughness. That's not to say that this book is mainly about writing programs. Rather, this is the kind of guide that power users wish for, explaining why and how things happen and glossing over very little. Programmers will value the clear NT API hints. <p> Initially, the author talks about important NT tools (such as Performance Monitor) and concepts (such as the idea of virtual memory and how it's mapped). He illustrates all abstract concepts with excellent conceptual drawings that make it easier to comprehend what NT is doing. A chapter on NT's architecture explains how the system works as a whole. Later chapters focus on individual subsystems, providing extensive coverage of processes, memory, input/output, security, caches, and NT. After reading the chapter on memory management, for instance, you'll have a solid grasp of paging and the internal settings that affect it. The book also contains experiments that guide the reader through concept-illustrating procedures. For example, readers crash their machines to see and analyze the dump log--a valuable skill. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>Inside Windows NT provides an extensive overview of Windows NT, and a high level peak at the internals. Packed with conceptual drawings, this book delves into NT tools and the core system itself.<p>Written at a time when information about Windows NT internals were hidden or not very well documented (even for those of us who wrote device drivers), this book provided valuable insights.<p>A valuable and interesting read for professional who must write code for NT or just want to know what goes on under the hood.</span>

                    <span>This book is absolutely great in its first half. So get an overview, learn about processes and memory management. Don't try on the more advanced topics though. Yes I do recommend this book, there is no good alternative  to this important subject.<p>Another aspect are the practical excercises.  They basically boil down to reading a number in some tool. This number  corresponds to the just read text. For me this wasn't helpful.</span>

                    <span>A lot of OS internal type of books talk and talk, even though most of them are indeed technically superb. But Inside Windows NT is special in that the author knows humans have to practice to learn. After you read a few pages,  you come to an Experiment section and see what comes on screen if you do  this and that. For non-systems programmer like me, this may be the only  book to satisfy my curiosity to know more about Windows NT.</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute must-have, whether you're a programmer or an NT administrator (although the former will get more out of it). The only gripe I have with the book is that the chapter on security is really weak (about 1/3 the length of every other chapter)--if you're looking for a detailed  programmatic discussion of NT security, pick up Kevin Miller's "NT  Services" (Wrox Press). This book isn't about security per se, but its  chapter on security is terrific. Sorry for the digression, Inside WinNT is  screaming to sit on your shelf now!</span>

                    <span>This is one of the books where I have to force myself to stop reading as one interesting a paragraph follows the next. The first few chapters give a general overview of the basic subsystems and how they work together. The  information described in these chapters are taken as a basis for the  following chapters that each discuss one subsystem. <p>For a general  overview of how a subsystem works the first few pages of a chapter give you  the general idea. If you want to know more the chapters will then go  deeper. <p>The book will NOT tell you how to program NT but rather  introduce you to the concepts that are working 'under the hood'.  <p>Shortcommings: Sometimes terms are used at the beginning of a chapter  that are defined somewhere in the middle of a chapter or in another chapter  further into the book. Also the network subsystem is not described at all.</span>
