                <span id="Label1">Who could forget the decade that brought us AIDS, Milli Vannilli, teen slasher movies, and a sitting U.S. president with an advanced case of Alzheimer's disease? Well, I guess that question answers itself, but for those who wish to remember, no finer source can be found than <i>Totally Awesome 80s</i>, by Matthew Rettenmund, the man who brought us <i>Encyclopedia Madonnica</i>. This loving but ironic catalog of the most important cultural events of the 80s is fittingly slim, flashy, and shallow, covering mostly the poppiest movies, songs, and political actions of the era that told us "greed is good."</span>

                    <span>What a cool book! Even though I was very, very young during most of the '80s, I can actually remember a lot of the things Matthew Rettenmund discusses in this book - especially the music. Top 40 radio was always lots of fun during the '80s, before big corporate conglomerates took over most radio stations. The '80s was such a great time - the music rocked, and so did everything else! (The '80s saw Cyndi Lauper and Madonna rise to fame - what else can I say?) This is a funny book that makes for great dinnertime reading. I wonder, though, why one of my favorite '80s TV shows - You Can't Do That On Television - was never mentioned? Still, this book is a near-perfect and very witty reference to anything and everything from the "Me Decade." Like, totaly radical!</span>

                    <span>As a child of the 80's, I looked forward to this book after reading it's great reviews.<BR>If you are looking for a book that will take you back to to the decade of Flashdance, Miami Vice, etc, this is it! The book certainly hits all the highlights (and lowlights) of the 80's; covering movies, music, and tv in separate sections and starting it all off with an overview of people and events.<BR>However the commentary of the author all but ruined it for me. As a fan of snark, I am all for poking some fun at a decade filled will targets. But few of the comments are fun. They are either not funny, barbed, or just plain out of line and wrong! For those who want to remember a decade teaming with quirks fondly, to have the author taking rude potshots at everything and everyone in a patronizing way just sucks the fun right out of it.<BR>Also there were glaring errors to be found even in a casual read through. Add that to the authors very annoying tendency to make assumptions about things such as a bands motivation for writing a song or naming themselves something without any basis for his observations takes all credibility out of the information. This book must have taken a lot of time, too bad the research was done on the bias, and so is the final product. <BR>Bottom line: this book is a great way back machine for all 80's-philes. But a more accurate title would be "One Person's Opinion of Everything 80's", because that is what it is. A more impartial and accurate touch is needed.</span>

                    <span>I wasn't even born in the '80s and I truly love everything about that era. The fashion the trends, and the music was great! I know more about the '80s then my parents do, and they grew up in the decade! Well this book says it all. It covers everything about the decade and more!!! The kids in my school don't even know what 8 track tapes are!!! I think that it is a great thing to know about the '80s even though I was born in 1990. Well get the book! It will teach you loads of stuff!</span>

                    <span>Do you love the 80's like I do? This will bring it all back to you in one book. The topics covered are current events, fashion, music, TV, and movies. Special attention is paid to the last three especially. I think fans of 80's music will love this the most. It covers everything from Lionele Richie, to Madonna, to Depehe Mode. As for movies, don't forget E.T., The Breakfast Club, and Back to the Future. In the realm of TV, The A Team comes on strong, the Dukes of Hazard wreck their car, and Arnold says "Whatchootalkinabout Willis?"<P>This will be a great gift for anyone who was a TV child in the 80's. If you're a child of the 80's, you should get it for yourself.</span>
