                    <span>I've read a lot of Kerouac's stuff and liked most of it. this, however, is truly pathetic, uninteresting and unnecessary. I guess if you for some reason need a portrait of the artist in decline... this is it. 
<br />
<br />If you've never read him please dont start here. This is only for those who already love and know what jack was capable of- we're better prepared to forgive disappointments like these. If you're new to kerouac do yourself a favor and start with things like the dharma bums, on the road and subterraneans- there's a reason these are as popular as they are.
<br />
<br />It's nice and short, though.
<br />
<br />I also want to mention that this is my first review- I'm not in the habit of trashing great writers lesser works. I dont need my opinions heard or validated. I just want to steer fledgling beat readers away from what could be an instant kerouac dealbreaker.

                    <span>Straight from the hip[flask] of Kerouac, a simple tale about the search for his family's history, which means (like every Kerouac novel) it's not REALLY about that at all, but more about life in general.  I loved chapter two (which you can read all of through the link, above) because it sums up Kerouac's writing philosophy in an nutshell (a good starting point for anyone diving into his works for the first time).  Since we all know booze would Kerouac not too long after he wrote this novel, it's tough not to feel sorry for him as you read -- and, at least for me, wish I could go back and smack his drunk ass out of it -- but I guess that's what made him tick.  After reading Kerouac's vivid, rambling accounts of the most mundane events, one can't help but to find a greater appreciation for life and everything in it.  God bless him.</span>

                    <span>There's no Satori here. No Dharma bums or Dharma either. Just the sad druken ramblings of a once great writer. Gone is the energy and excitement of On The Road and The Dharma Bums. And there's no interesting characters like Neal Cassady or Gary Snyder for Kerouac to bounce off of. Its just poor druken Kerouac wandering through France in an inebriated haze. And also this book was written in the mid sixties, the Beat Generation was well past its prime, already eclipsed by its progeny, the flower children. And unlike Allen Ginsburg, Gary Snyder and Neal Cassady, Kerouac was hopelessly out of touch with the times. And it shows. That's not to say that Satori in Paris is without interest, just that it pales in comparison with his earlier work. And Pic is an example of an interesting early experiment. I believe an early draft of On The Road, before he quite got his bearings and figured out how to write that masterpiece.</span>

                    <span>"Satori in Paris" explores a trip to France by Mr. Kerouac. In it we vist many of the interesting people and places that Jack runs into during his odyssey of sorts of self exploration. If memory serves me right I think this may have been his last novel published. Like many of his other great works "Satori" perfectly captures the vibe and feel of the pre-sixties, pre-Vietnam era beat generation.</span>

                    <span>This book provides the reader with the best chance of<br>exploring the roots of Kerouac's spitituality. Far too<br>often the beats are viewed as a bunch of intellectual<br>hedonists whose love for verse was equalled only<br>by their indulgence in the various permetations of<br>chemical abuse. The beats set the stage for the 60's,<br>and America's search for a true a national spirituality.<br>As "King of the Beats", Kerouac takes the reader into an<br>in depth analysis of what lay at the very heart of the <p>beat movement-the journey is the reward in and of itself.</span>
