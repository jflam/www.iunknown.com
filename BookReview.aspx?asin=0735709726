                <span id="Label1">Who better to ease you into the detailed world of HTML coding (where even an errant spacebar can gum up your creative masterpiece) than well-known Web design instructor Lynda Weinman and her programmer brother, William. This book's <I>first edition</I> came out over 3 years ago, and the Web has changed a lot in that time. Novices will appreciate this HTML primer that not only helps in hand-coding Web pages but also in troubleshooting the HTML generated by WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors like Dreamweaver and GoLive and image/animation applications like Flash, Fireworks, Photoshop, and ImageReady.<p>  <I>Creative HTML Design.2</I> covers basic page structure, images and compression, color, links, buttons, transparency, typography, organization, style sheets, navigation, rollovers, forms, and other issues. (A good description of the first edition, including a sample chapter, can currently be found at www.lynda.com; this new edition will most likely be detailed there soon as well. They also maintain an errata section, important for any book that includes code.) Lynda Weinman's specialty is her friendly yet tech-savvy teaching style--there aren't many who can walk readers through the minutiae of client-side image map coordinates and not confuse them (or bore them to tears). Brother William[SS1], an engineer and programmer, presumably provides the finer points of HTML, plus the JavaScript and CGI scripts. The book offers all the good aspects of Weinman's other popular books: text that's affable yet clear, with a view to anticipating problems beginners may stumble into; lesson projects that are neither too complex nor aesthetically amateur; and a book layout that doesn't crowd pages, but rather serves up ministeps and clearly captioned screen shots in easily digested morsels.<p>  With editors that do it all--like Dreamweaver and GoLive--why would a non-tech-head Web designer want to learn HTML? As Weinman explains, "The advantage of knowing and understanding HTML is that you are in better control of knowing what is possible and what is not." Even if you use an HTML editor, you will at some point have to go "under the hood" and fix troubled code, and at this point even a little familiarity can make a big difference in relieving Web design stress. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><ul><li>Choosing an ISP <li>Creating a basic page and uploading <li>Creating graphics, including how compression works <li>Web color palettes and color tags <li>Links, alt text, image maps <li>Background images and tiled patterns <li>Custom rules, bullets, and other artwork <li>Working with transparency <li>Tables <li>Typography and fonts <li>Site planning and management <li>Cascading style sheets (CSS) <li>Frames <li>Rollovers <li>Forms <li>Animation and sound <li>Listing with search engines <li>HTML 4.0 reference, including the finer points of "good HTML" <li>CD includes all project files for sample Web site used in lessons as well as JavaScript and CGI scripts used</ul></span>

                    <span>Five stars. I recommend <creative html design.2> to any one getting started with the creation of web sites. This book should be on the short list of books to read for creating websites. It covers more than html, and that is good. I benefited from reading it after having taken courses in web design and web programming. Reading it would be also be excellent preparation for taking a web related course. Several of its strengths are: it is co-authored by a graphic designer and techie/programmer (brother and sister), it includes a CD with the files referenced in the book, in includes an excellent html reference section, and there are a number of exercises. As many exercise as there are I would have liked more. The copyright date is 2001. I did not identify any soft spots but would estimate its shelf life will expire the end of 2003. That is the way it is with books about topics such as this. Even then it is should be a solid reference for a number of years.</span>

                    <span>When I was told that this book was going to be used for my technology class I was kind of excited because I am fairly familiar with the Lynda.com material. I had picked up her Learning Flash 5 CD-ROM and walked away with a feeling that it was money well spent, and that I had come away with a great deal of knowledge about Flash. Now keeping this in mind, when I picked up this title and read through it (mind you unlike some reviewers I read cover to cover), I did not feel like there was too much content that I could walk away with and use in any real world situtation. The techniques she used, produced very amateur-like pages that would not pass for a high school student's work. Mind you, for some of the fundamental HTML concepts the book was good, but for any real world stuff I felt like I was lookig at those pages where you know the person made it in Frontpage 98' without the plug-ins. Any of the cool stuff like the Javascript Rollovers was gone over so rushed and with so little detail, that it would have been better to have omitted it from the book. I am sorry this book just really was not worth the money.. I would look to that HTML Quickstart book over this one any day.</span>

                    <span>I like the idea of combining a designer and a developer to create an HTML book. The "family reunion" at the front of the book is banal and adds nothing to the book, but once by that, it's pretty smooth sailing.<P>What the book successfully does is to show that creating a good Web site is not a matter of simply knowing the code but correctly preparing the graphics and working them into HTML. They use PhotoShop 6, but I was able to fumble through using an older version of PhotoShop and even Fireworks for readying the graphics. The exercises are helpful and simple enough for beginners.<P>Some of the chapters, like one on bullets and horizontal rules was a bit overblown even for beginners. However, the bulk of the book is a gentle path to working with HTML and graphics. The online site (Ducks in a Row) is only so-so design wise, and the CD files needed for the exercises aren't always complete but enough to work through the exercises. The chapter on transparencies in GIF files was excellent and contained lots of good information and exercises.<P>My favorite part of the book lies in the Appendices. The authors compile the tags and their associated attributes in several tables so it is a good reference for later use at a more advanced level. They did not include every Maverick tag and attribute that Netscape and Microsoft like to drop in but stuck with the W3C standard as far as I could see.<P>Overall, when a beginner is finished with this book she'll be ready for intermediate level material for developing Web sites, and if that is the book's goal, it accomplishes it nicely.</span>

                    <span>The book covers all the topics you may encounter while designing a web page, whether it's a simple personal one, or a complex site. The layout of the book is great, it's easy to find everything and includes a comprehensive HTML 4.01 reference. Lots and lots of examples in the book and on the CD, so you see everything in action while you're learning the techniques. Great for both beginners and those with a knowledge of HTML, because it is so comprehensive, you will no doubt find many many things that you haven't learned yet or are not aware of.</span>

                    <span>I did not find this book at all helpful.<P>One major problem is that all the graphics techniques are for users of Adobe Photoshop 6 only. How many beginning web site designers own this particularily expensive piece of software? If you havn't got Photoshop 6, DON'T BOTHER TO BUY THIS BOOK. About half of it will be useless to you.<P>The other half - the coding side - is OK. Just. If you really want to learn HTML, there are other books that explain it more clearly and in greater depth. And Bill and Lynda's attempts to cover more sophisticated topics are so speedy that - in my humble opinion - they might as well not be there.<P>As for Lynda's inimitable style, well,whether you like it or not is a matter of personal taste. But my personal taste is not for twee brother/sister/father trialogues, nor for Lynda's inyerface instructions, as if she were the only begetter of web wisdom.<P>I havn't read her older books, the ones that are apparently well thumbed on every web designer's desks. But this budding web designer has definitely consigned her latest tome to the bottom of her extensive pile.</span>
