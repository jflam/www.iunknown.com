                    <span>This is without a doubt, one of the worst books i've ever read on any math subject.  The examples in the beginning are moderately straight forward and can be followed but as the book progresses the author becomes increasingly stingy with explanations.  The level of straight formula presentation such as in the section on hyperbolic functions is useless.  He presents page after page of formula, with no explanation of use.  At the end of this useless display, he ask how one would derive a new equation from the previous old ones.  Even the explanation given for how to do this is obscure.  Each chapter test the aquired knowledge.  The answer key is no more than a series of a,b,d,e each indicating which multiple choice answer was correct.  He shows NO work for any of the test problems.  All in all, this book has been an extremely frustrating experience.  It hasn't turned me off my desire to learn math but has helped me to realise their are charlatans in the math world.</span>

                    <span>This book presents trigonometry in a relatively informal and understandable way. Emphasis is on the facts, without getting sidetracked in proofs. The drawings are relevant and straightforward. The book is well-organized and proceeds logically from beginning to end. There are some question-and-answer problems in the text (although I'd like to see more) and plenty of multiple-choice test questions with answers in the appendix. The test questions are especially good, because they resemble the standardized tests schoolchildren are forced to take these days. The four-dimentional stuff is cool (but may be over the top for some readers). This book, combined with a standard school textbook, should make high-school students highly proficient in this subject, and get them ready for more advanced courses such as calculus, analysis, and topology.</span>

                    <span>This guy stinks at writing books.  The first ten pages of his book are annoyingly vocabulary intensive.  Rather than spending a little time familiarizing you with the terminology, the author immediately begins using every possible word in his vocabulary forcing you to have to glance at your notes.  He's probably a great math geek, but can't teach if his life depended on it.  Don't bother with this book.</span>

                    <span>I am a math dummy. I bought this book at a local store because it looked like I could maybe understand it. I do. For the first time I feel like I know something about trigonometry. Too many math books are just professors showing each other how smart they are. This book taught me something without making me feel stupid. It's the only trig book I have ever seen like this.</span>
