                    </div>
                    <span>I have been making video games for about 7 years and have reached the top technical position I can at my company.  So I wanted to learn some more about game design.
<br />
<br />I bought 3 books on game design.  The first, I discarded after 5 minutes of browsing as full of common sense and no real meat.  (Be warned - there are lots of books on game design like that out there.)
<br />
<br />Here's really where I think this book is different.  I devoured this book in one siting.  It's interesting and thought provoking, and I honestly came away feeling like I had some more insight into making games.
<br />
<br />High points:
<br />
<br />* Some interesting theories (or perhaps opinions masquerading as theories, but I mostly liked them all) about what is at the heart of a good game.  Why do people "play?"  Why is interactivity so important
<br />* Lots of examples of games he felt had good design, and some analysis of what made them good.
<br />* A list of common mistakes people make when trying to make games.
<br />* A list of game ideas!  He has a list of game ideas he's had that he's never turned into games.
<br />* Plenty of war stories about how some of his games came into being, including the political battles and the evolution of ideas.
<br />* PLENTY of strong opinions.  This guy is opinionated.  He either likes it or he hates it.  I didn't agree with everything he said, but I enjoyed the way in which he pursued his arguments.
<br />* An eye-opener as to just how narrow our industry really is, versus the range of games that we could be making.  This, to me, was the most inspiring.  He basically says that we've dug a hole for ourselves, and will have a hard time climbing out of it and becoming a mass-market medium.  He says that video games we make are primarily making "candy" or "cartoons" to use food or television analgies.  But where's the sandwiches, vegetables, salads, the olives, or the sitcoms, mysteries, dramas, or chick-flicks that would be consumed by a more mature and diverse audience?  I think a light bulb came on for me and I realized how we are all fighting to see who can get the most piece of this little tiny pie, when there are so many other pies.
<br />
<br />He's a bit bitter with the industry, and angry with the path it has taken - he basically says that nothing new has ben done in video games in the past 10 years, which consist of an endless stream of doom-wanna-bes.  As I'm starting to become a more veteran person and some of the newness has worn off and I'm seeking new challenges, I can see how this happened to him.
<br />
<br />All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
<br />
<br />The one negative about this book, is that he is coming from a time when everything was new and games were a lot simpler.  To make a hit game, you took one key idea and ran with it - and the entire game was SO focused on that one idea.  I mean it really was very simplistic.  But that's where the rubber really hits the road, isn't it?  Let's ignore graphics, sound, etc.  The average game today is FAR more complicated than those simple games of 10 years ago.  Even games like SimCity, Civilization, the Sims, Half Life, or GTA3 - which take a new idea and run with it - they are really deep and involved games.  Almost all of his examples are 5 or 10 years old - which sort of makes it hard to apply to today's market.  This is where I think his book leaves you hanging.  Of course, the other design books I've read all suffer from this flaw of putting a bit too much stock in old games and forgetting that with modern games, the devil really is in the details.  Buy this book for inspiration, not for practical advice.

                    <span>One thing I naturally expected from this book was that, like Mr. Crawford's other works, it would be very witty and funny. In that respect, I was greatly disappointed. The book's tone ranges from serious to grim, which actually shouldn't have come as a surprise considering the author's justifiable disappointment and disdain towards the gaming industry. 
<br />
<br />The other unfulfilled expectation I had for this book is that, like Mr. Crawford's previous works, it would at least have some form of loosely defined general thesis driving it. Instead, the topics seem mostly disconnected from each other, and could perhaps be best defined as Chris Crawford's thoughts on his career as game designer. 
<br />
<br />But thoughts, as those familiar with his writings know, are his forte. The expectation that this book unfailingly fulfills is that it be filled with challenging concepts that enrich the thinking of the reader when assimilated, together with a few great practical ideas. 
<br />
<br />As usual, the book does contain quotes from the author's other books or his website, but surprisingly it does not contain several of the concepts that made his first, classic book on game design so valuable. Anyone who is interested in the subject MUST read that book (The Art of Computer Game Design), available on the internet. 
<br />
<br />However, these two taken together are still very far from being a practical manual. Consider the width of Richard Rouses' book on the topic to complement the depth of these two. 
<br />
<br />Definitely a worthwhile read, though we've seen better from Mr. Crawford.

                    <span>This is very personal book. The author shares his experience and knowledge with you, showing you the strenghts and weaknesses of his designs. What is important it looks he always worked alone ( as designer and programmer ), so you can see all the difficulties related with such lonely achievments. From time to time Chris compare his games with Sid's Mayer Civilization (1991), but he do not mention that this game was created by a team of maybe 12-15 people! <br>This book is also a wonderful essay of game development history.<br>How to create a game if processor of your computer does't know how to devide two numbers (there is not such assembler instruction)!<br>Chris also diagnoses that entire game industry is in crisis today. He argue that from quite a long time the most important thing during game creation is not a game itself or the gameplay but just a beatiful graphics! So today, almost every game has beatiful graphics but it is difficult to find any fun while playing! And I agree with him.<br>Game creation is the form of the art. From the other side, the game should be fun for the player. This is very important to keep track on both.</span>

                    <span>Chris Crawford has a reputation in the game industry for being a bit of a nut.  But it is this nuttyness -- or original thinking -- that makes this book worth reading.  Who else but Chris Crawford would list Siboot, his own game, as one of the most important computer games of all time?  <p>Crawford's attacks on the game industry are for the most part accurate, although not always completely fair.  His perspective on what makes an interesting game is unique, and contrary to most of the things that are hyped in this disposable industry.  Not many people see things his way, but not many people have cared about computer games this much for this long.</span>
