                <span id="Label1">The JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies provide a flexible and popular basis for developing dynamic web sites and applications, powered by the Java language.  A wide variety of components, tag libraries, and application frameworks (such as Struts from the Apache Software Foundation) are becoming available, building on this basis and providing much needed functionality.<P> This book is designed to take you from a basic knowledge of the JSP and Servlet technologies to a deeper understanding of how best to implement core web site  features such as dynamic navigation, page layout, and content management; potentially tricky subjects like managing frames are analyzed and the best approach discussed. The approach is pragmatic: where an open source component exists that provides the necessary functionality, we'll show you how best to integrate it into your own applications rather than inventing your own.<P> This book covers:<P> The Apache Struts Framework for Java-based web applications<br> HTTP and frame-management techniques<br> The JSP Standard Tag Library (JSPTL) Early Access release<br> Dynamic navigation and page layout<br> Error handling and logging for web sites<br> Strategies for integration with relational databases and J2EE<br> Security, user management, visitor tracking, and personalization<br> Content management, searching, and portal sites<br> A case study of an XML-based application framework<br> <P></span>

                    <span>It is definitely not a beginner book.<P>But all the chapters are good even though it was written by different authors.<P>The section on refactoring in the beginning set the tone of the book. Good authors. Would recommend this book to anyone working with jsps. Very easy language to understand too. The reason I gave it a 4 is 'coz I understood it more only after I began working with jsps for a while.</span>

                    <span>I hope no one else has the same bad experience as me so this is just a warning. I spent around 20 hours trying to get the example in chapter 2 to work. I've installed apache/tomcat with IIS several times and it has never taken more than a couple of hours -point being figuring out struts shouldn't take very long. After struggling with this book I got another book "Apache Jakarta-Tomcat" and read their 10 page exerpt on struts. The 10 page explination in the Apache book helped me much more than the 63 pages in chapter 2. The explinations were much more clear and the struts frame work was very simple to understand. After reading the apache book I went back through the example found in chapter 2 and found SEVERAL errors in the source code! I wasted a lot of time because I had thought I installed struts incorrectly. It was frustrating to waste so much time just because the source code in chapter 2 was incorrect. If chapter 2 had explained struts more clearly I probably could have caught the errors in the source code. Chapter 2 explains about 500 ideas with no real concrete examples to show you what it's talking about. Then it speeds through an example (that doesn't work) and it doesn't really show you at all how everything is finally tied together.<BR>To be fair, the book does have a disclaimer in the beging which states that it's for more advanced users. So if you aren't very very familiar with struts don't start with this book. Once you get past the struts nightmare the rest of the book is pretty good. I wouldn't say the explinations aren't very good but the ideas they present are very usefull.</span>
