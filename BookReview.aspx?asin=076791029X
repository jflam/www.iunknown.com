                    <span>This is essential reading and a wake up call for women of ALL ages. In fact, this type of book should be required reading for girls in high school. Girls and women should learn to be financially independent/proactive early in life and not expect to be financially dependent upon their parents, partners, families or children. Also, it is reassuring to read that it is NEVER too late to begin saving for retirement and *everything else* This book can not only improve your financial life but your emotional health.</span>

                    <span>This book was recommended by my financial planner, and it is the best book I have read on the subject. I bought it only a couple months ago and have already started to see thousands of dollars in savings. The best thing about the book is that it gives you the confidence to be able to make financial decisions on your own, especially as a woman, for the benefit of the entire family. I would recommend this book for every woman.</span>

                    <span>you need to learn how to save money? if you only have money for one book on the subject, read this one. it's a personal finance 101 and a guide for out of control spenders (like me) on how to take control of your financial future, in a easy to understand and non-patronizing way. suze orman is just as good, so if you already have one of hers, you're set.</span>

                    <span>I just finished this book last week. The information given in this book is priceless and I recommend it to everyone. I am getting married in 3 months and will be giving a copy to each of my bridesmaids. Not just a finance book, it teaches you how to add value to your life and set realistic goals for the future, both immediate and long term. I also purchased Smart Couples Finish Rich to read with my fianc√©.
<br />This is a MUST read to everyone.</span>

                    <span>I'm turning 40 next year, and I've done a fair share of reading/research on retirement planning -- not a lot, mind you, but a fair bit.  Much of it was dry, boring, or just plain incomprehensible.  As a result, my savings and investing were haphazard (at best), and my record keeping was, frankly, pathetic.
<br />
<br />"Smart Women Finish Rich" has motivated me like nothing else has.  I don't know if it's because it's easier to understand and doesn't through a lot of jargon around, or if it's because Bach is so personable and seems genuinely interested in his readers.
<br />
<br />What really lit the fire underneath me though were the various charts he had illuminating the value of compounded interest, using time to your advantage, etc.  Now, this is something we all "know" at the intellectual level, but the way he presented it was enough to get me off my rear and working on putting my financial house in order.
<br />
<br />In the past several days, I have set up my filing system, reviewed my IRA account, requested and reviewed my credit report, opened an account for my "emergency fund" and scheduled automatic deposits, and made a plan for paying down credit card debt.  In the next week I'll get the ball rolling to contribute to my employer's 401(k) and get estate planning done for myself and my husband.
<br />
<br />I can't say enough good things about how this book has helped me put my financial priorities in order.  The reduction in my anxiety level over money is amazing.  Well worth it!</span>
