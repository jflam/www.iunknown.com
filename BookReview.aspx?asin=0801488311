                <span id="Label1">Building successful start-ups was never quite as easy as it seemed, and the changing economic climate has raised the stakes, reduced the margin of error. New entrepreneurs can&#146;t stumble into wealth on the power of half-formed ideas, or turn dreams into reality without doing a lot of homework. It&#146;s time to get smart. This book teaches would-be entrepreneurs the skills they need to get through the venture capital process with companies that will survive to grow and succeed.  <P>Rob Ryan, a pioneer in the high-tech industry, founded Ascend Communications in 1989, and throughout the nineties provided firms with the infrastructure they needed to keep up with the rapid growth of the Internet. At the beginning of 1999, Ascend was sold to Lucent for $25 billion. Since retiring from Ascend and starting Entrepreneur America, Ryan has helped launch a string of successful companies, including Virtmed, RightNow, and Virtual Ink. All provide electronic solutions to real-world problems, meet existing&#151;rather than manufactured&#151;needs, and save their customers time and money.   <P>In Smartups, Ryan focuses on methods he&#146;s developed over the years for building a sustainable business that makes money. He emphasizes the importance of testing ideas on customers and making sure that a product offers something new and important. Recognizing a team&#146;s key competencies is crucial, Ryan says. He also finds it necessary to take certain steps at the correct stages of a company&#146;s inception. Smartups will show you how to turn your idea into a real product, take it to investors, and get your start-up started right.</span>

                    <span>This is the newly released paperback version of Rob Ryan's earlier Entrepreneur America book. Great basic advice from a guy born in the Bronx and nurtured in the Valley who wnet on to found Ascend. Ryan pulls no punches in leading the reader (and his select entrepreneurs) on asking the hard questions about their ideas, companies and products to determine a core value propostion (and if there is one!). Definitely a must-read for anyone wanting to start a new business regardless of whether you've done it once or ten times! (So where's my autographed edition, Rob?)</span>

                    <span>I was ultimately disappointed by this book. It spent too much time emphasizing how incredibly smart a guy Rob Ryan is. It seemed very repetitious. Yes, it is written in a lighthearted style, but overall seemed like it only had enough content for a magazine article. He's been mentioned in Inc. magazine several times, which is what prompted me to buy it, but I didn't really learn that much from the book. One of the least useful of my many books on entrepreneurship. It does have a nice cover.</span>

                    <span>Joining Ascend in 1991 was a risky move for me. Who the heck were they, anyway? <BR>Then I met Rob. <BR>The rest is history. <BR>I've always enjoyed telling that story (usually a much longer and funnier version) to anyone interested in the Ascend tale. <P>The book that we are reviewing here is in typical Rob style. I can not imagine anyone else writing it this way. It's just him. "Do the Dogs like the Dog Food" - if you ever spent any time chatting with Rob, you'd easily guess that this was one of his quips. <BR>Even if I had not read this book (which I have done a few times now), I'd probably still recommend it. Rob was, and still is, an entrepreneurs entrepreneur. <P>I only wish I could find him again in a new guise here in Silicon Valley - and relive those Ascend days.</span>

                    <span>This is nothing more than a renamed paperback version of Rob's 2001 "Entrepreneur America: Lessons from Inside Rob Ryan's High-Tech Start-Up Boot Camp". The origional book gets a 5 star rating from me. (...)this was promoted as a new book, not a new printing with a different name. If you already have the earlier edition, don't waste your money on this one. If you don't, buy it and learn from Rob. My criticism is the lack of disclosure that this is a reprint and the false expectations that were built from the advertising that this actually offered new content from an author I greatly respect and will automatically purchase any of his new books.</span>

                    <span>Rob has managed to create a book which at the same time provides essential advice on how to create a company and is also highly entertaining. He has done a very creative job of producing entertaining metaphors ("keys to the goldmine", "monkeys spinning in the treetops") to elucidate the guidance he provides. Creating a real company requires executing quickly to solve critical problems of fund raising, finding customers, and creating positive cash flow. Rob crisply lays out what needs to be done and points to places where people commonly get lost in trying to build a sucessful business. I wish I had this book when I started my company. The book is extremely engaging and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in entrepreneurship.</span>
