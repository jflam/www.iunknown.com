                <span id="Label1"> Martin Russ's controversial book <I>Breakout: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950</I> tells the riveting story of how 12,000 Army personnel and Marines fought their way out of an encirclement by more than 60,000 Chinese soldiers. A Marine wounded in combat during the Korean War, Russ writes with a passion for the men who endured freezing temperatures and scaled treacherous mountains while continuing to strike the enemy as they advanced toward safety.<p>  While many accounts of modern war bog readers down in a morass of military and administrative details, Russ's history so clearly distinguishes the various units, locations, and personalities that shaped the campaign that it could easily be compared with the finest novels of battle, including  Michael Shaara's <I>The Killer Angels</I>. Expertly moving between American, Chinese, and Korean points of view, Russ argues that the Marines were trapped at Chosin because of the arrogance of Douglas MacArthur, the incompetence of the U.S. Army, and the disciplined planning of the Chinese generals.<p>  Celebrated for his brilliant war memoir,  <I>The Last Parallel</I>, Russ has provoked criticism for his tendency in <I>Breakout</I> to disparage the U.S. Army. However, his quotations of numerous dispatches showing Marine commanders' concern about advancing into the Chosin area, as well as his consistent portrayal of Army officers' ineptitude, lend credence to his argument that it was the particular esprit de corps of the Marines that prevented the disintegration of American forces in the freezing wastes of North Korea. <I>--James Highfill</I></span>

                    <span> This is the story of the chosin reservoir campaign. It lasted for a short time in nov- dec 1950. The Marines were surrounded, outnumbered 50 to 1 and still managed to show that the Marines are the greatest fighting group that the world has ever seen. Low on ammo, medical supplies and in temps. below zero much of the time, the chinese troops still did not stand a chance, they were cut down like so much chaff. "Retreat hell im attacking in another direction"
<br />  This is a must read for everyone! </span>

                    <span>I read this book when it was first released and am astonished at the approach that the author (Martin Russ) decided to take while characterizing the US Army involved in this campaign as well as the scope of his ignorance on the subject.  
<br />
<br />His bias towards the Marines is understandable I suppose, but it pervades the book in such an embarrassing degree that one starts to see that there's really no objectivity here, and the best thing to do is sit back and enjoy this as pulp fiction. The Marines stand tall as always and the army gets its little tush whipped, interspersed with a number of defamatory quotes the origin of which is anyone's guess. 
<br />
<br />I find it strange that this all is being lauded as some sort of historical work of great import when the fact is that there are absolutely no new revelations outside of a few personal stories or author's interpretations, all of which share the core feature that the "research" that supports them is little more, in fact, than a compendium of anecdotes divorced from their original context; either that, or they are anonymous--"The Marine officers don't hide under a bridge like ours do."  He also has no footnotes, which is very interesting.
<br />
<br />Regarding the above quote, it is difficult to imagine such a generalization, as most army officers were killed in combat or were severely wounded.  I would imagine a bridge is a good place under which to seek cover but the plain fact is that the army veterans have spoken highly of their officers; many earned the second highest valor decoration the army can bestow.  A widely admired leader, Lieutenant Colonel Don Faith, was posthumously invested with the Medal of Honor after being killed in close quarters combat at the front of his men.  Through vile innuendo Martin Russ sneers that the colonel wasn't worthy...
<br />
<br />The most mendacious insinuation Russ makes regards the Navy's order to returning Marine and naval personnel to not speak to the media regarding the army's alleged behavior. Truth be told, this order really was issued because some Navy chaplain gave a magazine interview in which he made a number of charges against army units in the Chosin area.  He later was proved wrong and I believe he was court martialed.
<br />
<br />You see, a lie becomes a sort of myth if repeated enough, and a myth becomes a sort of truth...
<br />
<br />Towards the end of the book the charge of collective ineptitude is again leveled at army units, this time during the famous withdrawal to the coast.  Incredibly, army units supposedly snipe at the Marine column they're supposed to be protecting. I spoke with an army officer who was there with the Marine column and who has attmepted to chronicle the events of those days.  He has spoken with a Marine author (not Russ) about that silly charge and the author admitted that it was 50 year old hearsay.  
<br />
<br />50 year old hearsay--that just about sums up Breakout.  No historical revelations or insights, just half-truths, hearsay and some good old interservice hatred that has echoed down throughout the years.
<br />

                    <span>Martin Russ has given us an exceptional work here - the story of 12,000 United States Marines, interwoven with the story of some members of the US Army in the hellish environment of North Korea in late 1950.<p>General MacArthur sent this force of Marines marching North during the Korean war, and they were suddently surrounded by a force of Chinese Communist troops five times their size (this was the first time that American troops had ever fought directly against the Chinese Communists).  Although they were severely outnumbered, and fighting in one of the world's harshest environments, they somehow managed to emerge from this horrible scenario and maintain the honor and dignity that the Marine Corps has demonstrated from day one.<p>Russ gives us a narrative history collected from many interviews conducted with survivors of the campaign and weaves it into the military and tactical struggle faced by these men.  Some of the pictures that he paints are gut-wrenching because of the horrors that these men endured; some cause the reader to smile because of the way that the soldiers faced their lot and overcame such challenging obstacles.  His writing style is crisp & clear, which enables the reader to sympathize with the harshness of the reality that the soldiers faced in North Korea.<p>Without a book like this, the literature on the battles of the Korean War could never be complete.  Russ has ensured that the men who faced the Chinese in the winter of 1950 will never be forgotten.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the humanistic side of the Korean war; it does not delve into the military campaign as much as the people, but it does do justice to the military commanders involved in this series of engagements.</span>

                    <span>This a a book about a bunch of very brave, cold Marines. <br>They got in their situation by poor Generalship by Doug MacArthur and General Almond.  The Marines had been fighting Chinese since the end of October, 100 miles south of the Chinese border. No one believed there were Chinese in any numbers there. Marine General Smith smelled a rat, and in spite of orders to advance quickly, advanced only a mile or so a day, and built supply dumps, and an airstrip at a vital spot. <br>The cold is the story, with temps at 20 and 30 degrees below zero. Machines and weapons would not work. Casualties from frostbite were 6 times the battle wounds. People froze to death.<p>Even when the Chinese attacked at the end of November and sent the 8th Army running for its life, Gen Almond insisted the Marines continue to advance.<br>The author is a Marine writing about Marines. Other than the Army engineers that built a bridge across a chasm to allow the Marines to get back to the coast, he has nothing good to say about the Army. They are incomptentent fools that deserved to die. The Army Col that got the Medal of Honor in this fight did not deserve it.<br>Chesty Puller is here, making statements that make headlines.<br>Col Ben Davis is here, making a cross country (mountain) trek to reinforce a Lt McCarthy, who is holding a key pass that will allow the Marines to get to the Coast.<p>The Marines fought off somewhere between 7 and 9 divisions, inflicting thousands of casualties. The Chinese too, suffered from the cold. They wore tennis shoes, and when they attacked, the Marines could hear their frozen feet clacking on the ground, as the Chinese feet were solid blocks of ice.<p>The ROK soldiers involved were people that had been kidnapped off the street for the Korean Army, and had no military training. They were useless.<br>The civilians, as usual suffered the most, getting killed by both sides.<p>Gen Smith never did say "Retreat Hell, We're just advancing the other way!". He said, "Heck, wer are just advancing the other way."  The reporters improved on it.<p>As other reviewers have noted, it is a very biased book, and others should be read to get a balanced story.<p>Be in a warm place when you read the book. It is a story about incredible cold and bravery</span>

                    <span>I've read "Breakout" (having an interest in this campaign), and the book essentially is a platform for the author's opinion, disguised as history, which actually is not uncommon.  My main gripe with the book deals with the warped portrayal of the army units invoved, which is shaped by two things: 1) attitude/bias of the author, and 2) sources (or lack thereof).
<br />
<br />Author Martin Russ's outlook understandably stems, at least in part, from his own service in the Marines.  But Breakout is a case of an author writing to an idea.  This is evident by periodic fragmentary glimpses into the ordeal fo the US Army on the east side of the reservoir, and their eventual doom.  This kind of cherry-picking has absolutely no credibility in any work of this sort, and coupled with evident shoddy "research" should relegate a book to adventure novel status. Russ also has no footnotes, and insinuates that research was involved due to a modest bibliography, the books of which actually rebuts all of his silly accusations. He mentions various interviews, all unnamed.
<br />
<br />Russ never mentioned the 1/11th Marines' loss of eight 155 howitzers when they gave way to panic and abondoned them;  if this had been an army unit you'd better believe it would have been in the book.
<br />
<br />One of the things which apparently hasen't fazed Russ is the very real revelation by Chinese records (before his book was published) that the army task force in question was not up against one Chinese infantry division of unknown strength, but two full strength divisions and probably part of a third, which totals at least 20,000 enemy troops - troops who were en route to finish off the marine garrison.  These troops were very harshly received by the army and the divisions were rendered combat-ineffective. Russ states that he is forced to agree in part with an army historian that the army's plight enabled the marines to survive, but concludes that this was so only in the form of a sacrificial lamb. This is not so. Sacrifical lambs do not fight back inflicting thousands of casualties.  But the number of Chinese involved is a crucial element to the story and has actually helped bring about a favorable change in many marines' attitudes.  That's not good enough for Martin Russ, though.
<br />
<br />US Marine forward air controller Captain Ed Stamford is presented as being the only pillar of strength in this mob of men to which he was attached, and is described as being the one marine in the campaign who forgives them for their incompetence. (Captain Stamford currently is listed as a member of the Army Chapter of the Chosin Few, but no matter). As Russ only quotes a few of Stamford's statements which originally appeared in two works, I submit he was never interviewed by Russ.  He also cites a flawed work on Chosin in his bibliogrphy that relied on a phony interview which Stamford himself angrily condemns.  This is one source of the curious negative portrayal in "Breakout" and is partly why legions of casual readers on the subject think the US Army behaved in a less than honorable manner. But Russ misses the whole point:  Stamford was actually there...
<br />
<br />One has to ask himself what he would have done or could have done, after fighting to the last bullet in -20F weather, dealing hard blows against a numerically superior enemy, many times in close quarters combat, until all hope was gone.  Not a few heroes died there, many of them with empty weapons defending the wounded who had been brought out, despite the contemptible accusation to the contrary in "Breakout".
<br />
<br />As Lt. Colonel Jack Nolan USMC (ret) stated at the Chosin Few army chapter reunion, "Had you not done your job I would not be here today."</span>
