                    <span>Although confrontation is difficult for many people, it is often necessary. Failure to confront someone over bad behavior may be misinterpreted as approval. Confrontations can help bring people back to a better, more productive course. However, confrontations also can go off track and become shouting matches (or worse). Authors Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler outline a method for approaching confrontations when the stakes are particularly high; those are the crucial confrontations. Boiled down to its essentials, the methodology consists of focusing on facts, remaining calm, listening to the other person with respect and working to motivate the other person and to enable a change in behavior. The book is light, anecdotal and easy to read. Yet, we find that it offers so much sound advice that any manager, parent or spouse could find something useful.</span>

                    <span>If you have read Crucial Conversations, then you are already very familiar with this book and its contents. The fact is, this book is a re-hashing of Crucial Conversations; however, this time, the principles shared seem more applicable than they were before.
<br />I think that this book is the real and better application of the authors' main principles. It is an easy and quick read and the language is very simple and direct. The book discusses ways to have a confrontation in which results are gained and friendships are not lost. It is a win-win approach. I do believe that this book can and does help. I did not particularily like the Crucial Conversations because it wasn't real earth shattering and seemed to simple. This time, however, the subject of "confrontations" seems more open to the authors' intentions-- thus a better read. 
<br />This is a good book to read and a better book to apply.

                    <span>Crucial Confrontations is the perfect companion book to its predecessor Crucial Conversations. Both are indispensable tools in creating a culture of performance. With its universally applicable principles and practical skills for resolving broken promises, violated expectations and bad behavior, it provides the diagnostic keys to unbundling seemingly complex issues that hold individuals, teams and organizations at a distance from their preferred futures. Beyond the welcome relief that comes from just cracking the code on a performance or relationship issue - these tools actually have the power to "knock people into gear" by making visible some of the long-term (seemingly invisible) costs associated with more typical coping or carping strategies. Without exaggeration, the skills that are suggested during a Crucial Confrontation entitled: Make it Motivating and Make it Easy can literally "change the chemistry" of the interaction to make closing the gap between what's expected and what's delivered a reality.</span>

                    <span>This book has helped me to enter the sometimes scary world of teenage children. It gave me skills to keep "in dialogue" with my children even when confronting them on "bad behavior, broken promises, or failed expectations." Since first reading this book, I have practiced these skills and am getting better with my practice. I love the concept of keeping the conversation "safe". Its amazing that I can confront my children on issues that before they would blow up, but now we are able to agree and see things the same way. I love to end with the question - Do you see it the same way, or have I missed something? This helps them to know that I really have their best interests at heart. This book is a must-read for parents, teachers, employers, and employees. It has helped me to better my relationships in all aspects of my life.

                    <span>I surprised myself by reading almost the entire book during a two-week trip to Thailand w.  The authors do a great job of showing how NOT stepping up has allowed catastrophic consquences to result.  For example, the co-pilot who chose not to speak up when the pilot was preparing to take off in freezing weather with ice building up on the wings.  All that survived was the cockpit tape that has the copilot hinting at the danger and not taking a powerful stand with the pilot.  Our circumstances are not likely to be that drastic, but it is really very serious business.
<br /> 
<br />I like that the book recognizes that speaking up can be risky and talks about how to make reasonably sure that you won't hurt your career or relationship when you choose to speak up.  
<br /> 
<br />The keys to managing the conversation so you don't get off in the weeds and get a valuable result begin with stepping back for a moment and remembering how you got to your reaction.  The authors say we start by seeing or hearing something, draw come conclusions, react and then take action.  If you review what exactly are the facts you started with and what are the interpretations or conclusions you came to, you are free to share it as a story the other person can understand.  If you speak as if your conclusions are facts, you can lose the rapport you need to have a good outcome.
<br /> 
<br />I like the question the authors suggest asking yourself to get to how to start a conversation that doesn't amount to an attack:  "What would cause a reasonable, rational and decent person to act like this?"  Answering that question puts me in a frame of mind to begin with an attitude of mutual respect.
<br /> 
<br />The other major key for me that I got out of the book is realizing that when someone does react badly during a conversation like this is that two key safety issues could be percieved as missing:  mutual respect and mutual purpose.  If you are ready to restore a sense of mutual respect and mutual purpose, then you can get back out of the weeds of someone reacting in ways you don't intend or that surprise you.
<br /> 
<br />Providing a way of knowing what to do if things go wrong in the conversation is key to my being willing to take on having the conversation in the first place.  Most people just keep quiet and there is a cost to that.  Some people hold back until they blow up and that doesn't work very well either.
<br /> 
<br />That is my three paragraph teaser about the book.  I like that the book is based on over 20 years of studying people who excell at this type of conversation and distilling how they do it.
