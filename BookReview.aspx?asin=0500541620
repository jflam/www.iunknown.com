                    <span>France is the most beautiful place on earth--bar none. But different regions of France have such different characteristics and there is a lot more to this wonderful country than Paris, Dijon, Nice, etc. In The Most Beautiful Villages of France, you'll discover gorgeous photographs of little, out-of-the-way towns and villages that will bring you new and unexpected delights. For those lucky enough to actually visit France, this book is definitely a must-have. For those who can only dream, there is no better way! In my opinion, The Most Beautiful Villages of Burgundy, The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence and The Most Beautiful Villages of Tuscany are equally well done. Don't leave home without them!</span>

                    <span>For those who would like to travel, to find somewhere in the world for living for a while, to take a rest, to walk with someone you love, you would just determine to choose that place once you've read the brief depiction and viewed those fantastic pictures in this book. The first time I saw that book was almost seven years ago, the images of those pictures/ photographs showing in this book could not help but drive me to that area through the time tunnel. I have been introxicated by the photos with the authors' brief description. However, I believe that the only way to have that kind of feeling is to visit this place following the guide suggested by the author. May be you could discover some other unbelieveable area within this romantic place in the world.</span>

                    <span>Although every picture is astoundingly beautiful, there is one of the home where Andre Breton lived that really takes my breath away. I find myself turning back to it whenever I need an escape. When friends come over, they always ask to see the books in this series. It is worth the price. Also, check out Most Beautiful Villages of Provence and Burgundy. I thought the Tuscany one could have been a little better, but still check it out.</span>
