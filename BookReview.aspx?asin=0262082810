                <span id="Label1">For anyone learning the Scheme programming language, the second edition of <I>Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer Science</I> provides a very digestible textbook-style introductory tutorial to this powerful and elegant language.<p> In the words of the authors, <I>Simply Scheme</I> is designed to be a "prequel" to another book, <I>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</I>. This latter title has been a staple of introductory computer science courses for years, but it assumes a certain background. <p> <I>Simply Scheme</I> works hard to make the somewhat tricky ideas of Scheme accessible. This tutorial stresses small sections on key language features, from basic functions, variables, and onward to recursion and other functional programming concepts. While languages like C++ and Java use objects to model data, Scheme programmers break a problem down into functions. The art--and elegance--of problem solving in Scheme comes from applying recursion and other design concepts.<p> Longer code samples in the book include a tic-tac-toe game, examples that work with poker and bridge, and a working spreadsheet demo. Throughout, the book employs a friendly and jargon-free approach to programming. This book is as much about <I>thinking</I> like Scheme as it is about the basic nuts and bolts of the language. Sections on using software patterns in Scheme help bring this new edition up to date.<p> Though not often used in business, Scheme and its cousin Common Lisp (which the book describes in an appendix) are still favored by computer scientists, for example, in artificial intelligence research. <I>Simple Scheme</I> succeeds in making a difficult programming language both approachable and accessible. It's a valuable resource to any computer science student who is taking Scheme on for the first time. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Scheme language fundamentals, functions and higher-order functions, variables, lambda basics, recursion, abstraction, software patterns in Scheme, lists, trees, sequential programming, working with files, vectors, Common Lisp.</span>

                    <span>The extra star is for the excessive effort these guys had to put in for what they did. It was not very effective. The biggest problem of this book is that it's full of confusing explanations the designers hoped would be "heuristic." This problem permeates the work from start to finish. The use of the special commands by the authors, not part of standard scheme, makes very little sense in most classroom settings that teach Scheme in the hopes of teaching functional programming. The whole idea of functional programming is that you have a bare group of essential concepts AND commands, and work your way from there. I had the great misfortune of taking a class where we weren't allowed to use the specially designed scheme commands for this book, but still had to buy it. If you are in that predicament, the book is completely worthless. Furthermore, while I admire the author's desire to prepare people for SICP, their treatment of this task borders on arrogance. At one point they actually suggest that "SICP was designed for MIT students" and that the rest of us aren't worthy of it yet. Quite frankly for anybody willing to take the time, SICP is not as terrifying as these guys make it out to be. This is a weak book.</span>

                    <span>Scheme itself is a terse declarative programming language with few (more likely zero) industrial uses. However the important and fundamental concepts in computer science are well demonstrated by the authors here. The book does serve fairly well as preparation for SICP but if that is the books purpose then the authors may as use raw mathematical predicates which is alot easier to read than Scheme code. The library code provided by the authors is vital for doing the exercises and coding<p>without these is not considered making the book a weak reference manual. The book is also too long for a single semester course which means you may as well undertake Knuth's volumes if you are in a long course.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in preparation for a computer science cource (taught by  one of it's authors). I chose the book because the course was taught in  Scheme, and I had not encountered the language before. I must say that this  is an excellent book. While it may use some non-standard extensions to the  language, in general, it does a good job of teaching Scheme. I feel that  after I read the book, I was thorougly prepared to read SICP, the main text  in my comp sci course. The non-technical and sometimes humorous style made  Simply Scheme an easy reading, and allowed me to concentrate on the  concepts rather than the jargon.</span>

                    <span>"Simply Scheme" is certainly an excellent introductory book on programming in general. I bought it for learning Scheme, though, and was disappointed. Most of this book deals with Scheme extensions written by the authors - you have to load a library file to run them. Towards the end of  the book, genuine Scheme features are introduced and their relations with  the author's extensions are explained - but this was not enough to make me  feel familiar with the Scheme language. The book is nicely written, and  100% recommended for beginning programmers, but not for people with  programming experience who want to learn a new language.</span>

                    <span>A great book to start you off with Scheme, and functional programming. The approach is slightly different from most other Scheme introductory texts, and that makes this book an ideal sequel for all those students that were  exposed to Logo as their first programming language. (By this I don't mean  those that used turtle to draw nice shapes on the screen, but rather those  that have read author's Logo books.) Brian Harvey starts off by introducing  Logo procedures into Scheme (word, sentence, first, butfirst...), but don't  let this mislead you into thinking that the book is trivial. Book slowly  builds up to a spreadsheet and database projects. Full of interesting  examples, and very witty. Five chapters on recursion are a gem.</span>
