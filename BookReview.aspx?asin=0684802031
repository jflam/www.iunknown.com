                <span id="Label1">What are the most important things in your life? Do they get as much care, emphasis, and time as you'd like to give them? Far from the traditional "be-more-efficient" time-management book with shortcut techniques, <I>First Things First</I> shows you how to look at your use of time totally differently.  Using this book will help you create balance between your personal and professional responsibilities by putting first things first and acting on them. Covey teaches an organizing process that helps you categorize tasks so you focus on what is important, not merely what is urgent. First you divide tasks into these quadrants: <ol> <LI>Important and Urgent (crises, deadline-driven projects) <LI> Important, Not Urgent (preparation, prevention, planning, relationships) <LI> Urgent, Not Important (interruptions, many pressing matters) <LI> Not Urgent, Not Important (trivia, time wasters)</ol><p> Most people spend most of their time in quadrants 1 and 3, while quadrant 2 is where quality happens. "Doing more things faster is no substitute for doing the right things," says Covey. He points you toward the real human needs--"to live, to love, to learn, to leave a legacy"--and how to balance your time to achieve a meaningful life, not just get things done. <I>--Joan Price</I></span>

                    <span>With due respect to Roger and Rebecca, who are unsung heroes in the Covey pantheon, this book is probably the most helpful of Covey's works with regards to clarity and transferance into application.
<br />
<br />I loved the 7 Habits but wasn't sure where to start.  This book helped - the mission statement workshop, the six step process, Win/Win Agreements.  Truly transformational.</span>

                    <span>While the information in this book is still relevant and helpful, it's basically a rehash of much of the information covered in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Some of the ideas about mission statements and priorites are discussed more thoroughly and there is more specific information on time management like handling the "big rocks" in your week, but overall it seemed like a review. If you haven't read '7 Habits,' then it's a very useful approach to time management and setting the priorities in you life.</span>

                    <span>This book makes a great addition to The 7 Habits. First Things First is as the title indicates a book about time management. But more than that, about people management. It's about social skills and so much more.<p>Whether you like Covey or not, this book will impact your life. A highly recommended book to succeed in the new millenium.</span>

                    <span>USA Today said that Stephen Covey is the hottest self-improvement consultant to hit U.S. business since Dale Carnegie and I agree. Covey is the best.<p>In First Things First, Covey discloses powerful time management techniques. What makes this book different from typical time management books and programs is that Covey shows you how to see the whole picture rather than tiny fragments of our lives. <p>Before reading and applying the techniques in First Things First, I would always lament<p>"I have too much to do---and not enough time to do it."<br>"I can't balance my personal life with my business life."<br>"There is too little of me and too much to do."<br>"I don't feel in controlof my life."<br>"Why do I feel so empty all the time."<p>What you won't find in this book is another daytimer program or another clock. Covey explains why it is more important to know where you are heading instead of how fast you are going. You won't find the old theory of working harder, faster, smarter and more, more, more. It's about effectiveness, not efficiency. And most importantly, it really works.<p>Thank you Dr. Covey!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>When I read this book, the movie, Princess Bride, came to mind.  In it, Vizzini, one of the characters in that movie, uses the word "inconceivable" repeatedly.  Eventually, another character in the movie, challenges him by saying:  "You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means."  Such is the book, First Things First, but the word here is "paradigm."<p>This is not an easy book to read; in fact, it could possibly induce a mild coma in the careless reader.  At the least, it should come with a warning about operating heavy machinery afterwards.  The difficult style is a result of having three authors.  There are places in the book which begin "Stephen:" or "Roger:" or "Rebecca:" Other sections of the book bear no such introduction, insinuating the three are speaking in chorus; and then, there are passages which appear to have been authored by various acquaintances of theirs.  This disorienting method of writing severely detracts from the already fragile quality of information in the book.  If you are writing a book and need two people to help you write it, you need to either change subjects or find a different partner.<p>The book is not completely lacking value though.  Chapters, Four through Eight, offer a decent time management system for those individuals who need to start somewhere; and Appendix A is an excellent resource for drafting a personal mission statement.  Otherwise, the core information is hopelessly out of date by twenty-five years.  The authors might be shocked to learn some of us are already using "sixth-generation paradigms" and are looking for something better.  Really!  Besides, if you are busy counting paradigms, you do not need to read a time management book much less write one.</span>
