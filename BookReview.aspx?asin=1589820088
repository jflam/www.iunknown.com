                    <span>I came across this book after thinking about retiring at age 51. It had good reviews so I thought why not. At that time there was none in stock and I had to wait at least 4 weeks to get a hold of a copy. It was definitely worth the wait! I found it to be very encouraging and sensible. 
<br />There is a lot to this book that will benefit anybody thinking about retirement now or in the future. Even if you never plan on retiring there is plenty of financial advice that makes it worthwhile. I've read many financial books and the author tells it as good or better than most. He definitely has a knack for writing and can hold your interest while teaching you what real financial planning should be.
<br /> I especially liked the window into the author's (Larry Ferstenou) and his wife Kris's life to show how they did it, what retirement is like for them, and what you should plan on in retirement both financially and psychologically. 
<br />Definitely worth getting, reading, and then keeping as a reference.

                    <span>I am re-reading Larry's book, this time with a highlighter in hand.  This book is for those of you love work (or hate it) but love free time and what you do with it much, much more.  I had the opportunity to take 6 months off in 2004 and to quote one of my favorite movies for my generation "Office Space": 'I did nothing today and it was everything I thought it could be'.
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong I am working like a dog right now and investing aggressively in stocks, IRA's, 401K, real estate (land and rentals) all with the goal of being done at 45.  Now I migght still work, but think of the freedom to not have to, or to work at Home Depot if it floats your boat.  If you are reading other books on getting rich... read this one and redefine "rich"</span>

                    <span>I've read numerous books on investing, living simply and living below your means.  This is probably one of the best because the author shares his real life experience of how he and his wife were able to retire young - without a ton of money. He also does a very good job explaining the importance of financial self discipline, saving early and hard and gives solid advice and direction for how to invest your hard earned money.  I found the book extremely motivating and was happy to get reassurance that I was on the right track.

                    <span>As a veteran reader of frugal, tightwad and financial books, I was more than impressed by this book.  It is not only a great book on the subject but very well written and easy to understand.  The chapters on investing are especially good and Mr. Ferstenou's take on the Social Security system confirmed my personal views as well.  The book also provides a wealth of resources and a good bibliography as well!</span>

                    <span>Larry Ferstenou got my attention right away by mentioning two books that everyone who wants to retire early should read: Paul Terhorst's Cashing in on the American Dream and Joe Dominguez's Your Money or Your Life. He also talks about a few dozen other books that can help in your goal of early retirement, but those two are must-reads.<p>Ferstenou has written a good how-to book on retiring early, but if you are the sort of person who has figured out that you want to quit the rat race and live life at your own speed, you probably don't need a book. You have probably already crunched the numbers and figured out what you have to do. What this kind of book does is let you know that there are others out there who have done it already. It's kind of a pep talk to let you know that it's possible and that there are several ways to get there. And you probably don't need as much money as you think.<p>As a pep talk, You Can Retire Young! is excellent. Ferstenou has included plenty of nuts and bolts advice to reassure you that you are on the right path and also has an upbeat attitude that makes it easy reading. He gives resources, such as books and web sites, and cites examples from his own experience. By the time you are finished, you feel confident that you can do it, too.<p>In my opinion, you can get all the information you need to retire early from the Terhorst and Dominguez books, along with Elaine St. James's Simple Living and Amy Daczyczn's Tightwad Gazette. But you may need an extra dose of motivation now and then along the way, and You Can Retire Early! is one of the better books on the subject.</span>
