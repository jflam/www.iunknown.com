                    <span>I initially purchased this book based on the fact that it covers both design issues and Dreamweaver MX techniques.  Don't get me wrong, this is a tool book that focuses on Dreamweaver.  However, it features far more design related info/discussion than almost any other tool book that I've run across.  First off, the whole first chaper related to design issues (designing intuitive navigation, information design and architecture, the produciton process, etc.).  On top of that, throughoutthe book you'll find "Design Reminders" that bring important design issues to light in the context of the Dreamweaver techniques discussions.<p>So, to say that ths book "is just baout the steps" (like one of the other reviews posted) is complete craziness.<p>The bottom line is that Dreamweaver MX: Design and Technique is a great book for those wanting to either get started with Dreamweaver MX or further their skills with the program.</span>

                    <span>This book walks through the features of Dreamweaver MX and shows some impressive things that others have done with it.<br>I didn't see any discussion of design principles or techniques. In short, this was a complete waste. If you can't read on-line help, perhaps you will benefit. If you can and want to learn about website design using Dreamweaver, look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I must say, I bought this book on the strength of the glowing reviews everyone here has given this book and all I can say after 3 months with it, I'm giving up and buying something else. Yes, the book is clearly written, but if you are an absolute novice like me, the "WHY's" of what you are doing are missing. The book explains in detail this step and that step but WHY are you doing it? The author does not show the final outcome of your actions. Therefore, your exercises have no meaning. So many computer software books are written this way today by people who expect the reader to know something about what they are trying so desperately to learn in the first place. My advice to them: lighten up, come down to earth like the rest of us. If you have something to say, say it with purpose. Put yourself in the place of the people who are actually buying your books. Very disturbing. MUST TO AVOID IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER.</span>

                    <span>Its been a long time since I've come across a computer book as good as Dreamwevaer MX: Design and Technique.  It has great introductory/intermediate coverage of Dreamweaver - working with text, images, hyperlinks, tables, frames, library items, tempaltes, site management tools, bahaviors, CSS, layers, timeline tool, and dynamic site sutff.  <p>However, I think the best thing about this book is the way its written.  The author writes in a really understandable informal style which is neither too complicated, nor too simple.  I know it sounds silly, but when you read this book, it feels like the auther is right there in the room with you having a nice discussion.  <p>The content is well structured and very logical.  The primary method of instruction is step-by-step.  You get walked through the process of creating, doing, and designing.  In the last section of the book (intro to creating dynamic sites), you have the opportunity of doing a more lengthy "real world" project.<p>I can't recommend the book enough...go out and buy it and I garuntee you'll be happy.</span>

                    <span>Dreamweaver MX: Design and Technique is hands down, the best introductory/intermediate Dreamweaver MX book I've ever read.  It covers the whole gambit, from the most simple page creation stuff to an introduction to creating dynamic pages.  Along the way, the author covers images, tables, frames, library items and tempaltes, site managament, CSS, layers, behaviors, and the timeline tool.  On top of this, the first chapter in the book is pure web design topics..no Dreamwever, just design stuff (like information architecture, designing intuitive navigation, storyboarding, etc.).  This is something that is definitely lacking from many Dreamweaver books.<p>I can't say enough good about the book.  Its writetn well - targeted at the intro and intermediate market.  Its fun and easy to read, and can be used as a comprehensive course or a solid reference.</span>
