                    <span>I got this book so I could get up to speed with C# and the whole OO philosophy.  It contains a lot of material but is a very dry read.  I found the Learning C# by Smiley a much more entertaining read and covered basically the same material.</span>

                    <span>Hopeful that this book off the Microsoft press would give me a quick start into the new C sharp language, I was disappointed to find this a flat.  It fails to effectively address the large audience of Visual Basic, Delphi, and C++ programmers migrating to C#.
<br />
<br />Most of the book is simplistic and tries to teach the reader how to "think like a programmer."  The problem is that many people learning C# are already familiar with programming to some degree.  In addition, this book desperately needs some larger code examples to give the reader an overall perspective, such as a few brief sample programs.  A "quick reference" section of the book would be most helpful.  This book also sticks purely to the C# language, and does not discuss anything about the compiler or the Visual Studio .NET environment.  I am still clueless about some of Visual Studio's automated behavior.
<br />
<br />People learning how to write for the first time will find this book an easy to understand introduction to programming.  People migrating to C# from other languages will be disappointed.  If you do decide to buy this book, I recommend getting a Sam's Teach Yourself C# book in addition so that you have a good reference.</span>

                    <span>Charles Petzold does an excellent job of introducing C#, the latest OOP from Microsoft.  The book is not for an advanced programmer - you would be disappointed if you thought this was a 300 level book, but it does say it right in the name.  
<br />
<br />What this book does that C# Step by Step does not do is it explains, very clearly, why you are doing what you are doing. It doesn't get bogged down in step 14 of 30.  Petzold patiently explains what placeholders are in Console.Writeline() and why they're so useful.  He carefully takes you from something you know to something you wish you knew and then explains the how's and why's of everything.  His style is almost as if he were talking to you.  He uses phrases like "Check this out" to make the reading livelier.  I can almost feel his enthusiasm for C# coming off the pages.  
<br />
<br />If you know C, C++, Java or maybe even Visual Basic this book may be too basic for your needs.  But if you're interested in learning C# as a first language this is a great book.

                    <span>Looking for an introduction to C#, I read the reviews here and decided to purchase this book.  Unlike a couple of other reviewers here, I already own a DICTIONARY, and so I am aware of what the words PRIMER and ASPIRING mean.  Those looking for a book about programming .NET should buy a book titled something like, "Programming .NET." Those looking for a book about using Visual Studio.NET should buy a book titled something like, "Using Visual Studio.NET."  A book titled, "Programming In The Key Of C# - A Primer For Aspiring Programmers" should present a primer for aspiring programmers.  Gee, go figure.<p>Through the years, I have programmed in C, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, Visual Basic, Delphi, various scripting languages in both the Unix and Windows worlds, Cold Fusion, PHP, and Active Server Pages.  I wanted to learn C# from the lowest level and move upward from there so I would have a complete understanding of the language as I move towards my final goal of programming Windows and ASP.NET using C#.  Having reviewed the TABLE OF CONTENTS made available here, it was easy to tell that this book would be the primer I was looking for.  A previous reviewer claims that this book didn't teach him enough about C# syntax.  The syntax in C#, although similar to most other object-oriented languages, is unique to C#.  This whole book teaches C# syntax, and also goes into a fair amount of detail of how structures, objects, classes, etc. are handled internally in the computer, and by the C# compiler.  I know there is another book written by Anders Hejlsberg which is a most complete coverage of the C# syntax, and I will probably end up buying that book as well to use as a reference.  To begin learning C#, however, I wanted to begin in a very comfortable and basic place.  I have finished this book, I have purchased and am reading a book on programming Windows with C#, and when I am finished with that book, I will buy a new book that is more specific to programming ASP.NET.  I will probably buy books specific to ADO.NET, and who knows what else as I become aware of new complexities that I would like to understand.<p>As a book about learning the basics of programming in C#, Mr. Petzold's book delivers on just what the title implies.</span>

                    <span>If I were a beginning programmer, I would give this book 4.5 stars.  I gave this book a poor rating because it does not clearly state its intended audience, which are beginning programmers.  It is NOT intended for those who already are proficient at another language (C,C++,Java, etc.) to learn how to program in C# and .NET.  It was too basic and didn't teach me enough about C# syntax nor how to use the Visual Studio .NET environment (it included it's own compiler). <p>The title should have read "Learn to Write Your First Programs, a C# Experience!", or something of that nature.</span>
