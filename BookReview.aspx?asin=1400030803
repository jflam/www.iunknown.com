                <span id="Label1">When Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s efforts to &#8220;open up&#8221; China took root in the late 1980s, Xinran recognized an invaluable opportunity. As an employee for the state radio system, she had long wanted to help improve the lives of Chinese women. But when she was given clearance to host a radio call-in show, she barely anticipated the enthusiasm it would quickly generate. Operating within the constraints imposed by government censors, &#8220;Words on the Night Breeze&#8221; sparked a tremendous outpouring, and the hours of tape on her answering machines were soon filled every night. Whether angry or muted, posing questions or simply relating experiences, these anonymous women bore witness to decades of civil strife, and of halting attempts at self-understanding in a painfully restrictive society. In this collection, by turns heartrending and inspiring, Xinran brings us the stories that affected her most, and offers a graphically detailed, altogether unprecedented work of oral history.</span>

                    <span>Once I started reading, I could not stop until I finished it. The true stories of the lives, experiences, pain and suffering of the women described by the author are unforgettable. I am a second generation Chinese American, raised in Chinatown in Los Angeles. I was raised watching movies from China and Hong Kong where the stories were always about the suffering of unnoticed, unappreciated women. I have always been grateful that I was not born in China. Members of my family had to live through the nightmare of the "Cultural Revolution" and my aunt who was persecuted and sent to the countryside for "reeducation" because she was the daughter of a merchant, died as a result of starvation and neglect.<BR>The only criticism I have of the book is the relentlessness of the sadness and misery of these women's lives. It makes the reading hard work. I hope the author is encouraged to share more true stories that are not always so tragic and depressing.</span>

                    <span>These true accounts of life in communist China for women will sadden, amaze, and make you realise freedom is not just a vague ideal but something we take for granted daily.<BR> <BR>This novel is an emotive collection of stories from Xinran, a radio broadcaster in China. For years in China she had a program which encouraged women to talk about their lives. The political minefield she uncovered is recounted through her own story, which is interwoven through the heartbreaking tales of her listeners. Tales of rape, forced marriages, separation from parents and other forms of cruelty are vividly recounted in a voice that is appealing for its honesty and simplicity. <P>Personally, I felt that such a book is important to read because freedom is something you take for granted until you see the consequences of its loss.</span>

                    <span>This startling collection of stories offers a remarkable insight into the lives of women in the country that threatens to become the most powerful in the world in the 21st century. Communism promised equality for all in China, but like all political systems it is no match for traditions and customs that have lasted for thousands of years. These stories painfully explore what happens when the modern and the traditional collide, crushing women in the middle.<P>Living in a culture where revealing the most personal aspects of our lives on TV is a daily occurance, it is hard to envision how revolutionary Xinran's radio show "Words on the Night Breeze" was in China. For the first time, women had an anonymous way to tell their stories to the world, and what spilled out was heartbreaking. There were stories of true disaster, like the mothers who suffered through a devastating earthquake and watched their families swallowed up whole. But these things happen in every country. Much more disturbing to me were the stories of arranged marriages by party officials--in this nation of "comrades," a woman still has no choice but to stay with a husband who is lord and master, and treats her much as her female ancestors must have been treated long ago. Or the story of the young girl who is abused for years by her father--when her mother finds out about it she is told to put up with it to avoid angering him! Stories about the massive cruelties of the Cultural Revolution abound--I never cease being surprised and shocked at the pain this country visited on itself during the rule of Mao in the 1960's.<P>Surely things are changing, one asks. But after reading about the university student I wasn't so sure. Women in university are the cream of the crop. But Xinran is shocked to learn that many choose what sounds like a new twist on an ancient tradition--they become "personal secretaries" to high powered businessmen, some foreigners, who need help navigating the Chinese system. They are totally cynical and businesslike, and view these relationships as a way to earn money and security. Woe to the woman who falls in love with her boss, however--she is cut off as cleanly as a concubine might have been abandoned in ancient times. <P>This is a painful, sobering book. Progress and freedom are elusive concepts, and again and again after reading of other parts of the world, I realize how lucky Americans are that we got to "start fresh" a mere 200+ years ago. This is a wonderfully written book, well deserving of 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>The Good Women of China is wonderful collection of vignettes that each give the reader a glimpse of what it is like to must have been like to be a woman in modernizing China. Xinran met each of these women through her radio show. Each of their stories paints a painful picture of the hardships that they continue to face throughout their day-to-day living. <BR> However, in the chapter "What Chinese Women Believe", I was sad to see "Falun Gong" so inaccurately portrayed, as I knew that her words would affect readers, who may not ever read another source. I am a Swedish reader and I have practiced Falun Gong for two years now. Falun Gong is a popular qigong practice that people do in over 60 countries worldwide. It is based on the values of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. As I understand it, the aim of the practice, as explained by the founder, Li Hongzhi, is to do your best to embody these three principles everyday and in everything you do. The practice has truly changed my heart and I feel that I have become a much kinder and considerate person as a result. My health has also vastly improved as a result of practicing it.<BR> Unfortunately, practitioners in China are currently suffering terrible persecution, as I write this, because the number of practitioners rose to between 70 and 100 million by 1998 (almost a thirteenth of China's current population). Jiang Zemin, former Chinese leader, after failing to win popularity similar to those of his predecessors, Mao Ze Dong and Deng Xiao Ping, initiated the persecution out of jealousy at Falun Gong's popularity, vowing to "Defame their reputations, bankrupt them financially and destroy them physically." <BR> The US government has already passed two resolutions condemning the persecution (H.Con. Res. 118 & 503). Jiang is now facing lawsuits in 13 different countries for "genocide and crimes against humanity," as are several of his main "accomplices", including Luo Gan, head of China's gestapo-like "6-10 Office." <BR> The inaccuracies in the woman's account are likely due to the lack of accurate information regarding the practice in China in general. Since the persecution began in July 1999, the state-run media has been utilized to vilify Falun Gong on a daily basis. Falun Gong books are burned and web sites and blocked, making it very difficult to obtain accurate information. This might explain why the author seemed to know more about the practice than the woman giving the account.<BR>. I hope I have included enough information to give at least a sense of both the nature of this wonderful practice and the scope of this human rights disaster. However, just in case, more information can be found if you are interested at - www.faluninfo.net.<BR> Otherwise, I found Xin Ran's book to be a good read. Well done!<BR> Take care and good luck book shopping. There is many a fine one her at Amazon.com J.<BR> Best,<BR> Jacob :D</span>
