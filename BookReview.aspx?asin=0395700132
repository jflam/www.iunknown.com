                    <span>The "Guerilla Marketing Handbook" is good in its own right, but is somewhat dissappointing when compared with the Author's "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons" book (which costs slightly more than half the price of the "Handbook"). Based upon the reputation of the Guerrilla series of books, I ordered four of the books covering Advertising, Marketing and Public Relations. However, I soon found that "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons" was Levinson's greatist-hits volume. As good as the other books are (and they are good, very-good), they just don't offer much more than what Levinson provided in condensed form within "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons."<P>Bottom Line? Levinson's books are terrific. In fact, although the phrase is overused, I'd say they are "must buys" for the business owner -- particularly "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons." Overall grade: B+/A-</span>

                    <span>I read this book before I read the book that started this whole series (Guerrilla Marketing- Highly Reccomended), and I can say that it definitely has a lot of "tricks of the trade" to save a small business money on advertising. <P>The problem I felt with this book, was that it was more of a product showcase then a real resource. It basically told you about certain things you could do to save lots of money on marketing and advertising, and then listed a certain company in conjunction with that service. While it was informative, I felt sometimes that I was trying to be sold on certain products.<P>I offer this suggestion: Read this book after you read Guerrilla Marketing. I think it best serves as companion to that book.</span>

                    <span>This 300+ page large size (8.5 by 11) marketing handbook is a must-have if you have already made the commitment to use Guerrilla marketing methods in your business. Read the author's best selling 'Guerrilla Marketing' for the whole scoop on this type of marketing.<BR> <BR>The book is divided into 7 sections - traditional advertising, mini-media, targeted media, promotion, telephone, non-media, and resources (this last section is the appendix). As I mention in the subject of this review, the only thing missing is a section on web marketing but the Internet was just born at the time of this book's publication. At the very beginning of the book, a few pages are devoted to explaining a seven step process to come up with a marketing plan. This simple process is good enough for most small businesses. <P>Marketing plan in hand, you are ready to start with the rest of the book. The information is very clear, makes sense, and easy to implement. Here's an example of what you can expect to find on any given page of the book - in the traditional advertising section, there is a sub-section on tips for ads in newspapers and magazines. It starts out with the golden rule of repetition and addresses the topic of designing the ad, the best days to run the ad, 13 tips for doing a successful ad, and headline tips! The sub-section then moves on to magazine ads. <P>The only downside to this book is the lack of a section addressing the world of the Internet. At the time of publication, the Internet was just being formed so we can't blame the book. I am hoping that the author will release an updated version with at least a third of the book dedicated to websites and web marketing. <P>With small business budgets, we are stuck doing some of these crucial business activities ourselves. This handbook just like the other books in the Guerrilla Marketing series by the author is extremely useful and carries a small business price! As always, successful Guerrilla marketing is a lot of work and requires a lot of thought. So don't wait - just get started! Good luck with your Guerrilla marketing campaigns!</span>

                    <span>This book has never been more relevant! Given the economic challenges the past 18 months have thrown at us, the ideas in this book will revitalize your marketing plans. You'll feel a renewed enthusiasm for what you do, and how you do it. I highly recommend this book for any marcom person who's feeling the pinch of tighter budgets and seeking new and innovative ideas (that aren't really new or innovative!).</span>
