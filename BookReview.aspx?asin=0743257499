The very concept of the enemy had been banished from our moral and political vocabulary. An enemy was just a friend we hadn't done enough for yet. Or perhaps there had been a misunderstanding, or an oversight on our part -- something that we could correct.... <P> "Our first task is therefore to try to grasp what the concept of the enemy really means. The enemy is someone who is willing to die in order to kill you. And while it is true that the enemy always hates us for a reason, it is his reason, and not ours."</B> <P> So begins <I>Civilization and Its Enemies,</I> an extraordinary tour de force by America's "reigning philosopher of 9/11," Lee Harris. What Francis Fukuyama did for the end of the Cold War, Lee Harris has now done for the next great conflict: the war between the civilized world and the international terrorists who wish to destroy it. Each major turning point in our history has produced one great thinker who has been able to step back from petty disagreements and see the bigger picture -- and Lee Harris has emerged as that man for our time. He is the one who has helped make sense of the terrorists' fantasies and who forces us most strongly to confront the fact that our enemy -- for the first time in centuries -- refuses to play by any of our rules, or to think in any of our categories. <P> We are all naturally reluctant to face a true enemy. Most of us cannot give up the myth that tolerance is the greatest of virtues and that we can somehow convert the enemy to our beliefs. Yet, as Harris's brilliant tour through the stages of civilization demonstrates, from Sparta to the French Revolution to the present, civilization depends upon brute force, properly wielded by a sovereign. Today, only America can play the role of sovereign on the world stage, by the use of force when necessary. <P> Lee Harris's articles have been hailed by thinkers from across the spectrum. His message is an enduring one that will change the way readers think -- about the war with Iraq, about terrorism, and about our future.</span>

                    <span>The catastrophic event that has come to be known simply as 9/11 was unique in American history. We had been brutally attacked. But by whom? Not by another country, as we soon discovered. Not by some vile dictator or head-of-state, as we later discovered. So who? Who was the enemy? Then, of course, came the question: Why were the World Trade Center and the Pentagon attacked in the first place? Why would someone deliberately, maliciously murder thousands of ordinary, innocent people?<BR> <P>"Civilization and Its Enemies" is an attempt by Lee Harris to answer these and other questions. The work is a brilliant analysis of the current geopolitical situation and how it came to be what it is. More significantly, it provides an insight into the historical precipitates and intellectual foundations and foibles which may account for the 9/11 tragedy.<BR> <BR>"The subject of this book," says Harris on the opening page, "is forgetfulness." Modern civilization has forgotten how it became civilized in the first place; it isn't knowledgeable of the long period of cultural evolution involved; and it doesn't remember the tremendous amount of labor, cultural and intellectual, that went into the development of civil society. Moreover, modern civilization has forgotten about a category called "the enemy." This concept of the enemy -- someone who is willing to die to kill another -- had been discarded from our moral and political discourse. And that fact, according to Harris, has left modern civilization vulnerable to attack by those who are the enemy of civilized society.<BR> <BR>This is an interesting thesis and, at first glance, may appear to be an implausible explanation for the 9/11 tragedy which was, according to the author, an end in itself and not a means to some other political or social end. Many contemporary observers may find this latter statement problematic since we are so accustomed to thinking in terms of warfare as a means to an end. Harris suggests that our ordinary understanding about what wars are and why they are fought is not applicable to the current conflict with terrorism. The nature of the game, so to speak, has changed and so has the enemy, and 9/11 was a manifestation of that change.<BR> <BR>So, who is this enemy and what is his intent? How did civilization get itself into this situation where it became so vulnerable to this enemy? What is the historical backdrop? What were the social and cultural influences? Who or what is really responsible? What can modern civilization do, if anything, to protect itself? Harris's discussion of these questions takes the reader on a tour through the development of civilization from antiquity to the present day, forming the framework with which he analyzes our current dilemma and providing a rationale for his conclusions.<BR> <BR>One of the most interesting of his discussions has to do with what Harris calls "fantasy ideology" and the related "transformative belief." He also points out the difference between abstract reasoning and concrete reasoning and discusses the "fanaticism" of abstract thought, important elements in the presentation of his argument. His concept of fantasy ideology is familiar to me because, while I use a different term to describe the phenomenon, it appears to be a subcategory of what I have called "intellectual insanity" in my own writings. Modern intellectuals are particularly susceptible to this type of thinking, which eventually leads them into the irrational abyss of moral and cultural relativism, epistemological subjectivism, metaphysical idealism, politicism, and scientism.<BR> <BR>Harris does more, of course, than just provide us with the historical background and intellectual underpinnings which have led to our present situation. He deals with the practical matter of our current conflict with "the enemy," giving us his prescriptions about how we should meet and confront the problem in the very real context within which we have to deal with it. Many intellectuals, especially those in the academic enterprise, will recoil at some of his suggestions.<BR> <BR>But the problem we face today, the author says, is this: "The ideals that our intellectuals have been instilling in us are utopian ideals, designed for men and women who know no enemy and who do not need to take precautions against him." These utopian ideals are dangerous because they are out of touch with the situation as it really is. The new enemy of civilization does not play his "war" game according to the rules we are used to; indeed, as far as he is concerned there are no rules at all. Our intellectuals and those who influence our social and political policies must come to realize this. Our old categories of thought and analysis will no longer suffice. And this brings Harris to what may be his most controversial conclusion as far as the academic intellectuals are concerned.<BR> <BR>Only the United States can play the sovereign in today's world. And if the use of force is necessary to defend civilization, then America will have to use it. At the same time Harris realizes the responsibilities involved in this type of action and points out the necessity, and dilemma, of being ruthless in the defense of civilization while not succumbing to ruthlessness itself. However, because it has produced, over a long period of time and through many sociopolitical conflicts, a practical design for solving and settling problems without resorting to massive ruthlessness, the United States is the only nation which can do the job required if civilization is to be defended and the enemy defeated.<BR> <BR>This is an important book that every American citizen should read. It should be required reading for our college and university students who are so desperately in need of intellectual guidance through the realities of the current geopolitical conflict which puts civilization itself in jeopardy. My only criticism of the book is that Harris needs to recognize there are some intellectuals around who don't subscribe to utopian fantasies and the fanaticism of abstract thought. I like to think I'm one of them.</span>

                    <span>For those who believe it imperative to deal with the threat that became apparent after 9/11, this book is worthwhile. Mr. Harris makes some telling points, namely ÒIt is the enemy who defines us as his enemyÉwe are the enemy of those who murdered us on 9/11Éif you are the enemy, then you have an enemy. When you have it, this fact must change everything about the way you see the worldÉto insist on maintaining utopian values when your society is facing an enemy who wishes only to annihilate you is to invite annihilation.Ó <BR>Yet he pulls his punches when he says we have become forgetful because the threats against civilization have become Òtoo distantÓ. (It is hard for some to forget the horrors of fascism and communism.) Moreover, when discussing how fantasy permeates the enemyÕs world view, he deemphasizes the context within which it arises, denying that there is Òsome inherent flaw in Islam, either as a culture or a religion, or in ArabsÓ. Consequently, he cannot counter the threat by providing disincentives to the Muslim and Arab movements by making them pay a price for their attacks.<BR>Mr. Harris writes that Òthe various things that must be done to protect societyÉare at odds with those values that express the highest that civilized life has to offerÑtolerance, individual liberty, government by consensusÓ as though our response requires a rejection of civilization. Yet perhaps the highest value of civilization is justice, which is the very thing needed for our protection. <P>Mr. Harris notes that the Arabs did not develop their economic resources, nor create their own wealth, but have benefited from the West. Consequently, their advantages appear to stem from magic, rather than from dealing with reality. Surely they have gained from our trusting negotiations and agreements, while benefiting from Western protectionism. Yet most of their advantage has derived from exploiting the flaws in Western beliefs, which they have mastered with great clarity. Here, it is we who have been blind to political and economic realities. Thus whereas Mr. Harris has properly addressed the material and military realm, he has overlooked the primary source of enemy power, which is political and ideological.<BR>I concur with his view that ÒThe civilization that the US is now called on to defend is not AmericaÕs or even the WestÕsÓ but civilization itself. I further agree with his requirement to review the positions of our utopian intelligentsia. However, it is unfortunate that Mr. Harris has not gotten to the source of the bloc to destroy us.</span>

                    <span>A quote: "Forgetfulness occurs when those who have been long inured to civilized order can no longer remember a time in which they had to wonder whether their crops would grow to maturity without being stolen or their children sold into slavery by a victorious foe....They forget that in time of danger, in the face of the enemy, they must trust and confide in each other, or perish."<P>When things like this are said, it's funny because we're being led to believe there is an immediate danger out there...and it's Liberals. Well in Nazi Germany it was Jews who were the danger. Of this quote, the most important point is lost, that, sure we know things were and still are like this in some places, but in America we DON'T live like this. Times change, this fact seems to be lost on people. The book leads us to believe there is an "Enemy" out there. Not Jews this time, now it's Liberals.<P>Also the history: Historical revisionism at it's finest. Right-wing authors have made a high art out of this tactic of revising history to fit their needs. The Greeks were not "republicans". The did not live in "countries". They lived in city states. He claims Sparta was successful because they beat the Athenians. OK. The Spartans were the conservatives. What is left of them? What happened to them as soon as new tactics and technologies came on the scene? What value is there living your whole life as a servant to the state (see NAZIISM)? What art, or anything of lasting endurance, came out of Sparta? They were conservative all right, but their lack of willingness to change and adapt to the new political and military situations destroyed them almost immediately after their victory at Athens. New improvements in military strategy were un-"PC", liberal, and "Utopian". OK, you believe that Sparta, and what happened to you? You died.<P>Historical revisionism is not cool: read 1984 by George Orwell before reading this.<P>The Greeks did not live in the 'burbs and work for corporations. Some things ARE different in different times. This book takes historical situations and pretends the Ancient world was like "Ozzie and Harriet". <P>And no the Greeks did not have cell phones or mopeds.</span>

                    <span>Although I consider myself a "liberal", this presumably "conservative" intellectual blew me away with the depth of his arguments and his amazing eloquence. Be on your guard liberal reader, or you might get convinced. <P>The problem I found with the book, is that the enemy's "fantasy ideology" may draw its appeal to huge masses of people, not because of the fantasy itself, i.e. the promised utopia, but from the flaws of your own civilization. This aspect is carefully avoided in the book. Unless you can change (the civilization), through the Hegelian thesis-antithesis-synthesis process, you are doomed to stumble. I see the role of every "fantasy ideology" as a potential agent of positive change, as long as the civilization is willing to examine the enemy's criticism, with an open mind. Perhaps they are right in some points, and the civilization does need to change. Russian masses, under the czar were in so dire a condition, that bolshevik ideology could easily take root, did, and led to the revolution. The russian government could do nothing to preserve its "civilization", so it lost to the "enemy". Was their particular flavor of civilization worth preserving in the first place in the form it had? Probably not. Yes, the bolshevik ideology set back the russian people seventy years, indeed it was a "fantasy ideology" which won outright. But the "civilization" it replaced hardly merited the label.<BR>In western europe, the influence of the same ideology led to a thesis-antithesis-synthesis cycle which created the european welfare state and averted more drastic changes.<P> What the writer completely omits is the fact that every civilization needs to indulge in self-doubt and self-criticism and critically examine the "enemy" point of view, even if it may reject it outright, if wants self preservation. Otherwise it is doomed to become arrogant, and then decline and fall is not far away,.</span>

                    <span>History is replete with empires who thought that they had all the answers, that their view of the world is the only one that mattered, that their narrative was the only one to which all of "civilization" should subscribe. In trying to impose their "truths" on everybody else, all they succeeded in doing was causing death and suffering for many. And their view was eventually defeated and gave way to another myth. Those who believe in the end of history are as stark raving mad as all the misguided fools who led their empires to ruin. The tragedy now is that modern technology has made weapons so destructive that the coming battles that will inevitably be fought if we go down the insane path heralded by Harris will cause suffering and death on a scale heretofore unseen, and the possible extinction of mankind from the planet. The book that needs to be written is "Homo Sapiens and its Enemies." Harris and and his fool ideas could be a prime exhibit.</span>
