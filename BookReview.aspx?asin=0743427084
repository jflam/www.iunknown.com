                <span id="Label1">As a primer on living the good life, few books compete with <I>How to  Practice</I>, another profound offering from the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader  His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Westerners may be confused by the book's title,  assuming that it focuses solely on Buddhist meditation and prayer techniques.  Though it does address meditation and prayer, at its core this is a book that  demonstrates how day-to-day living can be a spiritual practice. There are two  ways to create happiness:<blockquote>The first is external. By obtaining better  clothes, better shelter, and better friends we can find a certain measure of  happiness and satisfaction. The second is through mental development, which  yields inner happiness. However, these two approaches are not equally viable.  External happiness cannot last long without its counterpart.... However, if you  have peace of mind you can find happiness even under the most difficult  circumstances.</blockquote> As he has in previous books (<I>An Open Heart</I>, <I>The Art of Happiness</I>), the  Dalai Lama reminds us that developing peace of mind means paying attention to  our daily attitudes and choices as well as taking the time to meditate and be  prayerful. The six-part book covers Buddhist meditation techniques and  visualization exercises as well as daily thoughts and actions that foster  morality and wisdom. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>It doesn't seem like critiquing a book by the Dalai Lama is the best idea ever - but at least Buddhist don't believe in hell so I don't have to worry about being sent there for it.
<br />
<br />Actually there is only one real thing to be critical of here... which I will get to in a roundabout way.  Since I am not a Buddhist and all I wouldn't have usually picked up this book but since I received this book along with two others of the Dalai Lama's for free I figured why not.  I was encouraged by the introduction in which the book was described as having value for Buddhists and non-Buddhist alike... this was not exactly my experience.
<br />
<br />While I certainty wouldn't say that this book was of my value at all to read it's value was limited only into the insights it provided into Buddhism and not in any more general way since all of these practices are so deeply founded in Buddhist philosophy and worldview there can be no secular extraction for them that preserves there nature.
<br />
<br />Also, while yes I did learn much about Buddhism from this book having not been exposed to any of it before it was confusing at times trying to learn from this book which seems to assume much on the part of its readers - if you are looking for a primer text on the religion I would not recommend this one.
<br />
<br />Having said that thought I was very impressed thought with many Buddhist approaches to issues and problems that the mainstream Christian culture in America handles so poorly.  A very becoming humility was characteristic of the Dalai Lama's views on subject such as the potential problems that frozen embryos leftover from in vitro fertilization poses with the idea of reincarnation and when life begins.  This humility allowed him to admit that he doesn't have all the answers - Christians (especially those of a political nature) too often seem to view such an admission as a sign of weakness and would rather take a firm position (any position!) rather than have any shred of ambiguity left.  Far from being a sign of weakness though this humble admitting of what he doesn't feel like he knows for such was such a sign of strength and integrity to me.
<br />
<br />Likewise his openness to science stands in contrast to those same percussion-complex ridden Christians.  Instead of viewing research data from research involving the likes of cat scans and genetic sequencing as an assault on his values the Dalai Lama (correctly I believe) asserts that there is much that Buddhism can learn from such sciences and that there is much science can learn in return.
<br />
<br />While the continued captivity of Tibet doesn't exactly seem to be a ringing endorsement for passivism I think I am better off for having read this book, not exactly in a spiritual way but in that I, even as a secularist, now have a greater appreciation and understanding of Buddhism than before.  Yes, I think that that specific goal could have been accomplished better through other books since this one was largely focused on the spiritual side but still its hard not to have enjoyed reading the words of someone who comes off as so genuine and so humble as the Dalai Lama does.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is an excellent place to start on your path to enlightenment. It would be really hard to write an entire book comprising of every aspect of Buddhism and H.H. Dalai Lama did not intend to write a comprehensive book upon writing this. I usually look for more comprehensive guides when purchasing books on subjects new/unfamiliar to me, but this book was a great place to start in understanding the mindset of a peaceful and happy Tibetan Buddhist. He shows the way by example in his writing as his joy flows from page to page in clear and easy to understand writing. I highly advise purchasing, 'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Buddhism", as well as this book to anyone unfamiliar with Buddhism, as, "The Complete ....", describes the different Buddhist sects and ways. "How To Practice," can however be read on its own as well which is what I did prior to dipping into deeper fundamentals of Buddhism.
<br />
<br />The best aspect of this book is that the way in which it was written applies to anyone, (I.E.- Christians, Etc). H.H. Dalai Lama writes and even tells readers of different faiths how particular teaching can be applied in their faiths and lives as well.
<br />

                    <span>I am simpithetic to the previous two readers. They obviously did not want to learn of the religion. if they had they would have learned much more as I did learn.
<br />The first thing to note is that this book is on of the Dalai Lama's books. In it he incorporates experiences of his own life to portray that even if you don't become an oficial Buddhist you can still incorporate these pratices into your own life. The book give you fully detailed explainations on each step of the path. At the end of every section is a Summary of Daily Practice which simplifies the section so you don't fall behind or get lost. 
<br />The book also explains how to use the religion in daily life and how to treat Buddhism properly. This book Inspired me to become a Buddhist, I only hope that it inspires you.</span>

                    <span>I got this book after reading the other reviews and also because i wanted to read about dalai lama  but unfortunately this book did not fulfil that purpose.I found it extremly boring and very hard to understand. I was finished reading half of it when i realized that i did not learn a bit about bhddism or leant anything worthy at all. </span>
