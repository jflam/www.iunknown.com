                <span id="Label1">Simply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a document's structure from its presentation. The benefits of this can be quite profound: CSS allows a much richer document appearance than HTML; CSS saves time--you can create or change the appearance of an entire document in just one place; and its compact file size makes web pages load quickly. Eric Meyer, a member of the CSS&FP Working Group and an internationally known expert on HTML and CSS, tackles the subject with passion and delivers a comprehensive and thorough update to his groundbreaking book.   <P>All readers will benefit from both the depth and breadth of his experience and his clear and honest style. Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition is a thorough review of all aspects of CSS2.1 and a comprehensive guide to CSS implementation. The book includes new content on positioning, lists and generated content, table layout, user interface, paged media, and more. It explores in detail each individual CSS property and how it interacts with other properties, and shows how to avoid common mistakes in interpretation.   <P>If you're ready to take the next step with your HTML coding and incorporate CSS or are already a CSS code warrior, you'll find Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition is the book you've been craving.</span>

                    <span>There are times when a comprehensive list of properities simply isn't enough. At times like these, when my problem is CSS related, I reach for this book. This is one of those books you will need to get a more in-depth knowledge of CSS. It goes through the very basics of style sheets, to make sure that you not only know how to use them, but also that you know how they work!<P>This is a great book for those that learn by example, as there are plenty to go around. There is something about this book that makes it's approach to learning by example that little bit different, as it provides the basis to allow you to test out what you've learnt from early on. Another nice feature is the case study that converts a HTML only page into one that uses CSS.<P>For those of you who are struggling to get a browser to behave with a particular style sheet, then this book has some real gems to help make your pages more consistent amongst browsers. The problem is finding them! They are scattered throughout the book and I sometimes get the feeling they were added merely as necessary afterthoughts. Perhaps the next edition would benefit from a section devoted to gathering these tips into a chapter devoted to browser inconsistencies... that is, if they are still a problem at the time the next edition is printed.<P>As with all reference books, they tend to age. Cascading Style Sheets covers very little of the new CSS2 selectors and properties, which I'm sure will be covered in much better detail in subsquent versions of the book. While it may not be as complete as it could be, it is the book I recommend to those wanting to learn more about the basics of CSS.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for understanding Cascading Style Sheets. The writing style is amazingly readable, which is a stark contrast to the usual dull specifications found in online CSS references. <P>The author shares his detailed understanding of all the quirks of CSS1, and does a good job looking ahead to CSS2. Even if the reader doesn't follow every particular of every item, it's nice to have a feel for the programmers intention. I feel as if I have an even better grasp of whole concept of "cascading."<P>Even though it's a CSS version behind, this book is outstandingly usable for the HTML-familiar web designer who wants to streamline and update to cutting edge code. Personal web page owners would benefit greatly.<P>The only significant drawback to this book is that the book is printed entirely in black and white, which means that all examples are shown in grayscale, not in color. And this lack of color tends to undermine the in-color code examples. You have to use your imagination (or your own computer) to try out the CSS code to see what it really does on your color monitor.<P>With the exception of this limitation, I strongly recommend this book as a CSS learning tool and reference.</span>

                    <span>Eric Meyer is the master. This edition is way out of date. Instead, buy Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition. It explains everything about CSS2 in detail. For examples and workflow, buy Eric Meyer on CSS and More Eric Meyer on CSS. Just don't buy this outdated version of The Definitive Guide.</span>

                    <span>The subtitle claims this volume is the definitive guide, I believe it. This book provides comprehensive coverage of the current cascading style sheets specification and how it is being of being implemented (or not). The focus is on the CSS2 and CSS2.1 specs. My first impression of the book was that it would be a valuable reference manual, but as I began to read it, I soon realized it would serve as a great instructional source also. The writing style is as if a good friend sat down to explain style sheets. I found the pacing of the material to appropriate and the detail of the explanations to be exhaustive.<P>The chapter on selectors (chapter 2) was extremely valuable for me. It helped me to understand why some things did not work as I thought they should. Throughout the book, differences between the specification and the implementation in certain products are explained. Additionally, the differences between various levels of CSS are highlighted. The book has numerous examples for the CSS elements and variations.<P>This is a great book on CSS, but I wish that electronic versions of the examples were available. This is the only shortcoming of the book that I see. This book is a great tutorial and a valuable reference. Regular practice of the techniques contained within this volume can assist the reader in voiding the abuse of the table and fonts tags.</span>

                    <span>No doubt about it, Eric Meyer knows CSS inside and out! This book should be a fantastic reference for people who really want to explore the power of CSS.<P>Unfortunately the editing is so poor in many areas that you have to work through examples on your computer to see the effects being described. Screen shots are used to illustrate coding examples, but details which would help the reader interpret the picture are often left out. For example, when looking at an explanation of overlapping elements, you may be left to figure out whether a space between two lines of text is 20 pixels or 30 pixels wide when there is no reference of scale in the picture. You have to guess or try it out yourself.<P>When a series of examples are used to illustrate a concept, there is a lack of consistency in the example code. Instead of only changing the one element or parameter being discussed, a similar, but different, example is used so you can't simply look at two successive illustrations to see the effect of the change. In a few cases, whole lines of example code are missing. Probably lost in the shuffle while moving Figures and blocks of text to get the page layout right.<P>That said, there is a wealth of information here if you are willing to work a little to get it. I would still highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to seriously dive into CSS -- but if all you are looking for is an introduction or a basic reference, there are probably less frustrating sources out there.</span>
