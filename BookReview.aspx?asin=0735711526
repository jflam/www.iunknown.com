                    <span>For me, if I wrote a book, I'd want it to have all of the production values of this book.<p>The layout gets an "A".<p>I like the chapter sections with a `binding of content' in the quotations used and the graphics employed.<p>This is a beautifully compiled book.<p>Three problems.  Content, content, content.<p>I also have books on bookbinding, the art of making your own books.  This book will move from my technical bookshelf to my "Arts in creative bookbinding" shelf.<p>This is truly a beautiful book.  What I'll learn regarding the GoLive 6 application will be minimal but what I've gained on modern layout is outstanding.<p>I'm sure the editor of this book an I are best friends.</span>

Having used Dreamweaver for many years, the way GoLive works is completely different and this book was a good guide on figuring out how to get what I wanted done, done.</span>

                    <span>GoLive 6 Magic is an excellent book for those who wants to learn a bit more about GoLive than the basics and wants to go on to a deeper understanding and knowledge about what can be done with Adobe GoLive 6 and how to do it.<p>The projects in the book are easy to follow and understand and really useful.<br>I recommend it warmly to anyone who works in GoLive and have done so for some time.<p>It is not a beginners book and you have to know the basics of GoLive to fully appreciate it. But if you do, this is a must have book as it covers a lot of things that are not in the manual or the Help-file.</span>

                    <span>Having been a little disappointed at some of the material that Adobe's own _GoLive 6 Classroom In A Book_left out, I decided it was maybe time to take a look at something that assumed the user already knew the basics of what they were doing and wanted to really get to the juicy stuff.<p>GoLive 6 Magic fits the bill perfectly (which came as a pleasant surprise after reading some other titles in this series which were pretty to look at but not much more).  There's a lot of good stuff in here, and it's well worth a look if you've found some of the other available titles rather skimpy in their coverage of advanced stuff.<p>So what's in it?  Fourteen chapters in total, covering a wide range of subjects.  I'll admit that a couple were of no interest to me (those on WAP and i-mode site development) so I can't really comment on the quality of those.  I also found the inclusion of a couple of Quicktime-oriented chapters a little strange, although interesting enough.<p>Where the book really shines is in its coverage of GoLive's support of dynamic HTML through Actions - not only do the examples show to to perform certain simple (but general enough to expand on) tasks using what's provided, but there's also excellent material on creating your own Actions too.<p>On top of this the book also has a couple of chapters that deal with GoLive's SDK, showing how you can expand the tool itself relatively easily - both chapters make use of GoLive's ability to write extensions in JavaScript using the built-in editor/debugger too, so the techniques shown here are potentially of use to anyone who owns the tool, and not just those who happen to have the appropriate C or C++ development environment installed.<p>The remaining two chapters cover the use and customization of GoLive's text macro capabilities - useful if not exactly rocket-science - and the use of the dynamic content/data source binding tools.  The latter chapter covers the setting up of a simple news site and the creation of pages for maintaining said site, and it's clear and straightforward. <p>However, it did confirm for me my growing disappointment in the support in both GoLive 6 and its primary competitor, Dreamweaver MX, for PHP as a scripting language.  Both tools restrict their built-in support for PHP to the MySQL database, and for anything more complex than very simple databases, using the built-in tools for the PHP/MySQL combination becomes unwieldy pretty rapidly.  Until MySQL supports views and stored procedures, or GoLive and Dreamweaver support the combination of PHP and (say)  PostgreSQL, I'm going to continue hand-coding my database-driven pages.<p>That shouldn't really reflect on the book though - it covers the capabilities as they currently exist clearly, and if you get to the point where you need to add multiple content sources per-page, each based around a complex SQL query, you'll be aware of the shortcomings of what's provided anyway.<p>In summary, a readable book with plenty of screen images to show what's going on, and a lot of very useful information that'll be appreciated by the advanced user, and encourage/enable the intermediate user to *become* an advanced user.</span>

                    <span>I confess that I'm a fellow author of an Adobe GoLive book, and I love this title. Why? Because it offers long, detailed, masterful tutorials on some of the most complex and underdocumented features in GoLive that can also be incredibly powerful, especially for increasing efficiency and flexibility. GoLive 6 Magic lets your creativity get further unleashed by removing the restriction of relying on your own smarts to learn the most advanced features in the program.<p> I was relieved to read GoLive 6 Magic because it's the graduation present for our readers: many topics on which we can touch briefly or offer a simple overview are presented across several pages with illustrations and accompanying examples on CD-ROM.<p>You learn not only how to use advanced graphics tools, but how to modify GoLive Actions (plug-in JavaScripts) and build rich dynamic content.<p>Far be it from me to suggest you buy both this book and my book, but they're a nice complement to each other. If you've sucked the marrow dry of beginner and intermediate sources, buy this book: it'll help you master the rest of the program.</span>
