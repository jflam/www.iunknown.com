                    <span>Nothing better than that book. I wasn't able to understand how frames work but within couple of hours of reading chapter 10, frames became a piece of cake!!!! <br>Thanks for the excellent work!</span>

                    <span>I have just finished the first two modules and let me tell you that if you are a pure beginner to HTML, DO NOT get this book.  Module two is very confusing with very few examples for the beginner.  I have been designing pretty decent web pages (www.pacificlittleleague.org) with MS Frontpage 2002 and wanted to learn HTML so I could advance to using javascript & flash.  This book was a mistake purchase.  It is not for the beginner.  I have read all of the other comments that convinced me to buy this book, and all I can say is that maybe this would be a good book if you have already dabbled in some HTML.  If you look at some of the test questions at the end of module 2, such as #9 which asks about the proper XHTML format for closing the hr tag, you will find that she hasn't even covered the tag hr yet.  In # 11 it asks to rewrite "the text below" so that it doesn't show up on a web page - and then there is no text shown that could be rewritten.  The author really needs to get in a frame of mind to that of a true beginner if she is going to sell this book as a beginner book.</span>

                    <span>I needed a relatively quick way to learn how to construct a custom web page for my Computer-Help website, and this book did not disappoint.<p>I just finished the book today, and I can now use basic Javascript, tables, frames (don't use them!), and basic CGI scripts.<p>All the information you need to go from beginner to intermediate is here. I highly recommend this book as the most painless means of acquiring a working knowledge of HTML.<p>Some things this book does not cover are ASP, PHP, and the like, which is understandable. There are only so many pages available.</span>

                    <span>HTML was very intimidating to me. This book gives you just enough information and in a form that is not intimidating but rather exciting.<br>If you dream of opening wordpad and creating a page from nothing or if you use a wysiwyg and just want to understand some of the tags you are creating..this is a must have book!</span>
