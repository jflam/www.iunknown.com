                <span id="Label1">An insider's look at the internal turmoil at one of the world's premier high-tech companies<br>   This is the inside story of Hewlett-Packard Company's struggle to regain its former glory, and of the high-stakes battle between CEO Carly Fiorina and family scion Walter Hewlett over how best to achieve that goal. For decades, HP was admired not only for its innovative products and soaring stock price, but for its egalitarian corporate culture and father-knows-best integrity. Backfire explains how the company fell on hard times, recounts the historic decision that made Fiorina the world's top-ranking female executive, and brings to life the backlash that resulted when she tried to impose her charismatic salesmanship on the aging icon. Top BusinessWeek journalist Peter Burrows gives the dramatic blow-by-blow of Hewlett's effort to kill Fiorina's most controversial move of all, her $19 billion purchase of rival Compaq Computer. Fiorina won by a whisker, after the most expensive proxy fight in history and a dramatic lawsuit that accused the company of illegally fixing the vote. This gripping, ongoing story includes fascinating personalities and dramatic boardroom and courtroom drama.<br>   Peter Burrows (Alameda, CA) has been a technology reporter for BusinessWeek for nine years and has covered the HP saga from the start. The department editor for BusinessWeek's computer coverage, he has been the principal chronicler of Fiorina's tenure at HP, and has written three cover stories on the subject. He has also written numerous other cover stories, including looks at Steve Jobs's Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy.</span>

                    <span>Peter Burrows offers insights into high level business, where personality matters more than economics, as he explores the mammoth HP-Compaq merger. Most mergers fail to make money or to produce the promised "synergies" so, he asks, why - other than ego - do CEOs pursue them? Though stylistically somewhat trite, this book successfully explores the HP Board's decision to approve the merger, with Walter B. Hewlett's vote in favor, and his subsequent lonely, ultimately quixotic battle against it. The most contentious issues in contemporary business are all here: shareholder rights and value vs. CEO power; employee-oriented cultures vs. "re-engineering;" corporate integrity vs. sharp practice; and the interesting spectacle of a ruthless, hard-headed female CEO pitted against a sensitive, cello-playing man. The author says Hewlett-Packard executives were told not to speak with him after he quoted merger critics in Business Week, so there is an inevitable Walter Hewlett bias. We found this to be a very good read, even a must read, for corporate warriors.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book and an easy read. Burrows makes you feel like he is sitting across from you as he discusses the merger, the HP Way, Carly and Walter Hewlett's motivations. He clearly brings recognition to the HP Way and how it made HP a great company, and the dangers involved in destroying HP's identity by merging with Compaq. Why would a company with a suffering PC division want to buy a PC giant that was suffering even more, in a market where consumers have stopped buying PC's? "Two garbage trucks colliding". And yet Burrows gives credence to Carly's abilities and talent and clearly offers both sides of the story.<P>The best part of this book is the general business understanding it offers of mergers gone wrong. This is a prime example and well portrayed.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I enjoyed this book as it contained substantial original reporting that is not duplicative of the work that others have done. I would have liked to see more material concerning bottom line issues. The bottom line issue that has the most resonance for me is the Wall Street assessment, both now, and at the time of the merger, that HP's non-printing businesses have no value on the Street. In other words, if HP were to be bought by some other firm, the Wall Street consensus is that such an acquirer should simply eliminate the other businesses. HP's value is actually less as currently structured because eliminating these other businesses has closing costs associated with this shutdown activity.<P>The clear implication here is that Walter Hewlett was absolutely correct in opposing this merger, since the result clearly is that 20 billion dollars was completely wasted, and precious time is still being lost on ineffective strategies to revive these businesses. With the benefit of hindsight we can say that Walter Hewlett should have been given more credit than he received, even from Burrows, for opposing this capital and job destruction, even in the face of Fiorina's personal attacks.<P>This book should have pointed out that these at-risk businesses can still be saved, particularly the server and server-related businesses, with the appointment of proper management by the Board of Directors. What they need to be looking for this time is not someone whose picture has been on the cover of "Fortune" magazine, as was Carly's before she was hired, but someone with the knowledge and interest in saving HP. Carly not only does not have the engineering expertise, she simply creates the impression that she has no interest in HP's existing businesses, even printing, which she has left to wither on the vine in a new investment sense. <P>HP has had a computer server business for over 25 years. It is a big market, roughly 50 billion yearly and rising. HP has 27%, but has failed to gain any share at all from the collapse of Sun Microsystems. Instead, customers are transfering to IBM and Dell, which should be a big wake-up call for the Board. Dell Computer is number one in market position for the key Linux server business, perhaps because of HP's totally insular and uninformed approach to this market. A lot of hard work by HP employees went into building a formerly successful server business, it is senseless to discard this potentially excellent business because Carly is more interested in trying to sell MP3s at Starbucks, something that will never generate much profit.<P>I would have liked to have seen a clear statement in this book that if in the summer of 2004 if HP's non-printer businesses are still worth zero, that the HP Board of Directors needs hire a new CEO. Doubtless they prefer to have a charming dialogue with Carly about her boneheaded hipster ideas involving HP products in Starbucks rather than argue with some computer nerd about computer enterprise/service-provider product investments, but I would argue that being true to their responsibilities requires that they do the later, whether they like it or not. It would have been good for Burrows' book to say so.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>My major concern with this book is that it vastly understates the negative impacts any poor HP CEO, and in particular Carly Fiorina, can have. The negative impacts are not limited to HP shareholders, employees and customers, whom few people seem to care about. A few months ago Fiorina bought a 10,000 person Indian software firm, adding greatly to HP's huge investment in India. Inappropriate investments, HP and otherwise, are greatly resented in India, because it reinforces corruption in the culture that prevents improved living conditions for most Indians. Your Ronald Reagan dealt with the corrupt culture in the Soviet Union in a vastly superior way -- not by financially supporting corrupt bureaucrats and communist state governments (as Fiorina has done in India) but by dealing very sternly with these malfactors. Fiorina's investments have caused great harm in India. A few days ago Atal Vajpayee's government was voted out and the communists are going to call many of the shots in the new government. This is very, very bad for about a billion Indians. <P>These potential international impacts should have been given attention in Burrows book. HP and a few other big US firms caused this senseless suffering in pursuit of corruption in India. The motivation for HP to outsource to India in the way they are doing it is certainly not cost savings (which don't really exist) -- the motivation is a combination of graft (doing business in India requires bribes, and once slush funds are created it is impossible to determine weather the bribes really go to Indian bureaucrats or whether American managers pocket most of the cash) and the desire of Carly to remove herself as far from actual production and productive people as possible. It is said she does not even use the company cafeteria because she could find herself too close to actual HP workers.<P>I would hope in the future America would produce more great leaders like Ronald Reagan and find ways to keep harmful ditzy people like Carly Fiorina out of leadership positions. Burrows book would have been much better with a discussion of these international impacts.</span>

                    <span>The main weakness of this book was that its treatment of CEO Fiorina was far more favorable than the facts warrant. The controversy over the 20 billion dollar merger should have been foreseen by the Board of Directors. Certainly there was ample evidence at the time of the proposed merger that Carly Fiorina's ideas and actions were incompatible with her role as head of a major American company. Burrows should have detailed many more of these. For example, she invested millions of shareholder dollars in a radical feminist group and even set them up with office resources at HP. She donated over $100,000 of her personal funds to an eccentric socialist training camp in Los Altos Hills. This is clearly a businesswoman that simply does not have her head screwed on right for business. The businessman George Soros has been rightly condemned in the business community for analogous nutty actions on a larger scale but Burrows mostly gives Fiorina a free pass on such activity, although his account is certainly better than most.<P>It has been nearly five years since Carly Fiorina took over HP and the bottom line result is that even after spending 20 billion on Compaq, the investment community values HP at less that half of what it was worth when she took over. Clearly, a much harder-hitting book from Burrows was warranted than what he produced, given the huge magnitude of the investor losses that have occurred since.</span>
