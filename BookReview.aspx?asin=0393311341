                    <span>...Parrish's focus on individuals is the book's strength. Parrish is a true synthesis historian. For example, Parrish had a balanced approached of synthesizing the traditional views of the Great Depression with more non-traditional issues. He discussed the traditional topics of poverty, lost fortunes, and food lines. Yet he also had sections of neglected topics like the disruption on family life, the popularity of sex in the film industry, and how many had positive views of the Great Depression. He concluded: "The Great Depression drove some Americans apart and simultaneously brought others together in a common cause. For some the Depression confirmed the rottenness of capitalism and the need for revolution. For others it would be the best of times, when people reached out to help others, and when the government took the side of the underdog to battle injustice."</span>

                    <span>Parrish did an admirable job of balancing traditional topics and<br>non-traditional topics. For example, in chapter one and two he focused upon two influential white males, President Harding and Henry Ford. Yet in chapter 7 he talked about the struggles by women for equality in the workplace and politics. He had extensive comments on poor farmers and other laborers in chapter four. Part two in his book sways mainly to legislations and influential white politicians in the 1930's. While revisionists may argue that he failed to include more stories on influential women and minorities, one may argue that Parrish exposed the lack of important women and minorities in the 1930's.</span>

                    <span>Michael Parrish, who teaches at San Diego State University, has written a  thorough work of history for the layperson.  He covers the political,  social and - to a lesser degree - the economic landscape of America during  the decades of the 1920's and 1930's. Where many works of history live and  die on issues political, Parrish seeks a balance with a strong dose of  social history.<p>This is particularly important when writing about these  two decades.  The Roaring Twenties are inherently a span of time consumed  with social matters; from industrialization, commercialization and the  burgeoning media industry. The thirties, though dominated by the policy and  personality of Roosevelt, is still a decade about the relationship between  government policy and its effects on the lives of people.  Parrish covers  this well.  <p>He does not skirt political matters, however, and well over  half of the book is devoted to FDR's New Deal.  At times his treatment of  the agencies, policies and personalities of the New Deal become weighty and  laborious, it is still a useful book for New Deal/Great Depression  history.<p>The book is well-written, though not highly engaging.   Recommended for students and scholars.  <p>It includes period photos and  cartoons.</span>
