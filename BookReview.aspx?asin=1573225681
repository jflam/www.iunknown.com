                <span id="Label1">If you have always assumed that Christianity and Buddhism are as far apart philosophically as their respective founders were geographically, you may be in for a bit of a surprise. In this national bestseller, Zen monk and social activist Thich Nhat Hanh draws parallels between these two traditions that have them walking, hand in hand, down the same path to salvation. In Christianity, he finds mindfulness in the Holy Spirit as an agent of healing. In Buddhism, he finds unqualified love in the form of compassion for all living things. And in both he finds an emphasis on living practice and community spirit. <p> The thread that binds the book is the same theme that draws many Christians toward Buddhism: mindfulness. Through anecdotes, scripture references, and teachings from both traditions, Nhat Hanh points out that mindfulness is an integral part of all religious practice and teaches us how to cultivate it in our own lives. Nhat Hanh has no desire to downplay the venerable theological and ritual teachings that distinguish Buddhism and Christianity, but he does cause one to consider that beyond the letter of doctrine lies a unity of truth.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a Chinese Christian in Hong Kong who knows Christianity and Buddhism quite well (better the former than the latter, just opposite to the author), I am obliged to voice out my opinion despite my genuine appreciation of the author's effort to reconcile the differences or even conflicts between the two religions which the author deliberately named them as "traditions" instead. 
<br />
<br />Certainly, there are many similarities in elements like love, compassion, kindness, mindfulness, simplistic lifestyle and so on. However, the fundamental differences are insurmountable. Christians pray to Jesus and God for deliverance. Buddhists meditate to get solutions from within. Christians refer to the Bible for ultimate direction. Buddhists are not encouraged to stick to any "book" at all. Christians dont believe in reincarnation. Buddhists do. Jesus and the Holy Spirit "is" the one and only Creator. Buddhism talks vaguely little about the origin of life. In fact, what disturbed me most is the author's equating Buddha to Jesus and Mindfulness to the Holy Spirit. 
<br />
<br />I am not advocating intolerance nor rivalry against Buddhists nor Buddhism. My wife is a quasi Buddhist (a lot of Hong Kong people regards themselves to be) and our marriage is quite against the teaching in the New Testament. In my opinion, Buddhism, in particular the Zen tradition, is a great lifestyle or philosophy to be seriously studied and followed, but not a religion of (before) life and death (after). Buddhists can be just the same lovely and lovable as any christian, and we shouldnt label or judge anyone by what one believes. Actions always talk louder than empty words. 
<br />
<br />Anyway, this is a good book for thought, though I think it might be more suitable for Christians who have a solid understanding of their own religion, say, through study of the whole Bible several times. For interested christians who want to look into this area about living with both Christianity and Buddhism, I would strongly recommend the book "The Silence of Unknowing: The key to the Spiritual Life" by Terence Grant. </span>

                    <span>Thich speaks as someone who's suffered immeasurably. But his suffering, transformed, had enabled him tremendous insight. <p>Thich is able to understand the dynamics that underpin two great traditions. He is able to step outside of time and tradition on speak on truth.<p>He is not a "philosopher" or "lawyer" who plays with language to "prove" how these religions are one. Rather he speaks from his own experience to express his feelings regarding Jesus and Buddha. <p>Highly recommended to all Christians looking to deepen their  understanding of the holy spirit and to open their hearts to the living Christ.</span>

                    <span>In Living Buddha, Living Christ, Thich Nhat Hanh explains the similarities between all earthly religions, giving particular emphasis on his own background in Buddhism and his view of Christianity as it has been formed by direct interactions both hostile (missionaries in Vietnam) and serene (monks, nuns, and priests met during travels). As somebody that can an outside-in view to both traditions, I heartily concur with Hanh.</span>

                    <span>All religions have as their common thread the Golden Rule expressed in Buddhism as: "Hurt not others with that which pains yourself" and in Christianity as: "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you". Almost certainly, if Jesus and Buddha were to meet today they would embrace each other and tell us that we have misinterpreted their teachings by permitting or perhaps even advocating religious intolerance, religious rivalry, religious hatred, religious fanaticism and religious war. It was therefore like a breath of fresh air to discover a Buddhist monk from Vietnam who thinks, speaks and acts the Golden Rule - a man about whom Martin Luther King wrote: "I Know Thich Nhat Hanh and am privileged to call him my friend. He is a holy man, for he is humble and devout. He is a scholar of immense intellectual capacity. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity". In 1947 in Egypt early Christian documents were discovered, believed to have been hidden after orders to destroy them as heretical were given by the archbishop of Alexandria. The Gospel of Thomas resonates with the Buddhist tradition. These long-hidden sources show that the early Christian movement contained much more diversity of viewpoint and practice than later Christians acknowledged or even imagined. Because these teachings were smothered, many Christians today are adamant that the only path to God is via Christianity. Shortly after Buddha died there were two schools of Buddhism; after 400 years there were 20 schools; and today there are many more. Each is an attempt to keep the Buddhist teachings alive under new circumstances. Likewise Christianity has splintered into many groups. It is only by respecting the differences within our own church and seeing how these differences enrich one another, that we can be open to appreciating the richness and diversity of other traditions.<p>Thich Nhat Hanh is not a monk who lives in a hermitage and runs away from the world. For more than 30 years he has been active in combating poverty, ignorance and disease; rescuing boat people; evacuating the wounded from combat zones; resettling refugees; helping the hungry and orphans; opposing wars; training peace and social workers; and rebuilding villages destroyed by bombs. But he has only been able to do this because of the practice of meditation - stopping, calming and looking deeply. It is only through the practice of deep looking and deep listening, that we become free, able to see the beauty and values in our own and others' tradition and that we know what we should be doing in the world.<p>This book is about interfaith dialogue. "In a true dialogue, both sides are willing to change. We have to appreciate that truth can be received from outside of - not only within - our own group. If we do not believe that, entering into dialogue would be a waste of time. If we think we monopolize the truth and we still organize a dialogue, it is not authentic. We have to believe that by engaging in dialogue with the other person, we have the possibility of making a change within ourselves, that we can become deeper. Dialogue is not a means for assimilation in the sense that one side expands and incorporates the other into its 'self.' Dialogue must be practiced on the basis of 'non-self.' We have to allow what is good, beautiful, and meaningful in the other's tradition to transform us. But the most basic principle of interfaith dialogue is that the dialogue must begin, first of all, within oneself. Our capacity to make peace with another person and with the world depends very much on our capacity to make peace with ourselves." <p>This book is about seeking peace. "Until there is peace between religions, there can be no peace in the world. People kill and are killed because they cling too tightly to their own beliefs and ideologies. When we believe that ours is the only faith that contains the truth, violence and suffering will surely be the result." And "When there are wars within us, it will not be long before we are at war with others, even those we love. The violence, hatred, discrimination, and fear in society water the seeds of the violence, hatred, discrimination, and fear in us."<p>This book is about mindfulness: "In Buddhism, our effort is to practice mindfulness in each moment - to know what is going on within and all around us. When the Buddha was asked, 'Sir, what do your monks practice?' he replied, 'We sit, we walk, we eat.' The questioner continued, 'But sir, everyone sits and walks, and eats.' And the Buddha told him, 'When we sit, we know we are sitting. When we walk, we know we are walking. When we eat, we know we are eating.' Most of the time, we are lost in the past or carried away by future projects and concerns."<p>This book is about being there for others: "The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When our mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers." This book is about meditation.	 This book is about the common ground between Christianity and Buddhism - for the author there is no conflict in having images of both Jesus and Buddha on his hermitage altar. He worships them both; he touches them both as his spiritual ancestors. This book is wisdom. There are pearls of wisdom on every page of this book for seekers of the truth.</span>
