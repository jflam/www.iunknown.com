                    <span>I read this book over the weekend and I could not put it down.  It's one thing to read a book from someone who puts together a story of what they heard what happen but to read a story from Mamie Till on how her son was murdered and to feel her pain is something totally different.  She was a brave woman to do what she did and to write a book about her young son.  Wonderfully written.</span>

                    <span>Have you ever picked up one of those books that of such quality and intensity that you just couldn't put it down no matter what? Well, I just read one.  And that was "Death Of Innocence" by Mamie Till-Mobley, mother of murdered teenager Emmett Till.  I can't tell you how hard it was to not put this book down.  Mrs. Till-Mobley tells in engrossing detail the path her life took after August 28, 1955 when, while on a vacation to visit relatives in Mississippi, Emmett Till (or "Bobo" as he was affectionately known) was kidnapped from the home of his great uncle and subsequently tortured and murdered.  Mrs. Till-Mobley goes on to describe how she struggled to turn her own personal tragedy into a drive for freedom, dignity and understanding for everyone no matter the race, creed or color of the individual.  She also describes the place that her faith in God had in enabling her to move on.  It also shows what can happen when mankind allows its passions to overule its reason and common sense.  I'd just like to conclude by saying that I enjoyed this book immensely and I would recommend that everyone with even an ounce of compassion to read this book with an open mind and an open heart.  You'll be glad you did.</span>

                    <span>It was such a good idea to write this book in the first person. It was far from a documentary-like book with long technical jargon and delves into history. It read just like a work of fiction. I would lose myself for hours, reading this. It was as if I was right there.  After all the stories behind this tragedy I believe this is the actual factual account. Mamie Till firmly discredited all the lies surrounding Emmett's character. Though I did find one flaw. I didn't like how the fatal TRIP to Mississippi was dramatized. It was written that she could hardly function, eat, or sleep once he'd left for the vacation. Granted any mother will miss their child but to that extent seemed a bit farfetched. (And besides, Emmett had lived away from her once before upon her move to Detroit.)  But in a sense, Emmett was baby Jesus, and Mamie;Mary. God chose him as a sacrifice to open the eyes of the world and take action against racism.  JW Milam and Roy Bryant have long since been dead and I'm sure Emmett was waiting on the other side. Those animals are getting theirs for eternity. And the fact that Roy Bryant divorced the wife who's 'honor' he was supposedly defending, that was a slap in the face. All of them were poor white trash.</span>

                    <span>I am a 20 year old black college student that is from Clarksdale, MS. This is a little Delta town near where Emmet's murder was committed and also is mentioned in the book. The horrors described in this book are ones that every child from the Delta is aware of and is cautioned about. The men that murdered Emmett were brutal, merciless, tyrants that deserved the death penalty. <br>This book moved me to tears simply because of the fact that Mrs. Till never hated or wanted revenge for these men. She just wanted them to show some remorse and hoped that their little boys didn't grow up with the same kind of hatred that killed her son. This book clarified a lot of the myths that I have heard over the years about his death and also showed how strong and determined his mother was. He was her only child, the only boy, and yet she pushed and kept on fighting for him. They brought him home in a box filled with lime so he could deteriorate faster, and she said he didn't even look human, but she fought and never lost in the war of racism. She opened that box that was sealed by the state of Mississippi, and said "let the world see what I've seen".  I think that this book is an eye-opener for anyone not familiar with Mississippi and for people that are, it is a raw look at the ugly truth. Mrs. Till went on to become a teacher and influenced lots of more kids with the passion that she would have given Emmett, and I thank her for this look into a heart that was wounded beyond repair and thanks to God, she made it. We made it. Emmett will never be forgotten, his story lives on still.</span>

                    <span>This act of terrorism, committed by Americans, against an American, occurred less than fifty years ago.  Some of the people who were involved in the kidnapping, brutal beating, shooting and the tying of this fourteen year old child to a huge gin fan and throwing his body into the Tallahatchie River, may still be alive today...<br>I enjoyed Rev. Jesse Jackson 's rousing, sermon-styled introduction which leads you into the story. It gradually, becomes clear why Mrs. Till-Mobley felt it necessary to include a detailed story of her son's life.  I think it was important to her that the reader pay special attention to how he was treated by his family.  It's more than obvious that Alma Gaines (Emmett's maternal grandmother) instilled in them the belief that every life has value, that there are none so special to enjoy "preferential, common dignities".  I suspect, in that day, they were considered "uppity" because they dared consider themselves just as good.  They simply took the words from American doctrine and, rightfully, made them their own. They understood, more profoundly than many, then and today, that American privilege is not supposed to be about color, but about the implication of democracy, and that as human beings, we are all endowed with a fundamental right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It's unfortunate and destructive, how some Americans feel privileged on the basis of their skin color.  This ideal not only divides us among other countries it's also eating away at us from within.<br>If you are of the "unspoken, privileged class" of America, for a moment, try to reduce your "rights" to a fundamental level.  You'll then be closer to a reality that Emmett could have been your son, nephew, grandson, uncle, brother or husband - this is the African American experience.  Perhaps the most frightening truth is that America isn't so far removed from this event, socially, where we can say it couldn't happen today.<br>(...)Had Emmett not taken his father's ring on his trip to Mississippi, and been showing it off to everyone he'd met there (a seed of evidence for things unseen) they wouldn't have been able to identify his body. So, to the local authorities, it would have just been another insignificant Black body found floating in the Tallahatchie River.  It may seem that all Mamie Till instilled in her son, including the method for taming his stutter, led to his unfortunate demise, but the river runs much deeper. Emmett's story is more than the act committed against him.  His death brought about a consciousness raising that would change American history forever.<br>Pages 132 -137 tell the gruesome, and sorrowful, story of her ordeal identifying Emmett's body.  I found it disturbing, being a parent, yet I had to re-read it several times to try and make sense of what could drive human beings to commit such a crime.  I recommend you obtain a copy of this book, if only to read these four pages and I guaranty they will quell your innocence forever and perhaps change your entire worldview.<br>The story of Emmett Till deserves to be petitioned into our history books because it is, without question, a raw portrait of our America.  No one can decry this story.  It can't be discounted as an untruth fabricated by a self-promoting charlatan.  That his murder did occur, under these circumstances, can never be doubted.<br>Christopher Benson sums up Mother Mobley's character eloquently.  He writes that though she may have retired from teaching years ago, that was just "an administrative detail".  She continued to teach far beyond her retirement, and she still does.  There are lessons here about humanity, bravery, cowardice, love, and of course the evils we can be driven to out of hate and fear all doused with select pearls of wisdom on the intricacies of parenthood.   You'll bear witness to a spiritual journey as she  "walks through" her grief, on to understanding that the meaning of our lives sometimes paints a larger picture than we could have ever imagined.<br>I'm grateful that she did finally get to share her story.  I can't help but feel honored to have read it.</span>
