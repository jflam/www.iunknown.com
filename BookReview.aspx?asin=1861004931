                <span id="Label1"><I>Professional JMS</I> lifts the lid on the collection of data communications technologies known collectively as the Java Message Service (JMS). Don't approach this book without a very solid grounding in Java network programming and familiarity with the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) environment, because the authors don't slow down for stragglers. <p>  The book explains one technology after another, each in terms of its place in larger distributed computing solutions. That, together with the fact that most of the code samples are long and rather sophisticated, makes this book best suited to systems architects and programmers in the early phases of their work. <p>  A typical discussion of a JMS technology begins with an architectural overview of what it's for. These discussions include numerous boxes, clip-art computers, arrows, and database cylinders, with labeled messages moving along the interconnections. Explanations of specifications for software systems that solve particular business problems follow, along with the code that does the job. Critical sections of these passages are commented, often with tables that detail what's in the messages flowing back and forth among pieces of the system. Where relevant, utilities that handle JMS and J2EE tasks are documented--FioranoMQ and BEA WebLogic Server are explained thoroughly. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The Java Message Service (JMS) as a means of implemented distributed computing among Java classes. Focusing on the JMS 1.0.2 release, this book covers the contents of JMS messages, point-to-point messaging, pub/sub messaging, integration with JavaServer Pages (JSP), clustering, and JMS for mobile applications. </span>

                    <span>I knew nothing about JMS when I bought this book. What I like about it is that it explains the basic concepts of this technology (or should I say API?), And I personally think this is the most important thing. It then moves slowly on how to exploit all the capabilities of JMS.<P>The book introduces the different aspects of JMS (topics, queues, durable subscribers, etc) and it also explains with java examples. I actually didn't follow much the examples, but I used some code snippets when using it with a different application server. So it also helps. <P>Anyways, you can always refer back to this book if you have any JMS doubts</span>

                    <span>I expect that with introduction of JMS and Message Driven Beans which are based on this technology we will see very big movement towards implementing various application scenarious based on JMS. This book definitely could help you to decide what should be taken in account. I also like chapter on Clustering and Scalability - each enterprise (and you as developer for this enterprise) should think about this during design stage. List of various JMS providers (SonicMQ, IBM MQ Series, FioranoMQ, WebLogic) and implemented by them features could also be helpful.</span>

                    <span>This book covers a lot of ground about JMS. However, the problem is that it is written by many authors, which results in repetition of some subject, bad structure of the book and more pages than necessary for explaining the subjects.<P>The first 5 chapters are on 250 pages and cover the basic about JMS, but I think "Java Message Service" by Monson-Haefel does a better job here. However, I appreciate that there are sequence diagrams in the first chapter that shows basic design patterns for MOM-based applications. The next two chapters is code example that shows how to use JMS from a web application and from EJBs. I'm not too found about this kind of lengthy code examples. <P>The chapter about JMS and Clustering is very technical, but still only scratches the surface. This is a subject that needs an own book to be covered completely. The next chapter called "Distributed Logging Using JMS" is again a lengthy code example, but a very useful one!<P>Chapter 10 is about XML Messaging with some XML code example. I think this chapter, like some of the other chapters as well, covers too little to be of some real value and too much for just being an overview. Chapter 11 is about Mobile Applications and the criticism against this chapter is the same as the chapter about XML.<P>All and all this is a book that covers a lot of subjects related to JMS, but it does it in a boring and verbose way.</span>
