Shot on location in Silicon Valley on 35mm film and in widescreen, REVOLUTION OS captures an offbeat group of characters who are three-parts libertarian, two-parts communist, and one-part bad garage band.</span>

                    <span>Like it or not, hackers have been part of the profile of the computer age since its dawn. Mainstream non-insiders that don't code know little more about what programmers and hackers are thinking, formulating or from which perspective their reasoning comes. This documentary goes a far ways to bridge that gap and I felt very engaged while watching it. It's well produced (something I feel I can talk about with authority from having studied and from working within Video) does indeed incorporate a comfortable editorial logic and flow and includes well-photographed, well-cast, articulate and succint interviews that work with this documentary's focus. Bravo for the solid work.</span>

                    <span>This is a well put together retrospective detailing the motives, methods, and history of the free software movement and the open source movement. Best of all, it is entirely told through interviews with the community leaders who have been directly involved in it (namely Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, Linus Torvalds, and several others). It is straightforward, interesting, and very well edited, with an excellent soundtrack. It makes a great follow-up to Robert Cringley's "Triumph of the Nerds" and "Nerds 2.01." It is also notably apolitical, painting a very factual, unbiased, orderly picture of events (and certainly one that will anger those who like to rewrite history). It does get a bit thick towards the end, focusing on the business aspect, but not enough to jump the shark.
<br />
<br />This film is a very good at getting across the principles of open software, in a way even a non-technical person can understand. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>A stupid, propogandistic and self indulgant documentary about Richard Stallman and Eric Raymond.  Linus is a good guy, but these other folks are just demagogues of the computer age.  I particularly find their hacker interpretation of history insulting.  It ignores all the hardworking professional engineers and programmers who really did invent computers and operating sytsems, and makes us think that scruffy hackers at MIT did anything that mattered.</span>

                    <span>It comes with 2 DVDs, the first one is the Revolution OS movie and the second one contains interviews and bios of those well known anti-microsoft gangs like Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Linus Trovalds, etc. In the first DVD, it's not really a movie but a kind documentary film. No subtitle but closed caption is supported. Unlike Starup.com movie, this film gets a bunch of well-known gangs who devote themselves to the free & open software revolution to talk about 'how' the free software and open source evolve and 'why' it is getting more & more attention from industrial leaders. It also highlights some companies betting on Linux and open source getting rich at IPO during the Internet bubble, but not forgets to conveying audiences the message that most of those instant millionaires were broke overnight after the bubble busted.<p>If you're not familiar with open source or free software, I recommend you should put on the disc#2 and watch the Bios section first. Since the movie in disc#1 embeds a lot of people talking and comments, you may find confusion of who & what. In disc#2, besides the bios and some interviews, interestingly, it also includes the first version of the famous well-known paper written by Eric Raymond, 'Cathedral and Bazaar'. This paper actually played a very critical role on Netscape's direction to the open source world.  You can read it from your TV screen, and press your remote `back' and `fore' to flipping pages. Although this is convenience for people who do not have computer and read the paper on TV screen, you may find it's quite annoying to flipping and reading twenty something screen pages on your TV. After a while you may feel dizzy. Unfortunately, the DVD does not come with a PDF or other softcopy version of this famous paper in the open source world. If you are interested on how Netscape went to the open source path, there's another good documentary film called 'Code Rush' from PBS, you may also want to check out.<p>Overall, this is quite informative, knowing how the free/open software revolution begins and the reasons behind it. If you want to have a good intro of this open source communities, this is a pretty good choice.</span>
