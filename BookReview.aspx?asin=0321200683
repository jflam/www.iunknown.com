                <span id="Label1">I recently wrote and delivered <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com">ObjectSharp's</a> Services class. One of the key ideas in the class was that systems are implemented using modules that are connected via messages. 
<br><br>I became aware of Gregor and Bobby's book based on a recommendation from Sean McGrath. However, I deliberately avoided reading it while writing my class since I wanted to craft my own story.
<br><br>Once I had a chance to sit down and read this book, I was amazed by how effective it is in teaching a pattern language for describing asynchronous message-based systems. Gregor and Bobby obviously spent a lot of time categorizing the patterns in the book and carefully crafting them into a comprehensive cross-referenced "story".
<br><br>They also did a great job of inventing a series of icons that are used repeatedly throughout the discussions of various patterns. They are great at reinforcing the names of the patterns, and your eye quickly gets trained to recognize composite patterns that emerge during the detailed discussions of the individual patterns.
<br><br>You don't need to wait for the web service vendors to come up with an implementation for WS-ReliableMessaging. You can apply the patterns in this book using many of today's existing technologies. The book strives to be technology-neutral, and presents implementations of various patterns using many vendor's technologies. While this is somewhat jolting to the reader, it also serves to whet your appetite for what implementations look like on competing platforms.
<br><br>If you are interested in service orientation, and the impact that async message-based systems will have on your organization's applications, you owe it to yourself to purchase a copy of this book for every member of your team. Much like the seminal Refactoring book by Martin Fowler, the pattern language that it introduces into your team is absolutely invaluable.
<br><br>At ObjectSharp, we are making this book mandatory reading for all of our consultants who are involved in systems integration. </span>

                    <span>This is the third pattern book in my collection (the other two are Analysis Patterns by Martin Fowler and the definitive Design Patterns by the Gang of Four) and IMHO this is the best example yet of where patterns can really improve the development process. This is the first book I've seen to address the area of enterprise development where the real heavy lifting takes place. Applications don't miraculously integrate with one another; it takes talented, knowledgeable IT personnel to wire everything together. If you're one of those people, Enterprise Integration Patterns is an important addition to your toolkit.
<br />
<br />Chapter 2 takes the reader through the integration efforts of a fictional enterprise to demonstrate some of the patterns in action. The descriptions of the problems and their possible solutions... just make sense. You can really see the benefit that these patterns provide to simplifying, organizing and clarifying the situation. </span>

                    <span>Overall I am quite impressed with the quality of this book. The authors took a great look at the patterns involved in messaging architectures as traditionally practiced in EAI applications. If you are an experienced architect, you will find the patterns applied to many enterprise applications. If you don't have a few large-scale type projects under your belt, you won't think many of the suggestions are useful, applicable, or even necessary. If you do, though, reading this book will be well worth your time.</span>

                    <span>I had been waiting for this book for several years. There are many good books on software architecture using synchronous communication, but nothing on asynchronous communication --- the typical scheme when connecting existing applications. This is surprising since the underlying products (MQ, MSMQ, WebMethods, Vitria, etc.) have been around for a while, some for more than 10 years, and the techniques have become increasingly well understood by the practitioners. There are even some books on the individual products --- several on MQ for example --- but nothing more general about how to use messaging, message routing, and message transformation to build a larger system.<p>This is the book I had been waiting for. Furthermore the authors have avoided the usual three pitfalls of technical books: it is well organized, it well written, and it is deep treatment, not at all superficial.<p>The book is organized into 65 patterns (in the manner of the classic _Design Patterns_). Each pattern shows one typical problem in integrating applications, and how it is solved. Each pattern gives enough implementation details so it is clear how it would work, and an example or two so it is clear how it works in practice. For example the Message Expiration pattern addresses the problem of "How can a sender of a message indicate when a message should be considered stale and thus shouldn't be processed?"<p>The writing in this book is clear. For example "A Message Expiration is like the expiration date on a milk carton. After that date, you shouldn't drink the milk." The authors have also invented icons for each of their patterns. Their icon language allows a integration architecture to be visuallized in a way that UML does not provide.<p>Amongst the 11 pattern-describing chapters are 3 "interludes", chapter-length examples that explain a problem, show how patterns can combined to solve it, and then provide implementations in different technologies (JMS, .Net, TIBCO, MSMQ, etc.).<p>My only beef with this book is that it is long and dense: almost 700 pages. I bought it in late December 2003 and I am only finishing it now. But it is hard to say what should have been cut. Certainly none of the patterns are unnecessary, and the decription of each feels like about the right length. The interludes are also useful for seeing how the patterns fit together. So maybe this book just needs to be 700 pages.</span>

                    <span>This a book about enterprise integration solutions, authors claim that they are technology neutral, it is true. In the examples and implementations, they chose 3 most popular messaging frameworks to illustrate the patterns. However, they are pretty biased toward messaging as the "better" solution to enterprise integration strategy. It may have a lot of edges over the other approaches, sometimes it is just easy to use a simple wrapper/facade to do the integration. But I guess authors really intend to push their messaging solutions as the subtitle indicates.<p>Having said that, this is an excellent book of message pattern language, which I believe is the first one introducing the interesting topic. The books touches from the architectural patterns, e.g., messaging bus, pipe and filters, to common design patterns, e.g., publish/subscribe, request/reply, to some patterns that most MOMs provide as integrated solutions, e.g., durable subscriber, message filter, message expiration etc. With all these patterns at hand, a system architect would be able to craft a messaging pattern-oriented enterprise integration architecture by applying the appropriate patterns compositely.<p>The book would be better if authors describe some patterns implementation in more detail. E.g., it would be interesting to see how the message expiration is implemented, does the message contain a timer or the message channel monitor each individual message from start up?  How does the channel interact with the message and check the expiry? Guaranteed delivery is another example. I know most of these implementation details only interest MOM developers, whereas pattern users are only interested in how and when to apply the patterns, but now that the book is about patterns themselves, implementation details would be appreciated. <p>Since all the patterns introduced in the book form a messaging pattern language, knowing each pattern's strength and limitation under the context, scope and different forces, and how it interacts with other patterns to form a bigger(composite) pattern are essential to grasp the pattern language.  A collaboration diagram to show each pattern's transition/migration/composition to each other would be helpful.</span>
