                    <span>I read this book as a follow up to "Keep The River On Your Right". Again, Tobias takes us where few of us have ventured before. This exploration takes us to the primative people of New Guinea. Tobias gives us an excellent narrative of encounters with the people. In addition, we have insight to the politics and policies of the 1970's, when these people are invaded by the outside world as the need for natural resources become greater. Those who are interested in primative cultures, anthropology and third world experience will highly enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>Having visited the region where this book is set I found it mostly interesting for giving a picture of how things used to be there - they are much changed today!<BR>For those who haven't been to the Asmat region of New Guinea, this will be a fascinating read. Those inspired to go should be prepared to find it a lot more civilized these days.</span>

                    <span>Variant, modifying New Guinea cultures - such is the conclusion thatTobias Schneebaum has accepted after compiling his social science fieldresearch at the end of an odyssey in the jungle on the second largestisland on earth. Wild spirits, he infers in his book, Where the Spirits Dwell, could be mitigated by an unconventional search in the mysteriouswilderness. Schneebaum's field research has taken the social scientistto a group's most sacred customs and practises, giving an intimate bird's-eyeview on New Guinea. By participating in the daily spirit of the tribe he wasable to collect data and now has shared his insightful findings. Most socialscientists aim for the goal of presenting men in society as they naturally act.But to catch human nature surreptitiously requires the type of field researchthat is found in Where the Spirits Dwell. The secluded denizens were an attraction for the social scientist since he has investigated the hypothesisabout the visual and thinking processes of the Asmat tribesmen by using the Lowenfeld Mosaic Test. But he also was drawn to the society by the tantalizing unknown. The author states, "perhaps it was nothing more thanthe thought that what lay on the other side of the mountain was more excitingthan what was immediately around me." Some thoughtlessly have minimizedthe Asmat's thrill of discovering the first Caucasian. Years ago, social scientistand subject wanted to enjoy the intimacy of their encounter. The reader is attracted to the heart of the secret society which comprises some aspectsof religious belief and many views of sexuality. Pursuing his field researchthe anthropologist's methods are justified by the freedom of inquiry and the pursuitof knowledge but perhaps he also may have achieved greater insight because the people sensed something in him that attracted them instantly. Tobias Schneebaumconveys the condition of a solitary social scientist's world. Besides the freedomof inquiry it is filled with the limitations of dangerou</span>
