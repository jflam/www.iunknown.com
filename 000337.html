<p>I've been building a small set of tools that I need for my upcoming writing project. These tools will integrate some third-party tools into a standard NAnt build script. Recently, I wanted to add support for automatically generating <span class="caps">PDF</span> documents from my Office documents (Word and Powerpoint). I learned quite a bit of stuff while building these tools, and this entry summarizes some of these observations.</p>

<p>Observation 1: <span class="caps">COM </span>Interop. I have somehow been able to avoid <span class="caps">COM</span> interop until now. The first thing I learned was that <span class="caps">VS.NET</span> doesn't enumerate the <span class="caps">GAC</span> when generating the list of .NET assemblies in the Add References dialog. Office 2003 installs its primary interop assemblies into the <span class="caps">GAC,</span> but fails to copy them to <code>\program files\microsoft .net\primary interop assemblies\</code>, which is one of the directories that are enumerated by the <span class="caps">VS.NET</span> add reference dialog. If you want to add additional directories to the set of directories that <span class="caps">VS.NET</span> enumerates for the Add References dialog, you need to add additional keys under <code>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\AssemblyFolders</code>. I fixed my <span class="caps">O2K3</span> interop problem by manually copying assemblies from the <span class="caps">GAC</span> to <code>\program files\microsoft .net\primary interop assemblies\</code>.</p>

<p>Observation 2: Adobe Acrobat and the entire Windows printing system are a nightmare to automate. For those of you who don't own a copy of Acrobat, it is software that lets you generate <span class="caps">PDF</span> documents from any Windows program that is capable of printing. So, if I want Word 2003 to generate a <span class="caps">PDF</span> document, I have to make it print using a printer driver called "Acrobat Distiller". If you're a human being doing this, it's no big deal. You just tell Word to Print, and when Acrobat Distiller pops up a dialog box that asks you where you want to put the <span class="caps">PDF</span> file, you enter it and you're good to go.</p>

<p>Now imagine that you're an app trying to automate this process. It's a freaking nightmare. You tell Word how to print the current document via the <code>Document.PrintOut()</code> method. There are a million options that are available in this method, but of course, none of them are "the place where I want Adobe Acrobat Distiller to put the generated <span class="caps">PDF</span>".</p>

<p>As it turns out, I can tell Word to print to a temporary file. This is possible because I can pass parameters to <code>PrintOut()</code> for the path to the generated file. In a weird quirk of implementation, this doesn't tell Distiller where to put the <span class="caps">PDF</span> file. Rather it tells Distiller to generate a <span class="caps">PS </span>(PostScript) file!</p>

<p>This adds an additional step to the process: converting the PS to a <span class="caps">PDF. </span>To do this, you have to create an instance of Acrobat Distiller as a <span class="caps">COM</span> server and call its <code>ConvertToPDF()</code> method. You pass it the path to the PS file and the path to the output <span class="caps">PDF</span> file.</p>

<p>But wait, life isn't set quite yet. Remember that Acrobat Distiller is a printer driver. As such, it needs to be configured. And of course, all of the default configuration settings are wrong. If you try and tell Word to print using the default configuration settings, you will get a number of errors that are expressed as popup dialogs. That would, of course, be a nightmare in an automated NAnt build script.</p>

<p>I still haven't figured out how to configure printer settings programmatically yet. There really needs to be an <span class="caps">XML</span> configuration file for every printer driver, so you can use an <span class="caps">XML API</span> to whack configuration settings instead of having to learn yet another arbitrary <span class="caps">API </span>(YAAA) for programmatically setting printer driver settings.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, I've finally got everything working today. A suggestion to Adobe: write a simple wrapper <span class="caps">API</span> that solves this problem. I am more than happy to donate my code. This will eliminate one of the most common sources of frustration that are encountered by users of your product. </p>

<p>One final observation. If you're running as a non-admin, you can interactively run Acrobat Distiller to your heart's content. But if you want to start up Acrobat as a <span class="caps">COM</span> server, it doesn't work. This smells like a <span class="caps">DCOM</span> permissions problem, but my first look around here doesn't fix the problem. Grrr.</p>

<p>Might I recommend Win2PDF? http://www.win2pdf.com<br />
It performs the same duties Distiller does and fully supports the ability to pass a destination filename to Word's PrintOut method. Only costs $35, too. I used it for a project that automatically converts hundreds of documents from Word to PDF every day, and it worked very well.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link, Andy. What's interesting about their product is that they chose to emulate the old Adobe way of specifying the filename for the output PDF file - via a registry key. While a nasty hack, it's necessary until we get some facility for passing XML manifest files to embedded drivers in applications. </p>

<p>>I fixed my O2K3 interop problem by manually <br />

<p>What's your take on the versioning issues with regards to a common location for PIAs?<br />

<p>Hmm. Using the registry is just one way of accomplishing that - my apps simply used the OutputFilename parameter of PrintOut and never mucked about with the registry.</p>

<p>I have quit using NAnt and instead am using Menees' MegaBuild tool, which is great for automating VS.NET builds without starting VS.NET.</p>

<p>The utility can do lots of stuff and has a nice GUI. Check it out at :</p>
