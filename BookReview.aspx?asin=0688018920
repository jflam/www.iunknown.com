                    <span>We can't expect this to be as great as Ball Four, and it's not. But on the other hand, it's something that Ball Four isn't, and couldn't have been  --    a celebration and epilogue of the phenomenon that was Ball Four. After all, at the time that "B4" was written, there wasn't any phenomenon  --   it was just another baseball manuscript, maybe wasn't even going to be published. But it became a surprise best-seller and a huge STORY, and this second book tells the story of that story.<p>Some of the most interesting and delightful portions of this book are the reviews and letters about Ball Four. And expert comments. For example, Willie Mays: "I don't read them kind of books."<p>If you loved Ball Four, you'll revel in this book. If you merely liked "B4," skip this one.</span>

                    <span>Sorry to report that this book is nowhere near up to the standards of Bouton's marvelous Ball Four. The tone is defensive and some of the humor--such as the gang-bang incident--has a nasty edge.  It's hard to blame Bouton for being defensive, however, since he was attacked so strongly after the publication of BF.  Nonetheless, some of what he writes here sounds self-serving and disingenuous.  He implies that no ballplayer with a strong marriage would find that marriage undermined by the contents of Ball Four, but you've gotta wonder.  How many baseball marriages, already strained by long separations, could stand the extra stress of the husbands' now nationally-known infidelities?  As I read, I kept wondering, too, whether Bouton was still married to his beloved Bobbie.  (After reading the most recent edition of Ball Four, with its Epilogues, I learned--no surprise--that Bouton and Bobbie are indeed divorced.)  The book has flashes of Bouton's inimitable style and humor, but all in all, it's a come-down from Ball Four.</span>

                    <span>This relatively small but engaging book tells the story of Bouton's last half season (not counting his comeback in '78), his work in broadcasting, and all the aftermath of publishing _Ball Four_.<p>It reads exactly like a continuation of _Ball Four_, and in fact I'm surprised that the two have never been amalgamated into a single edition.  Here Bouton shares the ways in which his first book changed his life, making him both famous and (to some) notorious.  A number of letters he received are included, as are some of the book's early reviews and reactions.  In rereading it for this review, I not only laughed a lot, but I came away astonished once again at the conniption big league baseball had.<p>If you like _BF_, you've got to find this one.</span>

                    <span>As Jim Bouton continually updates "Ball Four" every decade, his summary of his life's upheaval created by the book makes for entertaining reading, especially from a satiric iconoclast like himself.  This is the  basis for "I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personally" a title which  came from sportswriter Dick Young, after Bouton reminded him about when he  referred to Bouton as a "social leper".  This sequel to  "Ball Four" deals with the book's success, the financial wheeling  and dealings that the neophyte Bouton fell into, and mostly about Bouton's  failing baseball career, which "Ball Four" brought into focus.    The loss of his career, the upheavel it creates and the loss of the  cameraderie of the dugout pained Bouton, and we easily fall into his  plight, as well as the unbridled success that the book gave him.  Following  reprints of "Ball Four" have updated his  personal/professional  saga, but none of the updates are as readable (or as funny) as "I'm  Glad You Didn't Take It Personally".</span>
