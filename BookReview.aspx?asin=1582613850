                <span id="Label1">Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters were the premier All-Pro safety tandem of the Cowboys&#146; Doomsday Defense and played in five Super Bowls together&#151;winning twice. They were teammates from 1970-80 and never experienced a losing season. Both were named to The Dallas Morning News&#146; All-Time Cowboys Team and both received the NFL Legends Award. Tales from the Dallas Cowboys is a fun look at one of the most beloved teams of all times. From what really happened during Franco Harris&#146; TD run up the middle in Super Bowl XII to Coach Tom Landry's suggestions on pre-game meals this book is a hilarious collection of never-before-told stories, told by one of the NFL&#146;s most famous duos, All-Pro safeties, Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters. They share with you their memories of the 1970s and &#146;80s&#151;from being over-looked rookies to playing for America&#146;s Team in an unprecedented five Super Bowls. Their stories involve teammates, both famous and infamous, such as Duane Thomas, D.D. Lewis, Tony Dorsett and Roger Staubach, salty veterans such as Walt Garrison, Mike Ditka, Mel Renfro, Cornell Green and Bob Hayes and legendary foes like Terry Bradshaw, Bart Starr, Dan Dierdorf, Lynn Swann and John Unitas.</span>

                    <span>Before Darren Woodson and Roy Williams, there was another Pro Bowl safety duo in Dallas - Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters! The hard hitting free safety, Harris, and the talented strong safety ball hawk, Waters, both shared the field for many of the Cowboys Super Bowl runs in the 70's and were both selected to the Pro Bowl numerous times. Harris and Waters were best friends on and off the field and even started a mutual business out of football. This book might be the best Cowboys book I've ever read and it's recommended for any 70's football fan, regardless of how much you like or dislike the Cowboys, because it's a great look at football history. Both safeties take turns writing small stories about significant moments in their careers. Some of the funniest football stories I've ever read are in this book and you get a chance to see what it was like in the locker room during those 1970's glory days. Because both players worked together so well, there are some great insights on defensive strategy the Cowboys used, including a few mistakes that didn't quite turn out the way Waters and Harris expected. I wish more players would team up and write a book like this because it's one of my favorite football reads in many years.</span>

                    <span>I got this book as a Christmas gift since Brad Sham's book "Stadium Stories" had been sold out in the local stores--and I can highly recommend this book to all who want to hear the inside story of how Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters made the club, and some of the inside stories about the players and front office people. Among those are how Gil Brandt, director of player personnel, wheeled and dealed to help Harris and Waters...how Charlie got his tasseled aligator shoes, and how Brandt helped Cliff Harris work out playing for the Cowboys and taking nine weeks of basic training to work out his military obligations simultaneously.<P>Anyone who grew up with the Classic Cowboys of the Tom Landry era of the "Doomsday Defense" will find it a wonderful and entertaining nostalia trip. It is a great read for anyone who loves the Cowboys!</span>

                    <span>This book brings back many memories, most fond, some not so fond, of a glorious period in the Cowboys' history. These stories give "insider insight" to many events that I remember watching or listening to on the radio. The book gives even more understanding on why these two safties are almost always both mentioned in the same breath; they remain a tandem.</span>

                    <span>If you followed the Cowboys at all during the glory days of the 70's, this is a must read. These stories are an interesting look at America's team, told from two men who helped them to 5 super bowls. Highly Recommended!!!</span>
