                <span id="Label1">For software development professionals and computer science students, <I>Modern Operating Systems</I> gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000.<p>   What makes an operating system modern? According to author Andrew Tanenbaum, it is the awareness of high-demand computer applications--primarily in the areas of multimedia, parallel and distributed computing, and security. The development of faster and more advanced hardware has driven progress in software, including enhancements to the operating system. It is one thing to run an old operating system on current hardware, and another to effectively leverage current hardware to best serve modern software applications. If you don't believe it, install Windows 3.0 on a modern PC and try surfing the Internet or burning a CD.<p>   Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, <I>Operating Systems</I>, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls).<p>   The first half of <I>Modern Operating Systems</I> focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing groundbreaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is enlightening to read Tanenbaum's explanations of the design decisions made by past operating systems gurus, including his view that additional research on the problem of deadlocks is impractical except for "keeping otherwise unemployed graph theorists off the streets."<p>  It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system--awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed--a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms.<p>   Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals. <p>   Tanenbaum's mantra is simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Toward this end, he makes frequent references to the Frederick Brooks classic <I>The Mythical Man-Month</I> for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated--with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its "mammoth Win32 API." A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more "user-friendly," which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code. The solution is to have smart people, the smallest possible team, and well-defined interactions between various operating systems components. Future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart. <I>--Pete Ostenson</I> </span>

                    <span>Tanenbaum's book is a thorough yet accessible introduction to the design and implementation of modern operating systems. This second edition explains the trade-offs developers must make and shows readers how OS' have matured since the 1960s. Knowledge of programming in C is helpful, especially if the reader wishes to complete the exercises following each chapter. I gave the book five stars for its content, delivery, and humor, all of which helped me learn a difficult subject in an enjoyable manner.<BR> <BR>"Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Ed" (MOS:2E) is very well-written, which may surprise those who suffer while reading other hardcover college texts. The book introduces problems facing developers, then helps the reader understand both simple and complex ways to address these issues. Tanenbaum's style is lively and informative, like the cover of his books. He appears knowledgeable and opinionated -- especially concerning problems with the Windows OS -- but he can back up his assertions.<BR> <BR>The best features of MOS:2E are found in chapters ten and eleven. Here Tanenbaum illuminates UNIX and Microsoft Windows 2000, respectively, building upon the material found in the previous nine chapters. He gives real reasons why Windows suffers security problems, such as internal complexity, code bloat, and design choices. UNIX is also critically evaluated, but stands up better to Tanenbaum's scrutiny.<BR> <BR>I don't recommend computer novices read MOS:2E. One needs a certain amount of interest and motivation to digest this material, and Tanenbaum's explanations of some concepts did not seem sufficient. However, after having finished this 900 page tome, I feel more comfortable reading about design issues for the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD scheduler. If you're looking to learn the how and why of operating system design and implementation, I strongly recommend MOS:2E.</span>

                    <span>Andrew Tanenbaum ( http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/ ) boots your neural network in the right direction in his classic introductory text to Operating Systems and the pre-cursor to his more recent "Distributed Operating Systems" (ISBN: 0132199084). He presents bit-level discussions addressing the core OS issues of processes, memory management, file systems and I/O (among others). He then buffers the information with in-depth, case study comparisons of unix, ms-dos, mach and amoeba (which Tanenbaum co-developed; see: http://www.am.cs.vu.nl/ ). Tanenbaum does not ignore theory altogether, but puts most of his effort into relaying practical concerns and solutions to real OS's.

<P>
 Tanenbaum's sense of humor never flags or fails to register; a most desirable quality in a technical book one is reading after 8-10 hours in the cubicle world. For instance, regarding the POSIX standard, "The [RFC] 1003.1 document is written in such a way that both operating system implementers and software writers can understand it, [a] novelty in the standards world, although work is already underway to remedy this."
 
 <P>
 The book assumes the reader has basic programming knowledge, though nothing beyond first year C. Tanenbaum has included numerous clear and helpful diagrams, as well as problem sets at the end of each chapter.
 
 <P>
 Thoroughly enjoyed - highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This books is a tough read, Mr. Tanenbaums explanations of concepts is very loopy and confusing at best. I have a fairly strong foundation in Operating Systems but still this book leaves me dazed. In addition to this book I have Operating Systems by Deitel and Stallings and I find that they manage to convey the concepts of OS much more clearly than Mr. Tanenbaum. I would strongly recommend against this book, even keeping it as a reference is a no-go especially considering the cost.</span>

                    <span>I do hope that prospective teachers/instructors at the collegiate level read reviews of books before choosing them. If so, then stear clear of this book. I am reading the 2nd edition version for a college level Operating Systems class. I have had some back books, but this one bites big time.<P>What astonishes me most is not the actual type of errors, but the type of errors combined with the large number of errors. There are so many gramatical errors, one wonders if Mr Tanenbaum uses Word with spell/grammar check enabled. My entire reading flow is disrupted when I have to re-read a sentence and try to interpret his meaning via the incorrect grammar. Even the diagrams are incorrect. <P>For example, on the section regarding Deadlocks, 3.4.1, he doesn't even have the letters correct in his explanation. If you look at Figure 3.5 a and then 3.5 b, you see the discrenpency, in 3.5b he has R where he should have T. I had to re-read the section just to make sure I understood it correctly. How such errors like this could still exist in a second edition is beyond me.<P>The flow from one section to another lacks as well. I just don't find this to be a collegiate level book, and am making an assumption that those who are giving this a high rating are either A) Friends of Mr. Tanenbaum or B) Far above the collegiate level themselves, so much so that they fail to see the errors. You know how it is when you are quite familiar with something that your brain will actually over-compensate and read over errors, or complete pictures/diagrams that are incomplete. <P>I would not recommend this book to anyone, and only give it 2 stars because there is about 30%-40% of value in the book, if you can bypass the errors. Students beware...</span>

                    <span>I have been using UNIX/Linux for a number of years, both professionally (scientist) and as a hobbyist at home. I am not enough of a C programmer to jump into the kernel discussions, but I had a real interest in learning what went on under-the-hood of the operating system. 'Modern Operating Systems' was an ideal match for the questions I had and my level of experience. The discussions were general enough that I could understand the give and take between the components of the operating system. Many was the time that I said 'aha!, that's what is going on.' As he explained mutexes, spinlocks or buffer overflows. I understand a great deal more now, thanks to this book. And, Dr. Tanenbaum's writing style is clear and light enough that the book was enjoyable to read, a rarity in a textbook. While this is probably not the book for everyone, with an interest in knowing more about computers and a little background, Dr. Tanenbaum serves up a real treat in this text.</span>
