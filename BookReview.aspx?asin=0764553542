                    <span>This book hits it right on the head. An excellent, easy to read reference guide on French wine. The book is well-organized and provided good tips and pronunciation keys to help navigate through the French language. This book is a must for the professional or amateur alike and a good value for the money. Useful appendixes contain vintage charts and a handy guide to classes of wine under the rather complex French wine laws.</span>

                    <span>This is an easy-to-read, yet not patronizing, book on French wines. Essentially, its the basics, but it gave me everything I needed to begin exploring and understanding French wines from my local package store. I've enjoyed some really good wines and had fun in the process. This book is easy to use and refer to when you need it. I don't recommend taking it to the wine store with you as you'll look really dumb, but the information is really helpful.</span>

                    <span>This book helps one navigate the strange world of French wine - where the land is more important than the type of grape. <P>The books starts with several chapters on why French wine is considered such high quality, and what the history is behind it. Here's you'll learn about the history and categorizations of wine, as well as overview of the archaic & mind-numbing labelling system.<P>The second section covers France's high profile wine regions, including Bordeaux, Burgundy & Beautjolais. If all you know about Bordeaux and Burgundy is, "They ain't in Napa", you're in the same boat as me, and the book can give you some guidance.<P>The third part covers France's other wine regions, including a section on Champaigne. (Champaigne does count as wine - another lesson for me!) This is helpful if you're traveling in France and want to know what local wines to try.<P>The book closes with answers to commonly asked questions about French wine, as well as exposing one to the myths of French wine.<P>Overall, the book is a great primer and eduational tool for the novice at French wine. (Or wine in general!) It'll help you with the history and feel of the French wine industry. Perhaps it can guide you at the wine shop, though likely not as much as knowledgable individual.<P>It passes the, "Would I bring it with me to France?" test. (I did, and it helped me know what wine to try by region) It doesn't pass the, "Will I be any better ordering wine at a restaurant?" test. (I'm not)</span>

                    <span>Ed McCarthy and his wife, Mary Ewing-Mulligan, began with "Wine for Dummies" in 1995, and they keep getting better at it as they work from big picture to small. After covering all of the wine world in one book they have narrowed their focus in subsequent "dummies" books on red wine, white wine and champagne. Now focusing geographically, they tackle French and Italian wines in two new books. The French book will tell the tale here because French is the most daunting wine for teacher and student alike. <P>That because almost all French wines are named for places (regions, towns, chateaus) instead of the grapes they're made from, which is the practice in most other countries. Thus your Bordeaux could be made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and most often is--but one of the most famous and most expensive Bordeaux, Petrus, is made almost entirely from Merlot. Not that you'd know from the label. You want Chardonnay? The French make it by the long ton but rarely label it as such, preferring instead something like Puligny-Montrachet. Then there is the collection of "cru" classifications for individual estates. This apparent perversity actually reflects the French belief that "where" means more than "what"; that the native heath marks wine and other foods just as a local accent marks you and me.<P>That's why this book is the test: Can the authors penetrate and even elucidate this maze? To their credit and my amazement they can and do. They are wine experts but primarily wine educators. They know this stuff cold but as <teachers> want you to learn and love this stuff as much as they do.<P>In fewer than 300 pages they achieve a great deal--they encourage, instruct, dispel myths, point toward good buys, discuss changing wine-making styles, celebrate new discoveries and pretty much everything else except feed the hungry and clothe the poor.<P>So if you're interested in French wine or know someone who is, you'll be better of buying this book than almost any other. The price is great and the authors are good company--they can <write> as well as teach.<P>-------------------------------------<BR>Bill Marsano is a contributing editor of Hemispheres, United Airlines' in-flight magazine, for which he frequently writes on wine.
