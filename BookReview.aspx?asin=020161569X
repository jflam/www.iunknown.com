                    <span>This book is a GREAT introductory book into the embedded world. Even if you are an experienced embedded engineer, you'll find this book useful to remember basic concepts you might have forgotten with time, but maybe you'll find it TOO BASIC for you.</span>

                    <span>It's just what it say "a primer".  This book seems like it would be great for someone who has never programmed for embedded systems.  However, if you have even a few months experiance under your belt, this book is a big waste of time.  I purchased this book to use a quick refresh after being away from embedded programming for a few years.  Sent it back after reading about 25% and skimming the rest.</span>

                    <span>A good book for introducing embedded systems concepts from a practical point of view.  It is used, along with uCOS-II by Jean J Labrosse, in a one of a kind certificate program course at the <p>University of Washington Extension, <br>Embedded and Real-Time Systems Programming (...)</span>

                    <span>I've been working with embedded systems for 10 years, and found lots of info, I hadn't seen or read before. The chapters on hardware is good info, and the review of RTOS architectures and core functions was a nice refresher. If you're new to embedded system design, then I'd highly recommend this book to nail down the basics.</span>

                    <span>If you are going to buy only one book on Embedded Software Programming, this should be the one.  The author introduces virtually everything an engineer needs to know about programming embedded systems.  There are two chapters describing hardware stuff that is useful for the software engineer to know.  There is a chapter on Interrupts.  There are three chapters on programming in an RTOS environment.  All of the chapters include coding examples on what to do, and also examples of code with bugs to watch out for.  There is also a chapter on debugging techniques.<p>All of the other FIVE STAR reviews (and many of the FOUR STAR ones as well) contain more specific points which I won't repeat here.<p>However, I will echo what I said at the beginnning.  If there is only one book you are going to buy about programming embedded systems, this should be the one.</span>
