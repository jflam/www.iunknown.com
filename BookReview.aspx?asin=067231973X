                    <span>If you are like me; fed up with shoebox size books that are written by 20 people writing half a chapter each with no continuity and a lot of unnecessary information, you are looking at the right book.<P>Like many people I know, I made the transition from COM to COM+ without reading anything and just porting my COM components to COM+. Recently when I had some time at hand, I picked up this book and read it in two days (yeah, try doing that with those 1200 pages books). It's an excellent book but here is a word of caution for you; it's not a beginner's book to COM+. If you have been working with COM (or at least know how to make a DLL and use it in VB), you are the audience of this book. If you don't know MTS, don't be discouraged, you don't need to know it in order to read this book but you do need to know ADO to understand some of the key concepts of this book.<P>The only downside of the book is that the author, while discussing practical application of concepts, keeps referring to the code on accompanying CD. Well, it would have been better if the code were also printed in the book (I know it would have become a little more voluminous but not a shoebox). I found it sort of distracting. As for me, the CD is still sealed in the package it came in and I guessed the code all the way and the guesses worked 9 out of 10 times. It doesn't mean that I am a very good developer; it's only that the author has kept the examples simple.<P>All in all, a true value for your money.</span>

                    <span>I started my COM+ learning experience with Peishu Li's "Visual Basic and COM+ Programming by Example" and then used this book to get a more advanced look at COM+. This was NOT money wasted. I highly recommend both books to users wanting the learn about COM+ and n-tier. This book is very well written. Developers with a background in MTS may want to skip the "by Example" book but you definitely want to read this book. Scot Hillier understands COM+ (and MTS for that matter) and his style of writing is pleasant to read.</span>

                    <span>I finished this book over a year ago, and never got around to writing a review. Probably won't help too many with most of the new development moving to .NET, but here goes. Overall, it was solid but I thought it could have done two things better. I thought the coverage on MSMQ could have been stronger and the project at the end did not get tied together as well as it should have. I like the approach of a lot of the Wrox books that really get into detail WHY they're doing something in their projects they use to tie their ideas together. I felt as thought the author really almost rushed this section of the book, and, in doing so, missed the opportunity to really drive home his points. Hopefully he reads these and will take a page out of the Wrox books in really getting down to explaining his reasoning and what is going on when he's tying his ideas together with a project in his next book. I thought he did an outstanding job up to that point though.</span>

                    <span>It's a great book to possess, When it comes to Component programming. After Don Box "Essiential COM", this is by far the best COM+ book I have read. It will give you good understanding about not just writing but design and implementing COM+ Components. Examples are great and right to the point.</span>
