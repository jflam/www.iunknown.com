                <span id="Label1">From the author of Kundun, a powerful work that reveals the true horrors behind China's "liberation" of Tibet.  <P>Since 1959, when China claimed power over this tiny mountain nation, more than one million Tibetans are believed to have perished by starvation, execution, imprisonment, and abortive uprisings. Many thousands more, including their spiritual and political leader, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, have been driven into exile.  <P>The country has been systematically colonized, so that indigenous inhabitants are now a second-class minority. Not only are Tibetans being squeezed out by Chinese settlers, but there are reports of Tibetan women being forcibly sterilized and of healthy full-term babies being killed at birth. Thousands of Tibetans languish in prison and suffer appalling torture. Rich mineral resources have been plundered and the delicate ecosystem devastated. Buddhism, the life blood of Tibet, has been ruthlessly suppressed.  <P>Mary Craig tells the story of Tibet with candor and power. Based upon extensive research and interviews with large numbers of refugees now living in exile in India, this book presents four decades of religious persecution, environmental devastation, and human atrocities that have caused Tibetans to weep "tears of blood."</span>

                    <span>Genocide. Ecocide. ugly words, but far worse is the actual doing of these atrocities. the book is passionate without being preachy, balanced in trying to stick to the facts without over dramatizing them. its is well written and easily read, convincing and deeply saddening. a must read for anyone desirous of knowing what is going on on The Roof of the World.<P>realpolitik versus the faith of the Dalai Lama and the people of Tibet. chinese communist with the millenium old chinese racism and serious blindness to all things not-chinese versus poor, buddhist, hill people. Tibet is loosing and may already have lost.<P>One thing missing from the book is an impassioned and reasonable plead of why the West, European and American people should give a damn about what happens in such a remote, poor, unimportant part of the world. her argument stems only from a call to justice and a call to the unity of humanity. and this is relatively unspoken. it is assumed in her passion for the people and Tibet and justice for there case.<P>Give me a minute to argue the Tibetan case.<BR>1- you buy Chinese goods, these effectively support the government and allow the rape of this poor country and its people<BR>2-there is a unity of humanity. we in the west are detribalized and owe little loyalty between the level of our families and the national governments.<BR>3-the connectedness of all is real. for instance. ship the tibetan forests to china, silt load in the major rivers in India will be enormously increased. the destruction and flooding there will kill millions and destroy the wealth of another poor nation. this will have great effect on the military and political situation in this volitile region.<BR>4-in is an example of the nature of chinese, communist, secular, expansionist, imperialist power at it rawist, most destructive, murderous.<BR>5-the tibetan people through the Dalai Lama partly, but through their faith have much to teach the world, and they are doing so in actions, with their bodies and lives in a way that shames the materialist West. a very important lesson about what is really important in life.<P>but after all of this. <BR>justice freedom faith<BR>are more than words. they are deeds.<P>and this book will help you understand why some people are killing other people in Tibet. today. tomorrow.</span>

                    <span>Mary Craig's Tears of Blood is a masterful account of a history long overlooked and disregarded by the international community, the history of 20th century China's brutal invasion and occupation of Tibet. Ms. Craig has gone even further than most to support the struggles of the Tibetan people, refuting point by point the standard line of the Chinese government, "Tibet has always been a part of China." A must read for anyone even remotely interested in human rights or Tibetan independence.</span>

                    <span>This is a must read book. As the west invites the China that Mao created to share in the wealth and the market place it is ever more important to understand the brutality and ruthlessness of the current Chineese government. <P>This book presents a clear and well documented look at the atrocities that have been inflicted on the Tibeten People in the name of official Chineese "liberation". 1.5 million bodies or 1/5 of the tibetan population from killings, starvation and brutal torture are all spelled out. Most of the dead are buddists and therefore do not believe in a response by violence.<P>If you like your facts in glossed over versions check out the movies 7 years in Tibet, or Little Budda or the best of the bunch, Kun Dun. <P>For an well written and easy read of the whole horrible truth of a genocide that picks up where Hitler left off.This terrible situations continues to this day and this book is a must read. <P>As a nation we have to understand the monster that is the truth of the Chinnese Government and this book tells it all. You'll read this and then run to your nearest word processor to write your congressman and demand that before we allow China any more of the fruits of the free and capitalist system they have to change their stance on respect for human rights. This country has not only attempted to distroy a people but they are trying to human spirit in Tibet.<P>Want more, run a search on Tibet and take a visit to the official web site of the Tibetan Government In Exile. But what ever you do do not ignore this book.</span>
