                <span id="Label1">Jim Wallis is the theological equivalent of a jackalope. He's an evangelical protestant with a strong streak of sympathy for works righteousness. As he explains in <I>Faith Works: Lessons from the Life of an Activist Preacher</I>, "in the Bible, faith is not something you possess but rather something you practice. You have to put it into action or it really doesn't mean anything. Faith changes things. It's the energy of transformation, both for individuals and for a society." For decades, Wallis has channeled the boundless energy of his faith into religious activism. He may be best known as the editor of <I>Sojourners</I> magazine and a founder of Call to Renewal, an evangelical ministry to the poor. <I>Faith Works</I> is a genre-busting book that includes elements of memoir, self-help, sociology, politics, and theology. Each of its 15 chapters conveys a spiritual lesson designed to compel readers to put their faith into action and make a difference in their communities. Here are the first three lessons, which will give you some idea of the respectful, humorous, and demanding tones that sound throughout this book: "Trust your questions," "Get out of the house more often," and "Use your gift."</span>

                    <span>Gee, we have to have "Faith Based" organizations to change lives and neighborhoods across America.  What a load of BS.  From the day this country was formed there were people taking care of people whether faith was involved or not.  Walls just loves to get preachy on the platform of righteousness.  People who care about others are religious or not.  They just have a basic need to get outside of EGO and place the welfare of others equal to their own.  To place Religion doctrine (which is NOT necessarily "Christian") before the feeding of the hungry is as anti-Christian as it gets. </span>

                    <span>I really liked the preview of this book.  Jim says many things we have all heard before but says it so well!  I too believe we need to look beyond our backdoor or comfort zones and really open our eyes to what's going on  around us.  By that I mean nationally and internationally.  There are many  things wrong in this world and unless we as Christians are willing to take  up the cross of Jesus in mission and doing for the least of them, things  will remain as they are.  Mr. Wallis has written a book previously entitled  Who Speaks For God?  It is excellent and explains the Sojourners magazine  he is the editor of.  I would encourage all readers to explore his work.</span>
