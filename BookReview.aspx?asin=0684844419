                    </div>
                    <span>In Huntington's model of international relations, there are several civilizations in the world: the West (Europe, USA), 
<br />Sinic(China, Korea, Sinapore and Taiwan), and Islam. Other civilizations he mentions are Orthodox (Russia, Greece, Serbia, Romania, etc.), Latin America, Japan, Buddhism (mainland Southeast Asia), and Hindu (India). These civilizations relate to each other with varying degrees of hostility or cooperation. That's the thesis; it's pretty simple and really it probably shouldn't be so controversial.
<br />
<br />But there are several sources of controversy.
<br />
<br />In general, he infuriates liberals because he allows that race and religion are factors in politics, and he is a realist about the nature of politics and the fact of violence.
<br />
<br />He believes that the West is declining relative to Islam and Sinic civilizations. He is obviously correct, although it infuriates American patriots and many proud Europeans. The rise of China is creating huge changes in East Asia, as Chinese military and economic power becomes the dominant factor, replacing American power. Managing this transition is one of the great challenges of current US foreign policy. He was among the first to recognize this.
<br />
<br />He famously says that Muslim civilization has bloody borders, mentioning conflicts between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Balkans, Nigeria, Sudan, Kashmir, the Caucasus, Israel-Palestine, Lebanon, Chechnya, Xinjiang, the Philippines, and perhaps a few other examples. This infuriates many liberals, including especially liberal Muslims.
<br />
<br />However, he evidently believes that these conflicts stem primarily from a demographic youth bulge. He also believes that if there were a clear leader of Islam, as Russia is the clear leader of the Orthodox, that its borders would be far more peaceful. So, contrary to some of his critics, he does not believe that Islam is inherently violent. In fact, he explicity recognizes that Christianity has been as militaristic as Islam has ever been. (So he manages to aggravate many Europeans and Christians as well.) 
<br />
<br />But for whatever reasons, Islamdom and Christendom are obviously generally in conflict. Huntington was among the first to recognize that this conflict is one of the principal issues of international relations today. The conflict is complex, however, and Huntington's treatment of it here is quite brief and simplistic, and few people interested in it will be satisfied. In particular, his description of the Balkan conflict will upset most people who have not considered a Serbian perspective.
<br />
<br />He does not believe the West should try to push its values on the rest of the world, including the concept of human rights. Internationally, he is a multi-culturalist, believing that the West should not bother trying to spread its culture: it just creates unnecessary conflict. Other cultures will not accept Western principles anyway, and they have their own principles which are just as good. This infuriates many liberals.
<br />
<br />He seems to think the United Nations is irrelevant, and he portrays the "Davos Culture" of Western-oriented leaders in other cultures as basically irrelevant. You can guess who disagrees.
<br />
<br />However, a lot of his critics believe that he thinks the West is better than other civilizations. He certainly believes the West is a unique and valuable civilization, worth preserving. He explicitly argues that multi-culturalism is cultural suicide for the West. He has a self-consciously white American perspective. This also upsets a large number of liberals and most academics.
<br />
<br />He believes that Europeans and the US should cooperate more closely, with the US in the lead. But of course many Europeans hate the US and its influence, secretly or openly. So guess who doesn't like this idea?
<br />
<br />He believes that the USA could become a divided nation if Hispanic influence continues to grow, and he considers this a bad thing; an implication is that Hispanic immigration and influence should be limited. (I think he might be more explicit about this, as well as his fear of multiculturalism, in his new book, "Who are We?") Again, reactions are predictable.
<br />
<br />He also evidently believes the Europeans are right to resist the Muslim immigrants in their nations, and not to allow Turkey to join the EU. Many liberals, especially North Americans, disagree with him.
<br />
<br />Another source of controversy is that he considers India a Hindu civilization, although it is surely multi-religious. Islam? Sikhism? Even Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and Christianity have significant numbers in India. So however India is to be classified, it is evidently a secular country, and that is why Hindu fundamentalism exists.
<br />
<br />Every big picture must be very simplified, and this is no exception. However, it is a reasonable big picture. I agree with a lot of this picture: China, the US, the EU, Russia (and the Orthodox world) and the Muslim world are the current principal actors in international relations. India and Latin America are due to emerge as well. Peace and cooperation among them are essential. Huntington dwells on conflict and the capacity for conflict; however, he obviously wants to avoid a violent clash of civilizations. Many of his critics did not read the last chapter, in which this is clear, carefully enough. Also, the West, including the US, must accept a smaller role in the world than we are accustomed to. International organizations such as the UN need to be restructured recognizing current realities (rather than the Cold War)--and that will be a reduction in European influence.
<br />
<br />I disagree with him about a lot of things, however: especially his idea of the US' identity, his dislike of multi-culturalism, and that he evidently accepts genocide and torture as relatively normal. There are a number of smaller points as well.
<br />
<br />Anyway, whether you agree or disagree with him, if you want to have an educated opinion on international politics, this book is required reading. I am very disappointed that many reviewers essentially write, "Don't read this! It will contaminate your mind with heresy!" Please. Let the ideas compete. These are important ideas. It may be melodramatic, but the future of the world is at stake, right?</span>

                    <span>Samuel P. Huntington is a figure both loved and hated among certain circles of academia, mostly due to his often controversial claims (such as his recent article in Foreign Policy, "The Hispanic Challenge," which takes a theme of the Clash of Civilizations even further).
<br />
<br />Huntington makes a fairly convincing case, if somewhat simplistic, for ordering the world according to civilizations in the post-Cold War era. Rather than repeat what other reviewers have said regarding this matter, I have chosen to address two concerns that I have seen regarding this book, each of which are misconceived.
<br />
<br />The first concern is that this book somehow justifies American hostility and imposition of democracy in China and Islamic countries, the two challengers perceived by Huntington as perhaps most threatening to global stability. On the contrary, Huntington argues for the recognition that the world is multicultural, and that "Western belief in the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false; it is immoral; and it is dangerous" (Ch. 12). Far from suggest we invade everybody and forcibly impose democratic regimes in places where democracy may not 'stick' due to a lack of Western values, he instead argues for the recognition of a multicultural world. "To preserve Western civilization in the face of declining Western power," he argues it is in the interest of the United States and Europe to: integrate politically, economically, and militarily; encourage "Westernization" of the already Western-leaning Latin American countries; restrain conventional and unconventional military development in China and Islamic countries; and "most important, recognize that Western intervention in the affairs of other civilizations is probably the single most dangerous source of instability and potential global conflict in a multicivilzatonal world" (Ch. 12). Huntington is ultimately arguing for a peaceful world order rather than a West which runs amok, imposing its values on other states.
<br />
<br />The second concern I've seen crop up is that Huntington is entirely a moral relativist due to his belief that the world is made up of differing cultures and value systems. He actually argues that culture is relative, while morality is absolute. As an example, he provides the case of Singapore which in the early 1990s tried to identify a common identity among its Chinese, Malay Muslim, and Indian Hindu/Sikh communities. A White Paper was created defining the "Shared Values" of Singaporeans: "Nation before ethnic community and society above self; family as the basic unit of society ; regard and community support for the individual; consensus instead of contention; racial and religious harmony" (Ch. 12). This White Paper, he argues, integrated elements of each member culture, as well as the Western emphasis on individuality (ostensibly in order to discourage nepotism implicit in Confucian values of hierarchy and family). Rather than attempt to establish a Judeo-Christian/Western standard of world values, such as is implicit in the UN Declaration on Human Rights, Huntington believes that common morality between all cultures does exist and must form the foundation of an international order.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book to anyone with a desire to understand international conflict, and particularly the role culture may play in it. Do not take all of it at face value, of course; read it with a critical eye and what you derive from it will be manifold more than you would have otherwise. This book deserves to be on any political scientist's bookshelf sheerly due to the influence it has had, regardless of whether you agree with its argument or not. Love him or hate him, when Huntington speaks, the entire world listens.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book was written around the close of the Cold War with the apparent goal of answering the question "The end of the Cold War brings to closure the old boundaries and conflicts... what fault lines will replace them?"  I have great respect for Huntington as a historian but I found the overall thesis of this book to be quite questionable.
<br />
<br />Huntington attempts to divide the world into a set of civilizations and attempts to portray recent situations in countries like the Ukraine, conflict between India and Pakistan as being the new sort of conflict taking the place of Cold War era conflicts.  While the specific situations Huntington uses for examples are quite real, I find his overarching theme quite questionable.  For every situation in the modern world that can be described in terms of Huntington's model, there seems to be a conflict that cannot be described in terms of this model.  Where for example, is the rift between the United States and countries like Japan and Singapore, for example?
<br />
<br />For these reasons I do not see how this book provides useful tools for analyzing international conflicts in the post Cold War period.  Even recent issues between the United States and Middle Eastern countries, which might seem to be a poster child for Huntington's approach, the intricate details seem to be much more important than any abstraction of a clash of civilizations.</span>

                    <span>I've noticed that the front of this book has been repackaged with an American flag contrasting with a green Islamic flag.  Talk about false advertising.  This book is not about the current post sept 11 war on terror.  It is a bold thesis about future intercivilizational relations in a post colonial,  post-unipolar world order.  Basically,  Huntington predicts that all of the world civilizations will modernize,  and then attempts to determine who will get along with who,  and who will not get along with who.  Basically China -Islam vs everybody---I think he is way off base in many of his PREDICTIONS.  A great book if you are extremely well read.  A terrible book if you are not well read,  and are trying to get a basic understanding of the world around you.  If that is the case,  read history,  the more ancient the better.  The older it gets(excluding religion,  the less biased it is.  Also,  read stuff from the west's intellectual history.</span>

                    <span>Do we now have a unified world?  No.  There are numerous languages, religions, and cultures.  And not all of them have the same attitudes towards what some of us in the West see as inevitable and uniform modernization.  In addition, demographic changes raise issues such as the potential Islamization of Europe.  
<br />
<br />Huntington warns us that all this implies that there will be cultural clashes in the future.  He says the dangerous ones "are likely to arise from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic intolerance, and Sinic assertiveness."  This is indeed a controversial statement.  After all, such clashes are by no means an obvious necessity.  Nor is it at all clear that in the absence of such external issues, Western society would not have very serious internal problems with totalitarianism and wars.
<br />
<br />The author notes that Islam has "bloody borders," and he gives five possible reasons for it.  First, Islam itself may be inherently aggressive.  Second, there may be the historical legacy of the creation of so many borders with non-Muslims.  Third, Islam's absolutism may be responsible.  Fourth, there is no Islamic "core state."  And fifth, it may be simply that there has been a recent demographic explosion in many Muslim societies that has made a large number of unemployed males readily available.
<br />
<br />Huntington says that the future dominance of Western civilization is possible but not inevitable.  This is also a controversial statement, given that there is great uncertainty both about what Western civilization is and how powerful it really is.  And this leads to some (you guessed it, controversial) conclusions!  Huntington recommends greater cooperation among Western nations.  In addition, he wants to maintain Western technological and military superiority over other civilizations, in particular over Islamic and Sinic countries.  And he advises us to avoid interfering in the affairs of other civilizations if at all possible.  
<br />
<br />It's an interesting book.</span>
