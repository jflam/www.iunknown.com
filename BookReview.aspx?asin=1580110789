                    <span>Well, I should have known.  The title "Decorating with..." tells it all.  It is first and foremost a decorating book that the wife would love.  This book has the best and sharpest color pictures of any decorating book and is very tastefully presented. But it is skimpy or just plain bad at helping you to DIY.  There is little that is useful in technique and little that is useful for tackling the complexities of say installing crown moulding.  But, I can't fault the author.  After all, the title is "Decorating with...".</span>

                    <span>If you're interested in ideas for interior woodwork, this book offers some nice photos that may inspire a project ... and sometimes inspiration is just what's needed to get us out of the chair and actively working. However, if you're interested in executing the work that's shown, an inexperienced carpenter will be hard pressed to succeed based on the information here. No book can substitute for experience, and this book is great for dreamers, but there are better carpentry guides out there if you actually want to do the work.</span>

                    <span>I just recently purchased this book to trim out my house with Crown, base and window trim and decorative caps between rooms. <p>while there are better boooks for pure trim carpentry skills, Jim Tolpin's book comes to mind, I find myself reaching for this book over Tolpin's as it has great color pictures, concise instructions, good organization, and most importantly, ideas.<p>When I was choosing how to make my base moldings, or build the decorative cap, I needed guidance on which moldings to choose, what size they should be proportionally, and how to build them. This is where this book becomes worth every penny--its descriptions and pictures, along with techniques for different styles such as neo classical, victorian and Arts and Crafts, with suggestions on how to put all the components together on walls, floors and ceilings.<p>Overall I highly recommend this book for anyone that's going to trim their house themselves.</span>

                    <span>This book will provide the Do-It-Yourself crowd with the knowledge necessary to tackle a trimwork project with confidence.  With excellent organization, information and pictures, it is hard to imagine a better book for this purpose.<p>Even if you do not plan to do it yourself, the book will provide excellent pictures to help you select the type of trimwork you would like, and will serve as a starting point in a project discussion with a carpenter.  The example pictures alone are worth the price of the book.</span>

                    <span>I have read many books on woodworking. Some of them have pictures of products you would never consider putting in your own home. Not in this book. It is full of pictures of trim work that is beautiful. If you buy this book just for the examples you see makes it worth it. I open it sometimes just to get inspired to higher levels of woodworking.  <br>  All in all well written, and super well illustrated. Highly recommended.</span>
