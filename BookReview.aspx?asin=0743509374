                    <span>let me explain--this is a great book and i love the positive spirit--however there is a thread that runs thru it that i do not like. there is a message of--be helpful to those who are in the "mix" of things, who may scratch your back in the future or people who may be important or beginning to be important--ALSO look out for people you think may have the potential to be important because who is important can and does change--that person may be a peon now, but there is a tomorrow and they may rise!  this is disgusting to me. this is not the way i want to live---like a gold-digger, money-hungry, sneaky devil going around sniffing trees and bushes to see if this is a good place to land for a while. i hate that and i don't like being around people like that. is that being real or helping you on your path to being real? no--and in my opinion, becoming real is THE major part of becoming a leadership master. again, i love the boost, the positive ideas, and stories because they are so against the tide of what many people would do in those situations. especially the "old school" of management in workplaces that it mentions, that of master and slaves---instead it advocates the trend toward whole team teamwork, and cooperative planning.</span>

                    <span>I have been a big fan of Dale Carnegie for over 33 years when I read his classic How To Win Friends and Influence People. While I love to read, I really enjoy audio programs as well. This program combines the best of Dale Carnegies ideas. <p>Also, The Leadership Mastery Course has been updated for the times which makes it a great supplement to How To Make Friends and Influence People. Those who actually read the book and listened to this cd tape set know the difference.<p>Great program. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased this audio program and really enjoyed it. It is a modern updated version of Carnegies ideas.I am confused as to the first two reviews referring to this as a book--it's an audio program!How to Win Friends and Influence People is an all time classic as well as How To Stop Worrying and Start Living. I also recommend The Leader in You.</span>

                    <span>I have read Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and I have also listened to this entire audio program.  Frankly, I think you'll get more benefit from the book.  "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is just great - it's a classic, worth at least 6 stars on Amazon's scale of 1-5 stars.  I'll give this CD 2 stars mainly because it has Dale Carnegie's ideas.  <p>One more piece of advice:  I have read Dale Carnegie's book at least twice and my wife has read it once.  "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is a book you may want to underline, keep, and read again and again.  Initially, I purchased the paperback version.  I suggest you look for a HARDCOVER version.  The spine of my paperback copy has fallen apart after several reads...</span>
