                <span id="Label1"><I>Photoshop 7 Artistry</I> is the book for serious professional photographers and digital artists who need to create expert imagery. This book will help you master the relationship between Photoshop tools and traditional photography. Photoshop Artistry is probably the most successful advanced-level Photoshop book available. It's initial appeal for photographers has been transcended; the basic principles the authors teach apply to all Photoshop users-particularly more-advanced users-and the advent of digital photography has further boosted the book's popularity. Covers creation and output of museum-quality art prints, images for high-end advertising, as well as GIFs, JPEGs, and Web Photo Galleries</span>

                    <span>If you are buying one book to learn Photoshop 7 (or version 6), this is probably your best bet. Learning Photoshop is similar to learning Economics -- you must learn a number of different topics and bring all of that knowledge together in your mind to understand the subject. This is a great book to help you bring together the essential topics and it covers a wide range of interesting and useful areas.<P>Here are the main reasons this is the best book I have seen on learning Photoshop:<P>-Conceptually, the authors have clearly thought through what is essential about learning Photoshop and have indicated which chapters focus on the essential material.<P>-The authors have substantial experience teaching and writing about Photoshop and this experience comes through in the clarity of the writing and examples<P>-The book is big (just over 450 pages), it is full color and every page is densely packed with valuable information that is easy to read, understand and absorb. Most other books on Photoshop are either filled with fluff, filled with white space or short. <P>-The examples are well designed and available on the included CD ROM<P>-This book is useful to the photographer, too. There is even a chapter on digital photography and the Zone System.<P>-I have found the index useful and the book has helped me quickly resolve questions that I could not answer with other books.<P>The table of contents is available here on amazon.com (go to "look inside this book!" and select the introductory pages) and will give you a pretty good idea of the scope of this book. The material available will also help you get a feel for the authors' writing style.<P>If you find this book intimidating, I suggest you look at books by Scott Kelby such as "Photoshop X Photo-Retouching Secrets." <P>Kelby is easy to read, gives good instructions, is easy to understand and really knows what he is talking about (you would be surprised how many Photoshop authors give bad advice which causes degradation of files, for example. Kelby understands the product deeply enough to avoid doing this and to give you good, simple ways to deal with images). <P>My two complaints about Kelby may be his best charms for some readers. First, his books have a lot less content than they might, but the extra white space may make the books more approachable for some readers. Second, he injects a bit too much humor into some of his books. But, as I said, many users may value these "features."<P>Other books on Photoshop worth considering: <P>"Real World Adobe Photoshop X" by David Blatner and Bruce Fraser <BR>"The Photoshop X Wow! Book" by Linnea Dayton and Jack Davis<BR>"Adobe Photoshop Master Class" by John Paul Caponigro</span>

                    <span>New Riders does it again with Photoshop 7 Artistry. The Authors Barry Haynes, Wendy Crumpler and Sean Duggan have comprised a comprehensive list of Photoshop lessons which provide the user with the know how to master almost any digital project. This book is a treasure trove of practical information, tips, tools and techniques sure to kick your Photoshop skills up a notch... or even two!<P>The book begins with a comprehensive in depth overview of Photoshop with chapters such as, Navigation, System set-up and Preferences, Picking and using Color, File Formats and Image Compression right down to Color Calibration and Management. They are thorough and skillfully written, so much so that the novice can understand them. <P>Throughout the book you'll be guided through practical examples of how to create the highest quality digital image by the use of color correction, layers, photo restoration, filters, paint and composition, all aided by an accompanying CD. Section two is reason enough to pick this book up, if not only for the photographic, color, printer, scanner and monitor calibration lessons alone. <P>The Photoshop expert will not only find this an unsurpassable resource but a guide as well to creating that perfect digital image. <P>Above all, this is a must have book for any Photoshop artist... budding or not.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book on Photoshop. There are many books out there which spend to much time going over the obvious but this book differs from that in its approach. If you are a beginner I probably wouldnt recommend this book, but if you have some experience with Photoshoop you will find this book an excellent way to extend yourself. Easy to read and well layed out. The book has a quality feel and is full of useful information...Highly recommended...</span>

                    <span>This is the best Photoshop book I have read. Its subtitle, "Mastering the Digital Image," says it all. <P>As one works through the step-by-step exercises and tutorials, the serious photographer begins to understand the complex relationship between the Photoshop tools.<P>Tutorials are explained in a simple and straightforward fashion. The explanations are grounded in reality, but offer a doorway to understanding the program's theoretical basis. <P>The book is not cheap, but it is a tremendous aid in unlocking Photoshop's potential.</span>

                    <span>It's true. The book is packed with detailed information. But it's mostly the information that I do not care to know or already know. I guess I shouldn't have bought this book because I primarily wanted to know about color correction. So I read about color correction from this book, and I was surprised yet disappointed when not much info on how to write Curves were included. The methods of using Level to correct a picture are rather simple and for beginners only. The before and after pictures are not that big of a difference compared to other books I read.</span>
