                    <span>I'm a brand new developer using VS.NET, and having never used Visual Studio before I've grown very tired of every single book on .NET
<br />spending %60 of their time explaining how it was done in Visual Studio 6, and how it is done in Visual Studio .NET. This book isn't much
<br />different except that I see a shocking amount of emphasis on the "old" ADO method of data access. In fact, if I read this correctly,
<br />there is more written on ADO/ADOX than there is about ADO.NET.
<br />
<br />This is about the 10th book on .NET that I've purchased and every one so far (especially those from MS Press) spend 2-6 chapters talking
<br />about .NET, what it is and why is is so bloody terrific. Book authors, PLEASE, lets stop introducing and re-introducing the same stuff
<br />in EVERY .NET book! Write a "Beginning .NET" for all that stuff and save your readers some time!
<br />
<br />Overall my opinion is that this book is mediocre. What this book is is a general .NET book with an
<br />emphasis on database programming (albeit with the "old" ADO stuff).
<br />
<br />In short, I'm glad I bought it used for only $10.</span>

                    <span>The target audience for the book is, quite simply, Access developers who are accustomed to VBA and/or VB 6. <p>This book serves a good purpose, as the .NET materials I have seen to date all refer to SQL Server in their examples; they acknowledge Access, but fail to show its uses. I am not crazy about seeing "old" technology such as ADO used in some of the examples, but for a book of this nature (transitioning between coding languages) I guess that is inevitable that some old/new information would be included at various points.<p>Do not purchase the book if you're intending to use the built-in VBA capabilities of Access or other Office applications -- that's strictly not covered. What you will find, though, is a good sense of how VB.NET operates on its own, and how to create applications that draw upon the data stored in your Access databases.<p>This should be a good base point for someone who's developed in Access, and wants to investigate moving forward; it should be a means to an end, rather than the destination itself. Additional reading on ADO.NET and classes will be helpful, I believe, to continue fleshing out knowledge to be truly effective in your work, but this book does a good job of introducting those concepts.</span>
