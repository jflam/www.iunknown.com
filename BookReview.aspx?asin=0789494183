                    <span>I first discovered these books by accident in a Stockholm bookstore. I had just come from Gothenborg by train and was a bit dazed. The book I bought by accident was in swedish but it still useful because of all the photos, cut away views, museum pictures, and maps and historical details. When I got home I bought a pile on Amazon.com of different places that I was going or had visited - but in english. <P>On a cold day back here in the USA (or Canada) or elsewhere, have a glass of wine and sit in a nice chair or in the garden on a warm day and read this book. For a moment you will be back in Stocholm. You are back in a small restaurant overlooking the Baltic. Thats how good the photos are in these books.<P>The photos and desicriptions and cutaway drawings are excellent. Plus they throw in some history and details on the art and many other things of interest. A solid 210 page effort - lots of stuff to see and absorb. Incidentally Stockholm is a truly beautiful city and I am amazed that more people do not visit Sweden.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>We're planning a trip to Stockholm in Spring 2003. This book is great for those pressed for time, as it gives short overviews of sights in Stockholm, by neighborhood. My only complaint: I wish it had more suggested itineraries. Beautiful pictures and interesting historical perspective throughout, not just in the introduction (as in many guides).</span>

                    <span>I Agree with several reviews ... about DK Eyewitness Travelguides, as a whole serie: It's the most complete, helpful andenjoyable amongst the series i've known. It doesn't mean that eachtitle deserves the 5 stars rating. Despite the insuperable editionscovering Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, Japan, Amsterdam, New York,Prague, Istambul, Tuscany ... There are also editions, like this one(Stockholm), very good, as usual, considering it's a DK EyewitnessGuide (perfect 3D schemes, photos, context info, maps...), but lackingsomething to be perfect: It doesn't cover any site/town located morethan 30 minutes from the capital's centre (ex: the amazing Upsalla),which doesn't happen on the Amsterdam, Brussels and Istambul editions,for instance. Instead, It covers each lost corner of Stockholm,painting it too much greater than this wonderful place actuallyis. The result is a book with 30 or something pages more thannecessary to help the most exigent traveler. As it comes in the bestof papers ... this takes more of our money, puts some"stones" into the traveler handbag and makes the trullyuseful information diluted there. Perhaps that's the reason for thecomplaining issued by a previous reviewer: A guide not muchopinionated. I would rather say: It's not a matter of opinion. TheLonely Planet and Rough guides sometimes opine "snoby", likeintruders, considering us simple-minded, unable to have our ownopinions. It's a matter of to bring or not good/essentialDATA,INFORMATION and TIPS to the readers. This guide has 224pages. Comparing it with the 192 pages of the uniquely conciseBrussels/Antwerp/Ghent/Bruges edition (in fact, all the Belgium in oneedition) the first gives half in change. It's a case of less for more.Anyway, if you plan staying a week in Greater Stockolm only (and thecity deserves it), you should take this guide with you. There's nobetter in the market restricted to your purpose.</span>
