                <span id="Label1"><HTML>XML Development with Java 2 provides the information and techniques a Java developer will need to integrate XML into Java-based applications. This book presents a fast-paced introduction to XML and moves quickly into the areas where XML has the biggest impact on Java Development. The book covers crucial topics such as the XML Documet Object Model (DOM), Using Java and XSL to transform and format XML data, Integrating XML into JavaBeans and EJB development, and using XML with Java Servlets. The authors also cover the impact XML has on Java database access and the way XML works with the Swing classes.</HTML></span>

                    <span>I don't like this book for following reasons:<P>- The source code can't be used on a project due to bugs and poor quality.<P>- The author does not know what Java Beans are but goes on to provide a buggy utility class.<P>- About 30% of the book is dedicated to non XML related concepts such as EJBs and Servelts etc.,<P>- Does not explain the concepts of DOM L1/L2 in detail.<P>- Does not describe JAXP in sufficient detail.<P>There are few more reasons, but I will stop here due to lack of time...<P>The landscape of Java & XML is very dynamic. There are lots of good books on XML but there are no good ones that provide good conent in the context of Java and JAXP. There is no point in buying this book unless company is paying for it.</span>

                    <span>XML Development with Java 2 is not quite as solid a work as it might appear from first glance. The examples, though thorough in their coverage, are incomplete in several respects. To explain: one of the first code samples in section 2.17, is not included on the CD Rom source (how many others are missing?); the book fails to mention which of several third party Java libraries are needed to build the sample applications, and much of the required software is not on the CD Rom so once you identify the libraries you must find, download, and install each one from the internet; the Java 2 compiler complains of deprecated apis; compiling chapter 8 sample code results in complaints that classes cannot be found - listing 8.6 calls for sams.chp7.XMLUtil, which doesn't exist. <P>Having complained to the technical support link at the back of the book, the only response was that they appreciated the comments and would consider what would need to be done for the next edition of the book. <P>Overall, I am impressed with the content but am non-plussed by the level of quality and technical support. If you want a book that you don't have to second guess, this book may not be for you.</span>
