                <span id="Label1"><HTML> Jack is back with the update to his best-selling, award-winning Photoshop Wow! Book! Readers have hailed previous versions of Jack Davis's landmark book as the "most useful Photoshop book ever" because of its practical, real-life solutions and its value-packed CD-ROM. The <B>The Photoshop 7 Wow! Book</B> simply ups the ante with even more time-saving techniques&#8212;completely updated for Adobe Photoshop 7.<P>In the <B>The Photoshop 7 Wow! Book</B>, the focus is on the visuals: Using beautiful, full-color pictures of professionally designed Photoshop projects, this volume clearly lays out the steps required to re-create these spectacular results in your own projects. To work visually, you need to think visually, and this book allows you to do just that. As with all of the titles in this popular series, the emphasis here is on results&#8212;how to produce the best work in the fewest steps possible. And sometimes that means using techniques even Adobe hasn't thought of, such as the Wow! Media Painting and Layer Style techniques introduced here. <P></HTML></span>

                    <span>I've already read Deke Mc Clelland's Photoshop bible, and was looking for a book that would explain me how to combine different functions in Photoshop, rather than just explaining where you can find a certain filter and how to use it.<P>Well, this is just the book that offers what I and may'be you needed. Advanced techniques and great inspirational stuff, and all this comes at a reasonable prize because the book is in full colour and on the CD-Rom that comes with it, you'll find all the pictures from the book (pre and after handling). And yes, lots of goodies too: layer styles, brushes, actions, ...<P>An absolute cracker. In fact, you can read it in bed, and it's calming to look at all these beautifully designed pictures, you can start designing the day after.</span>

                    <span>This is an awesome Photoshop 7 book, but it is not really designed for novices. If you are new to Photoshop look elsewhere..but if like me you have a few years into it you will really appreciate the professional skills taught here. Every page is packed with tips/skills/insights! Absolutley fantastic, and you can spend serious time learning from this book and CD. A definite must for the committed Photoshop user, but just don't spread the pages too much as they start to fall out after a while. Oh yes, the print quality is nice with full glossy color on most pages. Get it! (PS: There is a lot of redundancy with the Photoshop 6 WOW book, but to me it's worth buying the new version just for the 7 additions).</span>

                    <span>These people really know their Photoshop. Many reviewers have complained that the book is unsuitable for beginners, but I bought it immediately after buying Photoshop (which I'd never used before)and I've found it to be lucid and easy to follow. Anyone starting out in Photoshop has to be ready to deal with the learning curve-the program does EVERYTHING, so of course it's complicated. This book provides a thorough rundown on all sorts of great techniques, is clear and specific and beautifully illustrated. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>While this book appears to be great for advanced users, it is certainly not a beginning photoshop book. After reading the previous reviews, I thought this book had it all. After purchasing it I was disappointed. It does not cover the basics as I had expected. If your looking for an introductory book please look elsewhere. However, I do look forward to using it once my skills have improved.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I really do like this book. I must say that what it does cover, it covers in great detail. It is a must have if you want to have a working understanding of all of Photoshop's features. While short on special effects and a bit too reliant on the proprietary styles and actions provided, my understanding of how to work with colour has been expanded 3 fold. The only complaint is that the first few chapters are a bit scattered and if you are not used to Photoshop, its not hard to get a little lost. They layout is also a bit busy (like the CNN Headlines channel) and can be a bit of an overload at times, but with all the content he covers, I don't really see a workaround for that. On the positive side you can be sure that you're not going to miss much. Around the second chapter, things start to follow a more definite path and the mass of information accumulated in chapter one starts to take shape. Overall, I am very happy with the book and it makes an excellent addition to my Photoshop library.</span>
