                    <span>It's hard to imagine a more ambitious project than writing a natural history of the first four billion years of life on earth. It's even harder to imagine writing it for the interested layperson without making too many oversimplifications or leaving out too much important detail in a book with just over 300 pages. Richard Fortey has risen to the occasion though, and in the process has created a book that's engaging and highly worth reading.<P>You might expect a book like this to be mechanistic, starting at the beginning and cranking by rote through the sequence of events that constitute the earth's history. Fortey doesn't do this. In a cordial and poetic style he first introduces us to the real world of paleontology. A world of dirt, grime and fierce winds on forsaken beaches bordering forgotten islands of the far north. This is where Fortey began his carrier, and where he made a first mark in the study of extinct organisms from earth's ancient past. This first chapter is important because it reminds us that our knowledge of earth's history has come in fitful starts in which chance and luck have played a central roll. Only a fraction of all creatures leave fossilized remains, only a fraction of those are ever found, and even then they must be interpreted through the preconceptions of scientists. The miracle is that we know anything at all - but we do, and what a story it is.<P>Having introduced the working of paleontology, Fortey devotes the second chapter to the origin of the first life forms. This chapter is of necessity the most barren of all. We still don't understand the origin of life, though there have been remarkable strides in recent years. The author describes the central importance of carbon and the fact many carbon-based molecules necessary for life are found in extraterrestrial objects (but he does not advocate the idea that first life was extraterrestrial). He makes a strong point for the proposition that all life originated with a common ancestor. <P>Much of Fortey's discussions about first life discuss the roll that life played in creating our current environment. The atmosphere is literally a created thing, with the oxygen we breathe constituting a poisonous gas given off by the first organisms on earth. This makes creatures like the chemolithoautotrophic hyperthermophiles a little more understandable - first life evolved in an environment that we today would find very inhospitable - and vise versa.<P>From here the book pretty much follows in chronological order with the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The author explains how life first evolved in the seas, how it flourished, about extinction, and the eventual migration of life onto land. Fortey does not simply recite history, though. He has a style that brings these ancient animals and ecosystems to life. I particularly enjoyed his recollection of conodonts. Conodonts are tooth-like objects of calcium phosphate that were used for years as a type of natural chronometer. They belonged to an extinct aquatic animal. They changed as the animal evolved over time and their presence in sedimentary deposits thus enabled scientists to date the rocks in which they were found. The problem was, nobody knew what animal the conodonts belonged too. There was much speculation, and Fortey's telling of the story and its eventual resolution is typical of the way he brings the subject to life.<P>Through all the narrative Fortey does a reasonably good job of helping the reader understand that life did not march onward and upward along a directed path. This is a common misunderstanding, and one that chronological narratives often give. Life did not emerge from the seas and then rise to the air. Rather, like an expanding gas, life evolved to fill unoccupied niches. The simplest and oldest life forms still flourish, and if longevity is the measure by which life is accounted, then we are just upstarts with our few-million-year presence on earth. <P>There is, of course, the story of the dinosaurs. The neat twist offered by Fortey is to show how our understanding and perception of the dinosaurs has changed over time. He compares what we know of them today with how we perceived them years ago. I found this particularly interesting because I can recall as a little boy reading how dinosaurs were slow, had two brains (one in the head and one in the tail) and had to live in water to support their weight. Observing how our perceptions of dinosaurs have change so dramatically in my lifetime is a real-life dramatization of science at work.<P>The dinosaurs have changed our understanding of evolution as well. In times past dinosaurs were synonymous with failure to evolve and change - they disappeared because they were outmoded. Fortey explains how luck and chance are essential parts of the evolutionary process. The dinosaurs were superbly adapted animals. They are gone because of bad luck - a bolide from space - and we are here because some nondescript little mammals just happened to be lucky enough have the right equipment for surviving in the new environment. What had been good for survival changed in an instant, and changed the course of evolution.<P>The book ends with a chapter describing the search for our past and an epilogue on chance and evolution. This is a pretty brief chapter that summarizes the fossil evidence for human evolution and describes our earliest ancestors down to roughly the last ice age. <P>I truly enjoyed reading this book. It is well written and it has a useful glossary and a very complete index. The style of writing is informative yet colorful and full of imagery. Written by someone with an obvious zest for life - "Life" is a top-caliber book and one you won't regret investing the time to read and savor.<P>Duwayne Anderson, February 22, 2000</span>

                    <span>............through the biological history of our planet, written by a world- renowned paleontologist with a distinct ability to share his love for his work with readers.<P>If you are interested, even in the slightest, about the origins of life on earth and the magnificent evolution of species, than you'll simply love this book, which takes us from the first formation of cellular components and cells some 3.5 billion years ago in the waters of the Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian periods to the formation of multicellular organisms including the first animals. The Ordovician Period, during which our oceans teemed with trilobites, reflects the origin of coral reefs, whose evolution, among many others, is traced through to the modern day. The Silurian Period saw the origins of terrestrial plants and began the "greening" of our world which took place over tens of millions of years into the Devonian Period. It was then, during the Devonian, that animal life first crept from the seas onto land. Fortey traces the evolution of fish who ultimately gave rise to a species capable of living and walking on land and who is the ancestor to every terapod (land vertebrates, including humans) on earth today. By the Carboniferous Period, there are traces of terapods all over the earth's land and within it's coal forests. Seed reproduction becomes more common and our world is populated by a variety trees, amphibians, flying insects, etc. This period reflects the dawn of the earliest reptile. <P>We then move to the Permian period during which the supercontinent Pangaea was a single entity. Fortey traces "continental drift" to the modern day with all its amazing evolutionary implications for the landscape and its associated flora and fauna. It is during the Permian that we find the first fossil egg with a shell. At the end of the Permian and again at the end of the Triassic (the period of the origin of the dinosaurs) the planet saw mass extinctions. Dinosaurs dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods which followed, despite the "enlargening" of other animal species, and only their extinction permitted the beginning of the Age of Mammals that followed. The Jurassic also shows evidence of the first reptile-like birds and the Cretaceous gave us the first flowering plants. The book's final chapters take us through the success of the mammal and the rise of man right up to our own species. Throughout the book, the reader never ceases to be amazed at the events that have shaped life on our planet and by the fact that had even a single event been slightly altered, the course of life on the earth would have been dramatically different.<P>Each step of the magnificent process of evolution is highlighted with fossil evidence, be it evidence for a previously unknown species, a better understanding of a mass extinction, new knowledge about animal behavior, or information that allows us to better understand ourselves as homo sapien. I highly recommend this most readable and very solidly researched story of the history of the natural world.</span>

                    <span>British paleontologist Richard Fortey has written a marvelously concise and erudite historical synopsis of terrestrial life from around 4,000 million years ago, when meteors seeded the planet with the elements, most importantly carbon, that allowed for the evolution of organic molecules, to around 25,000 years ago, when Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens founded interior decorating by painting animals on the walls of his cave living-rooms. Fortey's account necessarily leaves off with the beginning of recorded history. (Blessedly, the life forms "Benifer" and Michael Jackson fail to appear in the narrative even once.) <P>The author hits the high points, including the evolution of single cells, the formation of bacterial colonies, the initiation of chlorophyll-based photosynthesis (that ultimately charged the atmosphere with oxygen), the specialization of cells into tissues, the population of the seas, the advance onto land, the greening of the earth, the separation of ancient Pangaea into today's separate continents, the Age of Dinosaurs, the advent of live-birth from wombs, the ascendancy of mammals, and finally the evolution of Man. For me, the most interesting chapter was on the apocalyptic cataclysm which ended the Age of Dinosaurs, i.e. the asteroid which apparently slammed into the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula creating the Chicxulub Crater. The volume also includes several photo sections that provide an adequate visual summary of the text.<P>The time spans of Fortey's tale are almost beyond mental grasp. For instance, at one point the author states that tool making by hominids began about 2.5 million years ago. Yet the style of the tools, the "technology" if you will, then remained virtually unchanged for the next million years. After witnessing the dizzying pace of technological advancement just during the span of my own life, this stagnation for such an incomprehensible length of time is mind-boggling.<P>I wish I had but a fraction of Fortey's knowledge of our world. LIFE should be required reading in every high school science program.</span>

                    <span>It didn't take me very long to figure out that the author had left out of this otherwise engaging and enlightening book the one thing that would prove most helpful to its readers struggling to put this vast amount of information in context- a chart showing the names of the various eras and periods. (The copy I read came from the library, and I took the liberty of creating a chart of the chronology in Excel, cribbed from "What Evolution Is" by Ernst Mayr, and leaving a copy of it on page 1 for the next reader.) Compounding this difficulty is Mr. Fortey's relatively haphazard organization of the material and sparse leavening of information that helps place it in context. For example, at one point in the book, he references dates of 2.5 billion years, and suddenly the book jumps to the Cambrian era of roughly 850 million years ago, with no real attempt to impress that scale upon the reader.<P>The author almost deliberately seems to have wanted to avoid the burden of actually 'educating' his audience, preferring instead to plop down next to him or her at some far-off pub and tell stories, leading a meandering tour of the best spots here and there. The tour is in chronological order, but never is the necessity of actually knowing the relative chronology foisted onto the reader. It almost feels as though to Dr. Fortey, 'education' is a dirty word - too much the dull, plodding stuff of daily life and not much fun.<P>But I disagree with this approach - though this book was written for a non-professional audience, it is still, I presume, an audience that would like to feel they have learned something. Not being able to place most of the insights in this book into a context or framework undercut this goal and he compounded this error through a circumambulatory writing style, replete with cryptic-sounding creatures whose place in life's strata is fleshed out only sparsely. Additionally, though there are three sections of black and white photographs, there were a number of places where a simple diagram or some other graphic would have done wonders for my comprehension.<P>Nevertheless, through my frustration at this book's failings, I was able to glean some worthwhile insight from this book. And while no one would accuse Dr. Fortey of crafting clear, readable and professional prose, his words do allow his natural enthusiasm (and a bit of hubris) to show through. I was delighted at some of the windows which Dr. Fortey opens onto the methods and history of paleontology, and fascinated by his discussion of recent thinking on which creature first struck out onto the land after billions of years in the water. All in all, one could do worse, but as I am beginning to read "Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth" by Andrew Knoll, it is already clear to me that one could also do a good deal better.</span>

                    <span>How can someone summarize the first four billion years of life on Earth in just fewer than four hundred pages? Through his personal expeditions, trials and tribulations, discovery and knowledge, Richard Fortey was able to convey the Earth's life history.<P>The beginning of the book starts out with Fortey's experiences on a geological expedition in Spits Bergen and then on to Australia and England. He writes about his experiences and emotions as he uncovers parts of history that had never been discovered before. Through his discoveries, he goes through what it is to be a Geologist and the different steps you take. Though this is science, Forty believes that science is never free of human emotions and adds every human touch he can to make the book more interesting and relatable to the person. There is not a single paragraph that does not contain some form of a metaphor, relating the Earths history with an English book touch.<P>With conflicting and supporting ideas throughout the book, Fortey never forgets to either give credit or confront an idea from a different scientist. This is a good book for someone who is not completely familiar with Geology and the course of the Earth's history to learn about the history of the Earth. It is written like an English navel, but contains all of the contents of a science and history book. I felt that the metaphors were just eluding the reader from the history and slowing the learning process. Though, I understand his metaphors and human accounts, such as relating dinosaurs to Fantasia the Disney movie to his wife sowing using modified characteristics as the early humans did. I liked how he compared and used examples that everyone could relate to, to convey the Earth and its inhabitant's history. But this book was well written and explaining the ideas, concepts and thoroughly.</span>
