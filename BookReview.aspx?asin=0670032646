                <span id="Label1">Paraphrasing a passage from Machiavelli's <I>The Prince</I>, Kevin Phillips writes, "a ruler can ignore the mob and devote himself to the interests of the ruling class, gulling the inert majority who constitute the ruled." He then says, "Borgia references aside, 21st-century American readers of <I>The Prince</I> may feel that they have stumbled on a thinly disguised Bush White House political memo." These pointed words would sting regardless of who uttered them, but coming from Phillips, a former Republican strategist, they have an added piquancy. In <I>American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush</I>, Phillips traces the rise of the Bush family from investment banking elites to political power brokers, using their Ivy League network, vast wealth, and questionable political maneuvering to obtain the White House and consequently, shake the foundation of constitutional American democracy. Citing the Bush family mainstays of finance, energy (oil), the military industrial complex, and national security and intelligence (the CIA), Phillips uses copious examples to show the dangerous alliance between the Bushes' business interests (huge corporations such as Enron and Haliburton) and the formation of national policy. No other family, Phillips says, that has fulfilled its presidential aspirations has been so involved in the ascendancy of the arms industry and of the 21st-century American imperium--often at the expense of regional and world peace and for their personal gain.  </p> It is hard to tell what offends Phillips the most: the Bushes' systematic deceit and secrecy, their shady business dealings, their cronyism, or their family philosophy that privileges the very wealthy and utterly dismisses all the rest. It is clearly all of these things combined. But at the top of Phillips' list is the dynastic nature of their family power, for it is that concentration of power and influence that strikes at the heart of our democracy. Past administrations have transgressed, albeit not so egregiously, and other political families have had dynastic ambitions. But none have succeeded as thoroughly as the Bushes. Jefferson and Madison would be horrified, and according to Phillips, we should be too. --<I>Silvana Tropea</I></span>

                    <span>Kevin Phillips is a Republican, and he wants you to see him as a Republican's Republican. And because he loves his party he wrote American Dynasty to warn everyone about George W. Bush. Clearly hailing from the northeastern Rockefeller branch of the GOP, Phillips has no love for the cultural conservatives who are ascendent in turn of the century Republicanism. While this work does refer to GWB's connections and then embracement of the religious conservative wing, Phillips' anger is clearly directed at the Bush family's economic policies. Classic Republicans were the party of small government and free markets, yet Phillips paints the Bushes as purveyors of bloated crony capitalism. And if that phrase makes you think of Teapot Dome, Phillips will describe that 1920s scandal, and contrast it, in great detail, with the far more egregious sins of the second Bush Administration.<P>With copious historical references, sources, and background, Phillips shows the recurring themes in four generations of the Bush family. Secrecy begins with the rites at Skull & Bones at Yale University; loyalty, rewarding the faithful and ruthlessly punishing those who speak publicly; enrichment through connections in the public sphere. Image matters more than accomplishments, and George W. probably was the wastrel son because he was tormented by how little he accomplished compared to his father George H.W. (who in turn was less learned and thorough than grandfather Prescott). <P>Phillips also points to the Bush family's dependence on the Walkers, showing why so many Bush sons keep the name alive. It's their money: the Walkers had the cash, the Bushes took advantage of it. Another interesting theme covered is the Bush families incessant avoidance of the term "dynasty" in referring to themselves, and how they push back at journalists who bring it up. And while Phillips goes relatively easy on GWB for his despoilation of the environment (his rage is more toward the corruption than the destruction), he spends an entire chapter plus many more references showing how GWB became a fundamentalist Christian, how he managed his relationship with the Religious Right, and what it means to the rest of the world. Short answer: if this was his base (both in Texas and in the US as a whole, then no one would outdo him in his support).<P>An odd note mars what is otherwise a scholarly yet passionately angry work: Phillips has just as much rage toward 42nd President Bill Clinton as he does toward the Bushes 41 and 43 (especially 43). Yet he asks the reader to take his condemnation on his say-so, calling him immoral, undignified, or the like. Phillips demonstrates that his disgust with the Bushes is merited, but doesn't show any proof of Clinton's weaknesses, probably because he is contrasting his opinions on Clinton's public sexual outing with the rock-solid proof of GWB's moral depravity (false statements to support profitable wars, plundering the treasury for the super-wealthy, no-bid contracts, and religious opinion elevated over scientific research). Yet curiously, despite the unease that these snappings at Clinton induce, they actually end up supporting Phillips' case against Bush by showing Phillips has no agenda with the Democrats. by Maddi Hausmann Sojourner 30 June 2004</span>

                    <span>The Good: Phillips delves into the history of the Bush clan and details the rise, over several generations, of a family consciously dedicated to the pursuit of wealth and power. His account of the Bushes' often heavily veiled involvement in international investments (especially in the oil industry), the U.S. intelligence establishment, Republican politics, and, more recently, in "evangelical Republicanism," are enlightening as to how wealth and power are developed and maintained in modern America.<P>The Bad: For those of us who would use this book as a club to help knock George W. Bush out of the White House in November 2004, it is a rather unwieldy weapon. Phillips's evident dislike of the two Presidents Bush is muted and hardly undercuts the evidence he brings forth regarding their financial, political, and intelligence activities over the years. But the story is a very complex one, involving many threads that Phillips tries to weave into a coherent storyline. He doesn't always succeed. If you are looking for a book to present to a pro-Bush friend or relative, as I was, as a very obvious "smoking gun" with which to argue against Dubya's re-election, this just ain't it, despite all the valid, sound information Phillips presents.<P>The real value of this book, which is why I can rate it so highly and recommend it to anyone, is in demonstrating the way that America's corporate/government establishment really works. There is a strong case to be made that the machinations of this establishment over the past one hundred years, however sinister they may seem to some people, have produced a strong and prosperous United States. But one may also question, as Phillips does, whether the secret dealings of a relative handful of powerful men and families are always in the best interest of either Americans as individuals or of America as democratic society. One has only to consider the current war in Iraq: Our president states that we invaded Iraq, essentially, to defend America's security and freedom by overthrowing an evil dictator; but one is led to believe that, in the mind of George W. Bush and his corporate supporters, "security" means the preservation of their own wealth and power, which means preserving the present U.S. economic structure; and that preservation is directly tied to an uninterrupted flow of oil from the wells of the Mideast to the gasoline tanks and power plants of the United States. They see their own interests as the interests of all Americans.<P>Could they be right? Think of the disruption in the U.S. economy - in the global economy for that matter - if Mideastern oil supplies were suddenly and substantially diminished. Our society and lifestyle have been built upon cheap gasoline and electricity, provided by fossil fuels. The Bushes and their cronies understand this reality with a depth that most Americans can hardly comprehend. And, as Phillips argues, the average American increasingly seems willing to trust his or her rights (and obligations) of citizenship to an imperialistic U.S. government controlled by political and corporate elites. Many of these elites probably mean well in serving all Americans, but is their dominance in our government and in our economy a sign of a decaying democracy?<P>What Phillips sees at stake is not just the influence of the Bush family and the re-election of George W., but America's democratic legacy itself. He points out that Democrats, too, have their elites and dynasties (Democrat Averill Harriman -- railroad heir, diplomat and New York governor -- was a close business associate of the Bushes; and if you count Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Kennedy dynasty now encompasses both major political parties). Rumors that Hillary Clinton is determined to seek the White House reinforce Phillips's contention that some Americans, at least, find something comforting in such familial continuity holding the reins of power.<P>This is not a book that is going to dissuade a fervent Bush supporter from voting for his re-election; a "swing" voter who is willing to take the time to read the book might find it influential. But "American Dynasty" is most definitely a book that will enlighten those with the eyes to see just how the establishment works. The Bushes, for better or worse, are definitely a part of that establishment.<P>Quibble: Lots of source endnotes (and not just from "Vanity Fair!") but no bibliography.</span>

                    <span>This is an outstandingly useful study, not just of the Bush family, but of a brutal and rapacious ruling class. Its power bases are Wall Street, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Texas-based oil business and the British alliance. Its corporatist fascism is destroying America's democratic and republican traditions.<P>CIA director Bush Senior thwarted Carter's efforts to get the US hostages out of Iran, helping to get Reagan elected. After becoming vice-president in 1981, Bush arranged the arming of the mujehadin and Saddam. Bush illegally sold arms to Iran and used the funds to back the Contra terrorists. In August 1990, Thatcher encouraged Bush's attack on Iraq: "George, I was about to be defeated in England when the Falkland conflict happened. I stayed in office for eight years after that." <P>Leading the religious Right, Bush junior portrays America as a new Rome beset by barbarians, and Iraq as Babylon. These fundamentalists use the Bible to justify pre-emptive war (Esther 8:11); Jeremiah 50:8-20 promises that Israel will gain 'from the destruction of Babylon'.<P>The Bushes look after their own: the richest 1% has doubled their share of US income since 1980. The ratio of executive pay to factory workers' pay went from 42:1 to 419:1. The USA and Britain now have the least social mobility in the developed world.<P>Texas capitalists oppose immigration control because they want cheap labour. "In addition to laws inimical to unions, the proven solution for keeping costs down has been Mexican laborers - either illegal immigrants or temporary guest workers ... Their presence in the Texas labor market also applied downward pressure on other wages." <P>The Republican Party and the Labour Party have common policies: imperialism and warmongering, fraud and corruption, government support for religion (faith schools), a class hatred of trade unions, support for freedom of capital (which equals slavery for workers) and for offshore tax havens, a rhetoric of compassion and inclusiveness but a policy of secrecy, deceit and lies. <P>Capitalism in absolute decline generates this kind of politics: the EU and Russia are going the same way too.</span>

                    <span>I finished the book just this morning, after taking my time with it, and my first impression is, MAN! everybody should read this thing (alternating chapters with Machievelli's THE PRINCE.)<P>Originally, beginning it, I was annoyed by the plodding, greyish tone of the writing. I expected something far more inflamatory and biased, and so I put it down then picked it up, then put it down, etc., until I was about a third of the way through it. By then the weight of the accumulated facts hit me, and I was astonished to realize that the conservative tone of the presentation of the material added greatly to its effect. (Naturally, I expected something from a wild-eyed yellow dog Democrat, but not at all.) So I raced through to the conclusion and, yes, there is an extensive bibliography, though it is not given as a separate section. Make your own notes.<P>I'm old enough to remember all the Bush scandals and squeak-throughs -- including the very suspiscious timing of the release of the American hostages by Iran -- and I must admit my suspiscions first began years ago when, watching WW II newsreel footage, I asked myself how it came to be that a motion picture camera and crew were present on an aircraft carrier flight deck when they hoisted Geoege Herbet Walker Bush out of the drink after he ditched his plane? Co-incidence? or OSS-CIA timing and stagecraft? Did they photograph any other fliers of ditched planes? And, is that how you become a WW II hero?<P>Really, one hell of a book!</span>
