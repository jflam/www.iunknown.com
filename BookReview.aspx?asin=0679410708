                <span id="Label1">Although most of this sprawling book is set in the 20th century, it begins on April 29, 1889, when Benjamin Harrison commemorated the first centennial of American government. This 11-year jump-start allows Harold Evans to write about the last major push to settle the Western territories, the gradual dwindling of Native American societies, the rise to prominence of William Jennings Bryan, and other quintessentially American moments of the 19th century.<p>  But make no mistake about it--<I>The American Century</I> is very much rooted in the modern world. Evans's tight, journalistic prose marks the significant events and personages in America's rise to superpower status and offers several educational surprises, such as a two-page spread on too-little-known naval historian Alfred Mahan, whose <I>The Influence of Sea Power upon History</I> shaped foreign policy in America and several European nations. His treatments of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the Watergate crisis are substantial highlights. Juxtapositions such as Ralph Nader and Rachel Carson or Jimmy Hoffa and Cesar Chavez make for a lively overview. The book essentially ends with the inauguration of George Bush in 1989, although brief mention is made to some of what has happened since then. Filled with photographs and contemporary editorial cartoons, <I>The American Century</I> is an excellent one-volume chronicle of a rather momentous 100 years.  </span>

                    <span>You don't really need to read "The American Century" in any particular order. It's the perfect book to play "history roulette" with; on a lazy Sunday when you're sitting by your coffee table, open it at random and you can learn about, say, the 1954 US-supported coup in Guatemala, or the "Accidental Empire" the U.S. amassed after the Spanish-American War, or the struggles between John D. Rockefeller's companies and unionizing miners, or the race riots that gutted Detroit in 1967. Or, better yet, skip the coffee table and put a copy atop your toilet tank--while it's a great living room book, it's an even better bathroom book. Not only can you read it in any order, you can read a lot or a little without feeling short-changed, and you will invariably feel better for having done so. When nature calls, this book will make you look forward to answering.
<br />
<br />Even better than its structure, though, is its author's clear and  easy prose style, and even better than that is his general refusal to write an ideological tome like, say, Howard Zinn's "People's History of the United States." Harold Evans doesn't buy all the conventional wisdom of the left or the right. When writing about the labor movement, for instance, he shows the excesses and the violence of the "company goon" days of the early 1900s, but he also looks favorably on Reagan's decision to fire striking air traffic controllers in 1981. Or when looking at anti-communism in the 1950s, he decries the excesses of McCarthyism but also says that Nixon was fair in his prosecution of Alger Hiss, and that Julius Rosenberg (cause celebre of the American Left) was, in fact, a Soviet spy.
<br />
<br />Evans intersperses the book with great little character sketches about the Presidents who served during these years. F.D.R and T.R., Wilson and Nixon: all come to life with brief vignettes and quotes describing their personalities and their various paths to power.
<br />
<br />It's not a perfect book--Evans buys too many of the standard journalistic mantras about, say, the Reagan tax cuts, and his coverage of corporate America slacks towards the end of the book, and he completely neglects to mention the Challenger explosion, one of the landmark events of the 1980s. But it is a great book, an intellectual swimming pool of sorts--you can hop in for a quick dip or dive in for hours of mental exercise. If you're anything like me, you'll find yourself reading and re-reading it, getting a great overview of a century of American successes and excesses--and enjoying yourself all the while.</span>

                    <span>I listened to all books of the series. I found that it was enjoyable to listen to, quite lively and it helped me in filling some gap in my knowledge of history. As such I would recommend it. <p>Having said that I found that overall it is a popular history book of little scholarly value and as many such books it has strong patriotic, ethnocentric and us-centric overtones. <p>if you are looking for an easy to listen to history of the period, especially if you are not very knowledgeable about it, this is a good book for you.</span>

                    <span>Generally well written prose, Evan's "The American Century" is rife with examples of his left-leaning tendencies.  Throughout the book, every Democrat is described in noble and glowing terms.  Errors made by the liberals are explained away as casual mistakes or honest misunderstandings.  Democrats are universally portrayed as virtuous and well-meaning.  Conversely, all Republicans/conservatives are shown to be mean-spirited and their policies are donation driven and designed to hurt the "average" American.  I understand that every historian writes with a particular bias, but the totality of it here makes the work unreadable to less idealogically-driven readers.</span>

                    <span>This book truly surprised me.  I expected a "coffee table" book full of pictures with not much content.  What I found instead,are recounts of our history often buried.  History that was-and still is- embarrassing for us.  Harold Evans has done his research not by reading about history, but by traveling the country talking with and even living with the people that are the product of our actions throughout this century.  I commend him.  He has opened our eyes to many truths, like them or not.</span>

                    <span>Don't let the "coffee book table" size or look of the book fool you; "The American Century" is a very well written and very well thought out book.  Its central thesis: Through political, economic, and social changes, the promise of American democracy (along with freedom, equality, and justice) slowly became a reality for all Americans.<p>Some criticisms leveled at this book are quite off the mark. One reader slammed Evans for imposing his own views and opinions on the past and thus committing a "cardinal sin."  Ridiculous.  No history is free of judgement or opinions. Whether it is in an overt statement or how the facts are presented, history is never impartial or neutral.  Another criticism is that the book is a product of leftist revisionism.  Perhaps, but a closer reading reveals otherwise.  Evans, for instance, claimed that Ronald Reagan was "no racist" despite the fact he opened his 1980 campaign in the Deep South in the town where the three civil rights workers were murdered.  He was also quite easy on Richard Nixon, describing his handling of the Alger Hiss case as "fair" and dismissing any notions that Watergate was part of some Oliver Stone-esqe conspiracy that somehow involved JFK's assassination.<p>The pictures alone make this book a good buy.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a solid grounding in American history but would like to get a different perspective.</span>
