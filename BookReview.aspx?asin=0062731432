                <span id="Label1"><p align="left">Out of the lifestyle revlutiion of the past quarter century has emerged a new kindof recreational athlete,oen more likely to pursue a physical activity that brings health benefits than to tackle a traditional "rough-and-tumble" sport. As a result, "overuse" or "chronic" injuries, such as "runner's knee" and "swimmer's shoulder", are increasingly replacing sprains, strains, and breaks as the badge of the weekend Warrior.</p><p align="left">The sports medicine profession has responded to the rise in overuse injuries by placing greater emphasis on injury prevention, developing new diagnostic and treatment techniques, and promoting rehabilitation as an aid to full recovery. This is what Dr. Lyle J. Micheli, one of the nation's foremost sports medicine authorities, calls the "new sports medicine."</p><p align="left">In <i>The Sports Medicine Bible,</i> Dr. Micheli responds to the need for more and better answers to the questions posed by recreational athletes desperate for sound medical advice that will help them return to their physical regimens as quickly as possible. He emphasizes strength and flexibility as the keys to injury prevention, encourages early motion rather than immobilization during the rehabilitation process, and recommends other proven techniques that are replacing the sports medicine techniques of past generations.</p><p align="left">This book covers the whole spectrum of sports medicine, including special sections on nutrition, female-specific sports injuries, exercise and the elderly, structuring a workout, flexibility and strength, clothing and footwear, and proper equipment. Separate chapters examine causes and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of injuries to the foot; ankle; lower leg; knee; thigh; hip, pelvis, and groin; back; shoulder; elbow; wrist; hand and finger; head and neck; and skin.</p><p align="left">By following the guidance and guidelines embodied in <i>The Sports Medicine Bible,</i> the recreational athlete can heighten his or her fitness experience, while learning the most modern techniques for effectively managing sports injuries. Written in clear, straightforward language with hundreds of illustrations, The Sports Medicine Bible is destined to become an essential piece of equipment in every athlete's gym bag.</p></span>

                    <span>I bought this book after tearing a calf muscle and pinching a nerve in my back. Although the injuries were not caused by my sports, they did force me to miss a whole season of hiking and biking. Thanks in part to the contents (and the help of a sports medicine doctor), I have recovered well enough to complete an 80-mile hike on the Appalachian Trail in North Carolina (one of the tougher sections in the South).<P>Compared to other books I consulted, this one covered more relevant topics and gave better detailed rehab and conditioning information. I heartily recommend it!</span>

                    <span>After I broke my ankle (not doing any sporting activity)this book gave me the confidence (and the exercises) to work and exercise my ankle during recovery. The book is easy to follow and offers clear (and easy) instructions. Even though I was seeing a Physio - I used this book to hasten and build up the strength and balance in my ankle that had been lost. Even now I find myself doing the exercises when the ankle is "sore". I refer to this book often to seek information on preventing and treating sore areas of the body! I have recommended this book to friends and even a client who all have had the misfortune of breaking bones over the past 3 years. Today I recommended it again to a friend. None of their injuries was a "sport injury" either - don't be put off by the title.</span>

                    <span>I had an elbow injury from weight-lifting. I bought this book at the same time I bought "The Sports Injury Handbook" by Levy. Prior to buying these books, I saw two sports doctors and both recommended I do some dumbbell exercises to rehabilitate. I looked through Levy's book and found not only the same exercises, but others and a better explanation than what the doctors gave me. Then I turned to the "Sport's Medicine Bible," and guess what? It didn't cover it. <P>My elbow injury is healing nicely thanks to Levy's book. As for this book, a waste of time. You would think a book with the word Bible in it would cover everything, but I found Levy's book covers more injuries and sports than this one. And I wouldn't complain as much if this book had a different title, like "Baseball Injury Bible," but it's misleading when it didn't even handle my injury, which is a common injury in weight lifting.</span>

                    <span>If you are going to exercise, there's a good possibility that you will at some point have to deal with an injury. This book will save you a lot of time and frustration if you do get injured, and if you read it and follow it's advice, you will probably be able to prevent injury in the first place.<P> When I developed bursitis in my hip (from running)I saw a General Practitoner, who basically told me to stop running. Then I saw an Orthopedic Specialist who acted as if I were wasting his time because he had patients with REAL problems. Then, I found this book, which taught me all I needed to know about the condition and treating it on my own. It describes the causes of injury and gives you techniques and exercises that actually HELP. I haven't had any problems with my hip for several years now, but I recently developed pain in my shoulder (rotator cuff tendinits) from weightlifting. I had been doing all the usual home treatment things, dreading the idea of going to a doctor who wouldn't help me. Then I remembered this book! I read about the various shoulder injuries and began doing some of the stretching and strengthening exercises the book describes, and within 2 days the condition began to improve.<P>I highly recommend this book to anyone who exercises. It has been a real godsend for me.</span>
