                    <span>I bought this in hoping to find a PL/SQL book that could give me a real life lab exercise. I gave up on this book. The examples would sometime refer to advanced topics not discussed. There were errors. The exercises did not appear to be kitchen tested before the book was published. I am still looking for a good PL/SQL book that has good interactive lab exercises, if you find one please let the rest of us know.</span>

                    <span>This book is awful. Elena, the author, mostly read from the textbook. Anyone can read from the textbook. Why buy this book if the author is just going to read from the text? My suggestions is to go to Oracle and buy their CBT. It is worth it.  </span>

                    <span>If you like a structured lesson, then you will find this confusing. Usually you expect a lesson then examples and labs. In this book the lessons are mixed in the labs. Lessons often use something that isn't covered until a later chapter, but they don't mention this. This book looks to be rushed too early to publishing. If you are OK with a scattered instruction method, then this is the book for you. Unfortunately there aren't many alternatives to this book.</span>

                    <span>With over twenty years in large scale IT development using Java/C++/C/Assembly languages on Unix/Windows 2000/NT platforms, but a neophyte with PL/SQL, I needed a PL/SQL package that would assume no background knowledge in PL/SQL, get me up to speed fast, and at the same time be comprehensive.  In other words, I wanted everything.  This package no only satisfied this need, but opened up new avenues of thought concerning approaches to database programming.  The book is simply matchless (it should get 6 stars--an extra star for the terrific exercises that incorporate hidden pearls of IT wisdom), and yes I have perused others on the market.  Ms. Silvestrova demonstrates that she is a consummate professional.  The flow of the book, depth of the hands-on exercises, and scope of material is an inimitable combination.  This so far may sound over-glowing, but a workman is worthy of her hire.  I would recommend this package to any introductory or middle level PL/SQL student.  If you desire to be a competent PL/SQL professional, look no further.  If you desire to have a guide that provides you with a solid answer to specific types of PL/SQL problems, look no further.  However, if you seek a slick product that spoon feeds you programming palaver (under the guise of teaching), fly you fool:  you have many under-performing options available.</span>

                    <span>Overall this book is is great for someone new to programming and/or Oracle PL/SQL.  The book contains one lab after another to allow the true beginner to practice concepts. This is a real lab book with plenty of exercises, It should not be thought of as a manual.  It is a good book if you need practice and examples that are explained to you.</span>
