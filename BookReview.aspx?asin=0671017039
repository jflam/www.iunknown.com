                    <span>I really enjoyed this book and found it very easy to read - especially for a reference book.<P>I've got my first race coming up this weekend, and Claire's motivational and racing chapters have really helped me prepare. Also, the nutrition chapter was very good.<P>I would definitely recommend anyone new to running buy this book.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. I'm 17 years old, going on 18, and just took up running in early August 2001. I didn't really know much about things like warming up, stretching, and other ways to prevent injuries. And so, in 3 1/2 months or so, I've suffered 3 injuries. First, an injury to my lower left ankle, that took over 3 weeks to heal and then came back for about a week about a month later. Then I had an ITB problem (left leg) that only kept me from running for 3 days or so. Now I'm suffering from a pulled muscle in my upper right thigh that occured about 2 1/2 weeks ago. While I wait for it to heal, I'm reading everything I can about injury prevention, and this book seemed like it would be a good book for that, and also a good overall running book. This book is really amazing. There's tips on everything from nutrition, injury prevention, race training, cross training<BR>(for when you're injured or just need a rest), speedwork, motivation, what to wear, and anything else you could possibly need to know. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is EXCELLENT, I think I have read it cover to cover probably at least 3 times. It covers EVERYTHING you need to know about running, including nutrition, training, weight concerns, motivation, racing, and special women concerns such as pregnancy and menopause. I ran only a one short race when I recieved this book as a gift, and as I read it I became SO inspired that I decided to do a marathon! Through all my training, I think I referenced back to this book at least every other day, and the answer I was looking for was always there. Never in my life did I think I would EVER run 26 miles, but now thanks to this book and becoming so inspired, I can proudly say for the rest of my life "Once when I was 24 years old, I ran a marathon . . .

                    <span>This book is amazing! I am a beginning runner and read this book from cover to cover. It is EXTREMELY helpful! There are chapters that cover everything from selecting running shoes, evaluating running surfaces, running while pregnant, running during menopause, etc. My favorite item is a 10 week beginner's running schedule that lays out a very easy run/walk plan that culminates in the ability to run for 30 min (about a 5K). For you advanced runners, there are also schedules with much higher mileage, i.e. marathons or half-marathons.<P>Kowalchik covers issues for all runners as well as issues specific to women. She also addresess topics such as nutrition, cross-training, and injury prevention.<P>This book is ideal for the beginning to advanced runner. This book definitely helped and motivated me. Give it a try.</span>
