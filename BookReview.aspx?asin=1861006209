                    <span>This books covers a lot and makes you aware of all the possible security issues in a web application.  At the time I bought it there were only two or three books on this topic so I didn't have much choice.<p>Maybe because I'm using 1.1 framework, but I found problems with Chapter 14 discussing Web Service Security.  There were two typos in the sample Web.Config. "loginurl" should be "loginUrl" and "all" should be "All" since case it's case sensitive.  Also, the only way I got the sample on page 353 to work was ignore the instructions and to comment out the whole "<deny users='?'/>" section.  Frustrating. Makes me wonder about the rest of the book.</span>

                    <span>Lot's of good recommedations, but not focused enough. Maybe it's because .NET security is still a hodege-pod of techniques that has no roadmap to follow.  Geez...I still don't know what technique(s) to use for a particular situation.  I can figure it out, but if I have to do that, what's the sense of buying the book?</span>

                    <span>I'm enjoying this book.  The authors break things down thoroughly, providing numerous approaches to a particular task, for example, authentication.  They provide concepts first and then apply it using differnt methods, for example, authenticating a user from credentials stored in XML file, SQL db, etc.  <p>Nothing seems to be skipped in this book regarding the topics they cover.  It leaves little if nothing to be desired.<p>Well done Wrox!</span>

                    <span>I m surprised at the book not being reviewed enough. It s an absolute essential, very well written and real-world wise. I think most people go for language books, ignoring such importand matters as security. How are they planning to deploy their web apps, I wonder. <p>One of the first things to learn from the book is that security is not only an administrator's task but half the job needs to be done by the developer. And that 's where this book comes in. I feel much more confident after reading it, all my question are answered.<p>A bravo! to WROX for doing it again.</span>
