                <span id="Label1">In her introduction to <I>Collaborative Web Development: Strategies and Best Practices for Web Teams</I>, author Jessica Burdman quotes industry leaders as saying, "Web development is crazy." Throughout the remainder of the book, Burdman breaks the process of Web development down to manageable chunks and offers techniques to help you successfully complete Web projects without pulling your hair out.<p> This isn't a book about development tools or programming languages--it's a user manual to the process of managing site development from conception to completion. The focus is on team development since almost all such projects of any scale involve a diverse collection of professionals. Brief interviews with seasoned team leaders add real-world perspective to the topic. <p> Burdman provides frameworks for analyzing both the project at hand and the team you have at your disposal. She tackles the process with a discussion of getting the project off the ground in an organized and complete manner. The material here is presented in plain English instead of with the usual heavy emphasis on flowcharts and management theory. She also doesn't stop with the summary of a single project cycle but covers client issues, team communication, and ongoing team cultivation as well. This book may not make all your projects go smoothly, but it will sure help. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Project scope definition, cost budgeting, team assembly, content planning, team and client communication, client education, quality assurance and testing, team evolution, and case studies.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for the person charged with managing a web development project for the first time, but who already has solid experience in project management per se. There are five areas in particular that are covered by the author which are quite helpful:<BR>1) the roles and responsibilities of the individual members of the project team,<BR>2) an overview of the planning process that should precede any web site production,<BR>3) a framework for communication between team members, third-party suppliers and the client,<BR>4) how to build quality assurance into web project development, and <BR>5) a comprehensive guide to useful resources on the web.<P>While a previous reviewer criticized the comprehensive resource guide as a mistake, pointing out that these resources are mostly out of date, I see it as a positive and laudable effort to introduce the web's fundamental strength (that of linking to other resources) into traditional media. This in essence is what the author means by "collaborative web development": a direct collaboration between team members, third-party suppliers and the client and an indirect collaboration with other suppliers through resources and technologies available via the web. More authors should follow suit!</span>

                    <span>Jessica Burdman has written Collaborative Web Development to assist companies to establish a team concept of Web development. She offers a sound blueprint for Web development that will allow a number of creative individuals to make their own contributions and for companies to better manage every stage of development from beginning to end.<P> Burdman lays down a solid foundation for establishing a serious Web development team. She identifies key team members and their individual responsibilities, she will assist project managers to break down and assign specific project responsibilities, and she will help companies to better manage their people and business policies. Burdman offers noteworthy advice on handling client matters such as payments, their involvement in the Website design process, dealing with roadblocks, thorny issues, and meeting deadlines.<P> A central theme emphasized throughout the book is good communication at all levels of development. Burdman will assist companies large and small to work through the many issues they will face, including many that will stretch their patience thin. The accompanying CD contains a number of helpful demoware development programs and other essential tools to meet a variety of Web development needs. Highly recommended for any Web design and consulting business environment!</span>

                    <span>Maybe this book had some good information in it during the early 90's when all of this stuff was new but now this book doesn't offer anything to anyone. All of the technical stuff is very old and the focus is on very simple stuff like HTML page directories and images while, the team structure chapters are conflicting seem to be written by someone who doesn't really understand the development process, and the project scenarios have little to no value.</span>

                    <span>Three stars is generous, but I couldn't in good conscience give it fewer. The content is good-quality, but is very "shallow." Geared exclusively toward web project teams, I expected to see some new collaborative techniques, or new spins on accepted methodology. What I got (while good) was only a very basic introduction to proper project management methodology. If you are part of, or lead, a web team, and have no experience in formal methodology, grab a copy of this book. Otherwise, look elsewhere.</span>
