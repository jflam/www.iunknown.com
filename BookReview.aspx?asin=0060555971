                <span id="Label1"><p>Before Barry Bonds, before Reggie Jackson, before Hank Aaron, baseball's stars had one undeniable trait in common: they were all white. In 1947, Jackie Robinson broke that barrier, striking a crucial blow for racial equality and changing the world of sports forever. <i>I Never Had It Made</i> is Robinson's own candid, hard-hitting account of what it took to become the first black man in history to play in the major leagues.</p><p><i>I Never Had It Made</i> recalls Robinson's early years and influences: his time at UCLA, where he became the school's first four-letter athlete; his army stint during World War II, when he challenged Jim Crow laws and narrowly escaped court martial; his years of frustration, on and off the field, with the Negro Leagues; and finally that fateful day when Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers proposed what became known as the "Noble Experiment" -- Robinson would step up to bat to integrate and revolutionize baseball.</p>      <p>More than a baseball story, <i>I Never Had It Made</i> also reveals the highs and lows of Robinson's life after baseball. He recounts his political aspirations and civil rights activism; his friendships with Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, William Buckley, Jr., and Nelson Rockefeller; and his troubled relationship with his son, Jackie, Jr.</p>     <p>Originally published the year Robinson died, <i>I Never Had It Made</i> endures as an inspiring story of a man whose heroism extended well beyond the playing field.</p></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I finished this autobiography about three months after finishing Marlon Brando's autobiography, Songs My Mother Taught Me.  Jackie Robinson had been off and on my mind for several seasons, and reflecting my general state of ignorance about the man, I'd reduced my thinking to the mantra, "There's many greats, but only one first."  (Subsequently with regard to Marlon it occurred to me, "Yes there's many greats, and only one last.")
<br />
<br />These two consummate American performers had much in common - enormous strength of character, almost unbelievable talent, and most admirably the will and ability to continue learning throughout their entire lives.  Most importantly, they inhabited the borderlands.  And in the borderlands wisdom is found.  
<br />
<br />Both started out as establishment-favored "outsiders."  And by the ends of their careers, believe me, they were both no-longer-favored-by-the-establishment outsiders, in spades.  Marlon had refused an Oscar and Jackie, well Jackie never turned his back on Branch Rickey, his first, great white friend and benefactor.  But from being a Booker T. Washington sort of Nixon supporter in 1960 and a Rockefeller Republican, if Jackie were alive today I'm sure he'd be a W.E.B. DuBois, Rainbow Party sort. 
<br />
<br />I'm not a sports fan and never have been.  But I always seem to have one or two sports heros  whom I follow irregularly.  Before reading this book, none of my sports heros were historical.
<br />
<br />It is a fine book about an extraordinary man of extraordinary courage - another of the "greatest generation" that put us in Vietnam, and Jackie of course supported the war in the 1960's.  In the book, he says he later realized it was a mistake to do so.  
<br />
<br />Highly recommended. </span>

                    <span>The accomplishments of Jackie Robinson epitomize courage.  Dr. Martin Luther King was once quoted as saying the he could not have done what he did , if Jackie had not done what he did.  With this set up from the greatest Civil Rights leader, I was anxious to read Robinson's autobiography.  However, I found myself a little disappointed in the book.
<br />
<br />I Never Had it Made devotes only about one-third of its text to Jackie's baseball career.  While I was disappointed in this, I realize Jackie was more than a baseball player.  My greater disappointment came in the bitter tone in which much of his post-baseball career is told.  It seemed as if Jackie felt the need to apologize for any mistakes he felt that he made.  I know Jackie did not want to be remembered as being bitter so this tone surprises me.  While Jackie did make some questionable choices for example about which political candidate to support, I do not think anybody held it against him.  The most revealing chapters discuss his son, Jackie Jr.  The story behind his oldest son's life and death show what a thoughtful man Robinson was.  More than any of the other chapters, I think chapters about his family and son demonstrate the character of Jackie Robinson.
<br />
<br />While I enjoyed the book, I am not certain Jackie knew what he wanted to say in this book.  A lot of the book is composed of stories of his life.  In other portions of the book, he seems to be defending himself.  Since Robinson died shortly after the publication of this book, I must wonder if it was rushed.  </span>

                    <span>This book tells of the struggles Jackie Robinson faced as he made a name for himself in the game of baseball. This is a wonderfully writen autobiography that tells the emotion and physical hardships he faced not only in the major and minor leagues while playing baseball but also in his everyday life as well.While perservering through all this, he succeeded to a degree of breaking the color barrier in the United States. As a child he witnessed constant racism from neighbors, children, and many others that came into contact with him. His mother brought him up to be very strong and independent because when Jackie was about one or two his father went to the city and never returned. He left her with nothing but thier five children who were all too young to work and support the family. Eventually after being forced to move, they went to live with Jacies uncle in California.<br>      This book really showed me how hard he had it. Not only did he have the pressures of playing in the major leagues but also have to worry about prejudist on the field and in the stands. You will see how he didnt have a friend to talk to unless his wife, Rachel Robinson, would travel with him during the season. There was no one who even dreamed of having a black man in baseball until the dodgers took on Jackie. Baseball has never been the same because of the influence this one man has had on the sport itself and many if not all other sports indirectly.<br>         "I Never Had It Made" tells Robinson's early years and influences such as his college experience at UCLA, where he became the school's first four-letter athlete;World War II , playing with the Negro Leagues; and when Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers asked Jackie Robinson to play, which was known as the "Noble Experiment".The league itself recieved a lot of critism from fans during the timethis "experiment" was unvealed.Jackie Robinson expesses his deppest feelings in this book and writes of his relationship's with individual player's and managers. He also talked of the few he had arguments and different views in many areas. There is many accounts of important games such as the 1955 World Series, when jackie Robinson and the Dodgers won against thier rivals.<br>        This book is a great story of one man's determination and detication to a sport he loved to play through thick and thin. He did this in the faces of all those people who said it could never happen,.it would never happen, and blacks will never say in major league baseball in the United States.Jackie Robinson was a true hero</span>

                    <span>"I Never Had It Made" by Jackie Robinson is an amazing biography of one of the most remarkable figures in the history of baseball. There is much more to Robinson than just baseball. From his fight for respect in the US Army to his support of Rockefeller, Robinson deserves much respect for this and is probably one of the best symbols of everything this country should represent. Much of the baseball critics doubted that he could even hit a big league pitch. Tom Candiotti said major league pitchers would "knock the bat right out of his hands." Robinson's critics claimed he couldn't hit because "he was all tied up at the shoulders and could never get around on the pitches inside." Jackie Robinson gave all of us, not only athletes, but every person in this country, a sense of our own strength. However, because I am an athlete, I looked at Jackie a little differently. This is not all about baseball; it's about the deep commitment that Robinson made to achieve justice for himself and all Americans. In 1947 Robinson broke the color line in the major leagues and suffered terrible abuse for doing so. He discusses his relationships with the sports figures he admired, and also recalls his run-ins with those he did not like. It is later about political involvements after his career ended in 1956 and his friendships with Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, William Buckley, and Nelson Rockefeller.</span>
