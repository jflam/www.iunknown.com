                <span id="Label1">A revolutionary new approach to diagnose, treat, and delay the onset of the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. <br><br> One out of every two families in the United States has a member with Alzheimer's or a related disease. Using their "Shankle-Amen Dementia Screening Test" in conjunction with medication, supplements, and physical exercise, Dr. Shankle and Dr. Amen have developed a program to prevent, delay, detect, and possibly halt Alzheimer's disease. The plan, combined with Dr. Amen's revolutionary brain-imaging techniques (which allow physicians and patients to monitor the workings of an individual's brain and the effects of treatment), will teach readers to employ early detection screening tools and early intervention strategies to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease as well as other forms of dementia.</span>

                    <span>I have been waiting for 3 years for this book to come out and it meets and surpasses my expectations. Dr. Shankle treated my mother for Alzheimer's and is treating my father for other neurological problems. Concerned about getting Alzheimer's myself, this book is both reassuring and informative, offering concrete steps we can all take now to reduce our risk of dementia and suggesting memory screening annually for everyone over 50. The essential message of this book is that dementia, like any serious illness, is best treated through prevention and early intervention. The book includes a web site for free memory screening and other easy tests to do at home and includes a chapter on current research. There are valuable ideas on finding a good doctor and web sites to go to for more information.</span>

                    <span>As someone whose father died from Alzheimer's and whose mother is suffering from this terrible disease, I wish this book was written years ago. I've read a lot about the disease and Drs. Shankle and Amen have written the best user friendly book on the subject. The brain diagrams, along with the descriptions of the areas of the brain, and what behaviors each area is responsible for, makes for an enjoyable read. Most importantly, however, is the overall upbeat tone of the book. An early diagnosis can make a huge difference in the life of the sufferer as well as their caregiver, so one need not feel their condition is hopeless. The new therapies Dr. Shankle mentions, along with over-the-counter supplements show real progress has been made in treating all kinds of dementia. Another important aspect of the book is the Shankle-Amen Early Dementia Detection Questionnaire which assesses one's risk factor. I know from taking this test that I need to have a neurological check-up every year since both parents had Alzheimer's, and by doing so I can effectively stave off the disease. This is an easy read on a complicated disease. Shankle and Amen are to be commended for knowing their audience and speaking to them appropriately. Well done!</span>
