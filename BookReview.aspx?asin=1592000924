                    <span>Breaking into the world of shader technologies can be a daunting task and a constructing a library of accurate knowledge is essential.  "Shaders for Game Progammers and Artist" is one of the most focused books I have ever purchased.  It only covers 'shaders' and does not attempt to present the surrounding technologies of DirectX or OpenGL programming.  At fist this tight focus disturbed me, as I did not have a secondary support book like "Programming Vertex and Pixel Shaders".  Put these two books together and constantly cross-reference the code and you have the solution to understanding the core of building good shaders.  (One other note:) You might want to add "3d Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development".  </span>

                    <span>As an artists I am amazed that nobody had yet considered writing a book on real-time shaders that could appeal to artists. Although somewhat technical (hard not to get technical when dealing with per-pixel lighting), this book does a great job at going through a multitude of techniques in an easy to understand way. Plus, the use of RenderMonkey as an edit tool makes the task so much easier!
<br />
<br />A must for all technical artists!</span>

                    <span>I have to admit this is a great book on the topic of shaders and real-time graphics. Unlike most books on the topic of computer graphics, this one does not bother explaining (yet again) how to create a DirectX window and goes straight into the topic of switing vertex and pixel shaders.<p>The plus of this book is that by avoiding the use of a specific API or speding time exlaining the use of such API, most of the book is spent explaining several techniques rangind from screen effects to advanced lighting techniques such as spherical harmonics. And all this is done through the use of the RenderMonkey tool...<p>My only gripe about this book (why i gave it 4 stars) is that although most of the topics are complete sometimes the author jumps straight into some complicated new concepts without taking enough time providing the necessary background information.<p>Finally, as a side note, this book DOES include RenderMonkey 1.5, which isn't yet availible through ATI.</span>
