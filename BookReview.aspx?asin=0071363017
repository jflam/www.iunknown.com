                    <span>Suitable for non-technical people. Very light on detail. Just an 600 pages overview of UMTS technologies and doesn't provide a clear picture. Books by European centric authors offer much better reading and clear picture of the technology (Kaaranen, Korhonen, Holma, Muratore). It seems "demystifies" series books from Mc Graw-Hill are less technical than the publiher's "professional" series books. 3G Wireless Networks by Collins from Mc Graw-Hill (Professional) is also a better raading.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, THE book for detailed introduction to Third Generation Wireless Communications Systems. The authors cover all the issues in an easy to read format.</span>

                    <span>It's a pretty good book for people who'd like to learn more about next generation wireless technologies. This 3G Wireless Demystified book covers 1G, 2G, 2.5G and 3G wireless networks and various air interfaces used and/or are proposed for these networks. It also does a very good job of listing applications and business opportunities for new wireless services.  While it doesn't provide in-depth design engineering level coverage of any particular wireless topic, it does offer a very good broad overview on everything pertaining to 3rd generation wireless.</span>

                    <span>This book offers a general overview of the 3G technologies (also 2G and 1G) in a technical nature that's easy to understand by a technical person. However, frequently the reader will find repeated materials that shouldn't be there. The format of the book is not exactly very professional compare to book of similar subject. The authors should try to improve the writing and organization in the next edition.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book has a lot of good info, but is riddled with silly errors, nonsensical text, references to figures that either don't exist or which discuss something else in the text and general clutter not to mention amateurish illustrations.  In places it seems like all three authors wrote their own paragraph on a topic and rather than condense them down they instead printed all three back to back!<p>The overall usefulness of the book is clouded because of this.  If the authors and editor couldn't catch some of these basic flaws, who is to say that anything else is valid?</span>
