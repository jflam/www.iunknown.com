                <span id="Label1">Touted as a <I>Ball Four</I> for the new millennium, Jose Canseco's <I>Juiced</I> promises to expose not only the rampant use of performance-enhancing substances in baseball (with steroids replacing the amphetamines of Bouton's day), but the painfully human flaws of its heroes as well. A steroid devotee since the age of 20, Canseco goes beyond admitting his own usage to claim that with the tacit approval of the league's powers-that-be he acted as baseball's ambassador of steroids and is therefore indirectly responsible for "saving" the game.<p>  Chief among his claims is that he introduced Mark McGwire to steroids in 1988 and that he often injected McGwire while they were teammates. According to Canseco, steroids and human growth hormones gave McGwire and Sammy Sosa (whose own usage was "so obvious, it was a joke") the strength, stamina, regenerative ability, and confidence they needed for a record-setting home run duel often credited with restoring baseball's popularity after the 1994 strike. Although he devotes a lot of ink to McGwire, Canseco envisions himself as a kind of Johnny Steroidseed, spreading the gospel of performance enhancement, naming a number of players that he either personally introduced to steroids or is relatively certain he can identify as fellow users. Because Canseco plays fast and loose with some of the facts of his own career he provides fodder for those looking to damage his credibility, but in many ways questions of public and personal perception are what raise the book beyond mere vitriolic tell-all. Those willing to heed his request and truly listen to what he has to say will find <I>Juiced</I> to be an occasionally insightful meditation on the workings of public perception and a consistently interesting character study. <I>--Shane Farmer</I></span>

                    <span>Jose Canseco obviously wrote this book to cash in on his last few moments of fame.  That's fine.  Ostracized by baseball, he partially wrote this book as revenge.  Fine by me.    Most people either bought this book because of this, or have refused to buy this book because of it.  Once people get past their initial excitement or hang-ups, they'll find a pretty good read nonetheless.
<br />
<br />This is honest, sometimes amusing, and a good page turner.  Jose Canseco fully admits his mistakes in terms of steroids.  He spends a considerable amount of time talking about how he used steroids, how he helped others, and even though he's entirely wrong, which even he admitted later on, he does explain the supposed benefits of steroids.  
<br />
<br />The best part is to hear someone's interpretation of baseball.  Whether you agree or not, he does bring up some interesting topics.  He asks why did the Rangers (and owner George W. Bush) trade for a well known steroid abuser?  He explains the complex and possibly corrupt relationship between umpires and players.  He talks about players cheating on their wives.  He explains the media and how it props up certain players.
<br />
<br />He also explains the details of his personal life.  Though standard fair, it's still pretty interesting.  It's about his experience growing up, his ex-wife, his cars, his daughter, etc.  The Madonna chapter was quite surprising because of how, well, dull, it all was.
<br />
<br />The one thing that hurts his credibility in the book is the constant self-victimization he perpetuates.  You get the feeling that he thinks everyone is after him.  After reading this, you feel that Canseco honestly believes that Major league baseball, the Florida police, the media, and the umpires are in some OJ type conspiracy to get Jose Canseco.
<br />
<br />All in all, I enjoyed reading it.  It's a short yet fluid read.  I found it insightful, amusing, and interesting.  Though I don't entirely agree or believe everything he writes, it's influence on baseball is undeniable.  </span>

                    <span>Instead of pawning this book off to someone else I am going to use it for toilet paper. It is no doubt the worst book I have ever read. I got more out of reading "pipi longstocking goes to the south seas" to my daughter. Its no wonder his fellow baseball players hate the guy. He is an embarrassment to baseball. The 1% of the book that has any merit are overshadowed by the 99% of the book where he talks about himself.  </span>

                    <span>In a previous review, someone wrote 
<br />
<br />"he's a complete liar, For instance, he says he pinch hit in GAME 6 of the 2000 World Series which was only a 5 game series. What else did he get wrong? Save your money. If you want to buy a good baseball book try "Ball Four."
<br />
<br />I think Jose meant Game 4, not game 6 (in which he did pinch hit and struck out). As you can see he's not the Brightest of the bunch, but i believe that most of what he said in the book is true. </span>

                    <span>All those millions for playing a "game" and he still comes off as being so bitter towards everyone and everything about baseball in this book???  It's really difficult for me to feel any sympathy for someone like this who has literally no education, no writing skills in this case, and has to inject illegal performance enhancing drugs to make it in his profession.  I went to many games at the old stadium in Arlington when he played for Texas in the early 90's and we used to watch him drive by in his Lamborghini with some "babe" in the car.  Do I feel sorry for him at all?  No way Jose!  At least Pete Rose just gambled, Jose should be banned from baseball for life and all his statistics stricken from the record books.  Oh, and one more thing; don't quit your day job just yet Jose!  You maybe need some sort of steroid to enhance your writing skills.</span>

                    <span>I had no intention to buy this book, but when I saw this at my local library last week, I couldn't resist picking it up. We've all heard about or seen the recent congressional hearings involving the issue of steroids in baseball. Who can forget Mark McGuire's sad "I'm not here to talk about the past" statement, over and over again?
<br />
<br />"Juiced" is Jose Canseco's autobiography and the thing that grabbed me was not that this was an apology, but rather a plea (!) for the use of steroids. Early in the book, Canseco writes "Yea, you heard me right: steroids, when used correctly, will not only make you stronger and sexier, they will make you healthier". Wow, you gotta have guts to write that. That said, Canseco has an ego bigger than his biceps. He claims to have "single-handedly changed the game of baseball by introducing [steroids] into the game". Urr, sure. The book is an easy read, with lots of fluff (such as Canseco's short semi-involvement with Madonna), the pages just fly by.
<br />
<br />The merit of the book is not the book itself. Rather, I am glad that this brought the issue of steroids in baseball to the forefront. It is ridiculous, looking back, how some of baseball's long treasured records have been blemished by steroids. Here's hoping that something will be done about that once and for all...</span>
