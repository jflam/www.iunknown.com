                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Oracle Developer Forms Techniques describes the concepts and techniques needed to build Web-enabled applications with Forms. The book covers advanced topics in great detail, including understanding and overcoming error handling limitations in Forms, such as errors which cannot be tracked through normal FORM_SUCCESS or FORM_FAILURE, ordering by items based on FK look-ups, obtaining Query Count without actually executing a query, and performing an exclusive server-side commit from Forms. The book also covers object-oriented methods in Forms, and Intelligence in Forms. Code segments are provided to help developers implement these techniques, thus easing application development time and effort.</HTML></span>

                    <span>This book is badly written, and the organization could be considered bizarre or non-existant, depending on your point of view.  <p>That being said, if you really want to dig deeper into Oracle Forms, this book might help.  The author shares a number of useful tricks, and the code is available at the publisher's site, so that is a help.  In keeping with the bizarre tone, the code is in Word format, so if you don't have Word (I don't at work) you may need someone to reformat it for you.  I had to rewrite all the examples anyway, for a decent layout.  But, like I say, there are some good tricks to learn here, so if you have patience and are willing to dig, this book might be for you.<p>The question is, tho: why are so many computer books written so badly?  I guess it's because editors can't write software.  Maybe I'll have to write one myself.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for an advanced, to the point, and concise book, look no further!  I am surprised that there has been only one review so far for this book.  Oracle Forms is a failrly complex piece of tool.  This book teaches you the 'right way' of using the software.  It provides a ton of advanced tips like  applying object oriented methods in forms, advanced GUI programming etc.  A comprehensive index allows you to find areas of interest very quickly.<p>Obviously, 226 pages of text could not cover a vast subject like Oracle Forms, however, this book gives enough pointers to lead you in the right direction.  If you are a little experienced with Oracle Forms, buy this book to leap to the next level.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent work describing the essential techniques for forms development. It has got valuable tricks of the trade involved in forms development and covers all new features of version 6 with live  examples. I feel this book is a handy and expert reference to forms  programmers and developers alike.</span>
