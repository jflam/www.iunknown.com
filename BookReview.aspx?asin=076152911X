                <span id="Label1">How do you launch a product in today's ultra-competitive and often saturated markets, break through the clutter, and develop strong and lasting customer loyalty? Get in touch with your customers' deepest emotions, of course.<br><b><i>Emotional Branding</i></b> teaches you the how's and why's of, "How does our product or service make our customers feel?" Author <b>Daryl Travis</b> (with a little help from Harry) leads you on a journey filled with colorful ideas and bottom-line lessons that will teach you how to instill brand loyalty in your customers. Whether you are a CEO, an advertising guru, or an innovative businessperson, you will discover how to use a brand's mystique to create powerful and lasting emotional connections with your customers. Travis also addresses:<br>&#183;Branding as a product of intuitive thinking <br>&#183;How people develop emotional responses to brands <br>&#183;Bringing together a company's elements to form a brand <br>&#183;Developing successful offshoot brands from existing ones <br>&#183;And much more!<br><b>Emotional Branding</b> teaches you how to identify and empower your product's appeal and connect it to your customers' experiences with your product. The results unlock the secrets to emotional branding, enhance the brand-consumer relationship, and show you and your business new prosperity&#8212;all from discovering and applying these powerful new ways to use the "F" word, F-E-E-L-I-N-G-S.<br>"Today's marketplace confusion can only be sorted out one way: by brand power. <b>Daryl Travis's <i>Emotional Branding</i></b> sings, a book to savor and ponder. And, if approached in the right spirit, a book to change your worldview and renovate your bottom line. Hint: It's for finance and human resource folks as much as for marketers, as much for three-person architectural studios as for Virgin or GE execs." <b>&#8212;Tom Peters, coauthor of <i>In Search of Excellence</i></b><br>"Every CEO's job is to create value and build assets, and every company's most formidable asset is its brand. Daryl's book is an important reminder that brands must be protected and nurtured. Read it, take it to heart, and expect some amazing things to happen in your business." <b>&#8212;James Berrien, president of <i>Forbes</i> magazine</b><br>"I've been in the business of building global brands for more than 25 years, and I've yet to read a better account of what it takes to make a brand. Apply all the analytics you want to a great company or brand and in the end you'll find it comes down to how people feel about it. This book reveals why." <b>&#8212;Thomas Oliver, CEO of Bass Hotels & Resorts, former executive VP of marketing, FedEx</b></span>

                    <span>Emotional Branding is many things, but it's not everything. It's not boring. It's not without insight. It's not heavy (weight-wise, that is). It doesn't even give you the impression that you're trudging through another business book. It's definitely not disappointing.<P>Daryl Travis spins his anecdotes about successful - and not so successful - brands and his encounters with Harry into a web of inspiring lessons that teaches you how to win and keep customers. He shows you how brand promises can soar as high as a hot-air balloon, or sit idle on the tarmac like a broke-down plane. If you're a marketing professional, picking up and sharing any number of Travis's examples with your clients will strengthen your pitch and make you look smart. And if looking smart and being successful are important to you, you really ought to read Emotional Branding. <P>Emotional Branding is exciting. It's insightful. It's practical. It's deep in a fun way. It's an easy read. It makes you feel good. It's worth every minute you spend learning from it.</span>

                    <span>This is a brave book that goes where many others don't dare ... into the realm of emotions. Daryl Travis gets it right when he says that the key question about a brand is, how does it make you feel?<P>This is a wonderful book with great anecdotes from Travis' years in advertising. It's sprinkled with lively banter from his friend Harry, making it a fun as well as interesting read.</span>

                    <span>Emotional Branding hits the bullseye on what true branding is all about...what promises do you make to your customers? what values do your company live by? and how do your truly serve your customers? Without this foundation, a brand is built on quicksand. <P>This book cuts through the fluff of superficial advertising, logos and corporate images and authentically connects a company's beliefs and behaviors to its customers.

                    <span>This was one of many brand books I read this year, and I his narrative style made this a quick read. Mr. Travis used an imaginary 'cohost' to illustrate the logic and lack of logic used in branding. The basic case studies and stories were right on target with good branding best practices. I think Mr. Travis could focus on additional case studies for a future book as that area is where his skills are best used. I would have enjoyed seeing more on peripheral brands and industries, and I think a follow up could cover this. All in all, a good, readable branding book.</span>
