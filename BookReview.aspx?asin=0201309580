                <span id="Label1">For a cutting-edge take on how to manage today's object-oriented, iterative software development process, take a look at Walker Royce's <I>Software Project Management</I>. This readable, comprehensive guide shows how well-managed software teams can produce better, more profitable software in less time. <p> The book begins by outlining the "traditional" waterfall approach to software development. The author looks at what changes for management when it comes to today's iterative software processes. Written with an eye toward management (with plenty of tables and figures for project estimation and planning), the author takes you through common pitfalls of managing software. <p> Besides reviewing older studies and metrics, the author offers his own 10 principles to managing software, along with hints for all facets of development, from initial inception to construction and deployment of software. The author provides detailed project milestones and other deliverables to help you manage software better, including a breakdown of tasks for your team that will help maximize your efficiency.<p> After a look forward at what better software management means for return on investment (ROI), the author presents several very useful appendices, which include software metrics (like COCOMO), as well as a description of the CCPDS-R missile command system (which used many of the author's management principles). Overall, this groundbreaking title will be useful to any software manager or project leader seeking to get control of software costs and improve team efficiency. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I picked this up thinking it will just another dry walk-through over the usually difficult software project terrain. Managing a software project is a complex, often under rated job: especially today when software engineering is going through a renaissance. Royce's book is a surprisingly good read. He examines the problems of why software PM is hard and what the industry went through to get where it is today. He highlights reasons why the Unified Process (okay, he *is* a principal of Rational) is necessary in striking a balance between what the clients need and what the software team can perform. I found the comparision of different software metrics useful and enlightening. There is even a good introduction to CMM. <P>I gave it a 4.5 star rating as at times Royce spends too much time on some personal favorite topic of his. But at no point is this book un-interesting.<P>All in all, Royce makes a good read out of a tough subject. This is not, however a book for the inexperienced software manager. You truely need to have gone through projects of various sizes and some tough project management before you begin to understand the book. Royce's book serves to fortify and aid what the software manager has experienced, enlightens managers on why software is the way it is, lists out pitfalls to expect, standards to follow. A rather good manual for the tough job of a software project manager.</span>

                    <span>"Unjustified precision--in requirements or plans--has proven to be a substantial, yet subtle, recurring obstacle to success." --quote from author Walker Royce.<P>The false dream that "writing the specifications to the utmost detail will ensure that the engineers create the perfect product, on time" is so prevalent, yet so wrong. Along the way to the finished product, the path is littered with discarded spec that can't be met for technical reasons, timing issues or a chain of dependencies for marketing reasons (if you remove Feature X, then Feature Y is useless.) The author goes on to write that software management is not an exact science; there are gray areas, dependencies and a constant situation of flux that has to be managed. <P>Royce gives case studies for software evolution and recommends changes in the management process, including a VERY valuable core set of metrics. The author is no ivory-tower professor; he developed the methods in this book and tested them in a large project for TRW. This book should be required reading for every software project manager.</span>

                    <span>Well-researched, well-thought, and well-written book provides a compelling business case for an iterative software development process. Rather than focus on the mechanics of the Unified Process, as one might expect, the author presents justification for transitioning from a traditional software engineering approach to an iterative approach.<P>Conventional software engineering is first presented, along with its drawbacks. The changing software landscape is examined, and future success factors are identified. The factors are then tied into the new process.<P>Thorough coverage of many different angles, including an excellent section on metrics, estimation models (and the evolution of COCOMO), team development, culture changes, etc.<P>Great read.</span>

                    <span>This book is hard to rate because I think the author has done a fine job of presenting the material. However, I would caution most people from putting it into practice. The managment process outlined is very rigorous, and should be reserved for defense contractors and other organizations that deliver large commercial applications to external clients. For software organizations that deliver applications internal to their company, the process in this book is probably a bit more than is needed.<P>That being said, the "process framework" hinges on iterative development. The author does a good job of showing why the traditional waterfall process does not work in today's environment, and this is applies to all organizations.<P>Then the author goes on to outline how software development breaks down into phases and iterations within phases. He also talks about the activites and artifacts that belong in each phase. Additionally, he talks about how organizations should be structured to support the process and how to taylor the process to a specific organization.<P>The case studies support the claims made throughout the book making it well rounded and logically sound. This process will work very well in the correct situation.</span>

                    <span>If you aren't versed in advanced project management techniques this book will be overwhelming. More important you may pick up misleading information. However, if you are a battle-scared veteran of software development projects and have a full understanding of earned value project management, estimating techniques and development life cycles you'll learn much from this book.<P>The highlights are:<BR>* A project life cycle and process framework that is [obviously] closely aligned to the Rational Unified Process (RUP), and can be fitted to any rapid development or iterative approach.<P>* An excellent tutorial on effective project controls, with an emphasis on earned value project management.<P>* In-depth coverage of estimating techniques, with a lot of material on the constructive cost model (CoCoMo), and current gaps in estimating techniques and to where the craft and science of estimating and software economics needs to evolve in the discussion of next-generation cost models. I especially like his distinction between the use of source lines of code metrics for size and function points for scale. There is middle ground.The treasure trove of metrics, including core project metrics, and the change metrics that are given in Appendix C.<BR>There is one glaring flaw in this book and an experienced project manager will quickly spot it: the proposed approach to basing work breakdown structures on project phases instead of the decomposition of the system to be delivered will not work. Using Royce's approach there is no clear way of integrating the work breakdown structure with the organizational breakdown structure. Using earned value techniques (which is well covered elsewhere in the book) Royce's approach will not align control accounts (sometimes called cost accounts), making his recommendations contrived and unworkable.<P>This book is better suited for an architecture-centric approach to project management, which means that it's more applicable to product development instead of internal IT projects. However, all seasoned PMs will learn much from it.</span>
