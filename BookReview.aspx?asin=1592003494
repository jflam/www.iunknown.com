                    <span>I bought this book because I was very impressed with another Thompson book. "Beginning C++ game programming.". Unfortunately, this tome doesn't live up to that high standard. 
<br />
<br />I almost never use the CDs that come with programming books. As I prefer to type in the lessons myself. However I was forced to pop in the CD on the first chapter of this book when my code would not compile. Imagine my surprise when I opened the solution and saw "if( PeekMessage( &msg, NULL, 0U, 0U, PM_REMOVE ) )" where the book had told me to type "while (GetMessage(&msg, wndHandle, 0, 0))". Huh?
<br />
<br />It didn't get any better after that. The text is poorly written. The editing is abyssmal. Maybe it gets better later on, but I'll never know. Because I'm not going to waste any more time on this piece of garbage.</span>

                    <span>I am an average programmer who is self taught, and I bought this book to introduce me to DirectX9. I liked the layout and simplicity of the book at a first glance so I bought it....and now I must say this to new buyers. There quite a few inconsistencies and typos... and I mean SERIOUS TYPOS, the kind that cause 3hrs of headache and time-wasting agony. Even in the first chapter. If I was not familiar with win32 programming this book would have been placed in trash can. I have never written anything bad about a book before, because I have never been so upset from one.....
<br />OK.. NOW The good part -- why I gave it 2 stars and not 1. When it comes to the DirectX9 info, I believe that so far (I am at chp.6) I think it's information is very clear and informative. 
<br />I do give them credit here.
<br />
<br />I couldn't find anywhere online for typo correction for books, even on the publishers page. I still hope to find something. 
<br />I cannot recommend this book unless you get the online version (and that is only if it has been updated). Check page 12(bottom) compared to 22(bottom) and see if the statements are the same:
<br />
<br />p.12
<br />while(GetMessage(&msg,....
<br />p.22
<br />if(PeekMessage(&msg,.....
<br />
<br />this means quite different things.(btw p.22 is correct)
<br />
<br />Luckily you have the CD to check against to see what it should be. But Some of the samples didn't link to the correct files. 
<br />chp.7
<br />example 3
<br />needs relinked to a folder in the sdk.
<br />chp.7
<br />example 4 needs to contain the sample file.
<br />
<br />There are 11 chapters and I am at #6. The problems have been less and less as I go through the book. If you buy this book, it can be frustrating at chp.1. But it does get better. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps someone.</span>

                    <span>There is already a review of this book that gives a very good description of it's strengths and weaknesses by M. Velez &#34;gpbook dork&#34;.  I just wanted to support some of his facts.
<br />
<br />Chapter 4 and 5 are horrendous, the first chapters on 3D rendering.  It switches CUSTOMVERTEX structures without any notice and stops giving compileable examples.  Even within subsections the variables used to represent a particular buffer change.
<br />
<br />There are comments that define the structure, and then the structure is different (XYZ_UV in the code snippet comment, and then XYZ_ARGB in the code).
<br />
<br />The most insulting error takes place on page 96 in Chapter 5.  Keep in mind at no point has the word &#34;dolphin&#34; been used in the book prior to this (my comments *'ed):
<br />// Set the indices to use
<br />m_pd3dDevice-&#62;SetIndices( m_pDolphinIB ); // *I thought we were calling it iBuffer... and is it m_pd3d or pd3d?
<br />// Call DrawIndexdPrimitive to draw the object using the indices
<br />m_pd3dDevice-&#62;DrawIndexedPrimitive( D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST,
<br />  0, // BaseVertexIndex
<br />  0, // MinIndex
<br />  m_dwNumDolphinVertices, // NumVertices *When did we declare this?
<br />  0,  //StartIndex
<br />  m_dwNumDolphinFaces ); // primitive count *We didn't declare this either
<br />
<br />So we locked a different buffer and then draw this out of the blue buffer?  It's insulting to think I bought a book that clearly uses the code from the DirectX provided samples.
<br />
<br />There are much better books on introductory DirectX, and this one is just a ripoff of the DirectX tutorials.  Do not expect ANY intermediate or advanced topics out of this book, I know it never claimed to, but most &#34;beginner&#34; books I have read go a bit further than this.
<br />
<br />... any typos in my post are meant for irony (what do you want... i'm a programmer not an editor, i can't spell correctly)</span>

                    <span>Beginning DirectX 9's strong points are solid organization, simple language, great introductory examples and good content. Its weak points are the supplementary CD examples (most of which do NOT work), its typoes and poor proofreading.
<br /> 
<br /> The first thing the avid programming-book reader will notice is that a good 66% of the book is devoted just to Direct3D! This might seem like a bad thing, but after having read the entire book, the reader does acheive a satisfactory level of coherence and familiarity with the many interfaces discussed. The author, Wendy Jones, explains the major components of DirectX with a consistent approach of first introducing the steps of initialization and utilization and then diving into the specifics. This repetitive style allows the reader to grasp the parallelism of the various components of DirectX and not be too intimidated by it.
<br /> 
<br /> Jones steers away from getting too hefty on the advanced computer lingo (or the "Chapter 4: Well i'm showing you this, but it can be done using orthonormal orientation vectors that i'll explain later in chapter 52"-type statements popular to this genre ehem Lamothe ehem Luna). Instead, she gives the reader the essential materials necessary to implement the newest version of DirectX in the simplest language and content possible. Where confusing off-topic structures were optional, she completely avoided them and this leads to fast comprehension.
<br /> 
<br /> To get you started, the author gives one of the most superb examples I've seen on the topic. All it does is setup the D3D device, set the mode and clear the screen blue, but it's a matter of what complexities she avoided to get the point across: programming with DirectX IS POSSIBLE! Other examples are not as specific, not so much a walkthrough but will give the reader the tools he/she is looking for.
<br /> 
<br /> The pitfalls begin when you pop in that supplementary CD-ROM; (I often check those out first to get a gist of the scope of the book and what I'll be learning). Barely any of the executables run! Consequently, the reader is left not deciphering the code that already works but trying to decipher the text so he/she can hopefully get their own example running. The CD-ROMs in game programming books can make or break them, in this case, it harshly affected my opinion of the text.
<br /> 
<br /> Another downside to the book is the poor proofreading the publisher did! Keywords like 'if' are spelled 'If'! RGB is sometimes spelled RBB. This sentence was also allowed to print: "DirectInput, like other components of DirectX, is initialized in a similar manner to other DirectX components." This is not only redundant it's nonsensical. Though these be entertaining, they are CONFUSING and make one doubt the validity of further code snippets and interface explanations.
<br /> 
<br /> So it seems this books high points are as high as its low points are low. (If my rating for this book were a 2D sprite, its y position would be indirectly proportional to its z-buffer) Ineffective jokes aside, Beginning DirectX 9 is definitely a worthwhile read. It will give you that general introduction that you desperately need and not discourage you with the complexities of DirectX. Though a little editing might have been needed, its strongpoints overcome.</span>

                    <span>This is a very nice introduction to DirectX 9, although it's a little confusing as to why there is also a Beginning Direct3D 9 book also by this publisher, that covers the same material (but written by a different author). The reason I make this comparison is because this book is about 80% Direct3D, and the other 20% covers DirectInput and DirectSound.<p>But, I would have to say, I enjoyed this book more than Beg D3D because it is easier to read, definitely a good choice for a beginner or an experienced programmer who wants to get up to speed with DX9.</span>
