                    <span>This book wasn't what I expected it to be.  I was expecting something from the point of view of being an Administrator and being shown what I needed to do, why I needed to do it, and how I would use Microsoft Windows Server 2003 to do it.  Instead, this book is written from the point of view of being an Administrator and being shown what Microsoft Windows Server 2003 can do and exactly how to do it.  For the most part, the book is descriptive instead of prescriptive.  Given that, the book does a very good job.  It's extremely detailed and covers a huge spectrum of what Microsoft Windows Server 2003 can do.  One odd thing is that even though the author assumes in-depth knowledge of the terminology and concepts of server administration, he also seems to assume that the reader has never seen a Microsoft Windows XP desktop.  He spends a good chunk of the book describing (in detail) things that anyone who has ever worked with XP already knows.
<br />
<br />So, ignoring the fact that this book wasn't what I expected, overall, if you know what you're doing as an Administrator and just need to know how Microsoft Windows Server 2003 does the things you need to do, then I highly recommend this book.  I give it a rating of four stars out of five.</span>

                    <span>"Windows Server 2003 Inside Out" is a really important book. In my opinion this book is the only book that is absolutely essential for any person working with Windows Server 2003. If you are an administrator or programmer or developer, no matter what your level of expertise is, this book is a must. As Windows solutions tech, I must say that I believe this book will take me further in the Windows world than all the other books I've previously bought and all the classroom instruction I've had. This book should be required reading for every Windows developer and programmer and administrator. Buy two copies because the guys sitting next to you are going to hog your first copy and you'll never get it back.</span>

                    <span>and I've read a lot. Practical but with plenty of explanation. It goes through all the information that you need in a clear and understandable way. And to top it off, excellent tips and extras. What more do you need in a book? Just buy it!</span>

                    <span>This is better than any other books out there that do nothing more than tell you how things SHOULD work; this tells you how things DO work. Our primary domain controller crashed and resisted all attempts at restores. We continued to have network problems with it out of the chain. I knew pretty much nothing about administering active directory (besides the basics of adding groups, users, etc.) and picked this book up to try to help us. There was a section in it about the first server that gets active directory installed serving as the operations master and how to seize that function to another server. After seizing that and a few others, our domain started behaving itself again. Along the way, I picked up some other useful knowledge and now our domain is actually running faster. The book also showed how to do proper back ups and restores of Active Directory so we never have this problem again.
<br />
<br />I would echo what others said that this book will help you with specific problems. I was impressed with the author's use of real-world scenarios and experience as well as the graphics and screen shots to help you. 
<br />
<br />Highly recommended.</span>
