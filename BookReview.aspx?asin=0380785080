<br />Raleigh Pinskey, makes it nearly impossible for you to fail in promoting yourself using this book unless maybe by chance you apply the following three methods 
<br />
<br />1.) You accidently put this book in a corner and can't find it.
<br />2.) You close your eyes and can't remember where you put it.
<br />3.) You use this book as a hat rack.
<br />
<br />Well I didn't try anyone of the above techniques because I was too busy trying to read this book.
<br />
<br />Raleigh is truly a Viz-ability coach who knows her stuff.  On page 76 she tells you to "Sponsor A Contest", pg 212 she informs you to use Testimonials, pg 21 put your picture on a business card and promote yourself some more and last but not least she gives you 98 fresh, interesting, exciting other ways to get started on your self promotion mission.
<br />
<br />Pinskey provides all the little bitty tid bits necessary for you to move from the rank and file of the average into the upper board rooms of the highly exalted.  Pinskey's book roars with detailed steps and a caring that you rarely see in a tell-all-book like 101 Ways To Promote Yourself.</span>

                    <span>I went to Camp CEO in Prescott, AZ during my summer of 2004.  At the time I was between my freshmen and sophomore year.  Raleigh Pinskey was one of the dozen counselors at Camp CEO.  She gave each camper a copy of this book.  Being able to meet her and get advice from her certanily helped me out alot.  Most of what is in her book is what she taught us throughout that week.  It was an amazing experience.</span>

                    <span>The title led me to expect a list of 101 promotional ideas, with an explanation of each idea. But Raleigh Pinskey delivers far more!<p>Everyone in business needs promotion. And it's usually promotion that gets left behind, the victim of time allocation where priorities are put on product acquisition and delivery, and the myriad everyday details of running a business. Yet it's promotion that brings attention to the company and gives us all the opportunity to grow the business.<p>Pinskey gives us 101 promotional ideas, and here's the bonus: Each idea is explained, including implementation ideas, resources, and contacts needed to pull the idea off successfully!<p>This book is a resource manual that could have been produced in a notebook and sold at business seminars for a hundred bucks. Instead, Pinskey and her publisher have made it a gift, packaging it as a mass media paperback at a remarkably low cost. Don't bee fooled by the low price. Others would charge far more for this advice.<p>Skim through this book. You'll easily find a dozen ideas that are not suited to promote your business, though they might be useful to others. And you'll find a couple of dozen ideas that do apply to your specific business. Take those ideas seriously. Put them into action and profit.<p>I'm taking this book home for a weekend project to come up with a few new promotion projects for my own business. You can, too!</span>
