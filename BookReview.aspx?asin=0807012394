                <span id="Label1"><I>Miracle of Mindfulness</I> is a sly commentary on the <I>Anapanasati Sutra</I>, the Sutra on Breath to Maintain Mindfulness. "Sly" because it doesn't read like a dry commentary at all. One of Thich Nhat Hanh's most popular books, <I>Miracle of Mindfulness</I> is about how to take hold of your consciousness and keep it alive to the present reality, whether eating a tangerine, playing with your children, or washing the dishes. A world-renowned Zen master, Nhat Hanh weaves practical instruction with anecdotes and other stories to show how the meditative mind can be achieved at all times and how it can help us all "reveal and heal."  Nhat Hanh is a master at helping us find a calm refuge within ourselves and teaching us how to reach out from there to the rest of the world. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>Thich Nhat Hanh has a great way of mixing teaching with story. He does so in all the books of his I have read. I think this book is particularly useful for those who are interested in mindfulness but not so interested in Buddhism. Certainly the concept of providing the focus and concentration you get from meditation within all areas of your life is very attractive and he provides practical tips on how to do this as a layperson.</span>

                    <span>I am still working on doing what is written in this book. Though all the concepts explained are simple, I find it hard to practice. Only repetitive and persistent effort within our lives can bring us true benefit of meditation. All the book is saying is to focus on our breath. I am still working on returning to the basic - a simple breath. It is so easy to get preoccupied with normal busy thoughts, forgetting the basic of the basic - breathing. 
<br />
<br />This book is something I need to read and re-read once in a while to get myself back to the basic. Now I realize that if I cannot live a basic life I cannot truly live a life. It took a while for me to know that this book is telling me something fundamental to all humans. </span>

                    <span>From this book I learned how to be present with everyday events, such as washing the dishes-feeling the water, the weight of the cup, etc. and about when I walk to feel the wind, the movement of my body, my feet touching the ground. From there I practiced being aware of all my actions and thoughts and viewed them as meditation, basically I learned to pay attention to what I am doing, when I am doing it.</span>

                    <span>Thay's writings often seem so simple as to be simplistic or childish, but spend a little quality time with this book (or any of his huge output) and you'll realize that, like other great spiritual teachers, his words have a profoundly life-changing quality. In this classic text, he explains in simple poetic language the basics of meditation practice; what to do, what to expect, and why it's an important and meaningful practice. The operative word in Thay's teaching is PRACTICE, and he really does mean "practice" as if you were learning to play the piano or to play tennis. If absorbed and worked at every day, preferrably in the context of daily meditation as well as the normal interactions of daily life, these teachings have the power to create peace and joy for you and those with whom you live and work. This is the beauty of Buddhist teaching in general and the teachings of TNH in particular: they are not complex theological constructs but simple, practical steps designed to make you happy!</span>

                    <span>Most likely Thich Nhat Hanh's most popular and compelling work, Miracle of Mindfulness is as much about being mindful of your thoughts and consciousness as it is about just trying to relax in order to attain a sense of clarity.  In a time of extreme angst and hasty deliberations, this book is an antidote to civilization.  In a move that is reminiscent of Krishnamurti, he brings such mundane things as washing dishes alive through a sense of mindfulness and actually "being there" when doing things like daily chores.  It gives one's life a sense of vitality and energy where there were once discordant thoughts.  This world famous Buddhist of the Zen tradition presents a step-by-step approach that will appeal to all but especially to the self-help enthusiast out there with his begging bowl seeking gems of wisdom.  This is by no means a trivial book and provides an extremely interesting counterpoint to books out there dealing with self-help.  If we are to effect positive change in the world, we need to start from the inside - find that "happy place" and proceed with a sense of calm that allows us to find the road - to ourselves.<br> <br>Miguel Llora</span>
