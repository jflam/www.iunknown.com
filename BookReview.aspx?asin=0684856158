                    <span>This book is sure to become a favorite For anyone who considers themselves a fan of classis TV. Cleaver, thorough, and fun, it is essentially made up of two different sections. The first includes a variety of different lists such as "10 Best TV Genres", "Top 10 TV Moments", "Top 10 TV Actors" and more. Each list is informational but never without a great since of humor. The second half is a list of, according to the author, the Top 100 Sitcom Episodes ever. Each episode is presented in the book complete with a summery, episode credits, and trivia concerning the episodes and the series themselves. Like the lists, this section is also extremely informational without losing a highly entertaining quality to it. Only a few disappointments can be found in the book. For instance, why is the highest-ranking "I Love Lucy" episode only number 26? Is there any chance for a recount? In any case, this is still a great book and highly recommended for any Classic TV fan.</span>

                    <span>At times irreverent, TV Land To Go is a mishmash of trivia, lists, more lists, and plugs for the network TV Land. Much of the book is hilarious, especially the list of basic TV plots and the collective wisdom of sitcoms. I especially loved the examination of the amnesia plot in comedies and the proliferation of the "hit on the head" trigger and "hit on the head again" cure.<P>The list of 100 top sitcom episodes is interesting, but, like any list, is controversial (at least to classic TV types). Why the Leave it to Beaver episode with Captain Jack, when the boys take home a baby alligator, instead of the one where Beaver becomes trapped in a giant teacup? Why the episode of Happy Days when Richie fights back against bullies instead of the famous "jump the shark" episode, or the one where Richie returns to the show for the first time in years?<P>The thinly veiled ads for TV Land -- its shows, specials, books -- seems tongue in cheek, but irritates as well. I flipped past those sections quickly. Some of the lists of top shows are short, and are conspicuously filled with shows that TV Land currently airs.<P>A nice addition, overall, to your TV book library, but not the "classic compendium" it's purported to be.</span>

                    <span>TV Land has become an Entertainment Staple for millions of Boomers and Genreation X-ers alike. This book is definitely picking minute thoughts and blowing them into "required trivia". The "lists" are often picked out of thin air, with no real purpose other than to throw out some entertaining nonsense...discuss amongst yourselves!<P>Be sure to consider this book more like a collection of clever jokes than some kind of research source. Just like the annual TV Land Awards Show, we're not taking anything seriously at all, we're here for the laughs, and nothing but the laughs. For those who agree that times passed have delivered much more of the ha ha ha on TV, you are going to like this book!****</span>

                    <span>"TV Land To Go" is a book much like the network itself. While entertaining at times, it is far too centered around self-promotion, whereas it should be centered around the preservation of classic TV shows. <P>TV Land, the network, seems to have lost its way from its beginnings, and instead of taking the tact of appreciating what it claims to preserve (ala Turner Classic Movies), it spends most of its time with self-promotion, even to the point of corrupting the shows with its "bug" in the corner of the screen, its shrunken closing credits [to allow for another promo], and, of late, a distorted picture DURING the shows to allow for another promotion at the BOTTOM of the screen!!!<P>If these things irritate you about the network, then I highly recommend you avoid this book, and purchase a book which takes its subject seriously. Many of the lists in this book do not even make sense...and other lists seem filled with shows which happened to be running on TV Land and Nick-at-Nite at the time of the books writing.<P>Evidently, no one ever told the executives at TV Land that the best way to attract viewers [and readers] is not to tell everyone how great you are, but to show it instead.<P>Looking for a good book about classic television?....try "Glued to the Set" by Steven Stark.</span>
