                    <span>This is an account of the tragedy of the "Andrea Gail", a shipping vessel that was lost (together with all of its six crew members) during a freak North Atlantic storm in 1991 which reportedly whipped up winds of hurricane force and mountainous seas with waves of 100 feet in height. As none who undertook that fateful voyage survived, the author has to rely on published accounts, interviews, and experiences of other people who have survived similar storms to piece together the story. Given that there exists little concrete information as to what exactly happened that tragic night on board the "Andrea Gail", some guesswork has to be involved in order to fill in certain gaps. Indeed, the author has to digress (which he does from time to time throughout the book) and discuss about the physiological response of drowning at the point when "Andrea Gail" should meet its doom. This, no doubt, has blunted the climax of the story. Nevertheless, the author also touches upon the plight of other vessels nearby and his description of some of the action-packed rescue operations does make a thrilling read. At the end, what cast the deepest impression in my mind is the difficult and often perilous life led by some North Atlantic fishermen (described by the author in great detail) as well as the heroism of those admirable rescue personnels. These certainly have helped to bolster the contents of an account which, because of its nature, is, to a large extent, a re-construction of events based on hearsay and secondary evidence.</span>

                    <span>In October 1991, meteorological conditions combined to create the worst nor'easter of the Century--"the Perfect Storm". Junger tells the exciting story of those who faced the fury of that storm at sea and of the men who tried to rescue them. <P>The book is genuinely thrilling, as the reader gets caught up in the various survival struggles and rescue attempts. Throughout the book, Junger regales us with tales of storms past & explains the physics of the storm & the Sea. All of this is wonderful. <P>However, I have one major complaint with the structure of the book. He has built the story around the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, MA, & her crew of six. But as he tells us in the opening section of the book, the crewman are basically drunken louts who work the boats because those are the jobs available to them. They go to sea to make enough money to fuel the lives of dissipation they lead ashore. They just aren't very interesting people. <P>Moreover, the Andrea Gail, as we know early on, was lost with all hands, so Junger is forced to imagine what may have happened to them. This leads to an abundance of "they must"s & "inevitably"s & "one imagine"s. It's pretty unsatisfactory. <P>Meanwhile, the pararescue jumpers (rescue divers) & the Coast Guard & Navy helicopter crews are genuinely fascinating. Their dedication to their dangerous work is wondrous to behold and their feats of heroism are amazing. Yet they are shunted to the side in the book & we are left wanting to know more about them & their work. <P>Now I know that other folks I've talked to have not been much bothered by this & I still enjoyed the book very much, so I wouldn't let this criticism deter you from reading it. It just bugged me. <P>GRADE: B-</span>

While the best combat stories are NOT always written by those who've been there(and the same holds true for sea stories etc.-)the old journalism device of "joining the brotherhood" so as to "understand & qualify" generally doesn't work here.!Had Mr Junger been a commercial fisherman some years before writing his "storm " perhaps I could be less subjective.Conrad was a seaman not because He wanted a license to write!

                    <span>Those who make a living catching fish from the ocean are always placing themselves at great risk. They often spend several weeks out in the ocean on a relatively small vessel (usually less than 100 feet in length), hoping that they will land that once- in- a- lifetime catch of fish that will improve their financial well- being. <P>When things go as planned, the life of a fisherman can be adventurous and rewarding. But when the search for sea- dwelling creatures is interrupted by a violent storm, a fun situation can turn critical and even fatal. Such is the case of the men and women who became stranded at sea in the "storm of the century", back in October of 1991. Also referred to as the "perfect storm", this violent act of nature left many people dead without a trace. Author Sebastian Junger wrote this book about the people who were aboard these boats, with quotes from some of the survivors and speculation about what could have happened to those who never returned. <P>The "Perfect Storm" occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean, just east of the New England states, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. This area is not normally known for producing violent storms, due to its northern latitude. This sudden turn in the weather took everyone by surprise, including those who were out at sea. They had no forewarning about the intensity of this storm, which seemed to brew up out of nowhere. Most of the captains and crew members have dealt with storms before so they knew what procedures to follow. But nothing could properly prepare them for the massive force with which they were suddenly faced. <P>Junger spends most of this book talking about the people who manned these boats, the events leading up to when they set sail, and the storm itself. Junger is best when he is describing the actual human events during the storms and the heroic efforts of the Coast Guard and Air National Guard to rescue these sailors. Throughout the book, he gets sidetracked from his story and starts talking about statistics and facts about hurricanes, drowning, rainfall, and other data. Some of these facts are interesting and they add to the enjoyment of the book. Other things are annoying and not very useful and they get in the way of the telling of the story. <P>Junger makes frequent mention of the "Andrea Gail"- one of the boats that was out in the water when the storm picked up speed and was lost without a trace of anything- people or vessel. It was obviously ripped apart in the storm. Junger mentions it from time to time, and he reports the few facts that are known. While the storm is taking place and afterward, when rescue attempts are being made, there is no more contact with the Andrea Gail. Junger provides some speculative guesses about what was likely taking place on the boat, in an effort to keep the reader informed about this particular fishing vessel. But there is no way to know what was really taking place after the radio communication ended suddenly on October 28, 1991.<P>Junger writes pretty well throughout this book, and he effectively captures the terror that must have been felt by those who were caught in this violent act of nature. The book could have been better, however, if he had included more interviews and quotes from survivors not only on the boats, but also those who were affected when the storm ran ashore and damaged their coastal properties. It also could have been improved with a better ending. Junger ends the writing suddenly, with a few paragraphs about another vessel whose crew was lost in a storm. There is no conclusion or anything to wrap up the book and summarize the key events. It just ends abruptly. <P>Finding ones' self caught in a bad storm in the middle of the open sea is frequently- occurring nightmare for some people, but it has become reality for a few. This book shows that the life of a fisherman is not all drinking, fun, and games. There are tremendous risks involved when one decides to spend several weeks at sea, and author Sebastian Junger presents a pretty good book about the perils of this lifestyle. It's a book worth reading, although it could have been better with a few improvements.</span>

Paints a very clear picture of the power and unpredictability of the sea and the weather, and what options humans have when they become caught in it. Occasionally overdid the technical information, but overall, a very vivid and good book.</span>
