                    <span>I just finished reading this book for an independent novel project for my Biology 104 course.  Throughout the  reading of this grammatical-error-strewn book, I realized something.  This book had no real-world implications.  It was written for the common person to understand biotechnology in their daily lives.  However, the book flowed at such an esoteric level, explaining only a quarter of the bio-heavy terms it used, that it was impossible to understand unless you were a bio major.  Then I realized: if you're a bio major, you've already understood these concepts.  Again, no real world applications.
<br />
<br />To make matters at hand worse, the book was incredibly dull.  Most of the topics it covered were explained so dully, with such drab examples, that I continually fell asleep.  I won't mention that I was reclining in a, well, recliner.  But it was pretty mundane.  The diagrams and pictures in this book are a joke.  One is Pacman eating a blob, which corresponds with "some bacteria eat toxins and eliminate pollution."  
<br />
<br />I found the bioterrorism section, a fascinating subject, to be also mundane, and extremely uninformative.  Some pathogens, such as cholera, were given a sentence description which simply said "this is used in bioterrorism".  Thanks. I'm REALLY understanding biotechnology.
<br />
<br />Don't read this book.  I'm sure there are much better ones that will help you understand these important biological concepts.</span>
