                    <span>The Boy Becoming A Man. The Man Who'd Become A Revolutionary Legend.
<br />"Che" writes eloquently as he fills us in on his life journey. He expierences a people, a land and ways of life he could only have read about in his native Argentina. The lands and people of Latin America open their hearts and minds to our two intrepid travelers. Giving them food to fill themselves and a place to lay their weary heads. The exhaustive trip is captured here in these pages. Che was alive to me when I read this I could see his youthfull exhuberence, his mind hungary for experience, memories, tales and change.
<br />They must have been two courageous individuals, "Che" and Alberto to attempt a feat such as this in a place like Latin America in the 1950's where much of the roads were poor, at best.
<br />It seems this became a test to Ernesto and Alberto, a test to live off their wits, intuition, luck and inginuity.
<br />Its clearly obvious that Ernesto was touched by the poor, disinfranchised and lowly people that he met along his journey. After reading his words, it will be no surprise to you why he turned out the way he did. Its no wonder that this trip was a milestone in the tranformation of one asthmatic Med. student into one of the most charismatic and driven revolutionary leaders of the 20th Century.
<br />Thank you</span>

<br />This account of a travel of young Ernesto Guevara and his cousin is interesting for its viewpoint and clarity. What at once struck me is the clear, cogent writing style that Che possesses. It seems to me in this personal voyage into his brain that he could have excelled in anything: he could have been a doctor, a politician, a writer, or a revolutionary-and I suppose he was all. 
<br />
<br />This travelogue, batch of impressions, political manifesto, human rights record book, and stream of consciousness is very easy to read. If you have traveled through Latin America you cannot but agree with some of his critiques of Latino society and smirk at some of his observations. If you have never traveled there, Che turns out to be a great guide with an eye for picking out interesting things.

                    <span>This book is a travelogue, not a manifesto. It is a personal, unassuming diary, so different from the blogs and journals that have become so popular lately. It is written (and well-written) by a cogent and intelligent mind.
<br />What is remarkable about this diary is that it offers a glimpse into the mind and soul of a great man before his revolutionary metamorphosis. There is no hint of politics, of socialism, or of ideology in these pages. They are a personal account, a series of astute and sensitive observations of people, places and experiences.
<br />The portrait painted by Che Guevara's own words is very different from that which adorns the t-shirts and posters of today's youth. Here he is funny, friendly, polite, down-to-earth. He is a regular guy, like you and me, backpacking through South America, savoring the sights and sounds of life. Along the way he learns, he struggles, sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses. He freezes, gets dehydrated, bitten by mosquitoes, stricken by asthma attacks; he starves, laughs in church, plays soccer, misses home.
<br />It is so easy to relate to the Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries because he is so ordinary. And he arouses admiration and hope because he is an example of the power that each and every one of us has within. His secret is determination. Willpower. Conviction.</span>

                    <span>Everyone longs for the freedom in their lives and the trust in themselves that would allow them to jump on the back of an old ratty motorcyle and cruise the continent. Che is not an icon for just anything, he was blessed with the courage to follow his heart. Che and his friend, Alberto, experienced laughter, misery, love and hate but did not shy away from it. Che doesn't describe only the highlights of he and Alberto's journey, he tells of the nearly freezing to death in the desert night and I won't spoil the book by telling the peaches story, but the reader will know it when they get to it.
<br />Inbetween the scenery and the adventures of Motorcyle Diaries lies Che's budding philosophies and convictions. "On top of her asthma she had a heart condition. It is at times like this, when a doctor becomes aware of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change; a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity." Che's devoted his life to attempts to change the system and Motorcyle Diaries is not a "Che did this" but instead a "Che felt this". Bear with me on that - I could not think of a better way to put it.
<br />The book drags on slowly in a several parts, but it is well worth the read. One might appreciate the book more if they are at least minimally versed in Latin American History beforehand. Motorcyle Diaries' quick references sometimes sent me back to my old history textbooks, but knowing them was not detrimental to enjoying the book.
<br />I have recommended this book a friend in medical school and another who is a seasoned traveler - both euqally enjoyed and appreciated the book, however in much different ways. I think that everyone can find something within themselves that they can identify with Che.</span>

                    <span>I read many reviews including the "editorial" review and I must say, many must have read a different book than I. I tried to find the "snide" references made regarding blacks and  homosexuals but it eluded me. What I DID find was someone who began this diary in an almost lyrical manner. Someone who was not only articulate but who obviously developed a social conscience at a very young age. While I don't agree with Guevara's politics and I find his remarks about the bourgeois tedious, I found myself intrigued by his ability to express himself.
<br />I think it may be much better to read this chronicle with no preconceived ideas concerning Che but rather read it as you would any other documentary about the times and conditions of the countries of South America.
