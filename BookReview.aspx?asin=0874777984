                    <span>This book is not for the casual reader, it's not an easy read (found myself frequently referring to the glossary and also rereading several sentences & even paragraphs to ensure I grasped all of it), it's intense, it's not so much as the way the book is written but it's the nature of the topic itself, it's complex (the book covers wide ranging topics ...Physics, Quantum Physics, Mysticism, Religion, Spirituality, Mind-Body Connection, Philosophy, Psychology...Etc.) nevertheless, Goswami has done a commendable job explaining some difficult concepts and putting forward his argument that our consciousness creates the material world. The book is delightful in the sense that every so often Goswami comes up with a neat little tale or a story or a quote or fable or a startling observation to illustrate his point.
<br />
<br />I liked Part 1, where the concepts from old classical physics (some of the concepts felt very familiar but not the terminology for them ...Strong objectivity, Causal determinism, Locality, Material monism, Epiphenomenalism) are discussed and compared with quantum physics topics such as the Wave-Particle Duality, Quantum Jump, Quantum action-at-a-distance, Non-locality...Etc (there are several books that discuss quantum world but this is the only one that I have read that will discuss quantum physics keeping old physics as a backdrop). Part 1 leads (via The Philosophy of Monistic Idealism: this is what the book is about) into Part 2.
<br />
<br />I liked Part 3, titled "Self-Reference: How the One Becomes Many", specifically the chapters about the Mind-Body problem and the search for the Quantum Mind (brain-mind has both classical and quantum components).
<br />
<br />Part 4, titled "The Re-Enchantment of the Person" (although very informative and well researched) feels less focused; there are so many tangents to so many different ideas & topics, it feels diffused and deviated yet some how complete at the same time.
<br />
<br />This is definitely worth reading, I recommend this book

                    <span>The book starts with a brief and incomplete introduction to quantum mechanics. It assumes you have no previous knowledge of the subject but I have to admit that, having prior knowledge of quantum mechanics, I found Goswami's introduction some what deficient. He conceals many interpretations of quantum mechanics and only speaks of the one interpretation that makes his thesis plausible - which undermines the strength of his argument.
<br />He then goes on to explain the different hypotheses of material realism and also briefly explains the different theories of mind. One weakness in Goswami's book is his irritating usage of bed time stories to explain difficult concepts. I am sure he could have done that, as hundreds have done before him, without resorting to such distractions. I found the part where he talked about the 'quantum and classical selves' a very interesting and fresh notion. Understanding it definetly creates a place for a new conceptualisation of the relationship of consciousness to our brain/mind. The final chapter is basicly an exposition of goswami's own beliefs which he tries to convince us are the plausible conclusions of his thesis. I was left smiling and somewhat peacful but utterly not convinced. To me, it seems Goswami, following on the mood of his book, made a huge but irrational 'quantum leap'.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this volume with a great deal of sympathy for Amit Goswami's thesis, only to discover he does not deliver in the crucial areas he claims.  He sets up exponents of material realism as straw men he then knocks down, rather than examining the actual range of thinking in this realm of discourse.  His arguments for monistic idealism are of the nature of, "my imagination fails to include an alternative so what I am comfortable believing must be true."  Even as I read I envisioned alternative monistic postures never explored, discussed, or suggested in this volume.  Rather than a demonstration of his argument Goswami has produced an attempt at persuasion to his personal biases.  I quite agree a thoughtful critique of material realism is in order, and also that a monistic posture can address the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, but this is not the text to go to for the goods.  Admittedly, Goswami's outline of quantum mechanics is cogent and useful.  It's the new age fluff approach to philosophizing that destroys his credibility.</span>

                    <span>It has been a long time since I was so happy reading a book.<p>I grew up in Christian Science. As a Christian Scientist I would not normally approach the subject of spirituality from the perspective of physics. However, even though Goswami doesn't OVERTLY talk about spirituality per se, I was amazed at how you can get to virtually the same conclusions on God, Life, and universal consciousness as Mary Baker Eddy taught and wrote about in "Science and Health" about 130 years ago.<p>I hope that "The Self-Aware Universe" and Dr. Goswami don't get burdened with erroneous labels of "cultism".  Maybe the Science will be a little more accepted in this day and age.</span>

                    <span><br>Most books that explore the intersection between science and spirituality seem to be written by non-scientists who explain some basic scientific principles and then extrapolate wildly to support their spiritual viewpoint.<p>Goswami, a physics professor, approaches it from the other direction.  He carefully lays out a scientific theory - essentially that matter is a phenomina of consciousness rather than vice versa.  <p>In the process he navigates through various topics in physics, mathematics, religion, and philosophy in order to provide the necessary components for us to get a grip on his theory of "monistic idealism" which he proposes as an alternative to the current "material realism" (matter is all that is real) which pervades scientific thought today.<p>I don't want to imply that I'm stupid, but the only fault I found with the book was that much of his jargon and scientific references went right over my head - so I came away with a good understanding of his theory, but also with the impression that much of it's depth and subtlties were lost on me.<p>I'm not sure how this book was received by the author's peers (if at all) but he impressed me as a "blow-the-lid-off-the-subject" type of scientist who is willing to ruffle feathers and push beyond the traditional limitations of his field to integrate various disciplines in a search for a truth that doesn't just look right on paper but also jives with human experience and the soul.<p>Well worth reading.<br></span>
