                <span id="Label1">The famously taciturn South African president reveals much of himself in  <i>Long Walk to Freedom.</i> A good deal of this autobiography was written secretly  while Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years on Robben Island by South Africa's apartheid regime. Among the book's interesting  revelations is Mandela's ambivalence toward his lifetime of devotion to public works. It cost him two  marriages and kept him distant from a family life he might otherwise have cherished.  <i>Long Walk to Freedom</i> also discloses a strong and generous spirit that refused to be broken under the most trying circumstances--a spirit in  which just about everybody can find something to admire.</span>

                    <span>(Autobiography) Since Mandela was so integral to South Africa's freedom struggle, this is a story of that struggle as much as it is a story of his life. This is a fascinating account of an amazing struggle. Mandela effectively captures the paradoxes of leadership: means versus ends, ideology versus tactics. Mandela is a remarkable man, not because he is flawless (for he shows that he is not), but because he was not afraid to fight with all his might for something he believed in.

                    <span>Review by Rev. George van Popta
<br />
<br />Today I finished reading Long Walk to Freedom, the very impressive autobiographical account of the life and work of Nelson Mandela. An autobiography is, understandably, biased. If you write an account of your own life, you are not going to speak ill of yourself. Yet, reading through the book, it struck me that Mandela admitted that he had made mistakes. I found the account of his life imbued with a sense of modesty, humility and dignity that you do not find in many politicians.
<br />
<br />Mandela showed himself to be a man of another order when he did not turn the table to oppress the minority whites when he became president but, rather, called everyone to the table.
<br />
<br />It is one of the interesting stories of our time: a man who spent 27 1/2 years as a political prisoner of his country because of his fight against apartheid ends up, in his old age, the president of that country. One of his deputy presidents is the previous president who headed the party that had put the system in place.</span>

                    <span>A superbly written biography, with enough details that allows the reader to get to know and understand the man without been long drawn. Mr Mandela's wit, honesty and humility warms the heart and promises hope for the relief of the suffering "man".</span>

                    <span>The Boston Globe wrote that this book "should be read by every person alive" and I wholeheartedly agree.  Mandela is an excellent writer, and his story is an amazing demonstration of perseverance and forgiveness.  His reliance on simple values-- truth, the importance of listening, dignity-- reveal how tragically far societies can stray from the basic principles they should be safeguarding.
<br />
<br />Read this book, and pass it on (and don't be intimidated by the 600 or so pages).  We should all listen to Mandela's lessons.</span>

                    <span>Here is a man who fought his entire life for the freedom of his people, including 27 years in prison.  An inspiring story that I didn't know much about until I read this book.  A little long and detailed, but I definitely have a greater appreciation for this man and his struggle.  If you don't know the story of Nelson Mandela, you should read this book!</span>
