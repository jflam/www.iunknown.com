                    <span>Before reading this book I had plenty of experience with HTML and had studied SQL and C in school (but hadn't used it for ages).  I found this book gave me everything I needed to get started.  I did find some mistakes in the examples but they were minor and obvious. If you have any prior experience with programming you should be fine going through this book.  If you already know PHP but want to know more about Apache or MySQL there are probably better books out there.  I also had a little bit of difficulty getting the installation right but once i had it right I was away and now I am programming database driven sites with ease.  All thanks to SAMS.</span>

                    <span>I have never written a book review on Amazon before, but this book was so bad I figured I owed it to other buyers to tell them about it.  The simple fact is that is poorly written.  I have been a Coldfusion programmer for many years and have been blessed by well written books from Ben Forta.  This author consistently took simple concepts and made them difficult.  The examples were horrible.  Instead of just showing simple the new concept could do, she made each new concept a review of the entire book.  There were many things introduced that has no examples at all.  I have never swore at a book more!</span>

                    <span>I wasn't new to programming, having coded in C for years. However, I wasn't too familiar with database based programming or even web-based programming. This book gives you a very good start into these areas. I could finish it in fact in less than 10 hrs. This book is most useful to novices who have no prior knowledge of programming of any sort and have to start off with php. This is just an introductory book. It isn't adequate for advanced programming, but that's not the objective of the book<p>All in all, worth investing!</span>

                    <span>I should have known not to buy this book after having read "Sam's Teach Yourself Flash MX Actionscript in 24 hours"--also poorly written. The main problem with this book as well as the sam's flash book is that it leaves HUGE gaps in its explanations which force the reader to supplement the lessons with the Internet. For example, the beginning of the book says that no prior knowledge is necessary except for an understanding of HTML; in the intro chapters, it introduces you to databases in general, explaining what they're for. The next chapter on databases (besides the one on how to install mysql) however ("learning basic sql commands") is prefaced by saying:<p>   "...This is a very hands-on hour, and it assumes that you are able to issue queries through the MySQL monitor on Windows or Linux/Unix. Alternatively, if you use a GUI to MySQL, this hour assumes you know the methods for issuing queries through those interfaces."<p>What is that!? It goes from explaining what a db is to magically expecting you to know about issuing mysql queries without anything in between? I'm sorry, but this makes no sense whatsoever.<p>I'm sorry I cannot recommend another book, but perhaps you'd have better luck with ANY OTHER MYSQL,PHP, or APACHE book!</span>

                    <span>Before purchasing this book, I tried to install Apache, MySQL and PHP on my Windows machine without any luck. I was frustrated because this is all quite effortless if you use any flavor of Linux (Red Hat 9 in my case).<p>I purchased the Dummies book on the same subject(s) and I found it confusing, particularly getting PHP to interact with Apache. I returned the book and got this one and I was up and running with Apache, MySQL and PHP in about an hour.</span>
