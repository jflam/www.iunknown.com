                    <span>A very useful intsructional golf book that simply shows why Tiger Woods is such a great athletic golfer and how the reader can develop similiar golfing skills. In addition, the author compares in various areas of the golf swing and body movement, how Tiger's style of movement compares with a other great golfers. An enjoyable book to read and also learn how to emulate Tiger Woods great golf swing.</span>

                    <span>I want to play better golf so I bought this book. Its title is very inspiring for everyone especially beginner who want to hit the ball a long way. The good points of this book are the author keep encourage the reader that he/she can play good golf and offers alot of practice drills. However, there are also some points which should be improve otherwise it can be a good book not an average one (for me). These points are its lack of pictures. For instruction book like this, an easy to understand picture is need not just a picture of Tiger Woods' swing here and there. I think it should include some details of each club in the bag. For this subject, Ernie Els book did a great job. What I really can't stad is that the author praise Tiger too much. I agree that Tiger is a great player in this age but he is not a god like perfect player. When I read this book, I feel like it said Tiger never make a mistake in which I disagree. Tiger is a great player and he also make lots of mistakes. That is the way golf is played. My suggestion is to borrow this book from you friend. Browse it to see if you l like it then decide wheter to buy it or not.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As you are buying a golf book I wish to give a technical description of why this book fails. I am a nine handicap at Royal Porthcawl (Aged 19) 6ft tall, but only weigh 10st. As a result I could only hit the ball 260yds but with a fundamentally sound, picture perfect swing. This seems arrogant, but in the context of my book review I hope it isn't. Having studiously read and practised what this author preaches for eight months (compromising my A-level exams most likely)i shoul have ripped up a short links course. Instead I have found some alarming discoveries. Whilst this book will add 40-50yds to your drives best and 20yds average, -also 2clubs throughout the rest of your bag- block shots that land on other fairways, out of bound shots and power push slices occur. At 260yds this can be disastrous, at 290 it ruins your afternoon.Adding to this confusion is that Andrisani doesn't say which shape of shot should occur with these intricate setup changes (so for all the straight shots I hit, I have an equal number of bewildering draws and fades). The book is useful in that now having reverted to my old swing, the muscular exercises give me 20 more yards, however, a far better use of it is as a doorstop or a firelighter for a BBQ. It is full of hyperbole and exaggeration, and though I am fairly sure Tiger does use the 'shoulders-open, feet closed' setup alignment suggested in the book (he didn't at the PGA or the Open or the USPGA Open), he found and moulded this through twenty years of practise, an amount of time none of us have. Speaking to my doctor, (who is also a keen golfer) gave me his suggestion that he probably grew into these positions from childhood thus making them repeatable. Time which, most of us sadly can't have again. This book (like my review) is overly long and concise -a "noddy book"- containing lots of pretty pictures. None of the pictures are shot from a side profile either - crucial considering that setup and body-aim are at the crux of the book - and the book ends abrubtly, leaving me thinking that a few pages were missing. It had no surgery for fault fixing either. In fact, it has a childish section where the author rates and compares Woods, Nicklaus and Hogan giving Woods full marks in every aspect of his game! As a critique of a swing it is flawed, as a piece of sports writing it's poor. I was prepared to give it a try in this respect as golf pro's are not Cambridge academics, sadly I shouldn't have bothered wasting £10. As a bitter,ill-educated,xenophobic and sarcastic Englishman, I'm not sure how to judge Andrisani, but he engenders a poor perception of his contemporaries. The "Payne Stewart" of writing: loud, brash and arrogant. He clings to Tiger Woods in a rather unhealthy and religious manner and is highly pretentious here I quote: "The tiger crawls through the plain's long grass, never losing sight of its prey..." How sad! This book is a full-on, 'Nevada Bob' style, aggressive paean. It makes Tiger appear superficial, a golfing automaton. At the end of the day there is no substitute for a good teacher and practise. Stop reading books, turn off satellite T.V. and go to a decent pro (only joking about the books!). If you read books, get an English one (Nick Faldo's is best) someone who can hit it 300yds but realsises he is super accurate with 250 and plays on traditional links courses. Its a swing that has never had many injuries, easy to learn and repeat.If you can read and understand this then you are too old to try anything other than simple easy to pick-up fundamentals. Try Ernie Els' book too, as his is consistent and classic. Andrisani's book promotes too many idiosyncracies that breed other problems without providing a cure, or better still a reason why they occur. He would personally need to see you to be able to keep your swing in line -your local pro will tell you to square everything up if you go to him having read this book. Above all, an English taught swing will withstand most climate, terrain and rough diversities. Thankyou for your patience</span>

                    <span>This great little book clearly demonstrates the simple beauty of Tiger's powerful swing. There are very few golfer's who can create as much clubhead speed as Tiger, but we can all learn from his efficient form and translate that into purely struck golf shots. I have totally rebuilt my swing (especially takeaway & right arm extension through the ball) with tremendous benefit as a result of using this important book along with videotaping Tiger in TV tournaments and analyzing his swing in slow motion. Thanks John Andrisani for explaining the Tiger Woods swing technique. It really helps to understand a bit of what he's thinking out there on the tour.</span>
