                <span id="Label1">"...A good starting point for those who have felt the lure of the ancient Chinese capital but are unsure how to set about getting there. Should be one of the first books people turn to." &#8212;<i>Pittsburgh Tribune</i>, 5/2000   <p>   You'll never fall into the tourist traps when you travel with Frommer's. It's like having a friend show you around, taking you to the places locals like best. Our expert authors have already gone everywhere you might go-they've done the legwork for you, and they're not afraid to tell it like it is, saving you time and money. No other series offers candid reviews of so many hotels and restaurants in all price ranges. Every Frommer's Travel Guide is up-to-date, with exact prices for everything, dozens of color maps, and exciting coverage of sports, shopping, and nightlife. You'd be lost without us!   <p>   This is a detailed, user-friendly, and up-to-the-minute guide to Beijing, China's capital and its major gateway city. We'll take you to the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and the Great Wall, and show you how to plunge into the city's shopping scene and discover the best local restaurants. It can be difficult for Western visitors to communicate and find their way around in such a vast, fast-paced, and bewildering city, but we've made it easy for you to explore on your own, with detailed directions, accurate maps, practical logistical advice, and etiquette tips. We've also included a handy appendix of useful Chinese phrases, and establishment names are listed in both English and Chinese characters, making it easier for you to get around and find the places you're looking for. Our authors, experienced China travelers who've written about the country for years, offer valuable insights and paint a vivid picture of a city that's undergoing one of the most fascinating cultural and economic transformations in history.    </span>

                    <span>I bought this book because it was the most recently published travel guide on Beijing at the time (Dec '03). I have been living in Beijing for 3 months and have been to several of the places the book recommends. The facts in it are usually accuate; some prices, restaurant names, and phone numbers have changed since the book was published.<P>My main qualm with this book is the referencing... it is completely inconvenient. First of all, the Chinese characters of location names are listed in the back of the book, instead of with the desriptions (like most books). This makes is difficult to show people the characters of the place you are looking for if you're lost.<P>Also, if you are looking at one of the book's maps, and want to find out more about a certain location, there is no page reference. You have to look the place up in the index and then flip to the description.<P>Similarly, there are no map references in the sight-descriptions. (The book has several maps.) You have to guess which map the place would be on, based on the very basic directions given in the description. This can be a pain!!!<P>Otherwise, the book proved useful. My friends that had the Lonely Planet guide said that is was much less acurate than my book. Also check out Let's Go when deciding which book to buy.</span>
