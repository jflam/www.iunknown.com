                    <span>This book has been essential for me in developing a concept of the healing force in myself and in everybody -- Life Energy, as the title succinctly puts it -- and how this force can be activated. The specific details about our emotions -- and how they relate to the acupuncture system -- are fascinating. I particularly find helpful and thought-provoking Dr. Diamond's use of etymology (the origins of words) in pinpointing and evoking emotional states. The many photographs and humorous or touching anecdotes -- all these contribute to this highly readable, very therapeutic volume. I find Dr. Diamond's affirmations and the acupuncture points, which are clearly illustrated, wonderfully helpful in creating a daily routine for health and happiness. I have gone on to read many other books by Dr. Diamond, but this one remains basic and essential. I highly reccomend this book.</span>

                    <span>In this ground-breaking book, Dr. Diamond presents his research findings concerning the links between specific acupuncture meridians and various precisely delineated emotional states.  The connection between the acupuncture meridians and the organs of the body has been known about for centuries, and underlies much Chinese, Japanese and Korean traditional healing, and with Dr. Diamond's work connecting the meridians and the emotions we now have a link between the emotions and the physical body.  Although it has been accepted that our emotional state can affect our physical well-being, and vice versa, Dr. Diamond's pioneering research is the first to examine this mechanism in detail.<p>	This book should be required reading for anyone practicing, or hoping to practice the healing arts, either through conventional or through complementary medicine.</span>

                    <span>This book is a revelation! How does qi (chi) flow through the body and what impedes its flow? Dr. Diamond's research reveals that our Life Energy is basically EMOTIONAL with each acupuncture meridian representing a different aspect of our emotional make-up. Positive emotions represent a healthy flow of Life Energy while negative emotions represent an impedence of this flow. How can we transform our lives? By transmuting our emotions. This concept is so simple and its ramifications so profound that it is a wonder that noone has elucidated it with such clarity up until now. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, both for the health-conscious reader and the holistic health care practitioner!</span>

                    <span>Dr. John Diamond studied the work of Dr. George Goodheart, chiropractic physician and founder of Applied Kinesiology. Diamond extended Goodheart's approach into the realm of behavior and emotions.  This is a brilliant book that has surely helped many people resolve psychological issues. Diamond's work has also inspired a radical shift in the way we understand psychological health and treatment. Fred P. Gallo, Ph.D., author of "Energy Psychology," "Energy Tapping," "Energy Diagnostic and Treatment Methods," and "Energy Psychology in Psychotherapy."</span>
