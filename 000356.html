<p>Wow. I sure touched a nerve with my previous post on <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000352.html">what I think blog entries should be</a>. In reality, what I wanted to do was throw out the idea of using <span class="caps">PDF</span> as a way of controlling the format for longer blog pieces.</p>

<p>Jon Flanders, an old friend from my time at <a href="http://www.develop.com">DevelopMentor</a>, sent in a link to a Jakob Nielson article on <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010610.html">avoiding <span class="caps">PDF</span> for on-screen reading</a>. It's an interesting piece, and reflects much of the frustration that folks have with the current state of <span class="caps">PDF</span> on web sites today.</p>

<p>I'm about to launch a newsletter later today that will be distributed in <span class="caps">PDF</span> form. Here are my reasons why I chose <span class="caps">PDF</span> as the medium:</p>


<ol>
<li>I like to read my content one page at a time, much like I would in a traditional book or magazine. </li>
<li>I want to include some formatting in my newsletter to help increase the readability of my content. </li>
<li>I want the entire article to be available without additional roundtrips to the server. I hate articles that force me to read pages one at a time, but require a roundtrip to the server to retrieve the next page (almost all of the professional news/review sites are like this). </li>
<li>I want the content to be available offline for folks who want to read that way. I find that I tend to carve out reading time when my laptop is not connected to a network somewhere.</li>
<li>I want folks to be able to meet the above requirements and still be able to forward my newsletter around as an email attachment. This can only be accomplished if all of the content resides in a single file.</li>
</ol>

<p>To me, <span class="caps">PDF</span> is the only medium that meets all of these requirements. And as long as I format my content so that it can be easily read on-screen (respecting the <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000343.html">4:3 layout</a> of most monitors and using a double-column layout) I think I won't upset too many people. You'll find out later on this afternoon, I promise. </p>

<p>I appreciate your list of reasons for adopting PDF for your newsletter.  While I'm not a big fan of PDFs, I do like their self-contained nature.  However, I don't consider it a good way to handle longer blogs, as it seems to defeat the nature of the blogging medium.</p>

<p>However, your reasoning caused me to recall a web news site whose format I've always enjoyed and that adheres to many of your ideals - the International Herald Tribune - and thought you might want to take a look.  Here's a representative piece:</p>

<p>http://www.iht.com/articles/114576.html</p>

<p>Via the "toolbar" at bottom, they provide formatting alternatives - one column/one page or multi-columns/multi-pages (my preference), as well as options to increase/decrease the font size, and a nice print layout option.  They deliver the entire article to you, so no round-trips are required, even when displayed in multi-page mode.  If the graphics were eliminated and the javascript embedded, it could be read off-line.  One thing that's bothersome is having to use the mouse to click between pages (although they mitigated this some by allowing you to click anywhere near the ending/beginning of the article text).</p>

<p>I suppose in the end, good content trumps format anyway.  </p>

<p>Good luck with the newsletter.<br />

<p>Wow! Thanks for the link, Eric. That is a very nice layout that those guys have. It looks like they do it through some CSS+DHTML magic.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my content.</p>

<p>You're welcome.  I did enjoy your newsletter.  I've been hearing and reading nothing but "Ant this" and "NAnt that" for a while now, but haven't had a moment to stop and check it out.  Your newsletter was just the intro I needed.  I look forward to the next one.<br />

<p>Thanks for the plug John ;-).  But you should know that Reader will only pull one page at a time, so when you go to another page it pulls it dynamically so the roundtrip issue you brought up only applies if a reader right-clicks on the pdf link and downloads it to their hd before opening.<br />
