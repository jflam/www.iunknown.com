                <span id="Label1">Chris Locke, one of the most outspoken and original denizens of Web culture, sounds off against the limitations of traditional "broadcast" marketing and offers an alternative approach to building customer trust and loyalty. <P>A Harvard Business Review Top-10 Business Book of 2001 <P><I>Gonzo Marketing</I> is a knuckle-whitening ride to the place where social criticism, biting satire, and serious commerce meet--and where the outdated ideals of mass marketing and broadcast media are being left in the dust. Invoking the spirit of gonzo journalism, Locke rails against business practices that treat customers like cattle, and urges marketers of all stripes to tap into Web-based communities, or "micromarkets," based on candor, trust, passion, and a general disdain for anything that smacks of corporate smugness. Gonzo Marketing shows how companies that support and promote these communities can have everything they've always wanted: greater market share, customer loyalty, and brand equity. Laced with Locke's inimitable wit and penetrating point of view, <I>Gonzo Marketing</I> is the raucous wake-up call that no one in business--from the trading-room floor to the boardroom--can afford to ignore.</span>

                    <span>...He offers some interesting ideas, but unfortunately I doubt that any of his examples would result in positive ROI for any of the companies involved.<P> True to its title (a reference to the eccentric writing style of writer Hunter S. Thompson), "Gonzo Marketing" also wanders and leaves along the way to its business advice. Alas, the odd writing style (sometimes quite readable, sometimes not) failed to entertain or educate me, and it certainly did not convince me that the author's proposals were worthwhile.<P> The recurring central theme of Gonzo Marketing is that companies should try to connect with customers by having employees or agents participate in communities that include the company's customers. "Companies don't give a damn about advertising . . . . What they care about is connecting with potential customers by whatever means is most effective." (p. 186)<P> Locke suggests that a company like Ford and Dell empower its employees to participate (on company time) in online communitites which include potential customers. For example, Dell could encourage its employees who believe in home schooling, to participate in online communities about home-schooling, not writing sales pitches about Dell, but instead being visible as helpful community members who happen to identify themselves as Dell employees. Locke also suggests that Ford employees who like gardening could participate in related online communities, and perhaps other participants in the community will decide they like Ford and buy Ford trucks.<P> This is not a new idea. Local business owners have long been involved in their local communities, by sponsoring Little League teams, by encouraging staff to join the local bowling league as a team, by donating supplies to the local Habitat to Humanity project -- and quite simply, by being actual members in the local community who share the interests and goals of many other members of that local community. People like to do business with people they like.<P> Alas, Locke's examples all seem to fail, not because they are "wrong" but because they all appear to fail the ROI (return-on-investment) test required of all intelligent marketing. They also create huge risks of brand dilution and potential legal liability.<P> Another of Locke's ideas is to "tell a story" or create a fun, playful message that can be associated with your company or product. Thus, 'marketing' becomes more engaging, more interesting, and more accepted by consumers -- but alas, when marketing is so entertaining that it is accepted, it often is no longer marketing.<P> Oddly, the real message I drew from "Gonzo Marketing" is that companies can do interesting, different styles of marketing, as long as they focus on being "useful" or helpful to the audience they are addressing. It's not enough to be "relevant" or "entertaining" -- those are good, but good marketers must go further: be useful, be helpful -- be someone that your audience "knows, likes, and trusts." That last phrase is not from Gonzo Marketing -- it is one of my standard marketing mantras...<P>Gonzo Marketing is not a dreadful book; I read it through, and I enjoyed parts. But I think the book could have been much better if a capable editor had carved its 214 pages down to about 80.</span>

                    <span>To bring humor to a topic requires mastery beyond that of a mere expert. In Gonzo Marketing: Winning through Worst Practices, Christopher Locke exhibits a lot of things, but most of all, his hilarious wit shines bright over the often drab concepts of business. His mastery is not of how business is done best, but how it's done worst. <P>While his feet might be firmly planted in the box, his head is decidedly unboxed. Locke evokes Esther Dyson's aphorism 'Always make new mistakes,' inviting corporate marketers and consumers alike to realize that markets aren't clean and tidy; they're messy and ugly - quick and dirty even. His ideas don't lend themselves to conclusive be-all, end-all solutions, but to random, dangling loose ends. And that's the point really, isn't it? The fault lines in the mass mind don't divide the markets, they are the markets. Their rumbling and shifting is where Gonzo Marketing collects and analyzes its data, like a seismograph of the new economy's undulating and ever-changing landscape. <P>While corporations scramble to make sense of the paradigmatic wreckage of the Web, Locke sits back laughing. The Web has reconnected consumers with each other. We converse online about everything. "Markets are conversations," asserted The Cluetrain Manifesto (of which Locke was one of four co-authors), belying any established attempt to contain or coerce them. Gonzo Marketing invites business types to abandon their old ideas about markets and just join in the conversation, dammit! <P>Don't come 'round here looking for answers to your marketing problems. Yes, we have no new panacea for your demographic woes today. But, if you're looking for an engaging romp through - and an enlightening rant about - the way business is done in the now, Gonzo Marketing is the blinking Exit sign on the box in your mind.</span>

                    <span>Gonzo marketing was going to be the death of 'marketing as usual' in much the same way, I presume, that Cluetrain represented the "death of business as usual." neither happened so I guess either the world didn't listen or the author's didn't quite "get it".<BR>Gonzo marketing is not an enjoyable read - it can be entertaining but that doesn't make it enjoyable. Just when Locke ought to settle down and actually build on an anecdote supporting his beliefs of a new framework of marketing he digresses (disingenously disappears?) into an aside and we're left wonder exactly what just happened. <BR>The publication doesn't need to be written in dry corporate style to support it's thesis. However, it doesn't and the apparent liveliness of mass-media marketing suggests that this publicatioin was more internet evangilism than a practical means of getting your message across.</span>

                    <span>A friend getting her Masters in marketing recommended this book to me. I have a website of columns and stories - essentially an organized blog - and have been trying to increase my visitors. That was the perspective through which I read the book: how can I use the suggestions Locke makes for business to improve their online presence to grow my own audience. While Locke doesn't focus on personal website, the book did get me thinking. As I read, I constantly had to pt the book down to jot down some new ideas. <P>The book got me to start thinking about who my target audience is. That's harder than it sounds, as I don't write about a specific subject, rather whatever I like. Locke recommends that companies let their employees become active in online groups about what interests them in an attempt to build credibility with these micromarkets in lieu of annoying web advertising. Effectively communicate with a plethora of micromarkets and all of a sudden the company has a significant online presence that doesn't irritate people. I followed that advice and started posting on sites that pertain to my interests. I don't blatantly promote my articles, but just participate in the conversation, figuring if someone is interested by my post he or she will click on my URL in my signature file or click on my bio, see my URL, and follow it through. Plus, I enjoy it.<P>Locke doesn't get too specific on his gonzo model until the next to last chapter. It covers only 20 out of 214 pages of the book. The rest of it is spent philosophizing and critiquing other forms of marketing. Did this help me? Yes. But it doesn't do much to push his model. He'd do a better job of selling it to businesses if he had a case study or two. The chapter on the model would've made a good article in a business magazine, asking for a company to work with him on this approach. Chronicling the advantages - and limitations (which he glosses over) - of the model would make for a more convincing argument. What he's calling for is radical and to a non-business person, it makes sense. But without a few examples, I doubt any business is going to start restructuring its approach to online marketing.<P>After all that criticism, why did I give this book four out of five stars? Well, it is a good read and it's working for me.</span>
