                <span id="Label1">At last, sailboat design explained in a way that all boat owners can understand and put to use. The first guide to design aimed at every sailor, Yacht Design Explained uses state-of-the-art graphics, dynamic charts and photographs, and clear explanations to show what makes hulls, keels, ballast, rudders, foils, masts, and sails work. It reveals why certain designs perform well and others fail. The authors examine a range of boats, from a 14-foot dinghy to a 40-foot cruiser, from a catamaran to an offshore singlehander. They break through the often confusing physics of yacht design to provide an understanding that sailors can use to get the most out of their time afloat.</span>

                    <span>Steve Killing and Douglas Hunter present a very well written and beautifully presented analysis of the historic and technical aspects of yacht design, and many the tricks of the trade in designing safe, fast and reliable yachts. Using many diagrams and examples, the authors introduce you to the basics of designing fast racing sailboats and present the challenges faced by contemporary yacht designers in achieving a good balance between safety and speed. <BR>You will get to know most of the aspects of designing a sailboat, from hull design, speed predictions, stability, rigging, proper ballasting and keel design. You will be introduced to the use of coefficients which allow the comparison of different yachts in terms of relative weight for a given length, the sail area relative to displacement, etc. <BR>Full with interesting details it is a delightful book to read and a very useful reference source. A great starting book on the subject.</span>

                    <span>This is a book written by a knowledgable and experienced designer, Steve Killing, who understood his audience to be the average person. You don't really even have to know how to sail to appreciate this book (but I'd suggest it). It's well written and the diagrams are perhaps the best I've seen in a boat book.<P>On the downside the editing of the book places diagrams occasionally two pages away from the text that details it. This does is disturb the flow of the topic you are deep in the middle of. Plus, some interesting topics (such as adjustable backstays) are given a very light overview, and some (like bulkhead/hull/deck joint mechanics) are not covered at all.<P>Basically, it's a book about performance yacht design. That means it is primarily focused on the sailing aspects or hulls, and rigging, and keels, as opposed to liveability, or pure structural tradeoffs in yacht building. <P>That said, I've read it twice already, which for me is a rarity. Buy this book!<P> -thaw-</span>

                    <span>Well written and straight forward with great graphics and pictures, this wonderful book on sailing yacht design is a must for the curious sailor. <P>The contents include fantastic graphics, charts, illustrations and photographs. It covers the fundamentals of design including hulls, keels, ballast, rudders, rigs, and sails. <P>Covering designs from Sir Isaac Newton to the America's Cup, this book is not a technical manual but an explanation of the problems that designers and builders cope with in solving the problems created by wind and water to produce a stable and practical sailing vessel.<P>Capt.
