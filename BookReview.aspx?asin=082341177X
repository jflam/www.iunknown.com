                    <span>David Adler has done a tremendous job with this biography as with the others in the series. The book is a great introductory biography for young students in grades K-3. Although his biographies have been criticized for being simplistic, I feel this is exactly what makes these books perfect for younger audiences. They were meant to be an INTRODUCTORY biography, not an  exhaustive research study. Young listeners will not be bored and will not  drown in excessive information. The book is abundantly illustrated with  colorful pictures and concludes with a timeline of important dates. My  kids, ages 5,8 and 11, love this series.</span>
