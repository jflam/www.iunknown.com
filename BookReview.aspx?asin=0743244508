                    <span>Barry Strauss' narrative of this complex ancient naval battle brings the story to life with rich details and a readable, popular narrative style. I found the book fascinating and learned a great deal about the Greeks and Persians -- not just the dry history one reads in text books, but a host of details from the revenge of a eunich to the wardrobe of the first female admiral ever. I highly recommend this book not only to history and war buffs but also to the general reader who likes adventure and lively prose</span>

                    <span>Strauss brings the ancient sources to life with this well researched account of one of the greatest naval battles of all time. The book reads like a novel, with rich color and great details. But Strauss also keeps true to the historical details, with well documented and well reasoned interpretations, an appendix of sources, and a detailed bibliography guaranteed to satisfy even the most finicky reader. The characters and the story are compelling and the story moves at a rapid pace. The author's familiarity not only with Greece's landscape and history, but also with the mechanics of rowing, make this book a treat for historians and athletes alike.</span>

                    <span>The Battle of Salamis describes the fateful naval battle between Greece and the Persian Empire in the year 480 BC - a pivotal event that determined the trajectory of western democracy. Persia had numerical superiority; Greece had cunning. Persia was a master of land-based warfare; Greece waged naval guerilla warfare. Each side knew the future of the world was in the hands of the winner. <BR>Barry Strauss is a master storyteller who brings to life not only the events of the time and their antecedents, but also a host of memorable characters: the brilliant but unscrupulous Greek commander Themistocles; the infantry-centric Persian King Xerxes who failed to understand naval guerilla warfare; the cunning Artemisia, the first female admiral in history; the vengeful Persian eunuch Hermotimus; the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who participated in the battle; the Spartan admiral Eurybiades, who had to maintain the fractured Greek coalition in the heat of battle... and many, many more. <BR>The battle of Salamis involved approximately 300,000 sailors, marines, soldiers, and refugees -- the equivalent of 20 million people in today's terms - from Europe, Asia and Africa. It included some of the cleverest tricks in the history of war, with many lessons for today's readers. <BR>The author does a masterful job of storytelling with a solid basis in research, including archaeology, meteorology, forensic anthropology and previously overlooked literary sources. He adds to this his own knowledge of rowing. The result is a meticulously researched page-turner - the author imparts the sights, sounds, and even smells of an ancient time, ancient cultures, and an ancient naval battle that imparts important lessons for today's turbulent world.</span>
