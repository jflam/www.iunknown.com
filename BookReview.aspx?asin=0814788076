                <span id="Label1">"Illuminating"<br> &#151;<i>Bookforum</i> April-June 2002 <P> "It has taken lawyers 200-plus years to morph copyright law from the balanced compromise that our framers struck to the extraordinary system of control that it has become. In this beautifully written book, a nonlawyer has uncovered much of the damage done. <I>Copyrights and Copywrongs</I> is a rich and compelling account of the bending of American copyright law, and a promise of the balance that we could once again make the law become."<br> &#151;Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law School and author of <I>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</I> <P> "Siva Vaidhyanathan has done a big favor for the academic and library communities. In this book, he has spelled out in clear, understandable language what's at stake in the battles over the nation's intellectual property. The issues brought forward are critical to the future of scholarship and creativity. Librarians and academics are wise to purchase this book and add it to their &#145;must read' lists."<br> &#151;Nancy Kranich, President, American Library Association, 2000&#150;2001 <P> "<I>Copyrights and Copywrongs</I> is an urgent information-age wake-up call to a public cocooned in belief that &#145;copyright' is a seal and safeguard for consumers and producers of culture-ware. This book guides us into the legal labyrinth of a new world of so-called intellectual property, in which &#145;fair use' isn't fair, where rights are waived and free speech&#151;when we can get it&#151;costs a great deal of money. From print books to video games, <I>Copyrights and Copywrongs</I> shows free expression in a legalistic chokehold. Clearly written, meticulously argued, this book is a must."<br> &#151;Cecelia Tichi, author of<I>Embodiment of a Nation: Human Form in American Spaces</I> <P> Copyright reflects far more than economic interests. Embedded within conflicts over royalties and infringement are cultural values&#151;about race, class, access, ownership, free speech, and democracy&#151;which influence how rights are determined and enforced. Questions of legitimacy&#151;of what constitutes "intellectual property" or "fair use," and of how to locate a precise moment of cultural creation&#151;have become enormously complicated in recent years, as advances in technology have exponentially increased the speed of cultural reproduction and dissemination. <P> In <B>Copyrights and Copywrongs</B>, Siva Vaidhyanathan tracks the history of American copyright law through the 20th century, from Mark Twain's vehement exhortations for "thick" copyright protection, to recent lawsuits regarding sampling in rap music and the "digital moment," exemplified by the rise of Napster and MP3 technology. He argues persuasively that in its current punitive, highly restrictive form, American copyright law hinders cultural production, thereby contributing to the poverty of civic culture. <P> In addition to choking cultural expression, recent copyright law, Vaidhyanathan argues, effectively sanctions biases against cultural traditions which differ from the Anglo-European model. In African-based cultures, borrowing from and building upon earlier cultural expressions is not considered a legal trespass, but a tribute. Rap and hip hop artists who practice such "borrowing" by sampling and mixing, however, have been sued for copyright violation and forced to pay substantial monetary damages. Similarly, the oral transmission of culture, which has a centuries-old tradition within African American culture, is complicated by current copyright laws. How, for example, can ownership of music, lyrics, or stories which have been passed down through generations be determined? Upon close examination, strict legal guidelines prove insensitive to the diverse forms of cultural expression prevalent in the United States, and reveal much about the racialized cultural values which permeate our system of laws. Ultimately, copyright is a necessary policy that should balance public and private interests but the recent rise of "intellectual property" as a concept have overthrown that balance. Copyright, Vaidhyanathan asserts, is policy, not property. <P> Bringing to light the republican principles behind original copyright laws as well as present-day imbalances and future possibilities for freer expression and artistic equity, this volume takes important strides towards unraveling the complex web of culture, law, race, and technology in today's global marketplace.</span>

                    <span>Siva Vaidyanathan had translated a sometimes incredibly misunderstood concept/subject into a reasonably understandable story. And, even more incredibly, it was written by a non-attorney (Siva is a professor at the U. of Wisconsin, School of Information Studies). "Copyrights and Copywrongs" covers the history and bastardization of American copyright law. Siva attempts to make relatively simple suggestions for fixing our complex, arcane system of protecting intellectual property rights. <P>Siva begins his "story" recounting in incredibly understandable terms, the history of the copyright ranging from the framing of the U.S. Constitution, the rights afforded musicians (recently challenged by the likes of ...) and of course, literary and digital works. Siva does not concentrate on the theoretical nature of this quagmire rather, he examines the issues as it relates to current issues and events making the content interesting and readable. He argues, very persuasively, that the current copyright laws in their punitive and restrictive form y hinder creativity and free expression. Further, he compellingly argues that the original intent of the laws were designed for flexible application to maintain cultural balance. <P>The issues framed in this book encompass the very future of creativity vital to industry, commerce, and free expression. A very enjoyable read even given the somewhat difficult nature of the subject matter.</span>

                    <span>Vaidyanathan clearly has some opinions on the topics he discusses. Since I don't have much experience with the history of copyright, I don't know how objective this book is.<P>That said, it's a terrifically readable book. I took it with me on a plane trip, and hardly even noticed the flight time! Vaidyanathan paints a clear picture of how copyright developed from early efforts of publishers and writers in England, through Samuel Clemens' fascinating manipulations, to the current state of US and international copyright law. <P>Vaidyanathan is of the view that the original intentions of copyright, to make "ideas" available to the public at low cost once the author has had a decent chance to make money off them, have been subverted over the years. The current restrictive rules, he argues, maximize profit to the author (or more usually, the publisher), and abuse the rights of the general public to access information and ideas.<P>It's a fascinating book.</span>

                    <span>Being in a special topics philosophy class, I was new to the whole intellectual policy and computer ethics field. I found this book to be as essential as James Moor's "What is Computer Ethics?" and Albert Borgmann's "Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry." <P>This book is great for beginners as well as some pros on this matter. It seemed like a perfect blend of what Noel Carroll calls in his "A Philosophy of Mass Art," mass art and avant-garde art - it is written in a style that the mass can understand (which defines mass art) yet challenges convential thinking and equips the reader with enough background knowledge early off to understand the rest of the book (avant-garde art usually doesn't even bother to give background knowledge as it is geared towards a certain field, not the masses).<P>Siva Vaidhyanathan did a masterful research in law and the history of law as he uncovers a bright story concerning intellectual property even from the time of the founding fathers of this nation. If you are a beginner in the field of IP, I suggest this book to be the first one that you read as it is an excellent base.</span>

                    <span>I have been reading your book and am alternately exhilarated and despairing. From other research on the web on this issue, I keep seeing over and over that without copyright protection, people wouldn't have incentive to create. What a load of muck. Creative people NEED to create. They also need to not starve to death, of course. But creating things in and of itself is rewarding. If money is what motivates someone, they should become stockbrokers or something that more honestly reflects their values. I think that motivation by money, and creativity are almost mutually exclusive; once money becomes the motive, creativity is dead, or at least mortally wounded. I know the thrill of creating. I do art without any compensation at all, because I need to and want to, and have been a computer programmer for years, marvelling that someone was willing to pay me for something that is so much FUN! Creativity is inherently rewarding.</span>

                    <span>This timely and wide-ranging book is useful on at least two levels. First, it rehearses some of the major steps and missteps that have brought us to where we are in the realm of copyright and intellectual property. Second, the book demonstrates explicitly some of the perils of the current legal framework.<P>Vaidhyanathan sets out his own objectives thus:<P>"This book has three goals. The first is to trace the development of American copyright law though the twentieth century. . . . The second goal is to succinctly and clearly outline the principles of copyright while describing the alarming erosion of the notion that copyright should protect specific expressions but not the ideas that lie beneath the expressions. The third and most important purpose of this book is to argue that American culture and politics would function better under a system that guarantees 'thin' copyright protection -- just enough protection to encourage creativity, yet limited so that emerging artists, scholars, writers, and students can enjoy a right public domain and broad 'fair use' of copyrighted material."<P>I believe that he succeeds on these terms. Even better, the book is very well written as prose, which we'd expect from a creative academic with long experience in print journalism. (The book is also full of fascinating tidbits. Did you know that Samuel Clemens would spend a weekend in Canada to register each of his books there? He did it to fortify his copyright protection throughout the Commonwealth.)<P>The chapters proceed more or less chronologically as Vaidhyanathan moves from early conceptions of copyright; through the careers of Mark Twain and D. W. Griffith as key users and developers of evolving notions of copyright; through the development of the modern recording industry, and its tangles with rap music in the past 25 years; and on into what I might call the copyright-command-and-control battles of the Internet era.<P>Along the way, he shows how we moved away from an older ideal of "thin" copyrights towards the modern regime of "thick" ones. In particular, he's strong in making the case that copyrights used to be -- and should be still -- the legal codification of a sort of utilitarian policy bargain. Vaidhyanathan drives home this interpretation time and again:<P>"Significantly, the founders, whether enamored of the virtuous potential of copyright as Washington was, enchanted by the machinery of incentive as Madison was, or alarmed by the threat of concentrated power as Jefferson was, did not argue for copyrights or patents as 'property.' Copyright was a matter of policy, of a bargain among the state, its authors, and its citizens." (page 23)<P>"The law [the first American copyright statute, enacted in Connecticut in 1783] also required that the author 'furnish the Public with sufficient Editions,' such that an author could not benefit from the protection of the law while restricting access to his work. Such a balance, a tradeoff, between public good and private reward served as the germinal idea of American copyright . . ." (page 44)<P>"Property rights in America are traditionally a matter of convention and agreement, and not, as the judge in [a case he's just been discussing] asserted, a matter of divine decree or 'natural' law." (page 59)<P>Throughout the book, Vaidhyanathan is an ardent proponent of a system of "thin" copyrights. He argues such a regime would be more reflective of U.S. legal history (as demonstrated in the quotation above about the Founders); allow a better balance between private commercial interests and broader societal interests; and promotes both protection for the established artist -- for a limited time -- and then the availability of our common cultural heritage to emerging artists.<P>(In making this last argument, he covers some fascinating ground, particularly in contrasting the typically linear nature of European [and European-American] creativity and the typically circular nature of African [and Caribbean, and African-American] creativity. While his absorbing discussions of the creativity embodied in Delta Blues, reggae, and rap music effectively demonstrate the latter point, I would have liked him to give more credit to the great classical-music tradition of one composer offering arrangements of or variations upon the work of another.)<P>Standing against this ideal of thin copyrights is the current corporation-dominated regime of thick copyrights and "intellectual property". While Vaidhyanathan sometimes shades toward stridency in his dicsussion of this, he's quite apt is assessing its major ills. The system has progressively done away with the "bargain" discussed above, in favor of making ideas, and not merely their expressions, the "property" of owners, and especially of owners who have the lawyerly firepower to back up their claims. Such a regime tends to ignore or suppress the broader societal interests served by balanced principles of fair use, in favor of private commercial interests. And in general, the system promotes the haves while it ignores, chills, or actively bars the have-nots.<P>The new property-talk regime of thick copyrights is a relatively recent innovation -- it really picked up steam in the 1970s -- that has been immensely ramified by the growth of computer technology and networked sytems. Copyright holders -- especially large commercial interests -- now have the technology to enforce copyrights much more rigorously. And, as Vaidhyanathan rightly points out, wrongheaded and antidemocratic legislation like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) puts too much of the police power behind such enforcement into the hands of the copyright holders themselves.<P>Fundamentally, Vaidhyanathan's got it right: ordinary citizens, newcomers, little people, and outsiders are getting the shaft at the expense of major corporations, the media Establishment, big wheels, and insiders. DMCA deserves to be opposed by clear-thinking citizens everywhere, and at some point we have to abandon the ridiculous prospect of extending copyrights ad infinitum. Though this book explicitly addresses the situation in the United States, folks beyond its borders should likewise heed its call to support better, freer, and fairer interpretations of copyright.</span>
