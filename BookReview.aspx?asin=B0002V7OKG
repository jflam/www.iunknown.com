                    <span>how dare you ASSUME the great Mr. Schmeling was a "Nazi Party Member" quite the opposite actually. Max NEVER joined the Nazi party and during "Crystalnacht" or "Night of Broken Glass" in 1938 Berlin, Max hid the 2 young sons of his jewish tailor Henri Lewin in his hotel room at the Excelsior; he did this at great risk to himself and his wife Anny. when asked 50 years later about it, he simply said he did it because "it was the duty of a man" Max went on to donate millions to various charities throughout his life and remained life long friends with Joe Louis, and even helped pay for his funeral, since he was destitute, does that sound like a Nazi to you? One of his more famous quotes, in 1992 or 1993 i believe, when asked how he would like to be remebered, he responded "I dont want anyone to say I was a good athlete, but worth nothing as a human being - I couldnt bear that" The great Max Schmeling passed 6 weeks ago, rest in peace champ......</span>

                    <span>A wonderful PBS/American Experience documentary concerning the second fight between Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis and the challenger Max Schmeling. Schmeling, a German Nazi Party member, had defeated Louis two years earlier to give Louis his first pro loss. This film not only covers the fight itself, but also the political and social ramifications that were worldwide. I've been a huge boxing fan my whole life, with this fight being my favorite. If you don't know the outcome......I won't spoil it for you! And the winner is.........YOU if you buy this DVD!!!!</span>
