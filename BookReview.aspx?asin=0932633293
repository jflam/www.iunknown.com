                    <span>I can understand why this book has gotten some mixed reviews. The author addresses many common modeling problems. But readers looking for instant solutions to those problems will probably be disappointed. Those looking for oop patterns are reading the wrong book. And anyone looking for a beginner's introduction to data modeling will be completely lost. But if you've been feeling as if your database designs could be better, but you're not sure how, you need this book.
<br />
<br />Mr. Hay covers many real-world modeling problems. His discussions of these problems give incredible insight into the thought process of a professional data modeler. That is the true value of this book.
<br />
<br />I first read this book about three years ago and now I am totally embarrassed by every database I created before. I've re-read it many times since and my copy is beaten and dog-eared. Thankfully, it's a hardcover book. 
<br />
<br />Make sure you read all the footnotes in the book. Some of them are hysterically funny.</span>

                    <span>There are two ways of modelling business environments.
<br />
<br />The first is how they like you to do it in tightly controlled organizations like the military -- "Follow this exact nine-step procedure and your data model will fall out the end of it".
<br />
<br />The second is to apply an intelligent, informed, and flexible approach -- it is this method that the book addresses, and it is far superior in my eyes.
<br />
<br />Those interested in data modelling by rote should look elsewhere, because this is an excellent resource that will be wasted on you.</span>

                    <span>Be aware entity-relationship modelling is considered harmful, being incapable of representing a full, detailed relational model and even being misleading quite often.<p>Since this book is based on ERM, it won't be ever a definitive reference.  It may have other qualities.</span>

                    <span>This book provides you with patterns for creating conceptual data models.  It's not practical, though, in that it does not provide insight into how to go from conceptual to real.  In fact, it's almost useless.<p>These "patterns" are nothing more than concepts that good data modelers instinctively know already.  <p>Also, his ER modeling techniques are a bit outdated.  <p>Finally, this book is very, very dense and difficult to read.  He just describes how to set up the models in very dense language, without going into the why's.  It becomes virtually unreadable after the second or third pattern.<p>There are other, more recent books out there which provide better, more up to date thinking on this nascent topic (which I believe is still years, if not decades away from truly practical modeling/process techniques).</span>

                    <span>This books is great for getting ideas. I use it to help me think about data models that I'm creating. Hay presents his thinking from many perspectives. He's not trying to say, "Here's how you do this data model." What he does is present different aspects of modeling various subject areas; illustrating various slants at approaching models for the subject area. This is very helpful when brainstorming or trying to come up with a model. This book is a great reference that I consult consistently at the beginning of each new modeling task. A must have.</span>
