                    <span>contrary to the idiots below, i don't think this bok is spreading "communist" ideas at all.  it's all too wishy-washy and if anything, will inspire people to join the democratic party, i.e. one of the two parties of capital and the ruling elite.  the book tends to gloss over the real issues of class, power, and inequality and goes for an analysis that breaks the population down into "quintiles" of income.  for what?  if you're a centrist or liberal you might like this, but for radicals and anti-capitalists looking for good analysis, this won't be very helpful at all.</span>

                    <span>...  <p>Collins and Yeskel do a superb job in showing why multinational corporations are progressively extending the gap between rich and poor, both in this country and abroad.  The power of the multinationals is incredible; of the 100 largest economies in the world, 51 are corporate.  Governments increasingly cater to multinationals, rewriting environmental and tax laws in order to encourage them to do business.  Even the supposedly liberal Clinton--who, after all, enthusiastically brought us NAFTA--bought into (or should it be "sold out to") the corporate line that "the business of government is business."  This attitude creates huge wealth for a very few, but the old claim that this wealth trickles down to benefit others is simply false, and Collins and Yeskel give facts and figures to demonstrate its falsity.<p>In short, the book is an invaluable read for anyone concerned with questions of social justice. sustainability, and old-fashioned economic survival.  It tends to be a bit redundant in places, but this may be more of a merit than otherwise in a primer that really does summarize a dizzying amount of information.  Readers who wish to explore the case against multinationals in more depth may wish to consult works like Derber's *Corporation Nation* or Korten's *When Corporations Rule the World.*  E.F. Schumacher's classic *Small Is Beautiful* is also still well worth taking a look at.</span>

                    <span>Just another book promoting the same old ideas of the twentieth century.  If you are knew to political philosophy, or philosophy in general, this book will be easier to understand than Das Capital. <p>But for the love of humanity, remember the millions of dead bodies spread throughout the world, the result of popular leaders spreading these ideas.<p>Of course, for those of us who have had to deal with Communism in school, on TV, movies, news, etc... this book is a good look into the mind of the newest generation of zombies to graduate with a humanities degree.  Karl Marx would be proud.</span>

                    <span>Just another book promoting communism. The same old arguments communists have been making for years, recast with the latest terminology in an attempt to disguise their true philosophy. Other than new terminology however, the book presents nothing new in terms of ideas and simply tries to foment racial and social war through the same old communist techniques.</span>

                    <span>Economic Apartheid in America approaches the issue of economic inequality in an alternative fashion.  Unlike other books, the authors explain the status quo and then continue to propose ideas and their thoughts of possible activist movements.  The first three chapters discuss the current situation not only in wages but also income, savings and wealth.  They explain the different indicators of increasing gaps between quartiles of income levels.  The authors provide reasons for the unequal distribution that has spiraled out of control over the past few decades, such as CEO compensation reaching a record high of 419 times greater than the average factory worker.  Chapter 4 outlines strategies for the so-called "building a fair economy movement."  They use historical examples to illustrate possible solvency of the current dilemma.  The book concludes with personal action-oriented options for readers to undertake, such as campaigning for a coalition for living wage.  While it is evident that the authors have strong opinions and may be viewed as radical, their suggestions do have relevance and have a right to be considered in the search for a solution.  The illustrations and charts serve in visual understanding of the facts and help the reader to understand the data in an alternative facet.  The book is not difficult to read or to comprehend and highlights the major problems arising between the rich and the rest of America.  Economic problems are running ramped in the United States and, as a reader, you are challenged to consider the fairness and moral implications of the issue.</span>
