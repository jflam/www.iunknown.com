                    <span>Probably the best general application architecture books out there.  The only time this book gets specific to a proprietary technology is in the examples only because martin wants to show you a real world example of what he is talking about.  There are examples in C#, some in java, etc.  It is organized very well and if you were around when he was developing it you could have gotten the whole book in pdf form for free!</span>

                    <span>You could view this as a rehashing of patterns that have existing for some time - or - you could view this is a collection of those patterns that are still relevant today. Based on how I used this book in my work, I see it from the latter perspective. There's nothing wrong with re-documenting old material when you focus on what's been proven and successful. Plus, there's new content that will be of interest to many as well. Though this book came out a while ago, I feel it is still relevant today.</span>

                    <span>I read this the first week it came out and was suprised by how much it rehashed GOF and the Core J2EE patterns books; however I have referred back to it on "Unit of Work" and a couple other concepts that it helped to differentiate.  TO it's credit it consolidated information from several bodies of knowledge in patterns, and it provided c# examples in many cases, thereby being the first high profile work that really exposed MS developers to a world of patterns, that was arguably previously unknown.  Besides being somewhat lacking in originality, the other problems were the fact it actually catalogued anti-patterns as patterns (e.g. transaction script is basically unmaintainable web pages), and it addressed enterprise system architecture without paying any mind to integration concerns (see Hohpe for an excellent treatment of this subject); I'm not sure the two really are separable when we start talking about business services.  The best thing about this book is that it emphasizes the criticality of rich domain models in complex systems, which IMHO is a core design principle which is currently being eroded by a current of irrational and marketing-drunk SOA furor ... which reminds me, Domain Driven Design is not to be missed, it's simply an inspired work which helps to make Fowler's domain model achievable for almost anyone.</span>

                    <span>Don't be afraid of the word Enterprise in the title, this book is relevant even if you work only on small/medium size applications. Fowler covers lot of database and data related patterns and quite a good amount of material is related to browser-based client GUIs.</span>

                    <span>Well, I finally got through this one, so it's time to write the review...
<br />
<br />I have to say I was disappointed by this book. Even though it's presented a MF's Signature book, in hardcover no less, the author tells us he just expects it to be "useful". Yes Martin, it is, but I expected it to be excellent, not just useful.
<br />
<br />Another, bigger problem is that the title is very misleading: those like me looking to find something on the level of the Gamma and Alur books beware, the are very few design patterns here, as this deals mostly with implementations techniques. A title like "Strategies for Enterprise Applications" would be more accurate so you know upfront what to expect. 
<br />
<br />It has also been noted that it fails short on the Enterprise tag, discussing neither security, nor messaging or deployment, and I agree. Finally, I feel it also fails in providing "a pattern language" since there are just too many of them presented, with too many words on them.
<br />
<br />But even as flawed as it is, I find it a good book, that will teach you some tricks you may have missed, and is also an invaluable introduction and teaching tool (just not for those of us already deep into design and architecture).
<br />
<br />A very positive feature of the book is that it denies neither J2EE nor .NET, playing to the advantages of both depending on the subject at hand. However, for true design patterns in those technologies get the excellent "Core J2EE Patterns" and "Enterprise Solution Patterns using .NET" respectively instead.
