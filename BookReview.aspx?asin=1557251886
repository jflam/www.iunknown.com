                    <span>I couldn't put this Christ-centered, uplifting book down. What a joy to read! Miss L'Engle is certainly an awesome writer who explores spiritual depths with refreshing courage and fearlessness. I would give this book 500 stars if I were allowed! A book that will touch you, move you, and encourage you in the faith.</span>

                    <span>A few phrases from the introduction capture the reason why this book was brought into being. "An issue such as the supernatural cannot be left to charlatans and hucksters. Because it holds importance for all of us, its investigation must be led by trustworthy guides-the best minds with the greatest linguistic gifts." The editor, Harold Fickett, picked his title, Things in Heaven and Earth, Exploring the Supernatural, then found fourteen totally different individuals, all competent writers, who were willing to do their best explaining why the spiritual is significant and meaningful. Readers will find these articles amazingly different in substance and style, yet each in their own way, deeply meaningful, "spiritual." Fickett also accomplished a major service for religious unity by choosing authors, liberal and conservative, from a wide spectrum of religious faith. In addition, Larry Woiwode's chapter emphasizes the natural world of forests and lakes, birds and beasts, through which God manifests love to the human race. Probably the most surprising article is by Ron Austin titled Blue Screen in which he hails God speaking to us through great lines from some of our most widely respected motion pictures. As editor of Cosmic Concepts inspirational books, my first scanning of these essays gave some of their authors high marks, others lesser grades. Since then I have been reading them to my wife, Jean, who suffered a stroke two years ago limiting her mental quickness, but not her depth of soul. I read slowly, with pauses to let the thoughts sink in. Her softly spoken "oh" or "ah" tell me "yes, the spiritual is coming through," and my appreciation of the author greatly expands. Reading in relaxed meditation, rather than rushing through, will enhance your appreciation of the authors' messages. <P>.</span>
