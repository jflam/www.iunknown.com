                    <span>William Safire has given readers a remarkable gift with this collection. Lend Me Your Ears is very similar to a book of poetry - it is to be treasured, read and referenced over a lifetime; never to be "finished" or forgotten.
<br />
<br />This book has broad appeal - especially to fans of history and politics. But, anyone looking for inspiration or uplifting can find an appropriate speech or passage in its pages. And, most importantly, the book cuts both ways across the political divide - one can find speeches from John F. and Robert Kennedy, FDR, Clinton, Lincoln, Churchill, Martin Luther King, and least surprisingly, Nixon, since Safire served as one of his speechwriters. Safire knows the language as well as anyone, probably better than your favorite English teacher, and his marvelous talents as a speechwriter give this book even more credibility. A good speechwriter knows a great speech when he hears it and/or reads it, as Safire shows with his selections in this book. (Point of fact - I'm a proud, liberal Democrat, and I have these feelings about Safire!)   
<br />
<br />Safire offers introductions and sage commentary before each speech, which I found both enlightening and entertaining. I cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone interested in great speeches through history. I'm hoping for a revised edition or perhaps a volume II from Safire.
<br />
<br />One final note: some criticize the author for speeches omitted in this volume, but a line has to be drawn, or a book on this subject could span thousands of pages. Keep in mind, this book contains great speeches in Safire's opinion; it's not an end-all-be-all list of great historic speeches.    </span>

                    <span>Hands Down!  <p>This is my absolute favorite speeches collection.  William Safire, the man who penned "nattering nabobs of negativism," draws from the ages to illustrate the power of human eloquence<p>Our age is dominated by speeches that will never qualify for inclusion.   This former speechwriter, current columnist and guardian of our language, selected, arranged and introduced 220 examples of history's finest oratory.  Arranged by theme and occasion, each speech is introduced by the editor, given historical perspective and analyzed for techniques that gave it force and staying-power.<p>This is the most valuable kind of book.  Since I purchased it 20 years ago, I have spent hours savoring its content.  My favorite speech in it remains Jack Kemp's November 30, 1990 salute to Winston Churchill in which he skillfully and eloquently turns into an intense and unequivocal plea for an armed intervention in the Persian Gulf.  It remains a superb example of an ideologue whom brings clarity and passion to dais.<p>No one who faces an audience and attempts to inspire, fortify, entertain, convince or memorialize should be without a copy of this wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>William Safire in his LEND ME YOUR EARS does not purport how to tell the novice speaker how to step up to the podium and knock 'em dead with a fluid barrage of words.  Instead, his goal is more modest, to figure out why some speeches have reverberated through the acoustic corridors of history while others have fizzled out with nary an echo to record their passing.  Surprisingly enough, he acknowledges that a magnificent speaking voice can not turn verbal mush into thrilling oratory. No one knows what Abe Lincoln truly sounded like, but we honor his Gettysburg Address as a sublime example of stirring words.  What Safire does is to give the reader a sort of ten commandents that the great speakers of the past must have followed.  Ironically, this list is not something that one can examine, nor can compare to what the speaker brings to the podium to exclaim,'Ah ha, this is what I lack!'  Among the magical list includes a variation on the old saw, 'Tell 'em what you're going to tell 'em; then tell 'em; then tell 'em what you told 'em.' Safire translates this as a smooth flow that invites a rhythm to the delivery.  He adds that this smooth flow must not be the smoothness of uninterrupted rhythm; there ought to be a variation that allows the audience to catch a breath at just the right point. Other necessities include occasion (the speaker is at the right point at the right time); forum (the 'where' the speech is given); focus (what's the purpose or point); theme; word choice. <br>  What Safire does with this list is to quote generally agreed upon memorable speeches and list them by category, speeches of patriotism, revolution and war, tributes and elegies, debates, trials, gallows and farewell, sermons, inspirational, lectures, social responsibility, finally closing with speeches of media, politics, and commencement. Each category has some dozen examples, with a prefatory explanatory essay per.  Some speeches have the added advantage of having been popularized in the media by recording or rehearsed performance.  I can still hear Marlon Brando as Mark Antony in 'Julius Caesar' rousing the crowd to a killing frenzy: 'If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.' Shakespeare used every one of Safire's requirements.  Getting Brando to say them was just a bonus. Who can forget Chief Joseph's closing words of the agony he felt over the destruction of his people by the white man: 'From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.' Then there is FDR's war declaration against Japan, replete with its sonorous cadences that begin with the critical phrase, 'day of infamy.' <br>       Great speeches are often not great until after the fact.  Lincoln felt that his speech at Gettysburg was a failure since it met only polite applause.  Others generate the unmistakable cachet of greatness right away.  Reading LEND ME YOUR EARS will not make you a great speaker, but it can give clues as to how and why the power of the spoken word can shake societies to their core.</span>

                    <span>Lend Me Your Ears is a collection of speeches, based on topic, from Ancient Greece to Modern America.  It is edited by William Safire, an old speech writer for Nixon.  Still active in the field, William Safire has some good insight into what makes a great speech and how we can learn from the masters.<p>In particular, each topic and each speech has an introduction by Mr Safire.  In his introduction he explains the background of the speech,why this particular speech is important, and what makes this speech, in his view, so good.  For the most part, the book is very well done.  <p>I liked his comments and actually have adopted some of his suggestions for my own speeches.  (I am an attorney. I would warn the casual speaker that nothing is worse then read the "best speeches of all time" right before your own presentaton.  I made that mistake, once.)  <p>Why not five stars?  I thought he could have made some better selections.  In particular, he focused heavily on modern America and our politiicans.  I am sure, based on his audience, this was/is a smart move.  By doing so, however, he deleted some speeches that had more impact, more relevence, and more interest to this reader.  Still, this is a minor critic.  It is a good book, just not a five star one.</span>
