                    <span>This is an excellent book for someone starting out in investing. It teaches you WJ O'Neil's CANSLIM method of picking stocks. <P>What's CANSLIM you ask? CANSLIM is a method of picking stocks developed by William J. O'Neil. He's taken his years of investing knowledge and developed a system of picking stocks that has repeatedly proven to be successful.<P>The book takes you through each part of this method from quarterly earnings through annual earnings, when to buy, trading volume, stock leaders, institutional support and market direction.<P>He also teaches you when to sell a stock even in a bad market. He'll show you how to cut your losses and why it's important to sell at the right time to prevent major losses on a stock.<P>Finally he takes you through some of the best stocks in recent history and shows you how to read the signs that they put out. This will teach you how to recognize today's stocks that are ready to burst from the pack and soar to new highs.<P>This book pushes WJ O'Neil's newspaper, Investor Business Daily, as it has much of the information needed to use the CANSLIM method. But even without his paper this book teaches you the methods needed to make money in the stock market.<P>All in all I think this is a great book for investors.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book from a man who obviously knows investing from experience (he has been successful). The book describes investing in Value stocks (moderate to high price stocks in steady companies) using technical analysis.<P>Patterns of successful stocks in history are reviewed and a system for choosing winning stocks is explain using detailed company information and charts. If you don't like math or don't want to spend time weekly reviewing your investments, this book is probably not for you.<P>Ture novice investors (like myself) BEWARE. Mr O'Neil does not describe many of the basic concepts he discusses in his book. I found myself becoming frustrated in several chapters as he discussed terms like "price consolidation", "overhead supply","upside buypoint", "pivot point", etc. After reading the book, I went and bought a more basic book (The Neatest Little Guide...5 Stars) to help me as a true novice.<P>In summary, I am glad I purchased the book. I now understand the investing viewpoint from a Value/Technical investor as well as the patterns of past winning stocks.</span>

                    <span>This is the best system you'll find anywhere. I originally worked as a broker for a firm that followed the Bill O'Neil philosophy and that firm made $$ for their clients consistently. Now I follow this system and trade for my own accounts with even better results. My last stock, TASR, was up roughly 100% (much more on margin) in one month and I found this stock by using the fundamental & technical analysis that I've learned through Investors Business Daily along with dailygraphs (www.dailygraphs.com). His strategy of cutting losses quick and letting winners ride is necessary to preserve capital and maximize gains. AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) rated this as the best performing strategy over several years period.</span>

                    <span>First, I would have to comment that the criticism about IBD as a normal newspaper is unfair. Its analysis and opinions are encapsulated in the numbers, systematically compiled for any common stocks worth considering as investments. Any individual investor would see that at one dollar, IBD is a bargain. "How to Make Money in Stocks" is the guide to understanding the ratings of IBD, as well as a clear introduction to O'Neill's investing philosophy. The prevailing market conditions are very important to the success of CANSLIM, and reviews of the book written in the depths of the 2000-2002 stock funk may be colored indeed. <P>I, too, had some questions about "pivot points," etc. that seem sparsely described. This is because you are supposed to look at the charts. If this isn't enough, look at more charts (the book has plenty). "Pivot points" and "accumulation" are not exact concepts, so one has to practice looking at the chart and acquire an understanding of these concepts. "How to Make Money in Stocks" is one of those rare books that relies on the graphical presentation of data as much as copy writing to communicate its sometimes fuzzy ideas.<P>This book is superb at describing the CANSLIM method on analysis, which can be done these days with free internet sources. An excellent description for novices of investing research.<P>My advice would be to pick up this book, read it, buy a copy of IBD, and keep track of ten or so stocks for 60 days or so. If the market goes up and these stocks don't, look for a better method. If you need more comforting words in the newspaper to guide your money decisions, drop this stuff and hire some investment professional.</span>

                    <span>I have been investing in the stock market since 1998. I've made my share and lost my share. However, it was always a chaotic affair. I wasn't investing based on anything solid, it was just going with the market. Besides who could lose in the 90's? Then came 2000 and 2001. <BR>Lucky for me I ran into this book and let me tell you something, it has made me comfortable with the way I invest. I don't need to keep up with the market every minute and I don't stress as much. I also understand better how to read graphs and how to interpret market activities. A book well worth it.<BR>It does mention the Investors Business Daily paper a lot because they publish it but it's a worthy paper also so I don't see anything wrong with that.</span>
