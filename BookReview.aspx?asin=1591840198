                <span id="Label1">Most Americans would agree that they are duty bound as beneficiaries of our democracy to pay taxes, and the majority of us do pay&#151;-exorbitantly. But what about those who do not pay their fair share? David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the <I>New York Times</I>, here reveals how fairness and equity have eroded from the American tax system. Johnston describes in shocking detail the loopholes our government provides the "super rich"--from private individuals to profitable corporations&#151;-to hide their wealth, to defer or evade tax payments, and to pass the bill to law-abiding middle-class Americans. The loss in revenue "imposes a severe cost on honest taxpayers" through reduced services, increased federal debt, and a weight on the middle class that threatens to impede its ability to achieve upward social mobility.   </p>Admitting the extreme complexity of our economy and by extension our tax code, Johnston points out that the very wealthy do, of course, pay taxes. However, because of shelters that allow them to understate most of their income, they pay little more on average than most Americans on the dollar. This is regressive, and unquestionably favors the superrich. Johnston includes examples of outrageous corporate malfeasance (such as companies that establish off-shore tax addresses) and exposes the tax benefits of the particularly loathsome practice made famous by Jack Welch, in which thousands of wage earners are laid off while a handful of executives are granted hundreds of millions of dollars through deferred compensation, company stock options, and lucrative retirement packages, all at stock holders' xpense. In addition to these offenses, he describes the tax evasion methods of those who simply defy the law and are emboldened by a beleaguered IRS that is too underfunded to serve as an effective deterrent to tax cheats. Johnston calls for a complete overhaul of the system. But because those who most benefit from these laws comprise the "donor class" that supports the government power structure, our prospects for reform remain very bleak. --<I>Silvana Tropea</I></span>

                    <span>The author is an investigative reporter who spent the last decade uncovering the tax scams of the super-rich. Both political parties (like a wrestling tag-team) alternate in taxing the many to benefit the super-rich. This recalls the aristocracy of the 18th century Europe who paid no taxes but received the benefits of government. Our tax system subsidizes the rich by taxing everyone else to pay for it (p.2)! Johnston claims that "apathy" causes people to be uninformed about public issues, or don't even vote. Actually the political propaganda in everyday life, like advertising, is designed to create this "apathy", or fear of questioning authority. The educational system also conditions people to "official history" and credulity.<P>Page 7 explains the "charitable trust" racket to money-launder assets like stock or buildings to get 96% of your money tax-free! "The U.S. tax code is the most political law in the world" said an expert. Taxation reflects policy; taxing the poor limits their ability to improve their life (p.10). Wage earners have a harsh set of rules unlike business owners. Tax policy since 1981 created the most highly concentrated wealth since 1929. The richest 1% are taxed more lightly than the middle class (p.11). Page 12 explains the "intellectual property" scam to lower taxes. Ever-tougher rules restrict union organizing. New rules allow trusts perpetual life and eliminate the estate tax. "Limited liability" corporations enabled corporate cheating since 1991 (p.13). These issues are under-reported because they're not 'fit to print'. Talk of the top 1% earning 21% of income but paying 37% of taxes is a created statistic like in advertising (p.15); the truth is on page 16. The 1997 reduced tax rate on long-term capital gains is a major tax break for the rich. Originally capital gains were taxed higher than wages on moral grounds (p.17).<P>The tax scams began in 1983 when Social Security taxes were raised, changing it from pay-as-you-go to create a trust fund to pay benefits over 30 years. But this money was used to pay for tax cuts for the super rich (p.18)! Whether Democrats or Republicans, the tax cuts for the super rich were financed by higher taxes for everyone else. This tax system is creating fewer stable jobs and lesser retirement incomes. Chapters 2 to 20 cover various related topics.<P>Chapter 21 explains the problem: the richest man in Congress is in charge of the IRS Oversight Subcommittee. He knows of no problems in tax cheating; 'hear no evil, see no evil, hold no hearings' (p.293). The IRS can't investigate rich tax cheats if there's no money in their budget for this! Or if they're forbidden to gather needed data (p.295). Business owners can legally report a lesser income (p.297). The "Contract With America" promised a fairer, simpler tax system, but resulted in 293 major changes (p.299). Johnston tells what is wrong with a national sales tax (p.300), and the "flat tax" (pp.300-309). Is reform possible with the current batch of crooked politicians? Not without an aroused voting populace. Johnston concludes that our tax system needs a complete overhaul (p.305). Taxes have been cut for the rich by raising them on the middle income (higher Social Security taxes than needed, and the alternative minimum tax). Congress needs to pass laws to report all income immediately and pay taxes on it. You can't believe the "courtesans of wealth" on broadcast media (p.306). Most Americans can't save because of their regressive taxes. A society top-heavy with wealth is an unstable society. Page 308 explains the tax burden. The cure is a simplified tax code (pp.312-316). Economic equality creates prosperity; poverty occurs when only the rich have money. What do you want?</span>

                    <span>Despite repeated statements to the contrary, THE AUTHOR, DAVID CAY JOHNSTON IS IN FACT A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN.<P>I don't know where people get the idea the author is a liberal. Maybe because his book criticizes George W.'s tax policies. They seem to overlook the fact that he just as often criticizes Bill Clinton's policies. He goes on to show that regardless of party affiliation, for several decades our elected officials in the whitehouse and congress have been continuosly and consistently shifting more and more of the cost of running this country from those who are most able to pay to those who are struggling to get by. <P>I'm about half way through the book, and I'm already thinking I need to buy a copy and give it to everyone I know. I think we should demand our senators and congress people all read this book and then tell us what they are going to do to guarantee the super rich take up their fair share of the tax burden and lighten it for those at the bottom. And if they don't enact it within a year, we'll vote them out office. And we won't accept a short term pacifier that will later transform into an even greater burden. We need a permanent solution.<P>This book explains in terms most people can understand the various ways in which our tax system cheats the average American. Even if the topic of taxes and finances typically makes your brain cloud over, you'll still be understand this book. The use of several examples to explain a given point help you grasp the concepts. I finally got impatient and jumped to the chapter whose title seemed to suggest might it contain the author's suggested solution "Is Reform Possible?". He points out problems with some recently suggested fixes, but doesn't suggest one himself. I think part of the problem is that while most people, after reading this book, will agree our current system is unfair, it's hard to agree on what a fair system would look like. <P>Every American citizen who pays taxes needs to read this book.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Johnston has written a very easy-to-understand and factual book that mainly documents specific historical events rather than many possible events. This slim book will probably confirm the reader's hunch that all is not well in terms of taxation in the United States. He gives examples of how the elite have managed to shift the load of paying for government onto an over-taxed middle class, and how the middle class shoots itself in the foot at election time by buying into slogans and wishful thinking. This book is not more than a good start for anyone wanting to get into the issues, and I therefore give it four stars; had the book been more extensive, it might deserve five stars, in my opinion.</span>

                    <span>Perfectly Legal is a superb analysis of our corrupt and unjust tax system, covering the myriad tax shelters and avoidance schemes available to only the super-wealthy, how corporations escape paying taxes and even use the tax system to make money, and how the IRS has seen its budget slashed and the subsequent rise of the tax-fraud culture and industry.<P>The effect of all this has been a great shift in the tax burden from the wealthy, who can most afford it, to the poor and middle-income families. Over the last 30 years the poorest 90% have seen stagnant wages, while the wealthiest 10% have seen exponential increases in income. Several reasons for this have been the numerous tax cuts over the last few decades, passed with the help of both Republicans and Democrats, which have overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and left the rest of us holding the bill.<P>Perfectly Legal shows how tax breaks for the wealthy - which hurt the economy and the majority of American families - have been sold to the American people. For example, both the Bush administration's push to repeal the Estate Tax (sold as the "Death Tax") and the push to end the "double-taxation" on dividends that almost exclusively benefit the wealthiest of Americans have been spun in a way that has garnered the support of the very people who will pay for them. The repeal of these taxes alone will cost the country billions in tax revenue, and will benefit people who are and will continue to be wealthy beyond most American's dreams.<P>The American people are being cheated out of their hard-earned dollars, and most are completely oblivious to this fact. With a state of never-ending war, ever-increasing military budgets, and cuts to social programs and education, the majority of Americans are being squeezed between shouldering the tax burden and struggling through stagnant wages, sky-rocketing medical, education and housing costs, and an insolvent Social Security system in an era of zero job security and no pensions. The result: a gaping divide between the wealthiest and the poorest Americans, CEO's that make 531 times as much as their lowest-paid workers, and record numbers of uninsured Americans and Americans living in poverty. Meanwhile, the wealthiest families and the corporations that generate money for them are becoming vastly wealthier.<P>I personally feel this burden - through my stagnant wage and skyrocketing insurance and property-tax costs - and am enraged by our tax system and the politicians and their influential donors who have created this great morass that, left unchanged, will most certainly bankrupt and impoverish the American people and our country. Change is possible, but only if Americans are informed. Perfectly Legal is an excellent book that I hope will help lead to this change.</span>

                    <span>Although this book has the ring of truth, I find it unsettling reading the misleading things he states about pensions, something I know alot about, and that makes me wonder about the rest of the book.<P>For example:<P>"The second and subtle, rule gives full credit to the inflation adjustments that over time boast the size of Social Security checks" Is false once you terminate the social security offset is frozen. <P>"But Congress listening to the political donor class, does not enforce the rules requiring that pension plans be run solely and exclusively to the benefit workers and retirees. Congress allowwed 60 percent of pension assets to be invested in stocks . . ., a risky strategy"<P>Assuming we are talking about defined benefit plans, since the government guarantees members benefits, the ones taking the risk is the plan sponsor, or if the sponsor goes bankrupt the government. The sponsor (employer) and the employee benefit gain if the long term cost is lower. With the stock market downturn (and just important the lowering of interest rates) there is alot of discussion about wether the accounting rules should change, and particularly if companies in distress should invest their pensions in bonds to protect both the government and stock holders.<P>Note after studebaker went broke the government required that pensions be funded and they insured them, this is to protect workers not the donor class and certainly not perfect it was an improvement over the time when benefits were not funded and those who quit early got nothing at all.<P>He mentions that pensions can consider social security benefits so that rich actually get a higher percentage of pay from the plan than others. While that is true, and one could argue for against this I suppose, he forgets to mention that the rich get no social security benefit for their pay over the wagebase (nor do they pay taxes on this). So the idea here is that if the employer is contributing 8% toward social security (upto the wagebase) they should be able to contribute 8% toward a pension above the wagebase so that together the employer is contributing 8% toward both the pension and social security. Recent changes resulting in the employer only being able to contribute 8% above the wagebase if they also contribution 4% below the wagebase - means that the rich still do not get the same percentage - the actual rules are more complicated.</span>
