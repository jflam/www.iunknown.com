                <span id="Label1">Setting up a Web site ranks among the most deceptively simple tasks in all of computerdom. At the end of the day, you just edit documents (and who hasn't done that before?). Even HTML, the underlying language of Web pages, is pretty easy to understand. But once the creation process gets underway, it becomes apparent that HTML coding is tedious, and that page designers often spend hours figuring out tiny layout details. Adobe GoLive CS is meant to ease and automate the process of creating and maintaining sites, and <I>Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a Book</I> should serve you well as a tutorial and guide during your first GoLive projects.<p>  Adobe chose a traditional style for this textbook, documenting the capabilities of GoLive one at a time with brief introductory paragraphs, stepped procedures, and screen shots that show the relevant pieces of the user interface. The illustrations effectively show processes--a series of three or more pictures might show how to select and modify an element, as well as the end result--but they and the steps usually manage to show only the standard way of doing something. There's less coverage of odd cases and obscure capabilities. Still, this book will get you off the ground and using Adobe GoLive effectively. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use Adobe GoLive CS to create and manage Web sites, assuming you've never done much work along those lines before. In addition to the essentials of text layout, hyperlinks, and tables, this book covers JavaScript for image rollover effects (and some others), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for consistent application of design rules, and the GoLive features related to ongoing site management.</span>

                    <span>I should've trusted other reviewers here and skip this book. What a waste of money and time.
<br />
<br />I am an hardware engineer and know HTML and have built basic websites using HTML coding, but would like to build websites that looks more slick. That's why I purchased Adobe CS ( for the photoshop and illustrator). since goLive is part of the suites I thought I'll learn goLive and redo some of my old sites.
<br />
<br />after going through all the chapters, you would only learn a couple of things about this software: where the buttons are, how to use the pick to make links, etc. 
<br />
<br />it does not explain to you how the software works -- which is what I'd be looking for when I learn a new software.
<br />
<br />bad book. worthless.</span>

                    <span>This is the worst kind of manual for anyone who is actually inerested in using the software.  Like all "tutorial" manuals, you can't get a simple answer to a simple question.  The only way to extract information from it is to follow each tredious episode to the end, and even then you will have only brushed across the highlights.  Why does Adobe persist in cranking out these useless manuals? I guess it is to force me to buy their tech support plan.  And where is a good after-market book on GoLive CS?  One which will actually allow me to get the info I need in a timely manner?</span>

                    <span>I read the reviews and then hoped for the best as I could not find another book which would help me learn this programme.  I use a MAC and I am reasonably computer savvy soI  hoped I would be able to find some work-arounds if needed.  All went well until Ch 8 when there were no scroll bars but by reducing the page size I could see what I needed.  Ch 9 was the worst.  To start with I had a copy of the finished file to pratice on.  By deleting bits then trying to replace them I managed to do some of it but there were other problems as well.  If I hadn't read the reviews I'd have given up at that point but fortunately the remaining chapters were almost trouble free. I have learnt a lot and I am confident I can create a simple web site using this programme.  My other criticism is that the book tells you what to do but seldom explains why so although I have finished it I feel I still have an awful lot to learn so I understand the programme </span>

                    <span>I have just worked through the whole book and have learnt a lot.  There are still a few errors.  Lesson 9 I was missing a ticker tape image and some people using Windows in lesson 13 have trouble with the "Black Bar" but using Icons instead of Icon frames solves this (View palette Display tab)(p481).  All in all a very good book and certainly much better than nothing.  Still after the huge outcry about the very flawed first edition it should have been perfect.  Also try Adobe GoLive CS: Tips and Tricks Adam Pratt, Lynn Grillo, together the two books are a good team. </span>

                    <span>I have never used the original version of this book/CD, but I purchased the Revised 
<br />Edition (printed in late August 2004) and everything has been perfectly clear so far.  It appears that many changes were made between printings, because the consistency between the book and the included CD has so far been faultless, typo-free, and error-free.  I'm through 5 of 13 lessons, and every step of every lesson so far has occurred exactly as indicated in the text, and all files on the CD have been found in exactly where the book says they should be.  Looks like Adobe read all of the bad press here and did something about it by giving us this revised edition in which all the errata seems to have been corrected (so far).
<br />
<br />I have prior experience with HTML design and with computer programming, but neither before in an Adobe environment.  I find the text to be VERY easy-to-follow, and I am impressed enough with how it has helped me that I have ordered Photoshop CS CIB and Illustrator CS CIB.  I'm no Go-Live whiz-kid yet, but the book has made me completely functional within just a couple of days.  I definitely recommend it.
<br />
<br />Beware if you buy this book- make CERTAIN that you buy/receive the "Revised Edition", or you may encounter the problems all these other reviewers have encountered.</span>
