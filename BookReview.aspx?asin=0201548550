                    <span>Coplien has won many consensus thanks to this book and his "Multi-paradigm design". You can easily verify it looking at the bibliography of EVERY book on C++ written after 1991: you'll certainly find "Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms". Many books have used it to expose tecniques. The best examples are both Meyers' "Effective" and "More effective" books. You can jump directly to the Recommended Readings sections to read the right acknowledgment to Coplien's book. You can then browse the items, and discover that some of them are revisitations and expansions of Coplien's ones). <p>Reading this book completely changed my view of C++, and, indeed, of any programming language. It traces a clear path that lead from a "normal" use of the language to a well-conscious use of each of his potentialities (those available in 1991, at least). Just look at the functors section to understand what a gem is this book, this is one of the most mind-expanding examples of the book. And if you did not understand what ADT are before, you'll gain a fine and solid account here. This just to quote a couple of examples.<p>Eleven years are a lot, and the language have undergone major expansions, especially since the ANSI draft on 1996-97. However, this doesn't take anything away from the value of the book, after all you can always learn namespaces from any other modern book. It's not a case that this is one of the most quoted books in the C++ literature.<p>Many have said it, and I can only confirm that this book should have a stable place on each C++ developer's bookshelf (together with Stroustrup, Meyers, Koeing, Allison and Murray).</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because it was in the "recommended reading" section of Scott Meyers's "More Effective C++" and his description of it intrigued me. I'm sad to say this is the first C++ book I've read that I felt was useless. I nearly gave up on it several times, but kept thinking there *had* to be something interesting hiding inside.<p>The first problem is that it is sorely out-of-date.  It was originally published in 1992 and update in 1994 -- still four years before standardization. A lot has happened to C++ since 1994. Understandably, the code examples don't reflect the current state of the language. What's worse is that many examples show poor programming styles and bad implementation details in the interest of "brevity," when more appropriate code wouldn't be much more verbose or difficult to write.<p>Hardly "advanced," the first half of the book covers basic and familiar language features. Though Mr. Coplien is no doubt and experienced object-oriented programmer, his discussions are too abstract and difficult to follow; most ideas could be more concisely stated in half as many words. The author strikes me as someone more comfortable with higher-level OOP languages like Smalltalk and Lisp, and has been forced to learn (against his will, it seems) how to shoehorn features of other languages into C++. In his defense, he does show appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of the different languages, and avoids outright C++ bashing.<p>This is a book manifestly void of any unifying vision. If there was any goal in mind, it appears to have been related to developing dynamic systems that support incremental program updates while executing, rather than anything specifically C++.<p>It wasn't all bad. His discussion on why procedural design still has a place in OOP near the end of the book was interesting. The high point for me was when he said, "If a process goes insane and needs to be killed..."</span>

                    <span>This book is quite old now, but the material covered in the book does not suffer from its age, because the book is not supposed to be a language reference.  <p> The book starts with some words of wisdom on the basics of the language, for example spending just long enough talking about inheritence and polymorphism to get to the heart of the issue. There are some of the simpler idioms introduced earlier in the book (virtual constructors, reference counts, handle-bodies) and then the book moves towards more advanced material, including multiple dispatch, and the best discussion of the prototype pattern ("exemplars") that I have seen in any book. <p> If you're looking for a way into "pattern oriented programming", and you found "Design Patterns" completely unreadable, this is a good book to get you started on some concrete examples. <p></span>

And Java is doing so great!<p>If you know C++ and  Java very well, you may reach the same conclusion.<p>This book is obsolete  in some perspectives, but it is a classic in C++.</span>
