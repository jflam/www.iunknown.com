                <span id="Label1">From the first Nepali author writing in English to be published in the West, Arresting God in Kathmandu brilliantly explores the nature of desire and spirituality in a changing society. With the assurance and unsentimental wisdom of a long-established writer, Upadhyay records the echoes of modernization throughout love and family. Here are husbands and wives bound together by arranged marriages but sometimes driven elsewhere by an intense desire for connection and transcendence. In a city where gods are omnipresent, where privacy is elusive and family defines identity, these men and women find themselves at the mercy of their desires but at the will of their society.  Psychologically rich and astonishingly acute, Arresting God in Kathmandu introduces a potent new voice in contemporary fiction.</span>

                    <span>Congratulations to Samrat Upadhyay for the excellent work. As a native of Nepal, I have no doubt that this book has successfully portrayed the simple-yet-intricate, spiritual-yet-material, rustic-yet-urban and naive-yet-sophisticated life in Nepal. While some of the stories have unexpected endings (like that in O Henry stories), most of them are designed to radiate subtle messages from the very beginning, which is really the evidence of writer's artistry and control over the plot. With his flawless English, the writer has proudly stood in line with other native writers of English.<P>The suppression of libido under the guise of morality and duty, the recklessness of Nepali youth under the seize of alcohol and the male chauvinism as the core of hindu culture, this book serves the kaleidoscopic purpose not only to view and judge the Nepali society, but also to understand and wonder the complexity of human mind and the conditioning of social surroundings. And in this regard, this book has a universal message and can appeal to all those who desire to understand other fellow beings.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Though this book exlpores the changing face of Nepal as other readers have suggested I thought most stories weren't especially real. The stories did not really sink in. In contrast I would definitely recommend his other book "The guru of love". The short stories chug along but in fits and starts and don't seem too close to home. It seemed as if the the subject of sexual attraction was not delved into correctly. The characters seem to have the sexual attraction all of a sudden rather than transitioning smoothly over time and over the course of the story itself.The author seems rushed to finish his story in some cases.</span>

                    <span>This collection of short stories explores the nature of desire and attraction in a changing society avoiding the excesses of many writers in this area. The stories are well-written and the characters are memorable. I look forward to reading his novel, and I highly recommend this collection.</span>

                    <span>really enjoyed this slim volume of short stories and can't wait to read his first novel. A gifted writer in the tradition of Rohinton Mistry and all the other wonderful and talented Indian writers --and now I have been somewhat exposed to Nepal's culture as well...I highly recommend this book</span>
