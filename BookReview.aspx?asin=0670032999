                <span id="Label1">While campaigning for president in 2000, George W. Bush downplayed his lack of foreign policy experience by emphasizing that he would surround himself with a highly talented and experienced group of political veterans. This core group, consisting of Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Armitage, and Condoleezza Rice, has a long history together dating back 30 years in some cases. Dubbing themselves the Vulcans, they have largely determined the direction and focus of the Bush presidency. In this remarkably researched and fascinating book, Mann traces their careers and the development of their ideas in order to understand how and why American foreign policy got to where it is today. <p>  As Mann makes clear, there has never been perfect agreement between all parties, (the relationship between the close duo of Powell and Armitage on one side and Rumsfeld on the other, for instance, has been frosty) but they do share basic values. Whether they came from the armed services, academia, or government bureaucracy, the Vulcans all viewed the Pentagon as the principal institution from which American power should emanate. Their developing philosophy was cemented after the attacks of September 11, 2001 and is best reflected in the decision to invade Iraq. They believe that a powerful military is essential to American interests; that America is ultimately a force for good despite any negative consequences that may arise from American aggression; they are eternally optimistic about American power and dismiss any arguments about over-extension of resources; and they are skeptical about the need to consult allies or form broad global coalitions before acting. <p>  <I>Rise of the Vulcans</I> succeeds on many levels. Mann presents broad themes such as the gradual transition from the Nixon and Kissinger philosophies to the doctrine espoused by Rumsfeld, Cheney, and the rest in clear and logical terms. He also offers minute details and anecdotes about each of the individuals, and the complex relationships between them, that reveal the true personalities behind the politicians. This is essential reading for those seeking to understand the past quarter century and what it means for America's future. --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>During the course of the George W. Bush Administration, it has become increasingly clear that the folks who run foreign policy do not reflect what most American think. As aurhor James Mann has brilliantly delineated his magisterial new book, "Rise of the Vulcans," American foreign policy is now in the hands of a small neoconservative clique who like to refer to themselves as "Vulcans." <P>Almost none of these neoconservatives served in the armed forces and most of them sought out deferments with the zeal of antiwar activists, with Vice President Richard Cheney getting five of them because, "I had other priorities." Yet neoconservative foreign policy is devoted to using military force, in practically every scenario. <P>These neoconservatives are war hawks who relish war even though they were draft dodgers themselves. For instance, before the '91 war with Iraq, then Defense Secretary Cheney and his chief aide Paul Wolfowitz immediately began devising their own war plan "without telling Powell or anyone else on the Joint Chiefs of Staff." <P>James Mann's book is quite comparable to David Halberstam's classic "Best and Brightest" about the Kennedy/Johnson foreign policy team. It is this writer's belief that future generations of scholars will point to Mann's book as being the definitive work about the forces at work in Bush Administration foreign policy.</span>

                    <span>The Vulcans is the name the 6 key figures of the Bush Administration foreign policy have chosen for themselves: an allusion to Vulcan, the crippled armaments maker of the Gods, who defended heaven.<P>This is a really excellent work of contemporary history. Journalism, I think someone said, is history's first pass. Well as a first pass, this book is meticulously researched and fairly argued. It is also very well written and tells a gripping story.<P>It makes the seemingly incomprehensible and incoherent aspects of the Bush foreign policy (at least to a European) entirely credible and logical. Nor is it unsympathetic to the shapers of that policy: Powell/Armitage at the State Department, Rumsfeld/ Wolfowitz at Defence, Rice and Cheney in the White House. It links their personal biographies and life experiences to the policy choices they have made: their desire to see America in the post Vietnam era strong and unencumbered again.<P>Armitage in particular comes across as quite a compelling guy. The dedicated Navy man and hard-living covert warrior from Vietnam, who dedicates his family life to adopting and helping Vietnamese refugees, his career is nearly destroyed by Ross Perot and Iran/Contra and he rises again through his friendship with Powell. A man who believes more than anything that America should not abandon its allies. <P>I haven't enjoyed a book about contemporary American policy as much since Fred Kaplan's The Wizards of Armageddon about Bernard Brodie, Albert Wohlstetter, Herman Kahn and the dawn of the atomic age.<P>Skip all the other political potboilers this season and spend the time with this book. The student of American politics, American history and the curious observer of American foreign policy will find much here to digest and ponder.<P>Whoever wins the presidency the future of American foreign policy will be shaped by these men (and 1 woman) and their actions and understanding how they got us to where we are will be vitally important.</span>

                    <span>This election year that's seen soullessly traitorous liberals degenerate into abominably more disparagingly insane, partisan venom segregatively against the president, it's comforting to have a tome produced by an author who neutrally doesn't take sides. Mann appreciably rejects vitriolic-motivated emotions for a sweeping, authoritatively cumulative approach at chronicling some of the Bush Admin.'s top policymakers, self-named after the Roman god of metalwork, proving even ex-LA Times correspondents are capable of fairness. To be sure, Mann's culpable of prejudices like opining Vietnam was a failure and taking the hardest stance in the Iraq war's aftermath, akin to squalid anti-war biases. Mann's aim is to scrutinize the six foreign policy advisers to inspect the influences their belief systems formed through experience have in shaping Bush's current policies. Thankfully, these six aren't suffering from liberals' "moral relativism", the notorious term that equivocally subordinates liberals to believe that hostile regimes will play fair, a side-effect from their refusal to judge anything.<P>While liberals are afflicted with an obsession of "balance of power"-cruelly unrighteous mentality whereby upright systems like America willfully overlook blatantly genocidal regimes like the former USSR and present-day Arab countries-these Vulcans nobly insist on intervention when a regime's oppressive, likely communistic and thus hostile. However, the contrast must be emphasized that before Democrat Jeane Kirkpatrick theorized in Commentary magazine's article that America employed double-standards for regimes that were pro-US versus communist ones, neoconservatives weren't keen on pushing democratic reforms on governments that were aiding America despite their personal abuses. The discomfort for neoconservatives was the Shah of Iran's pitiful example of democracy-instillation, as American influence unintentionally equaled Islamofascist revolution. Later on, America would successfully invert this slight apprehension to encourage democracy in the Philippines in a non-pestilent manner. There, the Reagan Admin. subtly pressured Marcos to resign to preempt a potentially genocidal coup by the bastard Communist movement arising out of the leftist gutter because it was gaining additionally antagonistic incitement under Marcos' dictatorship. <P>The Vulcans believe in one overriding philosophy dictating their policy: American military power is unmatchable and used to advocate defense of America's national interests and democracy. This philosophy's most visible materialization is Iraq today, where Bush's policies are implanting the foothold in democracy, modernity there (Bush's policies ARE progressively successful, fearmonger liberals!!!!). If the stereotypical anti-war/liberal crowd schemes to chide neoconservatives for the American buildup in unequaled military dominance, this book provides the refutation to their scapegoating. America's unreachable military might is solely an effect of other countries' post-Cold-War retrenchment in military budgets, as the Soviet threat disappeared, except America's leaders were savvy enough to foresee likely menaces emerging from areas beyond mere Soviet domination, such as the Middle East. Wolfowitz, particularly, was the author of a foreshadowing paper-Limited Contingency Study-that predicted precisely the shift of critical attention to the Middle East as the newly perilous zone where to expect invasion because of its vital oil supplies. While exorbitant-liberal felons like Teddy "Alcoholics Anonymous" Kennedy were misjudging to direct the suppositionally available funds from the reduced Soviet danger to unpromisingly sweeping, social-spending programs, Bush I's Admin.-Cheney, Wolfowitz, Powell-were maintaining that America required a steadfast level of military spending.<P>RotV is covertly useful in murderously derogating the iniquitous brand scheming liberals cast on Bush-that he's "unilateral". Mann orderly tabulates the times throughout the nineties where America was already qualifying itself to take more "unilateral", more independent, positions in the post-Cold-war world and thus solidification of lone superpower status under BILL CLINTON!!!! That's right, obstinately discriminatory liberals-CLINTON initiated American "unilateralism" by, while not declaring North Korea, Iraq and Iran as the proverbial "axis of evil", grouping those dictatorships as the "three thoughest challenges faced" in nuclear weaponry and missile containment. Mann recounts how CLINTON also "defied" UN "authority" by conducting the Kosovo intervention!!!! CLINTON was accused of "unilateralism" first, when he, judiciously, spurned signing a treaty banning land mines' use, opposed joining the UN-tyrannical, unauthorized "International Criminal Court" (ignobly relapsing by "signing" the treaty immediately before leaving office doesn't count; Clinton still fought sending the treaty to the Senate, and didn't recommend Bush's incoming Admin. to have it ratified), and prohibited submitting the Kyoto treaty to Congress. Also noteworthy is some policies shadily attributed to Bush-arming Taiwan and zero exclusive talks with North Korea before multilateral talks about its nukes program-that have been vilely misconstrued by liberals are actually updated extensions of Dole's platforms in his 1996 election bid.<P>Mann demonstrates how neoconservatism rose individually in the Democratic Party-callously sinking today's liberals' misconstructions that neoconservatism's a movement from the "radical right" of the Republicans. Many, once proud Democrats like Jeane Kirkpatrick, Henry Jackson and Hubert Humphrey were LOTS more regenerate than today's counterculture wackjobs infesting Democrats nowadays, like Dean, Kennedy, Kerry, Gore and Byrd. These Democrats of old were so regenerate they joined with Republicans in voting for measures that helped America, unlike the five extremists aforementioned, like opposition to the left-wing-errant détente which imposed a "balance of power" tolerance liberals are irredeemably preoccupied with for hostile regimes, as long as they didn't overtly hurt America.<P>The Vulcans'-especially Wolfowitz-neoconservatism embraced the breakthrough philosophy of Leo Strauss, who patronized denouncing liberalism's moral relativism, since that'd mislead into the gullible subterfuge of believing adverse regimes are equal with democracies-that'd in turn misdirect into getting duped by said regimes' clandestineness. Cheney's a prominent torchbearer for this mentality, while Mann offers that Rice is more of a "peacemaker" in the Admin., playing liaison between the hawks and more dovish-leaning members. Rumsfeld, curiously enough, was dovish during Vietnam, yet graduated into hawkish stands while administering Afghanistan and Iraq. Though conservative, Powell and Armitage may be segregated finely from hawks of the Admin.. The only ones with on-the-ground combat experience, they fishily espouse the most caution concerning committing Americans to war before a definitive plan, though firmly share the hawks' idealism of indomitable American power. As a bonus, Mann includes personal and professional photographs of the Vulcans from their early years onwards.</span>

                    <span>In this interesting book, we learn of the history of the most pivotal figures in the Bush foreign policy/national security team, namely Paul Wolfowitz, Colin Powell, Condeleeza Rice, Richard Armitage, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. We see that although of different backgrounds temperments and political/ideological views, all came together in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 to favor a strong preemptive approach to combating terrorism. Of these figures, only Wolfowitz can be considered a "neo-con". Cheney, a strong figure in the real politik approach of the first Bush administration and the earlier Ford administration is hardly a neo-con. Yet the administration is smeared as controlled by the dastardly neo-cons. The book moves in largely chronological order and traces the early life and careers of these pivotal figures and shows how they came to be where they are today. It presents a vivid and lively portrait of these larger than life figures. The story is presented without a pre-existing agenda. Jim Mann neither reveres nor disdains the Vulcans. He simply seeks to understand them. Therefore I recommend this book to everybody.</span>
