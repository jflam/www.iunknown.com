                <span id="Label1">Molds are everywhere:  we inhale their microscopic spores from birth to death.  But when an investigation in Ohio revealed that babies suffering from a serious lung illness had been exposed to a toxic black mold in their homes, millions of Americans became nervous about patches of mold in their own basements and bathrooms.  Before long, lawsuits were filed by the residents of mold-contaminated homes in every state.  By failing to address water damage, building contractors, plumbers, and insurance agents were held liable for exposing families to an unprecedented microbiological hazard.  The mold crisis soon developed into a fully-fledged media circus.  In Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores, Nicholas Money explores the science behind the headlines and courtroom dramas, and profiles the toxin-producing mold that is a common inhabitant of water-damaged buildings.  Nicholas Money tells the most important mycological story since potato blight, with his inimitable style of scientific clarity and dark humor.</span>

                    <span>If Douglas Adams (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) were reincarnated as a mycologist, he would have written this book. Dr. Money's liberal dose of irreverent humor makes his very detailed, erudite book on toxic mold easy and enjoyable to read.<P>In the preface, Dr. Money says, "Widespread fears about black-mold toxins are a product of the new millennium and deserve a critical, balanced, scientific inquirty. Though I cannot promise anything that boring, I do hope I can dispel some of the media myths about these microorganisms while identifying the real threat that can be posed by a few of these fungi." <P>Stachybotrys plays a key role in this book. In Chapter 5, Dr. Money discusses the 1993 outbreak of pulmonary hemmorraging (bleeding lungs) in poor children living in Cleveland. When Dr. Money began his book, he first thought that stachybotrys might be an innocent victim of media hype. However, he discovered that stachybotrys chrtarum can produce highly toxic spores. Along with the Cleveland outbreak, he discusses an outbreak of stachybotryotoxicosis in the Soviet Union in the 1940's, and illnesses linked to Stachybotrys among horticulture workers in Europe. Dr. Money also talks about the science used to evaluate the links between Stachybotrys and illnesses, and some of the political issues at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that caused the CDC to soft-pedal Stachybotrys.<P>This book has a thorough, although daunting, discussion of how allergic reactions are triggered in individuals. The body's allergic reaction is, as Dr. Money points out in Chapter 3 -- Carpet Monsters, an intricate mechanism. Until I read this book, I didn't realize that four types of cells primarily respond to allergens - dendritic cells, T lymphocytes (T cells). B lymphocytes (B cells) and mast cells. Dr. Money talks about each cell type's responses to allergens, and the creation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. <P>"Your Verdict, Please" (Chapter 6) is an overview of mold litigation. It has a very thorough discussion of what happened to Melinda Ballard's home, the resulting litigation, and a breakdown of what the jury awarded Ms. Ballard - and why. Dr. Money also discusses the reduction of the $32 million award to $4 million. This chapter also has a good discussion of how the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Daubert affected the Ballard case.<P>Dr. Money also discusses mycological warfare -- and he is not using the term as an analogy to what happens in a house with mold. He is discussing the development of mycotoxins as a weapon in armed conflicts.</span>

                    <span>Nicholas Money is an amazing writer who manages to entertain and instruct at all times. I found myself learning and laughing from cover to cover. "Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores" is a book for everyone. Not only does it provide a wonderful introduction to the study of fungi; it explores the way our lives and destinies are inextricably linked to those of the fungi. Homeowners, attorneys, and people in the insurance industry will find much to enjoy (and fear!) in this book, as will biology enthusiasts, naturalists, and readers of all persuasions.<P>As Money explores the "black molds" that have received so much attention in our news media, he also explores the cultural event surrounding their reception. The book is fascinating not only as a biological work, but also as a sociological study. Thorough research and diligent attention to detail provide Money with a unique, scientifically grounded perspective, and his quirky humor will have you laughing out-loud all the way through.<P>Importantly, Money does not provide any easy answers to the pressing questions raised by black molds. Instead, responsibly, he shows us what science knows and what it does not know, giving us a sound, factual basis for interpretation of the many wild claims we see in the media. The only negative factor involved with this book is the fact that readers everywhere have had to spend many hours (and dollars) cleaning their bathrooms like maniacs and replacing moldy shower curtains after reading it!</span>
