                    <span>I have purchased a number of film guides over the years and the Time Out Film Guide is probably the best one that I have run across. As another reviewer has pointed out, the subject index alone makes the Guide worthwhile. Looking for films about UFOs or films about eunuchs? Check the subject index!<P>In these days of digital cable, independent film channels, and the availability of less popular and foreign films for purchase over the internet,the Time Out Film Guide should prove to be a valuable tool. The Guide should satisfy those who like Hollywood blockbusters as well as those who enjoy "obscure, third-world flicks" (as another online reviewer of this book sneeringly refered to foreign films). A good film guide should review as many films as possible, both domestic and foreign, and direct you to other films that you might also enjoy. The reviews should both inform and, hopefully, entertain. The Time Out Film Guide fulfills these functions better than any other guide that I have encountered. Whether you like "East of Eden" or "East Palace, West Palace", "Gone with the Wind" or "Gonin", this is the one film guide to own.</span>

                    <span>I don't want to criticize Leonard Maltin, who's a bright guy with good taste by and large; but this is the film book to buy if you have to buy only one. The English critics for Time Out cover a huge range, including work that has barely made it out of the festival circuit but which richly repays attention--Hou Hsiao Hsien's films, for example, the new Korean cinema, American indies like "George Washington" and the lesser-known Iranian offerings. There were odd omissions in the ninth edition--lots of mediocre Disney, usually overpraised, and nothing at all from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli; Hollywood treasures like "The Good Fairy" left out; but that's to be expected in any reference book. And the comments are sometimes a bit boosterish and sometimes a little churlish, but generally they're on the money. Compulsively readable, and essential next to the DVD player or digital cable.</span>

                    <span>When it comes to film guides, Time Out can't be beat. It is by far the most comprehensive guide on the shelves and has been handsomely repackaged to include "cinefiles" on landmark movies down through the years. It covers not only anglo but many foreign language films as well. While other guides tend to focus on American, Canadian and British productions, Time Out will help you find a broad range of Russian, Indian, French, German, Italian, and Japanese films as well. You will even find such esoteric titles as Freedom (Laisve) by Sarunas Bartas. Imagine that! It breaks the films down in the appendices by categories, making it easier to track down movies whose titles have eluded you. In addition, it has extensive actors and directors indices to further narrow your search. It not only includes past Oscar winners, but those of the British Academy, Cannes, Berlin and Venice as well. The short reviews are well written with an extensive list of contributors. There is even a guide to help you build the ultimate DVD collection. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Great book, although not as complete as Leonard Maltin book. <BR>There's no rating/stars . . only capsule review which i think better then Maltin writing style. <BR>This book is the shiny version of Maltin's Guide (of course, you could see the price tag) <BR>A bit dissapointment for the Cover quality, the plastic layer is easily tear-off.</span>

                    <span>The 11th edition of the Time Out Film Guide (2003) is an excellent guide, offering the best capsule reviews of any of the film guides. However, it has been superceded by the 12th edition (2004), which is much improved. The items present in the 11th edition but missing in the 12th do not, in my opinion, offer sufficient reason for a separate purchase of the 11th edition, unless you simply must have every top-100 and top-10 film list ever printed. On the other hand, even if you already own the 11th edition, there is every reason to purchase the 12th edition. Besides being up-to-date it offers new and valuable features and a much spiffier presentation. Check out the reviews of the 12th edition to found out what these are.</span>
