                    <span>This book is very easy to read, very easy to understand, and very organized. 
<br />
<br />I recommend this book for beginners who want to learn about different types of filters and their basic application. Although Lee Frsot included sections where he talked about "creative application" of filters, there weren't enough to satisfy an intermediate photographer. 
<br />
<br />I am only giving this book 4 stars for the following reasons:
<br />1. There are similar contents on the web that are just as informative, for free. Check out www.tiffen.com or go to B&H's website and look for their free guide on filters. 
<br />2. The book lacked a section for reverse references. Meaning, the book is organized by filter type. "This filter is used for this situation for this effect." What I was hoping for was a filter guide organized by situations photographers face, as in "If you're taking pictures under this situation, you can use this filter to achieve this effect."
<br />
<br />Overall, this is a great, beautifully printed book. But it could have definitely been more. </span>

                    <span>This is probably the best book on filters ever written. Frost is clear and practical in his explanations and recommendations of brand and uses of the various types of filters. This book helped me decide on my brand of filters and their best uses.
<br />  
<br />I would recommend this book for anyone who has no clue which filter or brand to invest in. Even a pro would learn a thing or two in here. You would find great tips on how to make adjustments to filters, and their best uses. It's a great reference book for anyone.

                    <span>Good, consistent coverage of the subject. Well balanced, not too dry and technical, yet without sacrificing the value of the content. Clear examples, great writing style, richly illustrated. It would not take a lot of effort to learn new tricks and techniques from this book, and apply these to come up with great photos. Whether you shoot film or digital, filters DO make A LOT of difference, this book will teach you HOW! Suitable for all experience levels in photography. I bought it bundled with its duo,  The Complete Guide to Night and Low-Light Photography, another great title. Great value for money and a great investment (photography teaching workshops will charge you hundreds, even thousands of Dollars and they may not teach you quite as much as these two books can).</span>
