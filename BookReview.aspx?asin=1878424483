                <span id="Label1">In <I>The Four  Agreements</I>, Mexican shaman Miquel Ruiz built his teachings around four  agreements: be impeccable with your word; don't take anything personally; don't  make assumptions; always do your best. Now Ruiz offers readers a companion  guide, making practical mysticism out of the ancient Toltec tradition. On the  one hand this is an eloquent introduction to Toltec teachings, offering a  fascinating discussion of how one's life is a dream (and a dream that's often  dictated by others) and how "domestication" is the root of human suffering. On  the other hand don Miquel has also written a Toltec self-help book, offering  specific tools, exercises, and suggestions to help readers live their own  dreams, become more attentive, and make conscious agreements with themselves.  For readers who feel aligned with the Toltec tradition, this will certainly be a  powerful ally as they begin the dream of transformation. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>After reading The Four Agreements, I felt that it is great to learn the four agreements ¡V be impeccable with your word, don¡¦t take anything personally, don¡¦t make assumptions and always try your best.  However, that book did not have enough practical ideas or skills to guide me decode our old agreements/emotional garbage, how to be aware and how to transform.  This book has a practical guide to teach us how to live in the four agreements.  It teaches us how to become aware and how to transform.  
<br />
<br />1. Bring the Awareness to Surface so We Can Let Go of the Parasites, the Old Agreement, the Judge, the Victim, the fear
<br />
<br />2. How to transform by the second attention (become aware and not act on or judge too fast), action-reaction, attach-detach 
<br />
<br />Don Miguel Ruiz has a very playful style of writing when he was telling us the above skills.  I think in essence, the above  skills suggests us to slow down our thinking process to give us enough time to steer our feelings and actions to apply the  four agreements and to enjoy life intensely within the moment.  His dialogue about the four agreements and other people¡¦s stories about applying the four agreements give me hope that I can live my life with what he has suggested.  The dialogue helps us to decode certain emotional garbage and the dialogue helps me to break the old agreements.  It is definitely a must-read if you have read the four agreements.  Again, reading is not enough.  However, putting the new adopted philosophies into everyday¡¦s life is the way to turn the dream of hell to become the dream of heaven.

                    <span>What I most like about all of don Miguel's books is that they are written simply and from the heart. What I most like about this book is that it focuses the reader's attention on observing and releasing non-serving agreements. The techniques are clear, simple and dramatic. I use this book in classes that I teach on the Four Agreements and these tools are very powerful.<p>When we learn to love ourselves and live from our authentic selves, our actions toward others are naturally loving and respectful. This is because our authentic self is love. Don Miguel writes about releasing the illusions of non-serving beliefs which have nothing to do with the truth of who we are in this moment. This frees us up to enjoy our lives and offers great creative power. Give yourself the gift of this book and allow yourself to experience how great life can be.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for anyone. Don Miguel shares a heartfelt vision of very fundemental and useful truths in a very practical way that is easy to understand and follow. His work also goes beyond the new-age people, and far beyond the pop-psych books, because he is the real deal. His connection with the indigenous traditions of his people gives his expressions an uncommon sincerity and authenticity. I guarantee it will help you, should you allow it. ...</span>

                    <span>This book was suggested reading as if " THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view.</span>
