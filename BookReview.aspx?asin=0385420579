                    <span>If you're in a partnership, starting a business, or just looking for some inspiration to keep you focused on the direction you're going, then buy this book.<P>The illustrations and the background "thinking" that are added to the conversation truly give the reader a sense of understanding. <P>What I found to be the most interesting is how quickly the entire idea of TROT came together. Within a month of meeting, Mel and Bill had the ideas and the philosophy of TROT down. When it comes down to it, there was very little change from those initial conversations until the final product launched.</span>

                    <span>Mel & Patricia Zeigler are geniuses at creating raving fan businesses. They were the originators of the greatest store I've ever been in, Banana Republic. They sold it to the Gap and it is NOTHING like it's former self, which was reminescent of an Indiana Jones adventure complete with jungle headquarters and a jeep.<P>This book documents their next venture and details how they developed the business. It is like an adventure as you follow the letters to each other with new ideas.<P>If anything, I use this as a model for writing business plans. That's the biggest compliment I can give.</span>

                    <span>I have discovered Tea Mind! The tea is mine. It is now. It is hot. Oh evenness. Oh flow. Oh swallow of presence. I am a zentrepreneur!<P>I found a new appreciation for tea in fact before reading this book but now that I've read it I have further confirmed the splendor of this drink and I love coffee too! You have to read this book if you are curious about Tea Mind but you also have to read this book if you are passionate about ideas and need to bring these ideas into the execution stage. Also includes a real business plan - the one used to form 'The Republic;' a living example!<P>So much beyond the tea but the tea is enough! Check out their Web site and order their catalog then maybe order some tea and taste it to complete the tangibility of this company's birth.</span>

                    <span>My thanks to the authors for sharing- honestly, openly and truthfully- what it really takes in business to maximize objectives that include but go beyond the simple pursuit of profit. This is a must read for anyone who wants to launch or scale a socially responsible business venture.</span>

                    <span>This book has been an extremely usful resource to my company. Although my company also started small, Team 5 Technologies, it is now a large corperation. This book helped me understand more about giving the customer what they want, and putting myself in the customers shoes. After all, a company is only worth the value of it's products. With this is mind my good friends, read the book, Nick J. Frost - T5T</span>
