                    <span>I purchased this book because of the great reviews it received.  Wow, what a disappointment!  I agree that it is written well and easy to understand, but it is a far cry from learning EVERYTHING about Acrobat 5.0!  I am a beginning user so I did learn many things I did not know before, but it tires me when authors waste over 200 pages discussing past versions, especially when one of those is Acrobat READER (the free program).  "EVERYTHING" does not mean mentioning a feature or function of the subject program, then referring the reader to yet another book to find out HOW to use the feature.  Maybe using the 200 pages for this purpose would have been much better.</span>

                    <span>Finally a complete book on Acrobat.  Don't even waste your money on the Adobe Classroom book on Acrobat.  Really expensive and useless.  You won't have a clue of what Acrobat really is used for after looking through that.  This how to book is somple to read, written in an easy, engaging manner, and gets down to the facts quickly.  I woulld highly recommend this one.  Thanks to the author for FINALLY writing a comprehansive book on a subject that really needed one</span>

                    <span>Adobe's Acrobat program is one of the premier software solutions available today for creating and sharing PDF documents.  The PDF file format (Portable Document Format), is one of the more popular methods of sharing documents online. It offers special security features and maintains uniform viewing of files across platforms. Document page layouts, including fonts and formatting are retained.<p>How to Do Everything With Adobe Acrobat 5.0 by Doug Sahlin provides extensive documentation and instruction on the use of the latest edition of this leading program. Sahlin demonstrates through the use of screenshots and discussion how Acrobat can easily take captured data and documents, including Web pages, and create professional looking PDF documents for sharing with others.<p>     The book is thoughtfully divided into four sections - an introduction to Adobe Acrobat, creating PDF documents, editing PDF documents, and distributing PDF documents. Book content is extraordinarily well-structured, easy to read, and understandable. Readers may begin reading at the point they feel most comfortable with. Newbies to Acrobat are encouraged to start at the front. More advanced users may focus upon their specific areas of interest.<p>     Major strengths of the book include readability, attention to detail, and the comprehensive coverage of Acrobat features. Readers will learn nearly everything there is to know about Acrobat - gathering and capturing data from a variety of sources, integrating audio and video files to create multimedia presentations, editing and formatting content, adding digital signatures, using document security features, optimizing files, preparing files for use on the Internet, saving and viewing files, and much more. Readers will also learn how to integrate the use of other programs with Acrobat to create file content - including OmniPage Pro 11, PageMaker, and Publisher.<p>     Readers will gain a greater appreciation for Acrobat as a serious publishing tool. It provides smooth conversion of data and existing documents into a format accessible by millions of people around the world - business people, attorneys, engineers, researchers, educators, Web developers, writers, and hobbyists. This is must reading for anyone who wants to use Adobe Acrobat to its full potential as a powerful publishing tool!</span>

                    <span>I've read other of Doug Sahlin's books, and once again he has written a clear and very useful one! Acrobat is one of those topics that gets overlooked in the sea of books about popular topics such as MS Office. This book helped me get my files into Acrobat, understand how to copy protect them when necessary, create forms, how to best use the Acrobat reader, and how to edit and distribute our PDF files. Good, clear writing style. Recommended.</span>
