                    <span>Jeffrey Bilhuber's Design Basics is the greatest book on Interior Design that I have read to date, and I've read a lot. Jeffrey really does lay out the basics in an easy, comprehensible way. Although the homes pictured (which he designed)are more expensive, Bilhuber shares his tricks on how to make every space look fantastic, whether it is a one-bedroom apartment or a 14,000 square foot home. I am studying Interior Design right now, and I appreciate the ideas, aesthetic and attitude of Bilhuber. Bilhuber has a wonderful talent in mixing modern elements with the classic. From what I have read he is quite the history buff, and that is reflected through his design projects. He has a definite aesthetic as well, but he is able to show many styles for different types of people. He has designed purely modern spaces, a Morrocan-style home in Florida, and cottage-style homes on Nantucket. These are all very different styles. Chapter by chapter, Bilhuber gives many ideas on how to take these ideas and reinterpret them for any space. You have to read the text along with looking at the photos. There are hundreds of practical solutions written in the chapters of this book, like covering family room sofa cushions in leather for accidental spills. He actually has done that for a client with children. He is all about creating spaces that relect his client's personalities and needs. He has shown in this book that form and function can truly coexist. I recommend this book to anyone desiring a beautiful and practical home. Everyone can take ideas from this book. Bilhuber has shown through the beautiful photography and eloquent text that it can be easy to create the home of your dreams. I love this book!!!</span>

                    <span>I was surprised at the number of negative reviews this book got. Maybe because the book is so different than the majority of decorating books which are little more than collections of pretty rooms; they lack explanations of the underlying design concepts or discussions of problems and how to deal with them. This book gives you ideas and theories on dealing with low ceilings, awkward layouts, poor lighting, support columns and other real-life problems and explains why certain solutions work. (ie: doing x will add visual weight here and distract from the bad feature over there).<P>Yes, many of the rooms are sophisticated "adult" rooms. Many, but certainly not all, are in apartments (one of the appealing points for me, actually). He gives design principles (such as accentuating the positive and minimizing the negative) and shows real examples. Not everyone lives in the suburbs, buys furniture at Wallmart and wants their house to be a children's romper room. But even if you do, and you would never pick the same furnishings as Mr. Bilhuber, the principles can be applied to your own choices. Perhaps some people are put off because he does not give you pat decorating formulas (a la Martha Stewart's white plus one color always works well) but encourages you to look, think and consider...something a lot of people are not comfortable doing, I guess. <P>So far this book does a better job explaining the design concepts better than any others I have found. Even if you don't like the specific details in his rooms, his advice (decide how much and where you want to spend your money, start with things that you love, test colors in the actual room, at different times of day, think about what you want to use the room for and design it that way, etc) is sound and can be applied to your projects and your taste. I liked his explanations of what he was thinking, what principle he applied, and why an approach works, and what would or would not work in a space. However, if you are looking for a book that gives you rote formulas, this is not it.</span>

                    <span>For those of you seeking pretty pictures and how to copy the rooms, look in a different book or a magazine. The pictures are only incidental to the information inside. Instead, you will find out how this designer thinks so you can begin to see solutions and develop your own ideas. This is not a "step 1, step 2, etc." book, you will have to think and apply principles yourself.</span>

                    <span>It's amazing that Rizzoli did such a poor job on the production of this book. Some of the pages were out of sequence, others were missing, some of the printing was crooked, and most of the photographs were fuzzy. Bilhuber is not a good writer, but many of the writing problems could have been corrected with good editing.<P>The guidelines or suggestions offered were good, but a more detailed explanation with more examples would have been useful in many cases.<P>Even with these problems, the book would have been worthwhile if the pictures were clearer. Although he may not be a great writer, I think Jeffrey Bilhuber must be a wonderful decorator. He has a real talent for combining traditional and modern elements in an effortless way that makes them look wonderful together. He also shows us that common, inexpensive items, when combined correctly, can look elegant and luxurious. It's difficult to imagine children playing in his rooms, but we don't all have young children. His style is sophisticated and lush, and the rooms in this book draw the reader back repeatedly for another look.</span>

                    <span>There are so few design books that really deliver. As an interior designer I am skeptical of those books that come from the "designer of the month". Jeffrey Bilhuber is not only delightful to speak with - I was lucky enough to meet him - he really lays out his book with his own flair, design ideas and interior design credos (i.e. design basics). He presents the information in such a way, with humor, that makes it approachable but not "dumbed down" so anyone, whether formally schooled in design or not, can take something away and apply it if they choose. Many designers have tried this before and never come close. This is no easy feat, quite remarkable really! <BR>Deborah in Bethesda</span>
