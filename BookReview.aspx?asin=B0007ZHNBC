                    <span>  This lecture was a complete waste of money.  I fell for an obvious marketing hype with this one.  The production is abysmal, it is not even an hour long, and is nothing more than JZ Night and a microphone. 
<br />
<br />  This dreck is trippy hippy feel-good fluff.  Creating your day has been done for thousands of years, everytime you write out a things to do list. . . you've done it.  
<br />
<br />  We're all gods, so why indulge the imaginary friend called, " Ramtha? " Merely because it's extremely profitable. This farce rakes in tens of millions annually on the guarantee that most people searching for answers will try anything once.  </span>

                    <span>The "Create Your Day" DVD is in response to the overwhelming question of "How Do I Create MY Day?" 
<br />
<br />After seeing the great movie "What the Bleep" everyone is asking how Dr. Joe Dispenza goes about creating his day and asking "How Do I Create MY Day"? 
<br />
<br />The few negative reviews suggest to me some people are afraid to change, some people don't want to know they are in charge of their own life, some people want to continue to blame others for their circumstances. Let's hope you're not one of them. I used to be.
<br />
<br />This DVD will empower you to see you ARE in charge of your own life. I watch this DVD everyday to remind me that power is in ME. If you haven't seen the movie "What the Bleep" then buy it and watch it often. If you are bored or tired of your life these two DVDs will set you on a new path of discovery. Enjoy! (smile)

                    <span>This teaching from Ramtha is an invitation to begin to think differently about the world you live in and your role in it, beginning with a simple concept about creating your day. Sounds easy, and maybe even a little strange at first..but this is an opportunity to suspend your disbelief and just try it. Ramtha suggests we already create our day albeit in an unconscious fashion. That would certainly explain why so many of us have recurring themes and patterns in our lives that we have difficulty breaking free of or changing. How can a person effect real change if they are not even willing to try changing their mind for a few moments in the morning? 
<br />"Believe in yourself-do it every day-live it-to find out how it works" Simple advice from Ramtha. But how many of us really do this every day?
<br />The world is seemingly sometimes full of negativity and this site and some of it's reviews are no exception. Do you want to stay the same forever? Are you perfectly happy with yourself and your life? Why not take a chance and try something new? Then Judge For Yourself whether it is worthwhile or not. I am so glad I did. My life has changed dramatically for the better, and all it took was a willingness to take  a few moments in the morning in creating my day. </span>

                    <span>  Ramtha is a poor interpretation, and limited western spin on " RAMA " an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
<br />  The seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, Rama is said to have taken birth on earth to annihilate the evil forces of the age.
<br />He is widely believed to be an actual historical figure - a "tribal hero of ancient India" - whose exploits form the great Hindu epic of Ramayana or The Romance of Rama, written by the ancient Sanskrit poet Valmiki. Hindus believe that Rama lived in the Treta Yug. But according to historians, Rama was not particularly deified until the 11th century AD. Tulsidas' outstanding retelling of the Sanskrit epic into the vernaculars as the Ramcharitmanas, greatly enhanced the popularity of Rama as a Hindu god, and gave rise to various devotional groups. 
<br />
<br />  Ramtha is merely an annunaki playing a clever joke on the masses and laughing all the way to the bank.  This video doesn't even pretend to be more than an opportunistic tie in to capitalize on the success of WTBDWK. . .Avoid at all cost!</span>

                    <span>I was blown away by What The Bleep, and thus I bought this DVD.  I can't believe Mark Vicente put his name to it.  It is an appallingly low budget production, for an appallingly high price.  45 minutes of monologue, which could easily be digested via a $1.00 10 page pamphlet.  Do yourself a large favor.  Don't purchase this.  It is so obviously produced for a quick buck that I feel thoroughly ripped off, and unfortunately now will suspect everything Mark Vicente would put his name on.</span>
