                <span id="Label1">The Java Message Service (JMS) provides a way for the components of a  distributed application to talk asynchronously, or for welding together legacy  enterprise systems. Think of it as application-to-application e-mail. Unlike  COM, JMS uses one or more JMS servers to handle the messages on a  store-and-forward basis, so that the loss of one or more components doesn't  bring the whole distributed application to a halt.<p>  JMS consists of a set of messaging APIs that enable two types of messaging,  publish-and-subscribe (one-to-many) and point-to-point (one-to-one). The highly  lucid explanation of the ways in which these work makes the technical content a  lot more approachable. In practice, however, <I>Java Message Service</I> is  still a book for Java programmers who have some business programming experience.  You need the background.<p>  After a simple JMS demonstration in which you create a chat application using  both messaging types, the authors dissect JMS message structures, explore both  types in detail, and then move on to real-world considerations. These include  reliability, security, deployment, and a rundown of various JMS server  providers. The appendices list and describe the JMS API, and provide message  reference material.<p>  Considering the complexity and reach of the subject matter, <I>Java Message  Service</I> does a great job of covering both theory and practice in a  surprisingly efficient manner. It's easy to see why JMS has become so popular so  quickly. Recommended. <I>--Steve Patient, Amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>This book hits two flies in one smash: it gives a good background of messaging and JMS, and it is a good tutorial about the JMS API with lots of clear examples.<P>The first chapter gives a good and complete description of the messaging paradigm. Chapter 2-6 is the actual API tutorial. Chapter 2 gives you a simple and complete example of a chat application, chapter 3-6 explain all the aspects of the JMS API. The explanation is very clear and well structured with good feedback to previous explanations and messaging concepts, the reader never gets lost in the explanations and examples. And it is always clear for the reader why things have to be done a certain way. <P>Chapter 6 "Transacted Messages" also gives you a very short description of the JTA (supported by some JMS providers) API for two-phase commit transactions. Actually too short, I could not find a good tutorial in print elsewhere on this topic.<P>Chapter 7 "Deployment Considerations" is a very practical chapter for architects and deals with performance, scalability, reliabity, security, multicasting versus hub and spoke architecture. <P>Chapter 8 "J2EE, EJB, and JMS" describes the place of JMS in the J2EE platform and also describes new MessageDrivenBean type in the EJB2.0 spec. This integration between EJB and JMS has not been described yet in other books about EJB.<P>Chapter 9 describes the products of a couple of JMS providers. <P>This is a very even, complete and well written book. Contrary to what one reviewer suggests, this is not a book about SonicMQ.</span>

                    <span>Java Message Service (JMS) is relatively new and this is the first book out on the subject. Others are in the offing. This book will be of more interest to Java programmers unfamiliar with message-oriented middleware (MOM) than to more knowledgeable programmers.<P>The first chapter introduces MOM. There are two models that a JMS provider might implement -- point-to-point (or queue) and publish/subscribe messaging. The second chapter develops a simple pub/sub example, a chat room application. The third chapter discusses messages in some detail -- headers, types, and selectors. Selectors allow a receiver to be selective about which messages it's interested in receiving. Among other things, a selector can be used to match a reply to a request.<P>Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to pub/sub and point-to-point, respectively. For both, simple applications are developed for illustration. Chapter 6 discusses a variety of topics, for example, guaranteed messaging, that is, once-and-only-once delivery. Chapter 7 is devoted to deployment considerations, including performance and security. Chapter 7 discusses JMS in the context of J2EE and EJBs. Chapter 8 provides an overview of some JMS providers. One would do well to go to the Sun website instead, as it is more inclusive. There are appendices on the JMS API, message headers, and message properties.<P>There is the usual smattering of misprints. Then on page 112, there is a serious error. The authors say, "Unless you are doing a synchronous request-reply, you should avoid grouping a send followed by an asynchronous receive within a transaction." Even with request-reply, you don't want to group a send followed by a receive within a transaction. The reason is simple -- deadlock. The sending application sends a request and does a receive with wait for the reply. Within a transaction, the sent request is not committed until the reply is received and so, is not visible to any potential receiving application until then. Of course, a receiving application won't send a reply until it receives a request. The result is deadlock.</span>

                    <span>I needed to learn JMS for use on a project using WebSphere MQ and MQ Integrator (formerly MQSeries and MQSeries Integrator). This book did the job. The book provides multiple bug-free sample programs starting with a simple Chat and moving on to more involved B2B examples. The examples added complexity at a pace that was right for me. It provides discussions on the use of different programming patterns explaining not just how the Java classes work, but making recommendations on how best to use them.<P>The book sticks to platform independent JMS (as expected) showing SonicMQ screens occasionally. I used several IBM Redbooks and the MQ product manuals to get the platform specific parts configured.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I needed it for a project. If you need a consise and easy to read. It covers all you need to know to write your code this book is for you. There are other books with 600+ pages which cost more $$. It has links to JMS providers that you can use to run the sample code. The code is simple but to the point. I was able to compile the code without much changes. I would have give it 5 if it had one or two more chapters with more advanced samples.</span>
