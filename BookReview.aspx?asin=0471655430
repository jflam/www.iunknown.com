                    <span>John you sound like a nice guy, but...
<br />
<br />I rarely feel like I waste time, but this book is a large time waster. There is nothing about bull's eye anything. Simple information provided THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW!
<br />
<br />1. We are in a bull market. Wait for P/E's to come down like they always do and then buy.
<br />
<br />2. Value is good. He even goes back to the Warren Buffett war chest. Come on! Boy that drives me crazy.
<br />
<br />3. Hedge funds (million dollars to join) are good and you guys are going to be lazy, so find a good money manager, not a stupid lazy one who does not do one's home work. The due diligence for research is not on picking value companies in some bull's eye fashion, but for picking funds, mostly the hedge fund variety, which is what John does for a living. So if you do not like funds, do not have a million dollars burning a hole in your pocket, and want to control your own investments, this book gives you NOTHING.
<br />
<br />4. His chapter called Bull's Eye Investing is 7 pages long in a 400 page book. The chapter and book ends with this curious final statement(I am not joking). "Through my free weekly letter, I hope I can be a part of your "let's think about the future" for a long, long time. And I bet you we find the future far more fascinating and fun than we can even begin to imagine." Goodness what is this romper room madness in a book meant to pin point bear market strategy for non-professional investors?
<br />
<br />Another weak Value Investing book in boring, repetitive sheep's clothing.
<br />
<br />Again, sorry John.

                    <span>...a very good read for anyone interested in investing in securities, even if only so you understand what to expect from the market.
<br />
<br />However, the best book of the last 40 years...is not. I'm not sure which book would merit that designation, but, depending on what you're looking for, there are some contenders. At the top of the best books of the decade, that it is, even if only because it brings together a lot of information and, I think, the *right* information: don't get your hopes too high, how not to do it and then how to do it.
<br />
<br />If you're serious about going at it alone, your next best bet would probably be Morningstar's "Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing" and work your way from there, if you're still at it alone :). If not, Mauldin's book gives you enough pointers why and how to find some good value funds, based not on their relative, but decent absolute returns and stick with them.

                    <span>Jeremy Grantham of GMO oversaw $54 billion in his fund and decided in 1998-1999 too get out of stock portfolio.  Stocks for the long run had stopped looking attractive.  Grantham discovered 28 bubbles with 2 or more standard deviations from the mean in the last 130 years and noted that in every bubble the market returned to their mean of 14.6 Prices/Earning ratio for the market as a whole when the P/E was above 23.  
<br />
<br />John Mauldin believes the market will return to single digit P/E ratios.  Mauldin claims the market is 50 percent overvalued using four measurements based on dividend yield: first, the Tobin Q factor is the markets value of a firms assets divided by their replacement value is high by 31 percent; second, the price of stocks to their 10 year average of real earnings is too high by 31 percent; third, market capitalization (stock price x outstanding shares) compared to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is high by 45 percent; and fourth, the market P/E value of 26 is high from the 15 P/E median and Mauldin and Grantham concede too raising the median to 17.5 P/E factoring that investors are smarter and more liquid.   Mauldin concludes the market is overvalued at 50 percent and in recession, the DOW would correct to 6,000.  Why the correction?  The market loves comfort, stable growth, stable low inflation, and strong profit margins.   Biotech and technology receive no exception and as investors move from future value expectations to present value expectations and evaluate companies on value.  Some of the old companies will start to look good.
<br />
<br />The only force capable of breaking the business cycle is innovation.  Innovation charges growth and starts a bull trend.
<br />
<br />Operating earnings for 1988 through 2002 was 52 percent, so, in 1988, $100 would cost $152 in 2002, if earnings kept up with inflation and the growth of $23.75 (1988) would have moved to $36.10 in 2003.   15 years of earning grow was 56 percent or 3 percent a year and barely keeping up with inflation meaning 96 percent of the earnings growth was due to inflation and earnings were no where near inflation plus GDP.
<br />
<br />What is the 20-year horizon?  Mauldin observed that every period of 9.6 percent market returns started with low P/E ratios.  The P/E ratio amount strongly correlated with the trend in Market P/E ratio and none of the strong gains occurred without rising P/E ratios.  Looking at the market trend, half of the investors realized compound returns less than 4 percent and 10 percent generated gains more than 10 percent.  Subtracting inflation, taxes, and dividends the historical growth in earnings has been 2 percent.  Only new companies have been able to produce 3 percent.   Pensions need 7 percent in real growth.  Is it possible some pensions are 1/7 their value?  It is impossible to get a 9 percent growth assumption in a 5 percent bond market.  Companies often make a 70/30 balance of stock to bonds.  The cost for companies to drop their expected rate of return from 9.2 percent to 6.5 would be $30 billion according to CSFB assuming no recession that would correct the DOW to 6,000.  Corporations are in a bind and they have assumed the stock market would grow faster than it realistically could.  Pension fund replacement of 90 percent allows companies 30 years for the 10 percent in make extra payment; however, a replacement of greater than 10 percent may require the company to make extra payments within 3 to 5 years to bring the fund to 100 percent.  Only 4 firms a year grow at 50 percent for 10 years and 18 percent make 10% for 10 years.  The S&P earnings can't grow faster than the GDP.   The S&P changed it accounting report to core earnings.  The large infusion of capital into pensions will reduce reported earnings.  As earnings drop so will price.  Pensions are required to remain funded by law and as more retiree draw on the pension pressure will increase to replace the depleted funds.  If companies are assuming a stock growth of 9.6 percent then larger portions of their earnings will be required punching out the steam on their growth and market capitalization.  Companies can only hope that interest rates will remain low, the dollar will increase in strength, and taxation low.  The dollar devalues as debt increases, foreign countries like Japan and China buy U.S Treasuries to hold up the value of dollar to keep their exports strong, the dropping dollar makes America products cheap. In a recession bond yields increase, taxes increase, the dollar devalues, deflation increases buying power, and stock price drop.  </span>

                    <span>John Mauldin provides brilliant analyses of US and global economic dynamics to make a strong case for a flat to down market over the next ten years.  The book also includes an excellent tutorial on hedge funds.  If these subjects are your main interest, then the book a really worthwhile read (5 stars).
<br />
<br />However, while his writing is often masterful, the book fails to provide a workable investment strategy (which is sort of promised by the book's title).  His advice on how to find stock market winners is disappointing because it's wholly impractical for the average investor.  Essentially, his advice is to read everything there is to read about a company (SEC filings, reports, industry journals, creditable websites, etc.), go to trade shows, meet the company's management, meet the employees, etc..  He does allow for the fact that this process is somewhat arduous, so he advises working in groups to analyze a sufficient number of companies to find the winners.  This is just what a lot of professionals do in the investment industry... but these are full-time jobs!
<br />
<br />Overall: a great case for making hedge funds generally available to the public; a strong case for a flat to down market over the next decade or so; but, ultimately, doesn't deliver the golden arrow... so regrettably 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Mauldin's writing is clear and concise.  I have bought three copies of this book and given it to family members.  It's one of those a-ha! books on investing so the normal person who's just trying to invest their money wisely (and can't figure out why their investments never work out)! can find their way through the Impenetrable Forest of the Stock Market.  My father is a stockbroker, I grew up in a stockbroker's house, so shouldn't I know something about wise investing?  But remember the day when the rules all changed--and we found out the deck was pretty much stacked against the little guy and gal?  In this book, Mr. Mauldin gives some insightful knowlege--at least for me--about how to prune the deadwood and arm yourself with a weedwacker in the forest so that you can come out with a different attitude and better, new, more productive growth in your investment portfolio.</span>
