                    <span>This is one of my favorites from The Rich Dad Poor Dad series. Although I find Robert's work often too generalized, he puts some broad  based tactical information in this book. I've found with all of Kiyosaki's books and tapes you have to get repeated exposure to get everything out of them. If you've already been investing and/or building a business you may find this a bit too topical but I still found it useful.

                    <span>True to the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, this is another book you have to read if you want to become rich and to enjoy life.
<br />
<br />Yes money can't buy happiness but it can buy you the TIME you need to do the things you really want to do. In that sense time is truly worth more than gold.
<br />
<br />This is one of the books that will open up possibilities in your head, which is very important because if in you cannot imagine becoming a millionaire in the future then you will prove yourself right.
<br />
<br />I see a lot of people (some of them my friends) wasting their time on useless, directionless, completely wasteful activities and then they wonder why nothing is happening to them. My advice is to follow Rich Dad's Three Paths to great wealth.
<br />1.	Increase your business skills
<br />2.	Increase your money management skills
<br />3.	Increase your investment skills
<br />
<br />If the word investment or the other items above sounds technical and intimidating for you then this book is a big help because it is an easy and fun read.</span>

                    <span>This guy remember me that OLD true story Of a man who promised to make gold but nerver did, and others gave him tons of money, in the hope he was going to make gold FOR THEM, through some special talent, but acttualy it waS A TRAP TO STEAL OTHERS MONEY. That is a huge fraud.
<br />He shows no proof that he is as rich as he says and that he does all the transactions he claims in his book.
<br />
<br />As an Administration student i feel sick when i remember i gave this guy and his crowd my money by buing one of his books.</span>

                    <span>this book really marked a turning point. after reading it i started trading in options and investing in real estate. its has a lot of good advice, but like his other books has no real steps you can implement. for that you'll need to look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Kiyosaki is an excellent author.  For anyone in search of wealth, this is definitely the place to start.  The lessons found in the Rich Dad series are important concepts that anyone can learn from.  Apply these concepts to your own life and the possibilities are endless.  I also recommend Stop Working by Rohan Hall which guides one through building cash flow and becoming a "B" and an "I".  </span>
