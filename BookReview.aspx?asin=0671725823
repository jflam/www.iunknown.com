                    <span>This is definitely THE Jazz autobiography. Miles as controversial as ever. He just could have explained better why he left Jazz and started playing that weird fusion stuff... Mr. Troupe's wonderful ghostwriting job must be acknowledged.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First let me say that I have read this book three times from cover to cover and a fourth time essentially all the way through and I plan to read this book many more times. It is the best book I have ever read and my favorite of all time. This truly is a circumstance where you don't even have to be a fan of Miles Davis music to enjoy this book...though unless you listen to his music you wouldn't be compelled to read this book most likely. Miles is an incredibly interesting man and this book talks about the man with almost a gloss over of all his music. This book treats the specifics and detailed descriptions of his music as trivial lingerings because there are none. I believe the most in depth description of an album came for Sketches Of Spain and ironically this was an album that Miles did not care for in the least. I have read reviews that claim Miles does a lot of whining in these pages and I would personally not want to read that and if I read it in a review I would not buy the book...understanding that I want to assure you that there is absolutely no whining. Another thing I have read is people saying how terrible a person he was...well I have to say after the first time I read Miles' book I didn't think much of him either and I was quite dissapointed in him. But by the second or third time I read the book I really began to understand the man and why he was the way he was, and I think he's a beautiful person...quite troubled...but still beautiful..but you must read the book a few times to really understand him. And Miles would be the first one to admit he had demons but he did finally learn to defeat them. I love reading the parts about the death's of his Father, Mother, and Gil Evans...Why? While it is very sad you really see the man in these moments and you see that for all his rudeness and cold disrespect at times...there is a very caring and sensitive man inside. Plus I believe a lot of Miles' rudeness was justified because of the way people treated him and in the same situation most of us would be the same type person. This book is about the man and reading it is like having Miles there with you and he does speak about the music too but don't buy it for that, because it is minimal, buy it because you want to learn about the man. I love Miles. This book is a Masterpiece.   </span>

                    <span>To me, the best type of book is one where someone can tell it in their own words. This is what Miles Davis does to the T. There were times when I would be laughing nonstop because I could picture him saying these things right in front of me. He could cuss like none other, but it brought more authenticity to the work. He had a lot of respect for his peers, like Dizzy, Charlie Parker, and Coltrane to name a few. He had a DEEP respect for the history of jazz and wanted everyone to know that blacks deserve just due for really setting jazz music off. His knowledge of music, period, was unreal, especially now, because it seems that is what is LACKING BADLY with musicians of all genres today. He also speaks about other subjects, such as racism he encountered while in the business, his parents, siblings, and others. He also was his toughest critic, whether it came to his music, his dealings with women, other musicians, and drugs. All in all, Miles Davis was a dynamic, flawed, and an important figure in music history, and his story should be read by anyone who is a fan of music or who is a fan of a good story altogether.</span>

                    <span>As a Jazz lover, I can't help but consider this book a time machine into the past of jazz. I just finished reading it entirely for the second time (April & May of 2004). The first time I read it was 12 years ago (Spring of 1992). I have collected 3 Miles Davis box sets and a lot of his compact discs<br>in those 12 years, so reading the autogbiograpy this time around was much more like watching a movie.<br>       I, myself, have also become much more of a musician in the <br>past 12 years, so I found the book to be very didactic when Mile's shared his thoughts on musical subjects such as the Egyptian mode, the modal conceptualization of songs (all the songs on "Kind of Blue"), using the Fender Rhodes electric piano to cushion his sound, and more. <br>    For those who love John Coltrane, this book makes you feel even the slightest sense of knowing him a little; his extreme dedication to practicing and his repenting reassessment of his own life. Miles became good friends with Coltrane after he hired him into his band, yet they didn't spend much time together where <br>music was not concerned. Miles describes Trane's death as if it happened yesterday and it's extremely interesting to "hear" Miles <br>tell where Trane was musically right before he died in relation to the racial & social strife that the United States was experiencing in the 60's (this is even more poigniant when you have heard Trane's music from that period [read my review on "John Coltrane The Classic Quartet-The Complete Impulse Studio Recordings). I find it ironic that later in the book Miles mentions that he couldn't stand Trane's quartet at this period.<br>       This is another major exciting thing about the book; it gives insight on other music greats that Miles knew personally,<br>like Charlie Parker (especially), Gil Evans, drummer, Philly Joe Jones, Billie Holliday and many others. <br>   The part where Miles tells what he went through as a heroine<br>junkie is really heart-wrenching, and when he overcame that addiction, you really see and feel his cold-turkey withdrawl; he <br>overcame it out of self-determination.<p>       The last chapter of the book is a look into Miles' thoughts on life, women, racism, etc. He is quite the activist;<br>he never hated white people out of racism. He had an aversion to<br>white people because of all the racism that was enacted upon him. <p>     This book is musically and historically tremendous!!!</span>

                    <span>Not great literature, and not exceptionally insightful. Miles' public persona was a construct, affecting intentionally coarse language and simplistic, conflicting views. Lest you haven't gotten your share of that in the numerous interviews he gave, you can get your fill here. One might say that Miles in his own words is just being "direct"; one might also say that, in terms of this gutteriffic book versus the man's incredible music, his crudeness is hugely disappointing. The best things Miles ever said were thru his music. For measured commentary on his life and work, you'll have to turn elsewhere.<p>Speaking of which, the highly recommended Milestones by Jack Chambers, in its 1998 edition, detailed several passages of Miles autobio that were direct rips from Chambers' own texts. Anyone who thinks Miles' book is the bomb should at least glance at Chambers' recent forward to Milestones, which should raise an eyebrow or two. (Milestones itself is probably the best Miles bio available, in any case.) It's kind of fitting, though; Miles wasn't exactly a stranger to assigning his own name to someone else's music, so why would he be above plagiarizing words? Especially when there's a book advance already doled out and a deadline approaching?<p>I don't mean to demean the musician, though; Miles was obviously a giant and one of the most important visionaries of the 20th century. But again, it's the music itself that tells that particular story. What you get here, in Chambers' words, is "self-inflicted tabloid journalism." The sleazy parts are not worth detailing, and the questions regarding authorship and originality can be distracting to the discerning reader.</span>
