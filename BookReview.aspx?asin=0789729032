                    <span>I really don't have to get into detail. This is the book you want to have when you need something to go back on and read. This is the 1st book that helped me the most i only used 4 books but this one was the one that made me go back and read up again and me as a person that hates to read, I learn a ton of stuff from this very book. I'm telling you right now no one here can tell you all the details this one book has but if you pick it up and read it you will see for your self that this book is worth more then it cost. He even has a mixure of games inside the cd its crazy. This book chills in my back pack when i need some lingo codes and which im back in director for the 3d field im just useing it to bring back the old codes which this book holds. All i can tell you is that this is a great book for director and perhaps one of the best i have encounter you won't regrate it trust me on that. </span>

                    <span>This book states it's the only Director MX book you will ever need ... well, it's TRUE.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.  Director is a great tool.  Especially if you have a programming background, you will embrace the power of Lingo to create multimedia applications.  This book shows some of the best Lingo examples I have seen up to now in Director books.  It's good as a learning book and it's equally good as a reference book.</span>

                    <span>Working in a busy development studio, we've purchased all of Gary Rosenzweig's 'Special Edition, Using...' Director books over the last 4 years or so, and in this edition he's given the series a great overhaul.  <p>The book is not particularly aimed at a Director beginner (like most titles seem to be), although as a beginner this book will have you making your own multimedia very quickly.  It's more tailored towards intermediate (and even very experienced) developers who want to push their skills a little bit further - or simply want a reference book full of extremely useful, and practical solutions.  None of this 'Hello World' stuff in here,  all of the examples have clearly come from a mind who knows what is useful to us developers.  <p>The book differs quite a lot from the previous versions, in that there is much more content now on 3D, Flash integration and imaging Lingo.  The beginner chapters (focusing on the Director metaphor etc.) have been condensed (though they still cover all that's needed to know) to make way for the new content - also, 7 chapters focusing on specific product development (which were part of the old books) have been removed from the printed part of the book and added to the packed CDROM which accompanies the title.<p>I can't praise this book highly enough; if you're using Director MX at all, be it professionally or as a student, this book is an absolute must!</span>
