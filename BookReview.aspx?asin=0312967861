                    <span>The book I read is called I make my own rules.  It deals with a Man with a dream.  Not Martin Luther King but he had a dream to be the best M.C. around.  He wanted to have the best beats and rhymes made in history of rappers.  His name is LL Cool J also known as James. He grew up talking about his childhood life.  How he had bad and good times.  Mentioned how he met Run-DMC during his open mike night at the Apollo, and about his family and wife and his three kids. What I liked about the book is that it was base on Cool J and how he lived his life in the bad side of his town.  James Ruled his town like the number 1 bully he would always carry his switchblade with him if there would be any trouble with him or the friends he new.  He'll always be there to help them get out of trouble and try telling them to avoid getting thrown in the slammer.  Everyone in that lived around James's block would know what the deal is. The things I didn't like about the book is that is the sad moments.  True something might happen to someone but that always gets me.  Example of one Cool J had a dog. He would spend his time playing with it.  One day his dog got caught hanging from a hole in the backyard he said he tried to reach the basement but was to late.  That is the reason I don't do sad stories.</span>

                    <span>My wife borrowed this book and encouraged me to read it. I could not put it down. LL is very honest about his past vices. I recommend this book to anyone, especially young people.</span>

                    <span>James Todd Smith, AKA LL Cool J, lays bare his heart and soul in this engaging and candid autobiography.  He tells of his somewhat traumatic childhood that was filled with domestic violence, and the affect that it continues to have on his life.  He also gives a realistic, behind the scenes, view of the music industry-the sex, groupies, and drugs.  With emotion he tells of a time in his life that he was not proud of, a time when he was young, immature, and had plenty of money to throw around.  Smith uses his life to teach the lesson to youngsters that we all make mistakes and to view them as a learning experience.  The book also shares some of LL Cool J's opinions about the current state of rap, the murders of Biggie Smalls and Tupac, and other pertinent issues.<p>This book is exciting, inspiring, and heartfelt.  It tells a story of one man's obstacles and triumphs to go from a troubled boy to a multi-platinum-recording artist and actor.  Readers will walk away from this book with a true sense of both James Todd Smith and LL Cool J.  I highly recommend this work.<p>*Note this refers to the Parent Advisory Edition<p>Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers</span>

                    <span>I read this book and I found out that this sexy young man faced a lot of trials and tribulations to get to this point in his life.  He showed true courage as he realized that his life wasn't how it should be and rectified the situations.  I loved the honesty as well as the detailed time line and family portraits.  He is not just beautiful to look at he's "the completed package!"</span>

                    <span>LL Cool J.'s I make my own rules is a story about his life. James Todd Smith tells about how he is abused as a young child by his father. Later on in the auto biography, he starts to tell us about hpw he gets into the rap business. When he gets into the rap business, he shares with us some of the thigs that occuroff the stage, For example, in one chapter of the story, he says that he goes in the back to the bathroom and haves sex with this lady that he barely even knows in the bathroom sink. <br> LL Cool J. shares a lot of personal experiences that he has in  his life throughout this book. <br> I Make My Own Rules is a book strictly for those who love that sexy man with that big dimple on his left cheek (LL Coll J.)!</span>
