                    <span>Don was my coach for over a year so I had the first hand experience of his time-saving training strategies. Since starting<BR>to work with Don i was able to dramatically improve my fitness by training less than 8hrs/week while juggling 60hr work weeks and 3hr/day commute. I looked forward every month to the new workout schedules since all workouts were fun and challenging<P>I was very happy to see that Don put all of that energy and excitement of his personal coaching methods in this book. The programs and advice are invaluable for busy triathletes with family, work and other responsibilities. I am sure going to use this book for all my future training and races</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book on a Monday and finished on Tuesday. I could not put the book down. Very inspirational! I have read other triathlon books and have competed in several Ironman distance races, and this book explained things more clearly and in a way that jumped started my motivation to take my training to the next level. Other triathlon books are like college textbooks, this one was a great read and very inspirational, I have already recommended the book to my training parterners.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best book I have read regarding<BR>triathlon training. I am doing Lake Placid Ironman in less<BR>than 2 weeks, and I keep reading and re-reading<BR>this incredible book. Every time I read this<BR>book, I learn something new.<BR>Don has coached me, a mother of two young children and full-time co-owner of a business and has taken me from a non-swimmer<BR>to an Ironman. His time-saving ideas<BR>work and this book is a book I just can't put<BR>down. I couldn't name from favorite chapter:<BR>they are all excellent and cover virtually<BR>every aspect of triathlon.<BR>The layout of the book is user-friendly and <BR>interesting. I especially enjoyed reading<BR>the stories about "everyday" athletes. <BR>I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>After 13 yrs. racing triathlons I was very happy to see that I still had a lot to learn thanks to Don's book. It is a fun and informative read for sure.

                    <span>Get this book first, then read the others.<BR>I went to Don & Mel Fink's Triathlon 101 class and then bought the book. I read it on my next business trip and the lightbulb went on. This book distills the info from the bibles, websites, nutrition guidelines and articles down to what you really need to get serious and infuses it all with first-hand experience and common sense. The few tips that I first incorporated into my training have yielded noticeable results and gave me the confidence to set goals in line with my potential not the limitations of my schedule.</span>
