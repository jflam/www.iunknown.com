                    <span>This is probably my favorite book of all time. I love how convoluted the story is at the beginning, and how it all ties together in the end. This book really lets you step back and think about what is going on in the world and the meaning (or more like meaninglessness) of everything. Regardless, check this book out. It  is definitely better than Cat's Cradle and SlaughterhousE Five.</span>

                    <span>This is just another testimony much like all the rest regarding the effect reading The Sirens of Titan can have on a person.
<br />
<br />Ten years ago a friend lent me Galapagos.  I only remember something about dancing blue-footed boobies.  I liked it alright, but  I never got into Vonnegut, at least not until now.
<br />
<br />I am a fan of Thomas Pynchon, Tom Robbins, Haruki Murakami, Terence McKenna, Donald Antrim, Jim Dodge, and George Saunders.  And TSOT fits right in.  
<br />
<br />Written in an unassuming, slippery yet vivid manner, novelty builds as the pages fly by.  TSOT ends in a place so deeply affecting that it continues to roam around in my dreams, days after finishing it.  
<br />
<br />It is a completely satisfying read, lingering long after the last pages sadly and beautifully come to an end.  Which is the beginning in a way, and where our world is today:  sometime between World War II and the Third Great Depression--a time when people are only now beginning to discover portals to their souls--just in time to survive global extinction.  
<br />
<br />TSOT is a clever and ultimately hopeful arrangement of words and one of the few books I plan to revisit someday.
<br />But for now, my thoughts, day and night, are flooded with the aftermath of reading such a woderful  and moving book.</span>

                    <span>The Sirens of Titan, by Kurt Vonnegut (Slaughterhouse-Five, Breakfast of Champions), tells the story of how a lucky only son, Malachi Constant, gains extreme wealth, travels to Mars, Mercury, and Titan, loses his wealth, fulfills prophesy, continues his name, and, ultimately, is a victim of "somebody up there." 
<br />
<br />This is a difficult novel to summarize, as it is largely told in science-fiction form, involving interplanetary travel, robot aliens, and, of course, the chrono-synclastic infundibula. The protagonist is my Constant, whose name changes as his identity and role changes. Another key character is Winston Niles Rumfoord, the first man to fly into the chrono-synclastic infundibula between Mars and Earth. In the infundibula, Rumfoord is trapped in the light rays of the solar system and appears in various locations at regular intervals, as the rays come into contact. Hence, the novel has heavy sci-fi characteristics. 
<br />What sets this aside from much of the genre, though, is Vonnegut's focus on message through the medium of the protagonist, instead of through plot-heavy development. 
<br />
<br />The plot is loosely a parody/parallel to Old Testament characters involving Job, Jonah, and Noah. The book of Job rings the clearest of these. In fact, there are several rather blatant biblical motifs such as Rumfoord's revised edition of the Bible itself, with several passages quoted throughout the novel. 
<br />
<br />As the novel is following Constant's life, Rumfoord himself is heavily shaping the Earth's activities, as being in the infundibula not only gives him knowledge of foreign planets, but also of all solar system time. Thus, he slants in toward his own goals, including through the development of a new religion: The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent, featuring Malachi's catch phrase, "I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all." 
<br />
<br />Obviously, the theme has a lot to do with individuals' and societies' attempts to find reason in their worlds, cultures, and faiths. 
<br />
<br />Like other Vonnegut novels, the tone is relatively light and humorous, with a lot of ridiculous and strange occurrences. The language and sentences are structured simply and the book is a quick read. However, behind the simply structure and sci-fi settings, the characters and theme show far more than most books of similar "lightness." In all Vonnegut writing, wit and cynical, sarcastic elements create a strong social perspective that dominates over what, at first glance, appears to be light-hearted. Vonnegut also writes in a "clean," less assaulting style than younger writers whose styles rely on similar elements of wit and sarcasm. Read it! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Vonnegut, but very much on my mind since I purchased it off Amazon is "The Losers' Club" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.

                    <span>I had to read this book as a requirement for my AP English IV course. I must say that Vonnegut does an extremely good job of explaining the meaning of life using the most finite, human terms possible. A great read for anybody.</span>

                    <span>Up there with Cat's Cradle and Breakfast of Champions, and better than Slaughterhouse Five. This is my personal favorite. Excellent social commentary, intriguing plotline, very funny. Wouldn't suggest it as an introduction to Vonnegut, though it could be worse, for instance, Galapagos would turn lots of readers off (though it is an excellent book as well.), but once you've got a book or two of Vonnegut's under your belt (Cat's Cradle, Bluebeard, or Player Piano are pretty good to start off with) definitely read this.</span>
