                <span id="Label1">It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's <I>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</I>, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning <I>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</I>, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. <p>  Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment. (Ages 9 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>Very much recommend this one.  Book two continues the saga of Harry Potter and is as well done, if not better, than the first book in the series.  Actually, this is some of the best writing in this particular genre in quite a few years.  It goes quiet beyond juvinal fiction, although I suspect this series will turn out to be one of those that crosses age lines quite nicely.  Being as successful as they have been, they are quite open to cheap shot (goodness, there are a bunch of them here), but I would strongly suggest they be read before stones are cast.  Not only do we have a good story ling going here, stong character developement, but the author has also given us some very valuable lessions which are rather timeless.  Strongly recommend this one.  Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>The first half of the book, introducing us to the Dursleys and Hogwarts, was fairly entertaining (at least to someone like me who has never read a Harry Potter book before- though I have seen a couple of the movies).  The escalating perils in the second half of the book seemed pretty formulaic to me- Harry meets bug eyed monsters, Harry wins, Harry meets Voldemort, Harry wins.  This formula might be entertaining to most children, but I felt less engaged by the book in the last few chapters than I did earlier on.</span>

                    <span>This is the one of the worst of the books. It starts when Harry is living with his relatives who are so cruel to him it's unrealistic! Then some elf freak comes and tells Harry that he musn't go to Hogwarts, and this he refuses to do, giving him what he deserves; a barred window. Then the supreme geek known as Ron Weasly and his brothers rescue him, aware that they're doing it without permission. Then when they finally go to the Hogwarts Express the barrier to the platform is sealed (why for Ron, I have no idea), so they decide to let everyone see their magic car as they decide to fly there. Fortunately the car is wrecked.
<br />Then as Harry is at Hogwarts (after being yelled at by Snape) there are strange cases of petrification in the school by a monster (a HUGE offense for me, since it is revealed that it is a basiliisk, the so-called "King of Snakes"). Harry eventually finds a diary in an exotic bathroom, which somehow tells him that it was some spider (showing how stupid he is, since spiders can't petrify, and it's highly unlikely that a spider would kill someone). After finally convinced by the spider (whose name reminds me a lot of The Lord of the Rings, here),  Harry is still not convinced that Tom Riddle is the heir and that he framed Hagrid. HELLO! Hagrid seems really stupid-minded to actually kill someone!
<br />Then when they finally get into the so-called "Chamber of Secrets", Harry is finally aware of Tom Riddle being Voldemort, and in the end, Harry gleefully kills the poor snake (and I bet Harry's going to have a career of mercilessly killing snakes after he's graduated Hogwarts)!
<br />
<br />Dumbledore reminds me a lot of Gandalf. SOME ORIGINALITY!! Also, more evidence of snake prejudice is that Fawkes (a wretched phoenix of a DANGEROUS CHEMICAL REACTION) is referred to as "he" by the author, while Nagini (Voldemort's pet snake) is the only snake referred to as a gender, and she's referred this way by only Voldemort.
<br />
<br />Dragonrider, on the other hand, seems more interesting since it portrays reptiles as GOOD (for once)! So for those who like reptiles, do NOT read this series!</span>

                    <span>Imagine it's your second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and you and you are being united with all of your good friends from Gryffindor! But on the way there you miss your train and the only way for transportation is a flying magical car, but your luck runs out when you crash into a valuable Whomping Willow.	
<br />Well this is what happens to Harry Potter in his adventure to find the meaning of the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, in J.K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  
<br />	The story includes an abundant amount of nail biting events. For example, when a bunch of malevolent voices murmur from the walls of Hogwarts only to Harry, it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as more strange things begin to stirrup around Hogwarts. The words "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of heir beware," is written on the high walls of Hogwarts. "Well what does that mean" says Harry and his friends? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do whatever is possible even if it includes risking their lives, to solve this 50 year-old mystery.  
<br />	After the suspenseful events of the story Harry changes from a normal wizard at Hogwarts to this brave, courageous, and loving person by the end of the story. It is the actions and words of other characters that make him act this way. 
<br />	Bravery, courage, love and friendship are just a few of the outstanding traits that the main characters have, and they show these traits throughout the whole story. 
<br />There's always a lesson the author is trying to explain to the readers, and in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets clearly explains that bravery, courage, love for one another, depending on one another, and friendship are the main themes of the story. 
<br />If you enjoy a book with a dash of adventure; if you enjoy those nail biting events. Then you'll enjoy J.K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
