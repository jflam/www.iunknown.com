                    <span>This book helps you understand how databases works. The second half of the book explains how data is stored (100 pages), how indexes are built (100 pages), query processing (150 pages), transaction management (100 pages), and durability and recovery (50 pages). This is one of the best book, if not the best, on database implementation.
<br />
<br />The first half of the book is about databases from the user's perspective (e.g. SQLs). Although I was mainly interested in the second half, I found the first half to be an excellent reference on SQL.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the worst books ever written about database systems.  The writing is unclear and poorly written.  Examples are presented too complex for readers to clearly understand what is going on.  It even refers to examples many pages back where you have to flip back and forth and gets repetitive.  There is also no clear drawings or diagrams that help the reader understand what the author is trying to point out.  Overall a very poor book and not worth the time spent in reading and figuring out what is going on.</span>

                    <span>Very nice writen for new learners while covers enough aspects to step further.  Long because it is from the merging of another 2 books.  Recommended as a handbook for new commers to database area.</span>

                    <span>I was extremely disappointed by this book (I borrowed it, thank God). It is sparse on several subjects, exercises lacks answers and the book is in general poorly written. Besides that, the book is a merge of two books and the integration of these books should never have been attempted.<p>You may go to the book's home page and download a couple of chapters for free and decide for yourself.<p>Sorry, I cannot possibly recommend this book.</span>
