                    <span>Peter Singer's "Marx: A Very Short Introduction" is a superbly lucid and concise introduction to the subject of Marx and Marxism. Assuming the reader has no background in Marx's thought, Singer covers most of the important issues of Marxism and then assesses Marx's achievements and shortcomings in a refreshingly balanced manner. <P>What makes this book such a valuable introduction is Singer's clear understanding of what lies at the heart of Marxism: the issue of human freedom. Too many works on Marxism reduce it to a merely economic philosophy, which has the destruction of capitalism (and subsequent liberation of the world's workers) as its end. This is a gross misrepresentation of Marx's thought. Marx saw the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a classless society as means toward the true end which he sought: the liberation of humanity from oppression and exploitation and a return to our true nature as creative, self-actualizing beings rather than mere laboring appendages to an economic machine. Marx envisioned a world in which humanity toiled with its individual and universal fulfillment as the goal, rather than a world in which a few grow rich while the many dig ditches or work in Asian sweatshops for Nike. Freedom, true freedom, was the purpose behind Marx's work and also his life.<P>I highly recommend this book as a serious, thorough, and fair introduction to this complex subject. Apart from Terry Eagleton's "Marx," there is no better guide than this.</span>

                    <span>The "Very Short Introductions" series is great for us busy-bees on the go. It fits neatly in the pocket or purse for waiting rooms, staff meetings, etc. It has been said that Marx is the most influential philosopher in modern times. I feel this argument has merit. Moreover, Peter Singer does an excellent job providing a quick insight into Marx's life and work. From Marx's illegitimate son to a great summery of 'Dialectical Materialism', this introduction leaves you wanting to learn more about this man and his thoughts that have affected so many of us.<BR>The working man's philosopher of choice, Marx is an important man to understand if one is going to attempt a viable understanding of the philosophical basis of modern day socio-political struggles. In light of almost constant inundation of 'the market rules all' rhetoric, the idea that there might be another way of living more conducive to common man AND nature is attractive and refreshing. However, Singer does not take every word of Marx as gospel. He neatly squeezes in good critical analysis that inspires the reader to think and to question. I highly recommend this very short book.</span>

                    <span>This is indeed a very short introduction to Marx's life and work. You'd think that it would perforce be perfunctory, but Peter Singer, author of _Animal Liberation_ and various controversial books on ethics, delivers an essay that is a model of clarity and exposition. One caveat: he delivered it in 1980; this snazzy-looking paperback is just an overpriced new printing (with the addition of the afore-alluded-to subtitle) of a book that I've often seen in used bookstores for about two bucks.</span>

                    <span>Marx is a highly complex character, whether studied historically, politically, sociologically or (as I had to) all at once. This brief but concise guide to the life and works of Marx is one I have found frankly indispensable. Working chronologically through his life, listing events and ideas, it both explains difficult concepts with clarity and provides context, which makes some of Marx's abstract works spring to life. Singer is almost totally non-judgmental about Marx and his ideas and this adds to the crucial nature this book holds amongst my key reference works.</span>
