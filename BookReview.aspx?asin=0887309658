                <span id="Label1">Apple Computer was once a shining example of the American success story. Having launched the personal computer revolution in 1977 with the first all-purpose desktop PC, Apple became the darling of the national business press and Wall Street. Yet by 1995, the company&#39;s change-the-world idealism had all but disappeared in a bitter internal struggle between warring camps. Raging internal mistakes, petty infighting, and gross mismanagement became Apple&#39;s hallmark, and today the company clings to a mere 3.7 percent share of the market it helped to create. <I>Apple</I> is the spellbinding account of what really went on behind closed doors, revealing the forces that dismantled this once great icon of American business.</span>

                    <span>While others have noted the writing style (tolerable - I've seen far worse), the book as a whole is rather thorough and interesting.  Granted, it was published before Apple's comeback, so there is (perhaps) too much emphasis upon the failures.  However, the accumulated "could have" stories are interesting fare, things that may have been overlooked in the tale of a successful company's history.  Here we see the flirtations with Sun, with Apollo, the AIM alliance and PowerPC, porting to x86 hardware, the Newton, and the spin-offs: webTV, Be, etc.  Using hindsight 20/20, it seems that Jobs is under-represented.  Yet, at the time of publication, I think that this book provided an accurate picture of how things seemed to line up.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book, particularly to Apple fans and those interested in the history of computing.  Additionally, this book is prime material for those interested in business blunders, particularly related to technology.  For the latter group, this book makes a fine companion to the history of Xerox PARC, Dealers of Lightning.  The works together provide a chilling view of how tecnhological innovation is often antithetical to business interests.  I think that Carlton's work alone can make one consider the fate of technology in the hands of "big business".</span>

                    <span>Useful history and inside looks, but reading his 1998 back-of-the-hand dismissal of Apple's chances of survival is pretty humorous nowadays. His opinion that Apple should have licensed earlier is similarly wrong-headed and lacking in any technical appreciation of the downsides of licensing (dilution of brand,difficult QA processes, cherry-picking,  loss of platform homogenieity ).<p>He similarly doesn't understand the silliness of Apple developing an x86 MacOS in the early 90's, and again reveals his technical ineptitude by failing to pursue the ramifications of an Apple-brand x86 offering (ie a Mac with an x86 CPU) vs a software-only offering like Windows or NeXT's Yellow Box.<p>He also repeatedly blows the 5300 battery issue out of proportion.<p>But I think the weakest theme in the book is that an alternative platform with less than 10% "marketshare" is automatically doomed to failure. While there is a strong positive network effect for the 'standard' and a negative effect for the alternatives, in his near-hagiography of Gates & Co he simply missed the bigger picture that the lamosity of the Wintel platform's inherent legacy issues is and was a countervening force.<p>5-10% of the total market is sufficiently large for Apple, given a) it's the top 5-10% and b) Micros~1 continues to [stink] as it always has.</span>

                    <span>Jim Carlton's "Apple" is a fascinating account about the growth, the fall, the rebirth, and the slow decline of one of Silicon Valley's original PC pioneer.  It provides an exhaustive account of the egos and problems within the top ranks that prevented Apple from being a great company.  Again and again, Carlton shows how Apple blew opportunities to become a "standard" in the PC industry if it had licensed its technology, merged with a partner like IBM or Sun, or just had the competence to execute effectively and efficiently.<p>For the most part, I do agree with Carlton's account.  However, one cannot help but feel after reading numerous accounts of Apple's "failures" or "lost opportunities" if Carlton is making too much out of Apple's strategy.  Carlton also implicitly believes that becoming "the standard" could have been and should have been Apple's only goal.  Naturally, like another reviewer, I got tired of reading Carlton's 20/20 hindsight version of history that harps on every failure as somehow contributing to the company's decline.<p>The book was also published around 1999, so while it does include a section on Job's return and Apple's introduction of the iMac, it naturally missed out on some of Apple's more recent accomplishments: the new TiBook, the iBook, OS X, the "digital hub" strategy, and the fact that Apple is sitting pretty these days as other Wintel box makers are seeing their companies disintegrate under brutal price wars and commoditization.  Overall, Carlton's book provides a good history of the company, but its propensity to apply a 20/20 hindsight type of history that harps on every mistake the company made gets annoying after awhile.</span>

                    <span>Carlton relates time after time after time (after time) how Apple rose to great heights of genius and creativity, and then threw opportunity away with both hands and ran the other direction. The title is descriptive of the downs (but the book also covers the ups) of this amazing company. One of the few critical and unbiased (mostly) looks at Apple. All Macintosh fans and Steve Jobsians should read this book to get the other side. I was actually going to interview with Apple until I read this story.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on.   Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway.</span>
