                    <span>Suscribers to the AWAD mailing lists should be more than familiar with the entertaining and refreshing style of Anu. I have combed through this entire book and I have personally found it entertaining and useful. Some of the words are those we may use in our everyday lives, but the author also included lots of rare and exotic words. I don't believe that the purpose of this book be test preparation, but if you're the type who just enjoys exploring the wonderful world of words or adding to your vocabulary, this is the book to get. If you;re a word buff (like me), then don't miss this. Overall a great book!</span>

                    <span>This book is a compilation put out by Mr. Anu Garg.  If you are not familiar with Mr. Garg, he keeps the "Word a Day" email list.  Mr. Garg's love of words shows through his "Word a Day" list and now, this book as well.  A great gift for any linguaphiles on your list.</span>

                    <span>I strongly recommend against buying this book. As someone who can pretty much ace an SAT or any vocabulary test, I can tell you that basically no matter who you are, you will find this book usless and boring. Unless you have a better vocabulary than 99.9% of people (I do), you will not know or ever see the majority of these words (I haven't). There are some good ones - less than 10% of them - but if you want to improve your vocaulary, try something else. If you like words that are not even in the dictionary (except maybe Oxford Unabridged), words that never have and never will be used, or words that make you sound so smart that even the smartest 1% of the population won't know what you're saying, you might actually enjoy this book. However, if you don't fit into one of the above catergories: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Try Word Power or Word Smart I & II if you would like to acquire a good vocabulary or sound educated.</span>

                    <span>I will keep it brief because the title of this book explains its subject matter well.  This is a well-written, intriguing little book that begs to be pored over at one's leisure.  It is a pleasure to read about obscure words and their origins.</span>

                    <span>The reviewers I read echo my thoughts about this book -- I liked it a lot -- but they fail to warn how short it really is.  There are 55 chapters, but most are 3 pages long, generously spaced, and the third page often has half or more of it as trailing blank space so the next chapter can start a new page. You can read it cover to cover in one sitting, so it's not much bang for the buck.<p>Buy the book, though.  The quotations alone are worth the price, and Anu deserves some return for the AWAD website that he has provided free of charge for nearly 10 years. But the book would have been a much better value if it had been twice the length, which it could easily have been, given Anu's virtuosity.</span>
