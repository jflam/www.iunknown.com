                    <span>I've practiced a lot of sports since I was very young but I've never tried to 'tri'. I thought I knew a lot about endurance training but I was wrong. Friel's training book has been very useful and covered almost everything: training basic principles, periodization, skill assessment, nutrition ...
<br />Most of all, Friel's book gave me the 'ability' to prepare my own training annual plan and to schedule my workouts (with correct volume & intensity levels according to periodization) on a weekly basis. Definitely a "must have" for beginners and intermediate triathletes.</span>

                    <span>Training bible?  Maybe for the top 5% of triathletes worldwide.  But seriously though, I enjoyed reading the historical references and the way the author used evidence based data to solidify his arguments.  However, at many points in the book, I found the authors writing style kind of dry and uninteresting.  The section on periodization nearly put me to sleep (and I'm usually into that stuff).  I didn't like the chapter where he used peoples personal training stories and regimens, I couldn't relate to that schedule.  If you are like most recreational triathletes and don't have forever and a day to train, this may not be the first book to consider.  </span>

                    <span>I love the way this book is set up. It's not the kind of book you sit down and read from cover to cover. Rather, it's a reference book, a useful tool. I am 25 and new to the sport. This book enabled me to learn the basics and some day I'll use the technical information. It's helpful for any age and any level. A must buy! </span>

                    <span>I bought this book because it was highly rated and expected it to be a "bible" of triathlon. Instead it mainly focuses on how to cycle your training years and how to manage your time according to your goals. The chapter on technique and equipment is only very brief and superficial, Friel merely points out that you should get some swimming lessons to learn to swim faster, and maybe buy fancier equipment to cycle faster. The psychological side is also quite thin, and there just isn`t anykind of personal touch in the book. I really don`t feel like opening it again. In endurance sports you must have that "inner-burning" to keep you going, and quite frankly, Friel gives the feeling of an arm-chair theoretician of himself in this book.</span>

                    <span>I have been doing triathlons for three years and I feel this book is not for the Beginner Triathlete. This book reads like a College Text Book and is appropriate for the seasoned triathlete as it has invaluable technical data. I do not recommend this book for the beginner triathlete because I feel that it does Not address the mental and psychological aspects of doing a triathlon. Both of which I feel are extremely important hurdles for people to overcome when entering mutisports races. I recommend "Triathlon 101" by John Mora for beginning triathletes.</span>
