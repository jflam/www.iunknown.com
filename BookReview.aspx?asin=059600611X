                <span id="Label1">There are hundreds--if not thousands--of techniques used to compromise both Windows and Unix-based systems. Malicious code and new exploit scripts are released on a daily basis, and each evolution becomes more and more sophisticated. Keeping up with the myriad of systems used by hackers in the wild is a formidable task, and scrambling to patch each potential vulnerability or address each new attack one-by-one is a bit like emptying the Atlantic with paper cup.   If you're a network administrator, the pressure is on you to defend your systems from attack. But short of devoting your life to becoming a security expert, what can you do to ensure the safety of your mission critical systems?  Where do you start?   Using the steps laid out by professional security analysts and consultants to identify and assess risks, <i>Network Security Assessment</i> offers an efficient testing model that an administrator can adopt, refine, and reuse to create proactive defensive strategies to protect their systems from the threats that are out there, as well as those still being developed.   This thorough and insightful guide covers offensive technologies by grouping and analyzing them at a higher level--from both an offensive and defensive standpoint--helping administrators design and deploy networks that are immune to offensive exploits, tools, and scripts. Network administrators who need to develop and implement a security assessment program will find everything they're looking for--a proven, expert-tested methodology on which to base their own comprehensive program--in this time-saving new book.</span>

                    <span>Hello,<P>I've bought a lot of network security books, as keeping up to date is important in my industry (security analyst). My bookshelf is literally filled with books on this topic which I use both as reference material and/or as a total read from start to finish.<P>When I saw Network Security Assessment on Amazon, I was immediately attracted to the title, but felt it might be just another unwieldy book with a lot of techniques but little explanation. But I bought it anyway, and since it arrived before Security Warrior did, I started to read it first.<P>It just goes to show that even when you think you know alot, there's someone out there that has some worthy experience to share. This book shares a wealth of tools, and supplements it with not only examples of how to use those tools, but surrounds the whole use of those tools with a methodology without directly ramming a methodology down your throat.<P>From the introduction of what tools are required, through to network enumeration, scanning, remote information services (dns, ldap), and right through to specifics of assessing ftp, email, vpn and others...I felt this book was a worthy addition to anyones network security library. It even makes multiple references to materials outside the scope of this book, so if you want to read up more on something else - you've got a great start.<P>I like books to be simple in their approach, because as we all know network security can be very complex. I think this book achieves this goal, and I recommend it to beginners, intermediates and even some experts who are open to refreshers.</span>

                    <span>"Network Security Assessment" (NSA) is the latest in a long line of vulnerability assessment / penetration testing books, stretching back to "Maximum Security" in 1997 and "Hacking Exposed" shortly thereafter. NSA is also the second major security title from O'Reilly this year, soon to be followed by "Network Security Hacks." NSA is a good book with some new material to offer, but don't expect to find deep security insight in this or similar assessment books. <P>NSA begins with the almost obligatory reference to the king of assessment books, "Hacking Exposed" (HE), saying "I leave listings of obscure techniques to behemoth 800-page 'hacking' books." I don't think some of the techniques covered in HE but not NSA are "obscure." Noticably lacking in NSA is coverage of dial-up techniques, wireless insecurities, Novell vulnerabilities, and attacking clients rather than servers. Should NSA receive a second edition, I expect to see the book expand closer to the "behemoth" it seems to deride.<P>The best chapter by far was ch. 11, where the author with assistance from Michael Thumann takes the reader on a tour of exploiting vulnerable code. The stack diagrams and code snippets were especially helpful and the explanations were clear enough. This sort of material is a solid introduction to some of the techniques found in "Security Warrior." I also liked ch. 14, where the author explains a sample assessment using the tools already introduced. Kudos as well for maintaining an errata page and tool archive on the publisher's Web site.<P>The advantage NSA has over HE is the variety of tools on hand. I learned of at least a dozen tools not mentioned elsewhere. The author seems to be thorough while listing various exploitable flaws from the last several years. While the prose is well-written, I believe the HE series does a better job communicating fundamentals of the underlying technology. In other words, HE gives better explanations of 'what' we are compromising, while "NSA" prefers to concentrate more on the compromising itself. This technology education aspect of the HE series has always been its strong point. For example, there's no need to read a 500 page book on Microsoft FrontPage to understand the problems with it when a quick look in a HE book explains the technology's basics as well as its security flaws.<P>It's been over a year since the 4th edition of HE was published, so I recommend buying NSA to freshen your assessment skills. For the scenarios it does cover, which include most UNIX and Windows Internet-based attacks, it is thorough and accurate. Combined with O'Reilly's "Security Warrior," NSA presents an updated picture of the assessment scene.</span>

                    <span>"Network Security Assessment" is a fun little book that covers vanilla network security assessment approach from planning to scanning to exploitation (but for whatever reason no reporting and remediation in the end). I liked that the author outlined the methodology first before diving into techniques. Such methodology presents (as it is common in the security arena) a double-edged sword, since it is used by security consultants as well as amateur blackhats.<P>The book is mostly fun to read (especially when the author is picking on the CIA in his remote information gathering activities). Sometimes though it boils down to listings of known vulnerabilities, some dated, going back to the times of RedHat 5.x and public exploit references. The coverage is pretty comprehensive, includes UNIX and Windows platforms and applications as well as VPN (but not network devices and wireless). I also liked his description of information gathering activities. The book covers most of the commonly used tools such as "nmap" (covering some of the relatively lesser known details of this scanner) as well as touches upon some of the less common such as "scanrand"). Every chapter ends with a brief summary of possible countermeasures to the activities in the chapter.<P>The book is definitely recommended to people new to the whole security assessment area. I suspect that those involved in the field will pick up some new things as well. For example, I liked that the author emphasizes various brute-forcing tools that can be as handy as the actual exploits when attacking a networked service. Also, I learned a new approach for picking up an internal IP address from behind the NAT by watching for certain ICMP packets.<P>Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

The author has a very professional approach to security assessment and every chapter covers in detail ways to find out information about systems and their vulnerabilities. The final chapter walks through the process of creating a detailed report about an attack. One of the best security related books I have ever read.</span>
