                    <span>A disappointment.  I'm a fan of Penguin Lives series, which,  tend to give a somewhat alternative -- and fascinating -- view of their subject. Not so with Nuland's Leonardo.  I struggled with Nuland's use of Freud as a reference point for Leonardo, and with his belaboring Leonardo's presumed homosexuality as a reference point for understanding his life.  By the time I made it past this, I admit I didn't give Nuland's manuscript my fair attention. And I'm content leaving it that way.  </span>

                    <span>This is the second of Sherwin Nuland's books that I've read. The first, his biography of Semmelweis, was much better written. (I gave the Semmelweis book five stars.) Dr. Nuland's sentence construction in the Da Vinci book is often rather strange. I don't mean to pettifog, but I found his awkward sentence structure a distraction. That being said, I liked this short introduction to the life of Da Vinci. I knew almost nothing about Leonardo's life before reading this book. Now I'm equipped to read a weightier biography. </span>

                    <span>This book does a great job of covering a largely enigmatic life in a short number of pages.  Unlike many other authors, Mr. Nuland does not just write his assumptions as fact, but clearly points out where he is making assumptions, the facts he is basing them on, and what other historians think.  On top of this, the book is an enjoyable read.

                    <span>Well written, short study of a very remarkable man.  This by no means is a comprehensive study of Da Vinci nor his times, but does give the reader enough information to search on, if interested. It was more like a survey of a life rather than a complete biography. I would highly recommend it.  This type of study is great for those who like to know a bit of this and a bit of that.  Need more like it.  Thank you Mr Nuland.</span>

                    <span>I was aware that in addition to being a master painter DaVinci was also a visionary scientist with ideas far ahead of his time, but I had no idea that he had made such remarkable leaps forward in the investigation of anatomy.  This is a very interesting side of Leonardo that I'm glad to have learned more about.  Even so, I don't know if it deserves to degree of focus this biography gives it.<p>This work gives a functional overview of the major events of DaVinci's life and dabbles a bit in the interpretation of a few of his more famous works of art.  But it is first and foremost a biography of DaVinci the anatomist, to the detriment (it seems to me) of DaVinci the artist and DaVinci the mechanical engineer.<p>Beyond that, two things bugged me about this book.  First, the author is a bit preoccupied with the idea of Leonardo's homosexuality and uses that as a tool to pschoanalyze many areas of his life.  The speculations on his early childhood are almost exclusively retrospections guessed at by looking backward from an adult homosexual male.  <p>The second thing that bothered me was the author's treatment of DaVinci's religious beliefs.  I recognize that religion may not have been a central focus in DaVinci's life, but he does seem to have had a definite belief in God, whearas Nuland more or less apologizes for that fact whenever he is forced to bring it up and it seems that he would like to simply dismiss it as one of the areas in which DaVinci was a product of his times.</span>
