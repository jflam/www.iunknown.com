                    <span>I have been a fan of TV game shows for my whole life. Several years ago, while I was on vacation in the Los Angeles area, I made an appointment to try out to be a contestant on the Wheel of Fortune TV show. I detailed the rules of the game to friends gathered around a pool in Altadena. Our host, a professor who never watched TV, said that puzzle solving on the Wheel was an example of cryptanalysis. He taught a course on the subject at Caltech. He retreated to the house and emerged with a copy of the Gaines book for me to read. I went on to win over $50,000 on the show.<P>This book may be dated now that we rely on computing systems to encrypt and decrypt our information. However, I found the detailed discussions of historical encryption techniques interesting. The book was of use to me as reference of important statistical information on the English language: frequency of single letters, diagrams and trigrams (two- and three-letter combinations), initial and final letter frequencies, ordered list of the most commonly used English words. You may not become rich and famous in Hollywood as I did, but you should find this to be a worthwhile book.</span>

                    <span>As a former codebreaker with the ASA/NSA during the VN war, I often found it helpful to have a copy of Helen's book handy, and spent many enjoyable hours solving the sample ciphers provided. This valuable book not only describes many historically significant encipherment methods, but also goes into detail about how to break them. Afficianados of manual ciphers might also wish to contact others with similar interests and can do so through the American Cryptogram Association at www.cryptogram.org.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book over 40 years ago... It is, by far, the best book for pen-and-pencil cryptogram solving that I have found. It gives sufficient information to allow attacking any pen-and-pencil cryptogram. If it is followed by Bauer's "Decrypted Secrets," one would have a very thorough introduction to methods of solutions (Bauer is quite mathematical, but also recommended to the mathematically inclined). An excellent introduction with a great deal of useful information that is probably the best available source for pre-computer techniques.</span>

                    <span>The author of this book was party to a cryptological society, still around, founded in the early 1920's which made, and solved, cryptograms as a hobby just as people 'do' crossword puzzles. <P>All crypto can, loosely, be divided into the sort used by governments, banks, international drug traffickers, and those using digital communications and that type of crypto used by people who just don't want secretaries, nosey people or their teacher peeking into their lives.<P>This book will most likely cover all the later groups crypto needs. I have used it, almost exclusively, for 30 years, where fast and short communication was needed to a known recipient with a decryption 'key'.<P>This book uses complex English and print which is uncomfortably small. There are some 'gems' of obscure information in this book as, by example, a frequency list which identifies the final letter of 10,000 typical words in Portuguese ... O.K. ... nothing I suspect that one could not 'figure out' but nothing I suspect that one ever would.<P>While a trained crypto analyst might unravel these in short order they are impenetrable to most secretaries, nosey folks and schoolteachers.</span>
