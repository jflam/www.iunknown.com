                <span id="Label1">With a dedication that cites the lovely passage from <I>The Wind in the Willows</I> about how there's "nothing half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats," the <I>DK Complete Sailing Manual</I> tacks into a welcoming breeze from the start. It's an unpretentious, simply written, well-organized (by color codes for easy referral, no less), and comprehensively illustrated instructional that starts with the basics and, step by understandable step, builds from there.<p> Steve Sleight, a British National Champion racer, charts a course that beginners can quickly pick up and the more advanced can hold onto for ready reference. Emphasizing essential principles and techniques, he gets you into the boat, familiarizes you with both theory and practice, and then launches you safely with more than enough knowledge to keep you afloat. Before returning to port, he'll have you relatively ship-shape in knots, navigation, maintenance, safety, equipment, weather, and etiquette in vessels and situations ranging from one-person dinghies to multi-hulled yachts and calm lakes to high seas. "For those who catch the sailing bug, there is rarely a cure," he writes. Given this, the <I>Manual</I> comes through handily with the requisite life support. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>"There is nothing - absolutely nothing - half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats." -The Wind in the Willows<P>Ok, life being short and all, there is not enough time to sail the world in one lifetime. Actually, Washington is a beautiful place to sail, yet, my soul longs for the beach life in Florida. The water is warmer for sure! <P>This book seems more sophisticated than the KISS series by DK. I'd say you could use both. This has a nice easy to use Contents section which lists all the basics so you can find information faster. <P>First Essentials is a chapter about safety, it lists the parts of the boat, essential equipment, how a boat sails, main controls, etc. I found it to be quite good. <P>Then they divide the sailing information up into Dinghies, advanced dinghy sailing and cruiser sailing. <P>The navigation section is rather good with information on charts, compasses, plotting equipment, navigation instruments, buoyage, pilotage, tides and tidal streams, plotting a position and passage skills. <P>Weather, Practical Boat Care and Staying Safe are the last three chapters. <BR>Highlights include:<P>Great diagrams of the parts of a boat. <BR>Learning to tie the six basic knots<BR>Capsize Recovery<BR>Trapeze FUN! <BR>Catamarans<BR>Cruiser Ropework - more advanced<BR>Daily Changes - how to read the sky<P>The author taught himself to sail at age 10 and was teaching others by the time he was age 14. He has taught daysailing, cruising, and competitive racing. Some people sure know how to live the good life. Jonathan McKee was born in Seattle, Washington where he began sailing at the age of 10. I'd imagine this book is a favorite in Seattle. <P>In the case of sailing, knowledge really is freedom.<P>Essential!</span>

                    <span>Here is one that stands out among the many. Steve Sleight's book "The Complete Sailing Manual" takes no chances at overstatement. The design and layout of the subject from the most elementary to the most sophisticated is managed with charm and grace. Each section teaches and inset boxes confirm. A glossary aids short memories. Little by little the reader is delighted into learning a great deal about sailing in a little space. The illustrations are clear and entertaining. The photographs well selected and nicely shown. It was a pleasure reading the book. I'll read it again.</span>

                    <span>I think all the DK series books are interesting to read. Sailing is such a varied topic that illustrations are important to help the reader quickly grasp the concepts. I read and enjoyed Sailing for Dummies, but wish I had bought the DK Complete Saiing Manual first. I used it to supplement my sailing lessons. Although it is not as in-depth as Chapman's, I feel this is a great book to introduce beginning sailors to the many areas of sailing such as sailing basics, weather and cruising. Once a reader has the overall basics from this book, then learning the extensive details offered in a volume such as Chapman's will seem more easily digestible.</span>

                    <span>The biggest challenge facing the author of any sailing text is to communicate comprehensive information on a technical subject in a manner that is still readable. Many of them fail at this, being either too dry for most people to read or not sufficiently comprehensive to be very useful. <P>Steve Sleight's Complete Sailing Manual is one of the most informative and engaging books on sailing I have ever encountered. The writing is highly articulate and flows in a manner that draws the reader into each topic. It is sprinkled throughout with gem-like details of seamanship, history and personal experience that expose the author's formidable knowledge of sailing, communicating and teaching. It can be used as a reference or text -- read and enjoyed from cover to cover or kept on board to be used when you need to look something up.<P>The subjects range from dinghy and high performance sailing to racing, design considerations, all aspects of cruising, navigating, weather, storms, maintenance, safety, line handling and very much more. Each is handled thoroughly, and presents specific details that most writers are not sufficiently articulate to include. There are excellent sections on anchoring and docking under power or sail with consideration given to almost any possible wind and current strength and direction. Included is a discussion on techniques for using warps to turn a boat at a dock or on a med-moor. <P>The work is a beautiful balance between images (clear precise diagrams as well as excellent photos) and text. In short it is a complete sailing manual - extremely responsible in its content and fun to read.<P>As the director of one of the largest sailing schools in the United States, I am very pleased to have discovered this treasure and plan to use it as a text for our more advanced courses.<P>Dave Franzel Director Boston Sailing Center</span>
