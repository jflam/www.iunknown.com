                    <span>I couldn't disagree more with Cecil Fox's obtuse review of this book. I think Mr. Fox spent more time examining his 'Word of the Day' calendar than attempting to formulate a coherent review. In fact, his description of Cobb's work reads more like a pastiche of academic cliches than an opinion from a reader who might have actually read the book he was reviewing. Revisionism? Where? "Ideological rectitude?" What ideology was espoused? I thought the text was concise and honest about the South, the Delta, and regional identity. Apologist? Please see Mr. Fox's review of "Moon Handbooks Havana" for a textbook example where he equates the U.S. with a third-world country in comparison to Cuba and offers up the laughable non sequitur that "Civil liberties are no more endangered in Havana than in Alabama or the Bronx." If Mr. Fox did indeed grow up in the Delta, then his review more accurately reflects the pretentious dismisiveness of a prodigal son from Madison or Ridgeland than a sharecropper from Tutwiler. Cobb's focus on the elite as an oppresive force that shaped both the economy and society in the same manner that the Mississippi shaped the Delta might not be popular with all but will never be mistaken as revisionist.</span>

                    <span>Love it or hate it, the South, and Mississipi in particular, looms large in the identity of America. "The Most Southern Place on Earth" does an outstanding job explaining how Mississippi became, well, Mississippi. It is just amazing how much this obscure and economicaly poor state has contributed to the arts and culture of the county.</span>

                    <span>Growing up in the Delta I find a lot to dislike about this exercise in academic revisionism of Southern history. The author is clearly ignorant of those times that shaped the history of the Delta, the floods of 1927 and '37 followed by the migrations of black people to the North followed by the mechanical cotton picker, followed by the emmigration of light industry to the "new" south. This superficial book is typical of the ideological rectitude among apologists that permeate parochial history departments. A person wishing to understand the psyche of the Delta should read instead, "Lanterns on the Levee",or "Rising Tide", both available from Amazon.com.</span>

                    <span>I loved what the book!  As a 4th generation Mississippi Deltan, seventh generation Mississippian, white , 48 year old male, I was very impressed with Mr Cobb's research.  He certainly dispelled many of the myths that we were taught as we grew up from a segregated society to a desegregated  society.  I now live in Colorado but my family and friends still live in  the Delta.  I wish this book was required reading in the schools in the  Delta as well as anywhere segregation and racism exists to help people  better understand why these problems that continue to plague these areas  will not go away.  A great study on the Mississippi Delta with more fact  than fiction.</span>
