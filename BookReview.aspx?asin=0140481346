                    </div>
                    <span>Arthur Miller wrote an outstanding play on the human condition as it pursues the traditional American dream.  Willy Loman is a man of high self-esteem and expectations, who always waited for the big hit to occur, yet it never did.  He then gets to late in life and looks around to find all those whom he admired and didn't had made something of themselves, while he was still in the same salesman position he was in as a young man.  
<br />
<br />The book switches between his memories and reality, which reflects his true state of mind, being linked to what is perceived as a glorious past in many different ways:
<br />- He was an extremely well liked person, had great connections, which was the basis of his self-esteem.
<br />- His sons were outstanding and capable of taking on the world.
<br />
<br />That glorious past was pitted against the crude reality:
<br />- The world changed and he knows no one anymore, which coupled with his old age, makes him unproductive and leads his to be fired from his long time job.  He is fired by the son of the company founder, who had made him many promisses and kept his hopes up, hopes which were not fulfilled.
<br />- His son is a poorly adjusted man, never being able to focus on anything, preferring to go west for long stretches without accomplishing anything meaningful in Willy's eyes.
<br />
<br />Willy gets trapped in an imaginary world, swithcing from the reality of his and his family's shortcomings and the potential that layed before them as young men (his and his sons').  This is a short but densely written story, one of those few that will open a small window into a failed man's heart and let you peek inside.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This short book is in fact the script of the two act play with some extra notes. It is just over 130 pages long written in medium to large font, takes 2 to 3 hours to read, and in addition to the lines there are descriptions of the stage lighting, the colors of the lights, spot lights, sounds, music, the motions and positions of the characters, and the design and the look of the set, all described in detail as we proceed through the play. In principle, one could take the book and faithfully reproduce the play.
<br />
<br />The front cover of the book has a simple black and white photo of four of the original cast members in the play - probably from a later scene - including Lee J. Cobb who is the character Willy, the aging salesman. From the photo of Cobb, along with the text, the notes, and the scene descriptions, the reader is transported back in time to New York in the 1940s, back to the original production starring Cobb, especially for those who have seen and enjoyed Cobb in the movies.
<br />
<br />The basic story is simple although there are some complicated questions and undercurrents in the play: it is about an older worker who runs out of energy, loses interest in his job at a smaller company, and is fired with no pension or pay package - pre wrongful dismissal days and litigation. Then we learn how that person deals with the situation and interacts with his wife and two sons. 
<br />
<br />The subject matter about a father in trouble and how he deals with his declining social status - and sometimes reversing that decline - is not new. Although Willy is just a humble salesman, there have been many stage characters through the ages depicting similar troubled and aging fathers including the mythical King Lear or Prospero in the Tempest, the latter who reversed his declining fortunes. The present modern story resonates with the reality of aging workers, especially those people just too old or too tired too change and adjust. It is not exclusive to America but it is a universal story that could pertain to the older workers in Japan, China, Korea or Europe. 
<br />
<br />So I think that the play is not just about success in America per se, it is about surviving and dealing with life's problems, not meeting expectations, losing interest in life, maintaining some pride and dignity in advancing years, communicating with your children not being isolated, staying flexible, looking forward not backwards, and maintaining a positive attitude as Willy's wife seems to do. Willy takes his own life, thinking of himself as a failure even though he has a faithful wife and mortgage free home, and could have found employment elsewhere.
<br />
<br />He is a beaten man, alone, isolated, too tired to go on. The only grey area in the play is the question: does the depression and suicide attempts pre-date the firing ? That part is hard to tell with all the flashbacks. The story is made more poignant by his two sons - almost middle aged themselves but immature - who seem to be drifting in their own lives. It is a formula that brings more stress on Willy, and after a few false starts, Willy snaps and completes his suicide. It is a play that one will not forget. 
<br />
<br />Once I started to read I could not put the play down. It is compelling stuff. Arthur Miller's play merits its "classic" status. 5 Stars.

<br />(Note that this review is for the book "Death of a Salesman: 50th Anniversary Edition" published in 1999)
<br />
<br />This book has five sections:
<br />
<br />(1) Preface by the playwright, Arthur Miller (Oct. 1915 to Feb. 2005) who provides a very brief analysis of his play (among other things).  Its title is "Salesman at Fifty." (This play was published in 1949.)
<br />(2) Actual play itself that has two acts and a requiem.  (In fact, the subtitle of this play is "Certain Private Conversations in Two Acts and a Requiem.") 
<br />(3) Still pictures in black & white and color from the first production of this play in 1949 (starring Lee J. Cobb) and the 50th anniversary production of this play in 1999 (starring Brian Dennehy).  There are eleven of these pictures found between the first and second acts.
<br />(4) Afterword by Chris Bigsby (an author, playwright, broadcaster, and University professor).  This afterward is an excellent detailed analysis of the play from which I learned much.
<br />(5) Selective chronology of world productions of this play from 1949 to 1999.  For example, one entry has the play put on film for CBS in the US in 1985.  The lead character was played by Dustin Hoffmann.
<br />
<br />The actual Pulitzer Prize-winning play itself is unforgettable.  It is about hard-working, traveling salesman Willy Loman, a man whose life has become a permanent nervous breakdown, due to a kind of "success mania."  He's about to lose his job, he can't pay his bills, and his sons Biff  & "Happy" don't respect him and can't seem to live up to their potential.  His wife stills loves him but she is caught up in a state of "bitter helplessness."  Willy, now in his sixties, wonders what went wrong (after all, his dream of monetary success should have come true by now!!) and how he can make things up to his family.  He is now indeed a "low man."
<br />
<br />I shall provide a quotation from Miller's preface and from Bigsby's afterword both of which seem to capture the essence of the play:
<br />
<br />Miller: 
<br />
<br />"The Lomans [especially Willy], like [society's] models...are not content with who and what they are, but want to be other, wealthier, more cultivated [and] closer to power."
<br />
<br />Bigsby:
<br />
<br />The story of Willy Loman is "a dream shared by all those who are aware of the gap between what they might have been and what they are, who need to believe that their children will reach out for the [monetary] prize that eluded them, and who feel that the demands of reality are too [absolute] and relentless to be sustained without hope of a transformed tomorrow."
<br />
<br />Finally, I saw the movie version of this play (starring Dustin Hoffmann) first and then read the actual play.  I found that when I did this, the actual play was easier to read and follow.
<br />
<br />In conclusion, Arthur Miller has left us a gem of a play that is truly "one of the greatest dramas of our time."
<br />
<br />(published 1999; play is 110 pages; entire book is 145 pages)

                    <span>It is a difficult task to review one's favorite play.  I have known and loved DEATH OF A SALESMAN since I was sixteen years old; I am now twenty-five.  Let me just say that, whether or not one considers DEATH OF A SALESMAN a tragedy, it is unquestionably one of the greatest dramas of the twentieth century; it is also the late Arthur Miller's greatest play.  Like his ALL MY SONS (written in 1947, two years before SALESMAN), and like his subsequent THE CRUCIBLE and A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE, DEATH OF A SALESMAN brings together the themes of familial responsibility, man's role in relation to his society, and the possibility -- or impossibility -- that an individual can lead a normal life after having committed a crime.  Whereas in Joe Keller's (the protagonist of ALL MY SONS) case this is a crime against the "human family," Willy Loman, the titular salesman, betrays his own family.  To the above-mentioned themes DEATH OF A SALESMAN adds one more:  the dehumanizing effect of capitalism.  Willy, having reached the retirement age without having achieved the success in his profession of which he always dreamed, has become a mere object to be discarded by the company for which he has worked for twenty-five years.  ("You can't eat an orange and throw the peel away -- a man is not a piece of fruit!"  Willy protests to his boss, Howard.)  Where SALESMAN differs from ALL MY SONS is in its seamless integration of expressionist techniques, showing that Miller had learned from Tennessee Williams' 1947 play A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.  Under stress from guilt over his past "crime" as well as from the knowledge that he will soon be "thrown away" by the selling firm, Willy's mind wanders increasingly back to a past, happier year (1928 -- significantly, the year before the Great Depression began).  Thus in SALESMAN past and present exist onstage simultaneously, and the stage itself is a map of Willy's mind.  This is the true brilliance of the play.
