                <span id="Label1"><P> <I>First Things First</I> is a revolutionary guide to managing your time by learning how to balance your life. Traditional time management suggests that working harder, smarter, and faster will help you gain control over your life, and that increased control will bring peace and fulfillment. But in the first real breakthrough in time management in years, the authors of <I>First Things First</I> apply the insights of <I>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</I> to our daily problems of struggling with the ever-increasing demands of work and home life. <P> Rather than focusing on time and things, <I>First Things First</I> emphasizes relationships and results. And instead of efficiency, this new approach emphasizes effectiveness. It tells us: <P> * Why we feel a gap between how we spend our time and what's deeply important to us<BR> * How focusing on efficiency and control increases the gap instead of closing it<BR> * How to determine if what you're doing is really important -- or only urgent<BR> * How to overcome the tremendous gravity of habit<BR> * How to put people ahead of schedules<BR> * How to lead your life, not just manage your time <P> Offering a principle-centered approach and the wisdom and insight that made <I>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</I> a #1 bestseller, <I>First Things First</I> empowers listeners to define what is truly important; to accomplish worthwhile goals; and to lead rich, rewarding, and balanced lives.</span>

                    <span>Stephen R Covey is more than an inspirational writer. Covey empowers the reader with techniques to improve lifestyle habits. His wisdom allows the reader to regain control of his life. Instead of being a slave to everyone else's priorities, you become faithful to your own aspirations and priorities. This book has given me the courage to examine my life to ensure that I am on the path of life that I want to be on instead of the path that my life dictates. Anyone who struggles with not having enough time for the things that really matter should read this book. It will give you the gift of discovering where the time for those "First things" are.</span>

                    <span>In our days, the society's pressure for obtaining more and more material things has made us forget about the really important things. We don't have time for our most loved beings, and we always have something "urgent" to do. <P> Stephen Covey in this audio-cassette, show us that this kind of conduct is product of not hearing our inner voice, not following our principles. Sure, money is important but how many people, at th e ime they die would like to be more time at the office? Not a lot. When in an experiment, people is asked what would they do if they know they are going to die in six months, the most common response is to be more time with the loved ones. With the techniques that the author describe in his book, you will be able to create "time zones" that would help you to stay focused in the most important things of your social, spiritual, mental and physical dimensions, giving you a better quality of life. <P> Another book that I recommend you, related with this theme of time management is: "Time Shifting, creating more time to enjoy your life" by Stephan Rechtschaffen.</span>

                    <span>Some people on the reviews complained about the book not just being Covey talking...but if you notice the book is written by three people (yeah, Amazon only shows 2, but I have the book in front of me) The CD is a good highlight to explaining the basics to the First Things First principles. The cd says to get the book for using the meat and potatoes of the book...BUT there is also a 3 Disc set out there which is Unabriged and tells it all (for some reason I can't find it on Amazon...but have found it in searching around the net) So if you want the basics to remind yourself of what you are doing (Review regularly to make it a part of your life is a common self improvement strategy) is quicker than re-reading the book over and over... especially when given the gift of traffic to slow down and enjoy the CD.</span>

                    <span>Our lives are busy and full of change. Keeping our priorities in order while maintaining focus and vision is a constant challenge. We live in a society that loves short cut techniques where there is no short cut, only a path based on principles revealed throughout history. A meaningful life is not a matter of speed and efficiency but what you do and why you do it - and we need to be reminded of this everyday. The best way is to take a few minutes of quiet time before the daily rush. Our hearts and minds need nourishment and this is the purpose of this book - to provide daily nourishment through the daily reading of wisdom literature that can have a profound effect on the quality of our daily decisions by keeping us focused on what is important and preventing us being swept away by urgency. Covey believes these little daily thoughts will help us do three things - to reconnect with our big ideas and the insights that accompanied learning them; to encourage us to take a little breathing space between events and our response - a space that reconnects us to our inner compass; and to garnish our wisdom literature habit. We need to be constantly reminded of the principles that have been part of the wisdom of every successful individual and civilization. These are some of the readings that made an impression on me:<P>January 4: Be governed by your internal compass, not by some clock on the wall.<BR>January 5: If the thing you are committed to is principle-centered, you become principle-centered and you walk your talk.<BR>January 11: While you can be efficient with things you cannot be efficient - effectively - with people.<BR>January 14: We need to move beyond time management to life leadership.<BR>January 23: Meaning is in contribution, in striving for something higher than self.<BR>January 29: We choose either to live our lives or let others live them for us.<BR>January 30: The best way to predict your future is to create it.<BR>February 6: The more involved you are, the more significant your learning will be.<BR>February 7: What does it matter how much we do if what we're doing isn't what matters most.<BR>February 14: More than any other factor, vision affects the choices we make and the way we spend our time.<BR>February 18: Vision is the fundamental force that drives everything else in our lives.<BR>February 22: There's no way we can escape accountability. We do make a difference - one way or the other. We are responsible for the impact of our lives.<P>I think that Covey is right. We need a five-minute reminder as we start each day to make sure that we keep our thoughts, plans and priorities pointed in the right direction because where we're headed is more important than how fast we're going.</span>

                    <span>I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an "advice o'the day" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest.</span>
