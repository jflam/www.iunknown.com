                    <span>This book, like its predecessor for NT 4.0, is a perfect quick reference for those tasks you may not perform very often. I've had it less than a month and I find it usually answers my questions without a detour to my other W2K texts (including those for the two courses I took). It's a tad big to be called a "pocket consultant" but it's still easy to tote to the server room. I took off a star as there are a few areas where info could be added, such as in startup configurations.<BR>(Review of first edition).</span>

                    <span>At 8 X 5-1/2 X 1-1/2 this nicely bound volume can take the abuse of being carried around in a briefcase. With 477 pages including a 20-page index you should seldom have to resort to your ten-pound complete technical reference. An on-the-road administrator or consultant might find this to be his most indispensable resource.<P>This book is one in a series of portable references for system administrators. The book contains the typical step-by-step instructions with frequent screen shots. The typesetting is nicely done, and, like most books from Microsoft Press, the editing has been carefully done.<P>The author assumes general familarity with a networked Windows, if not NT, environment. It is not a planning or installation book but a daily adminstrator's guide. If your network planning is not complete or if Windows 2000 is not yet installed, you will need other references.</span>

                    <span>I have the first edition and got the second edition immediaetly. With the second edition, Stanek has done a great job! This book is well written, easy to follow and concise, yet packed with lot's of useful information and hints and tips for Windows 2000. I consider myself a fairly expert Windows admin, but still learned quite a lot from this book. Like other Windows books that Stanek has written, this one is excellent for either new admins or experienced admins. I whole heartedly recommend this book to everyone.</span>

                    <span>My library of tech books fills many shelves. Out all of those books, Microsoft Windows 2000 Administrator's Pocket Consultant is one of the most used. I highly recommend it as a desktop reference. I refer to it all the time and it is one of the rare tech books I read cover to cover as well.</span>

                    <span>This is the best Win2K Server book I have come across for daily administration. Stanek's writing style is actually enjoyable to read and easy to understand. He obviously knows the subject, and this book is like attending an expert training class. It's refreshing to read a book written for the real admins. I also used it to help prep for MCSE tests on Win2K. <P>I particularly bought the book because I needed additional training on Active Directory. It has also helped with our DNS and DHCP configuration. Finally I found a book that covers Win2K DNS in good detail and also details how it integrates with AD. After reading the book, I finally fixed our DNS and AD problems. Another highlight of the book for me was his covering disk configurations, roaming profiles and EFS. Lots of expert tips and insights. Again, the book's not an exhaustive reference on the subject but is a solid daily adminstration reference. I highly recommend this book as a primary tool to correctly learn how to admin a Win2K domain.</span>
