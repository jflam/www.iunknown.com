                    <span>"The Best American Mystery Stories 1999" is a strong collection of modern crime related short stories that run the gamut from Private Eye tales to ameture sleuth stories to whodunnits? They are as varied as the authors themselves. Some giants of the genre check in here, including Lawrence Block with "Keller's Last Refuge," Loren Estleman with an Amos Walker short "Redneck," and John Updike with the sinsiter little tale "Bech Noir." Among the best of the rest are "Poachers" by Tom Franklin, the gruesome mass murder aftermath story "Safe" by Gary A. Braunbeck, "Netmail" by Brendan DuBois, and an excellent Vietnam era story, "A Death on the Ho Chi Minh Trail." As with every entry in this fine series, there were a couple here that didn't work for me, but overall the quality of the nineteen stories selected cannot be disputed.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed with most of the stories in this anthology. The first half of the book had me interested, but midway through the stories, my passion for them waned.<P>My favorite story in the group was the first one (BLIND LEMON by Doug Allyn). It was a moving story in which two strangers reunite ten years later after getting their friend killed. Due to guilt as well as fear, they both go their separate ways trying to escape the tragedy. They see each other at a bar where one of them is performing. The story was very poignant and heartfelt. I wish Mr. Allyn success with his other works.<P>My main disappointment was with Jonathan Kellerman's THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE. It was a good story and it could have been a surprise to the reader. Unfortunately, it is in a book about mysteries. If things seem a little too ordinary three quarters of the book, then there must be a twist somewhere in the end. I think this story would have worked better in an anthology of love or family stories, as well as in a magazine guided towards women.<P>It is good to read short stories every once in a while to discover new and promising authors. As I previously stated, nothing really stands out in this particular anthology, however, I recommend the 1998 as well as the 1999 Best Mystery stories. You will find some pleasant surprises in them.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this collection of the best mystery stories published in 1999. There are some familiar authors in this book such as Phillip Margolin, Lawrence Block, and Jeffery Deaver. These authors stand out for themselves so I will not comment on them but make note on the overlooked authors.<P>My two favorite stories are SACRIFICE by L. L. Thrasher and OUT THERE IN THE DARKNESS by Ed Gorman. The first one involves a mother's extreme measures to protect her daughter's innocence. It is L. L. Thrasher's first short story and an excellent one at that. The story is heartbreaking but it makes you think twice of how precious innocence is to a child. Ignorance is bliss but the truth here is very dangerous.<P>OUT THERE IN THE DARKNESS involves a group of poker buddies who stop a burglar from robbing their house. They decide not to call the police but to handle things themselves and try to get information from the criminal. Everything then backfires and the four friends are now fighting to stay alive. One of the themes here is the danger of becoming a vigilante and the consequences one must pay.<P>Overall, most of the stories in this collection are good and I recommend it as an aperitif before trying out a novel by one of the authors. I would like to make also an honorary mention with SAFE by Gary A. Braunbeck. It will make you think twice about cleaning houses.</span>

                    <span>What fun! The stories in this anthology were entertaining, thought-provoking, and at times, frightening. These are not only good mysteries, they are very well written short stories. It's the kind of book you pass on to your friends,</span>
