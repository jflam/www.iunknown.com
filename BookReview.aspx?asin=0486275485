                    <span>As and ageing student but a novice in the study in Greek I have found Page's paperback edition very useful (it is in fact the prescribed text for the course I am doing), but it has deficiencies.  It appears to be a facsimile print and the Greek text in particular is not as clear as it might be.   The print size could be a little larger and the off-white page colour makes the reading harder for ageing eyes.   The Greek text is, however, more readable than some classical Greek texts which are little better than appalling. 
<br />
<br />Another aspect of Page's commentary is that he occasionally  uses Latin in the Commentary.   Those of us who studied Latin a long time ago (or not at all) find this no help to us at all.   I would recommend that anyone studying Medea in Greek seriously should certainly have this edition and should also buy the edition edited by Alan Elliott (Oxford Press).   The latter has a very clear Greek text, notes which are on a slightly easier plane than those of Page, and a useful vocabulary at the back.
<br />
<br />I must make it clear that I make no comment on the Medea play itself. That is left to others of greater knowledge.</span>

                    <span>Euripides play "Medea" is a timeless reminder that certain human characteristics are universal in nature.  Medea's readers will notice that, even despite they live 2,000 years after this play was written, the same types of disputes between individuals occur.  Men still cheat on women, and women, just as then, had strong emotional displeasure with such behavior.  What Euripides could never imagine is that this is an excellent story about evolutionary psychology.  This story does not justify such behavior, and, in fact, shows that the consequences can be deadly.<p>We see today that the story of Medea is on every single day in our living rooms!  Yes--every soap opera is about women who have been hurt by a man, while that man, because of biological instincts that encourage him to look for a variety of women--will search near and far for another female who will accept him.  What most stories do not explain, however (and especially not in that time era) is that women do feel immense pain from this, mostly emotional.  Medea was able to use that emotional anger she had -- and use it to cause physical and emotional pain on her philandering husband.  The only question is, did she need to kill her children to make that point?  That remains to be seen.<p>Michael Gordon</span>

                    <span>I didn't read Medea when I was in school, but I have now read through this slim tragedy twice over the last month, and the more I think about it the more I find the story line and its captivating protagonist fascinating and current. <p>Before opening the play, my knowledge of Medea had been limited to the occasional reference to it in news reports involving infanticide -- not something that made me eager to read the original. <p>Though Medea does take the lives of her children in a twisted revenge plot, it would be a serious mistake to consider that unforgettable act the central part of the play. Instead, it is Medea's evolution that is most important.<p>Despite the fact that she gave up her life to follow Jason, Medea is revealed as a kind of proto-feminist early on in the story, a woman defined more by cleverness than by rage ... and yet never seeming merely cunning or calculating. Sadly, this kind of dominating and complex female character would be somewhat unusual by the standards of popular literature today; she must have been exceptionally remarkable in the day of Euripedes, the play's author.<p>The tragedy itself indicates this kind of reversal in several ways, ranging from the manner in which Creon reacts to Medea in their conversation near the end of the story to the way the chorus makes mention of streams flowing upwards in the mountains.<p>But for all its value, Medea does not stand on its own. Readers must know what ancient Greek audiences already knew: that Medea sacrificed everything, including her life in her home country, to help Jason win the treasured Golden Fleece and to mother his children. But soon she is abandoned in favor of a woman of more noble birth, which is where the play begins. This edition -- not the play itself -- loses a star for failing to explain that context in what could have been a very brief but invaluable introduction.</span>

                    <span>The great screen writers and directors of the last century have nothing on Euripides when it comes to being an innovator of art. Euripides tore away the shackles of the "how to write a play" of his day--Aristotelian dramatic theory. In the process, modern Western drama was born. His play Medea is a prime example. <br>	<br>At first glance Medea does, in some respects, exemplify Aristotle's requirements for a tragedy. However, the play violates Aristotle's vision more than it corresponds to it.  It does this through untraditional content and innovation.<p>In layout and movement of the plot, Medea closely matches the form of Aristotle's standard example of a tragedy--Sophocles's Oedipus Rex. Medea shares Oedipus's convention of beginning with the perspective of a mournful look back on the events that are about to be told. <p>Medea is highborn and descends from the lineage of the Gods. This in some ways fulfills Aristotle's requirement that the protagonist be exceptional. Likewise, both Medea and Oedipus depict what Aristotle would call "terrible and piteous events." However, this is where the similarity with Aristotle's ideal of the tragic ends.<p>The character of Medea is the main wrench that Euripides throws into Aristotle's description of tragedy. Aristotle's idea of the tragic hero demanded a change of experience and fortune that entails unmerited suffering on the part of the character and a fearful viewing of events on behalf of the audience. These things do not happen in Medea. <p>Medea has a history. She has killed spitefully and coldly in the past. She continues to do so throughout the play. She never even faces the threat of a fall from a high station because she secures sanctuary in Athens before she sets her revenge into motion (incidentally, one comes to feel like the psalmist who wrote: "I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil"--though in this case it is a wicked woman). Euripides uses Medea to make a commentary, not to bring about that lynch-pin of Aristotelian drama: catharsis. <p>Medea does not attempt to meet up with Aristotle's requirements. Instead, it is becomes new form of art--tragedy as social commentary. Euripides shows himself to be among the great artistic innovators in history by his transformation of a received dramatic form into something different but wholly effective in its own way.</span>

                    <span>According to the introductory note in the Dover Thrift Edition, "Medea," the play by Euripedes, was first produced in 431 BC. After more than two millennia, this remains a powerfully written human tragedy. The Dover Thrift edition features an English translation by Rex Warner; this very effective translation manages to sound both classic and contemporary at the same time.<p>"Medea" tells a story involving the classical Greek hero Jason and Medea, by whom he has fathered two children. As the play opens, Jason has angered Medea by taking on another woman to be his wife. This conflict drives the drama forward. "Medea" is a gripping story about love, parenthood, politics, betrayal, anger, and revenge. There is a subtle but fascinating theme of ethnic tension as Medea and Jason clash. Finally, I believe that, after all these centuries, Euripedes' sociological and psychological insights remain compelling.</span>
