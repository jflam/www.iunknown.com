                <span id="Label1"><P>The long-stale page metaphor for Web sites is finally dying out, replaced by the single-screen rich-Internet apps that Flash MX 2004 is at last bringing to the mainstream. To stay ahead of the curve&#191;and to start creating the kind of Web sites you used to only dream of&#191;you need this guide. In these pages you'll learn how to create the sites that more and more companies are demanding&#191;the kind that pull complex data from multiple sources for delivery via a single Web interface, so that users can perform multiple functions from a single screen. The focus here is on building the Flash MX 2004 front end to work with that complex data. You'll learn how to structure applications to eliminate page refreshes while reducing download time, build real-time and time-delayed applications with Flash Communication Server, integrate technologies like Flash Remoting and Macromedia Central, and more. You can even download all of the source files form the book's companion Web site.</P></span>

                    <span><BR><BR>At first glance of "Macromedia Flash MX 2004 for Rich Internet Applications" I noticed that the book is not meant to be a complete reference for Flash MX 2004 or ActionScripting. Finally I had a book in my hands that isn't a 1400 page terse reference manual. "Flash MX 2004 for Rich Internet Applications" at 460 pages is very convenient and easy to hold. Thank goodness for that as I have read through so many 1400 page reference books lately that my wrists are about to explode.<P> This book will really strike a nerve with intermediate Flash MX 2004 developers who already have some basic understanding of ActionScript and the Flash MX 2004 interface. I enjoyed the small snippets of code with easy to understand explanations. It's a real source of relief to me that it doesn't require writing 2,000 lines of code just to get an understanding of how a small function works. The book is written as if the author knew "just" the code I needed to get many important tasks done and he presents it in a way that gives direct explanation and a flexible snippet of code that is also reusable.<P> Of the most interest was Chapter 5 'Presenting Data" which has some really good examples of how to work with HTML and CSS styles inside of Flash to present data in a consistent form. Also standing out is Chapter 6 'Basic Data Exchange' which covers using Flash to store user information and manipulate your Flash movies in some creative and interesting ways. It also covers the use of XML specifically in the Flash MX 2004 interface which is nice. Another mentionable is Chapter 10 'Production Techniques' which is full of time saving and useful tips to using Flash. This chapter is really worth the price of the book if you don't have a vast network of Flash developers to tap into for the 411 on how to use Flash MX 2004 in a production environment.<P> All said and done, after I finished reading "Flash MX 2004 for Rich Internet Applications" it was hard to believe that this book could pack so much useful information into such a small package but it did just that for me. It was a pleasure to read, interesting and full of information. We highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>As a web development professional who's purchased well over a hundred Web Devlopment books over the years, I most often find myself skimming and referencing these giant manuals, however in Phillip Kerman I've discovered a READABLE technical author. <P>After purchasing Phillip Kerman's previous outstanding book "ActionScripting in Flash MX" I saw that he was the first to publish an MX 2004 title. Naturally, his previous book was recommendation enough, so I purchased "Macromedia Flash MX 2004 for Rich Internet Applications". <P>Having now read it cover to cover - and now as I go through it again - I'm amazed at his writing style. Not only is it extremely understandable, thoughtful, and insightful, (even the complicated parts), it makes sense of the CONCEPTS behind what he's talking about - not just the examples. <P>In MX 2004 for RIA's, Kerman walks the user through everything from arrays to the new components, to exchanging data with outside sources, to communication server, etc. Basically covering all the good bits that Flash MX 2004 is capable of. This is not a reference book - It is a book that gives you a BROAD UNDERSTANDING as well as the confidence you need to take on the advanced stuff on your own. If you're the type of person that borrows code from other sources because you've never quite UNDERSTOOD something. Read this and people WILL BE BORROWING YOUR CODE. <P>I'm please to say that Kerman is consistently ahead of the pack in both his writing and explanatory style. I enthusiastically recommend this book to all professionals looking to dive into Flash MX 2004 and gain a thorough understanding of it's new and improved features and components.</span>

                    <span>This book was very disappointing. The author goes through endless verbose and meandering discussions of software engineering, but doesn't have a clue how to write decent code. The examples are pitiful--poorly designed, hard to follow, and sloppy.</span>

                    <span>Throughout the book the author keeps on singing an re-singing the praises and benefits of using the Flash but without any substantiative hands-on examples. It is the only book that I returned out of some dozen and a half books that I bought in the past year.</span>

                    <span>A very good read! I took interest to this book mostly for the 2 chapters on Flash Communication Server and have ended up reading a great deal of the rest of the book. I have found that there are a lot of hidden gems in this book that many authors don't touch base on. From production shortcuts to optimizing scripts that even macromedia doesn't mention. Seeing how one develops their own apps without components in the flash comm chapters was a real eye opener due of the lack of documentation on doing such. This book has help on a few different projects since I have read it! From optimizing my RSOs in FCS to building powerful multidimensional arrays - efficiently. <P>I think this book is for self starters and motivated individuals that see the need to learn with out the opportunity of having some one around to show you the tricks and techniques to speed up your production.</span>
