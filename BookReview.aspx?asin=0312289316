                    <span>I've been reading this book.  I'm still undecided about using the author's system for my paperwork at home.  The system has some attractive aspects, but I have big doubts.
<br />
<br />First, I am dubious about labeling file folders only with code numbers. I don't relate well to "M101" and would rather the label says what's in the file, such as "College Transcripts."
<br />
<br />But mostly the book seems outdated in many respects.  It was written in the 20th century before we had PCs in our homes.  It instructs us to write entries on the paperdex in pencil, so we won't have a big mess if we delete or change something.  And it assumes we will be typing labels.  These and similar passages aren't just quaint - they are distracting.  I wonder if this is really a good system in the computer age, or if there's a better alternative for me.  Will putting the Paperdex in an Excel file, and adding descriptive words to the cryptic code numbered folder labels, be enough?  </span>

                    <span>Hi, my name is Jeanne, and I'm a Piler. I've lived with this disease for 40 years. It has disrupted my personal life, my professional aspirations, and my living space. Or it *did*, until the day I borrowed this book from my local library (then renewed it ten times before succumbing to purchasing my own copy). Oh, I was skeptical... I'd already collected many books on the subject of Organization and Feng Shui, and either lost interest halfway through, became too confused to move ahead, or tried and failed at the plan.
<br />
<br />Then I found "File... Don't Pile" and my life was forever changed. Once I'd tried the process outlined in the book, I found myself becoming more organized. My Piles were diminishing. Old billing statements, coupons, and special offers dated as far back as 1997 were relieved of their life in Pile Purgatory and relegated to the Round File. The stack of "I want to keep this but have no idea where to put it so I can find it when I need it" items have finally found a home. And because of the Index, I no longer need to wrack my brain to remember where it went.
<br />
<br />The first Pile I tried with this method was my Pile of design jobs (I freelance from home). I spent a long evening applying the method to the items, and voila--they were neatly filed. Easy to locate when I needed to refer to a job from last year for an elusive logo. Bonus not mentioned in the book: I discovered a better way to name my jobs for archiving. I'd been using a clunky version of a job archiving system learned at a previous job, but since I lacked their production manager software that automatically assigns each job a number, it wasn't very effective. Keeping a written sheet with the numbers with no sense of order was also ineffective. The old numbering system was something like "20021101-03" (year, month, day, third job). Having to sort through CDs to find a job was tedious and time-wasting.
<br />
<br />Renaming current jobs to match their corresponding physical folder was a breakthrough!!! If I need Company A's logo changes from last year, I just grab their Index, scan down for "COA139 New Logo", and find the CD whose label bears that job number.
<br />
<br />This system is one of those things where it might not make sense UNTIL you try it. Once you get into it, the lightbulb flips on. Now if I could just figure out how to catalog all that yarn...</span>

                    <span>The book's two methods of filing sound good on paper, but in reality the methods require (at least) twice as much time to find what you are looking for.  The book recommends using an index system based on writing codes on each file tab.  Therefore the tabs by themselves mean nothing.  When you want to find a file you have to look up the files index number in an index journal where you are supposed to keep track of what all the tabs mean.  After you look up the tab code in the index you take that code and go to the file cabinet.  If you still remember the code by the time you go to the file, you can pick the right file.  As you can see, the book's method's require twice the work (i.e. once to lookup the corresponding code and twice to go look for the file), not to mention the daunting task of creating and maintaining the index journal.  Like I said, it sounds good on paper, but it's an unproductive system when put into practice.  Save yourself the time, money and frustration and learn from my bad mistake, stick with your current filing system.  If you're still not convinced, try this.  Rename all of the folders in your computer to some alphanumeric code, put the original names of your folders along with their corresponding new index numbers in an index file.  When you want to go to a folder, go lookup the index code in the index file and then go search for the folder.  If you like this kind of system, then this book is for you.

                    <span>For many years teachers in  Wisconsin have flocked to hear Pat present her ideas for organizing.  Knowing that one doesn't have to attend her workshop or remember everything from the workshop in order to have organized files is of benefit to all.
<br />
<br />This is great stuff.  It organizes home files, teacher files, office files....anything that needs filing.
<br />
<br />And you don't have to do all your stuff at once!!!</span>

                    <span>I, due to my extreme procrastination, am just getting my feet wet with Pat Dorff's system, but it's the only system that I've discovered so far that seems to shed a different light on why previous filing systems haven't worked.<p>How long can we shove something to do with "Bank" (involving more than one!  LOL) in just a few folders and expect to find it in a moment's notice?!<p>I want to be able to find ALL of my filing paperwork in less than a minute.  Can it be done?  I'm sure it can, but the system, once it's set up, is going to allow the person to BE in control, not the other way around.<p>I, at age 35, have been disorganized all of my life.  It has cost me time, money, embarrassment, etc.<p>Some people that I've talked to think it's kind of comical that I'm trying to get my life organized.  One of the things that I like about this book is the fact that a person has a way to organize other subjects, not just VIPs (very important papers).  For example, I have different interests that involve paper.  If I don't have a good filing system to look back for reference, then how am I going to locate them?  Also, if a subject isn't no longer needed, then other material can take its place (i.e. the coding system).  It's a real pain to have to keep re-filing papers due to changes -- the regular alphabet system.  <p>One way I have decided to handle the "Personal Business" part of it, even though the files will probably go beyond 35, is to not worry about the number and just keep adding (PB36, PB37, etc.).  I think it's okay to bend the 'rules' a little bit to fit one's own needs.  I have a lot of paper that I can categorize as "Personal Business," because I sure don't want to put it under "Miscellaneous" anymore!  I have to get away from that word...<p>As the author writes, just reading the book and not 'doing' anything afterward isn't going to get the papers in their rightful places.  That's the biggest step:  Getting Started!  Once that is done, then the other papers will fall into place.<p>I will post back once I've gotten the filing system down and make any notations of any hints that I come across.<p>Happy Filing!</span>
