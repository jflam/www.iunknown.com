                <span id="Label1">In this sparkling debut, an unconventional heroine defies tradition by making a marriage between the strict customs of India and the wild freedoms of America to find her own happy ending. <br><br> Hilarious and heartwarming, <i>For Matrimonial Purposes</i> proves that while the search for love takes many forms, the heartbreak and exhilaration are universal. In a sensual whirl of silk and spices, Kavita Daswani takes us from Bombay to New York and back again-in what is sure to be one of the most welcomed debuts of the summer. <br><br> Unmarried at twenty-four-and with no prospects in sight-Anju is a great source of worry to her family. Despite the best efforts of relatives, fortune-tellers, and matchmakers to arrange a marriage, she can't seem to find a husband-or at least one she's willing to marry. <br><br> Quickly becoming a spinster by her culture's standards, she is eager to escape the community that views her as a failure. After pleading with her parents for permission, she boards a plane bound for the United States and a dream of a career. And although husband-hunting isn't any easier in New York City, at least she's got company!</span>

                    <span>I thought this book was a fast read, and would be a pretty good beach book. The plot is straightforward- upper middle class Indian girl wants to be married. Her parents want her married. Her town wants her married.<P>It was interesting to hear about a woman's perspective of doing what is right and expected in India, even at the present time, as it is vastly different from what we Americans know. Unfortunetly, I don't have much knowledge as to how representational this book really is, and though I enjoyed hearing this side of the story, I still had difficulty beleiving that this is how things are.<P>I was conflicted about the heroine Anju. On one hand she is a rising star on the PR front, but she is also a devout Hindi who has set up a prayer shrine in her studio apartment. I could not get the two halves of this character to mesh in my mind as far as a work of literature goes. Her New York friends are too sterotypical for me, and I wasn't moved by her Indian relations.<P>I think the story would work better if it was done as a journal- the amount of interior monologue is oppressive.<P>But, the book is easy to read, and you do wonder if Anju will ever find love, so I think there is a definate audience for this book.</span>

                    <span>maggie Z saidit all. Just when you thik the heroine has come into her own. BAM there comes the (boring) happily ever after. This book is nothing but fluff. But if you want an easy read go for it!</span>

                    <span>A sparkling book about upper class Indian lifestyle. I identified completely with the light hearted style. It is meant to be a superficial look at the duties between Indian parents and daughters. You have to be Indian to understand that the character is not spineless or gutless as considered by western standards. An Indian parents duty is to get their daughter married, hence the arranged marriage and it is the duty of the daughter not to hurt her parents emotionally or socially. This book is about the attempts of both of them to achieve that goal through an arranged marriage. A simple story line, well written, never boring. Good job, Kavita!</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book from a bookstore in Mumbai on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised when I read it. It surpassed my expectations and the more I read it, the more I got involved with the characters of the book. The central character of the book - Anju is so much like the new-age, evolved Indian woman. Independent, intelligent and will not settle for second best. The book is about a one-woman search for the perfect Indian husband. The story is spread over two continents - India and USA. I could not put down the book, till I did not find out what sort of mate Anju finally landed up with... Kudos to Kavita Daswani for writing about such amazing characters...</span>

                    <span>What a terribly bad novel. I love fiction from India, but this was pathetic. The main character was such a spinless, witless woman that I had no respect for her. Her main goal in life was to find a husband and keep her parents happy by finding a husband. Nice goals if this was hundred years ago. If you want to read a good about contemporary India, arranged marriage and Indians, read "The Mango Season" by Amulya Malladi. Now that was a good book!</span>
