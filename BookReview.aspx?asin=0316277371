                <span id="Label1">On those magnificent days on which your drives split the fairway down the middle and your wedge shots leave you putting for birdie, you think: "I wonder if I could do this for a living." After all, guys in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, guys no one heard of until recently, are making planeloads of money on the various golf tours (and buying private planes to take them from one big-money tournament to the next). <i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i> is a bit of a reality check. John Feinstein chronicles the struggles of the top golfers in the game, as well as those trying to get onto the PGA Tour. These are gifted players who've devoted their lives to the game, and on any given day they could just flat out stink. <i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i> is a completely  engaging book from first page to last, a wonderfully observed and masterfully told story of pain and profit in the world's most frustrating sport.</span>

                    <span>I guess I am the only reviewer who found this book tedious and banal.  It's more a series of thumbnail biographies of pga tour players, linked together through weekly accounts of pga tour stops, than anything else.  Feinstein's writing seems to move along at a brisk enough pace, but after several chapters, I found one event starting to blend into the next, one Q school qualifier after another, one harrowing tournament finish after another, and so on, and so on.  Feinstein's writing verges on being formulaic- it's all written in a sort of breathless, anxiety filled pace, as the nail biting details of who's missing the cut, who's choking under pressure, whose marriage is on the rocks, who's in danger of returning to Q school all gets mixed together in a swill of golf gossip and insider minutia.
<br />
<br />What I found missing in this harried chronicle is any sign of the transcendental joy that marks golf at it's best.  It's almost as if Feinstein writes to show us how miserable and unbearably tense the world of professional golf is.
<br />
<br />While some of the details he provides are interesting, overall I found the book repetitive and lacking in the sort of poetry that the best sports writing sometimes achieves.</span>

                    <span>Golf is the cruelest sport, and "A Good Walk Spoiled" is a probing look at what beats inside the hearts of those who play it for a living. Author John Feinstein chronicles the 1994 PGA Tour season through the experiences of several pro golfers, stars like Tom Watson and Davis Love III as well as those trying to make the grade.<p>If you watch pro golf at all, even just occasionally tune in on the final round of a major, this is a book for you. It gives you a taste of why the Tour is so absorbing to those who follow it week-in, week-out. The first 100 pages pull you right in with scenes from two pressure-cooker events from opposite ends of the bell curve: The 1993 Ryder Cup at The Belfry resort in England, where America's best golfers compete with those from Europe for a much-coveted trophy; and Qualifying School, where the wanna-bes vie simply for the chance to compete on tour. Both are nervous narratives, and highly addicting.<p>Feinstein is no elegant prose stylist, but he's not a short-order cook, either. He writes in a deceptively easy-going way, not beating you over the head with all the words he knows or quoting from great works of literature to describe how John Cook felt about trying to make a certain putt. He just puts it all together and makes it gel, sometimes throwing in a clever metaphor. About the weather at the start of the 1994 British Open: "Turnberry had the feel of a schoolyard on the first warm day of spring, everyone excited and rejuvenated by the gorgeous weather." On the work ethic of the pros: "On any Tuesday and Wednesday on tour, the [driving] range looks like the exchange counter at Macy's on the day after Christmas."<p>Feinstein is even better as an interviewer. From normally taciturn guys he draws out some personal stories worth reading, like Paul Azinger's fight with cancer and how Curtis and Sarah Strange dealt with an unexplained medical condition she had that hobbled her for months. Some nice catty comments, too, like Davis Love's noting the demeanor of tour legends Watson and Jack Nicklaus: "I'm sure it's subconscious, but sometimes with those guys you feel as if they have to remind you how great they were because they can't show you anymore."<p>Watson was a revelation for me in this book. He always came off as prickly and distant, but he shared a lot with Feinstein and comes across the better for it. He was still trying to win majors in 1994 at age 44, and coming heartbreakingly close, but maintained a stoic demeanor and a sense of humor throughout.<p>Feinstein is a friendly-enough golfer's Boswell, but not everyone benefits from his pen. John Daly, working through his personal demons in 1994, comes in for some withering criticism, as does Greg Norman, who plans an elitist alternative to the PGA Tour that never gets off the ground. Tiger Woods is conspicuous by his absence, just a single mention near the end. He was barely on the radar screen in 1994, a teenage phenom noted for his skin color and not much else.<p>Some say "A Good Walk Spoiled" is the lesser for the lack of Tiger-time, but I enjoyed the opportunity to see what the tour was like before he changed everything. It's a worthy historical record for that alone. And though the book does drag a bit in the last 100 pages, with Feinstein not putting the same level of effort into his writing as he did detailing earlier tournaments, it makes for very pleasurable and edifying reading all the same. Even if you still can't make yourself care about who's squaring off in the last round of the Match Play Championship, you will finish "A Good Walk Spoiled" with a much deeper appreciation for those who live and die by how they play the game.</span>

                    <span>As I read this very enjoyable book, I felt more like I was listening to a conversation than reading a book.  It almost feels like "Did I ever tell you about the time I was playing with Greg Norman, and he..."   Feinstein has access to places and people that most golf fans never will, and as such, he has boatloads of great stories about the events and players of the PGA Tour (and the PGA wannabes).  Feinstein is great at collecting and telling the stories, particularly the character-revealing ones.  For that, the book is wonderful.  Specifically, I felt I was in Davis Love's quaking shoes while he was "throwing up on himself" at the Ryder Cup.  Feinstein tells the story so well, the reader feels part of the action.<p>At the same time, I couldn't help but think that the book was poorly organized.  Feinstein makes some effort to put the contents into a unified semi-chronological tale, but he fails in that.  Most of the events or people that he writes about require going back to cover background info on what set up that situation, or how that player got where he is now.  The backgrounding leads to a lot of de-synchronization (? -- throwing off the timeline?) in the book.  Many of the background information is also great and enjoyable storytelling, but given the chronological organization of the book, it was hard for me to keep the events straight -- which came first, which story had later impact on what, which ones overlap (two stories about two players at the same event, for example).  <p>There's also a lot of jumping from discussions of one player to another.  This works fine for the well known players, but not so well when the reader is trying to remember which of the Q-school players is which.  Still, in thinking about it, I couldn't think of a better way to organize it.<p>Having felt self-imposed "pressure" on the golf course -- if I make par here, this will be my best round ever! -- reading anecdotes about the *real* pressure of Q-school was fascinating.  Feinstein gives the reader the feel of needing to make a shot to be able to eke out a living by playing golf, and made me appreciate the difference between that than the pressure of making a shot to take pocket change from my foursome.<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the book.  What's not to enjoy, really -- it's good stories about an interesting (to any golfer or golf fan) subject.  I give only four stars because I just can't help feeling that the book could be much better organized for a more consistent read.</span>

                    <span>... that are so well written that they can be enjoyed even by a non-enthusiast of the sport. "Instant Replay" by Dick Schaap and Jerry Kramer is maybe the best example.<br>But this book is a good one. The best parts of the book are those that deal with the non-superstars; with those who grind out a living on tour, or can't quite hang on to their exempt status and drop to the lower tours, or have to go back to the dreaded "Q-School". If all you want to know about is the glitz and glamour and celebrity of the top stars, just bookmark Tiger's web site and read about him in People magazine or whatever. But there are dozens of stories in the world of golf more interesting, more engaging, more saddening or moving or inspiring than anything you've ever read about Tiger and his money and his girlfriend and his clothing. Feinstein captures some of those stories in this very readable book.</span>
