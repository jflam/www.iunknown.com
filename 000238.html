<h3 class="title">Puppy advice</h3>

<p><P>Kobe has grown like a weed over the past 7 weeks. When we got him, he weighed in at a svelte 17 pounds. Today, he's a 35 pound brute and growing like a weed!</P><br />
<P>We spent a lot of time reading various bits of puppy advice, both in books and on the web. Here's a few things that we learned about taking care of new puppies that we didn't find written down:</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>Books give conflicting advice. Often. You need to experiment to find out what works best for your dog. You need to devise experiment(s) to rule out options. For example, we found that you need to measure the amount of water that you give Kobe. Initially we restricted the amount and when water was given to him. He did fine during this phase. Next, thinking that he could self-regulate his water, we put down measured amounts of water three times a day. He did fine here as well. Finally, we decided to leave down unregulated amounts of water. One afternoon he decided to gorge on water (with the predictable consequences on our kitchen floor :) We switched back to measured quantities left out for him to drink when he wants to, and everything's working out great.<br />
<LI>Puppy diarrhea is <EM>really</EM> gross. Especially when he does it on carpet that is just one foot away from a large expanse of tile! We found that fasting him for 24 hours followed by 24 hours on a rice diet worked nicely to clear it up. However, Kobe wouldn't eat just plain rice; we fed him initially a rice / apple mixture and then a rice / chicken mixture.<br />
<LI>Puppies sleep <EM>a lot</EM>. If we're around and bothering him, he'll stay awake. Otherwise he just crashes out.<br />
<LI>Raising a puppy in an apartment is both good and bad. It's really good if you have a cute dog since everyone in the building will want to stop and say hi to him. This socializes the dog in a hurry, since he has met almost every shape, size and color of humans. The downside of raising a puppy in an apartment is the process involved in going outside. It takes nearly 5 minutes to get him to his "potty spot". This means that you'll need to carry him in the beginning, and you may be in for a few accidents along the way to his potty spot before he gets it. It took Kobe almost 5 weeks to go reliably to his potty spot.<br />
<LI>Older dogs generally don't want to have anything to do with energetic puppies. The oldest dog that I've seen Kobe play with is a 3 year old standard Poodle named Chanel who still thinks that she's a puppy. The rest of the dogs that Kobe regularly plays with are 2 years of age or younger. His best friend is Bailey, a 7 month old Golden Retriever; those two can go at it literally for hours on end, resulting in one very tired (and very good) puppy!<br />
<LI>The "terrible twos" aren't really all that terrible. I've seen Kobe give me a vacant look when I tell him to sit, and then he proceeds to sit about 20 seconds later; but that happens pretty rarely.<br />
<LI>Not all puppies want to chew through wiring. So far (thankfully) Kobe has shown little interest in wires. He does, however, have a taste for baseboards and door trim. With a bit of vigilence and bitter apple spray, we were able to change this bit of destructive behavior.<br />
<LI>Playing tug-of-war is not a bad game at all. You just need to define the parameters, and it's a great way of teaching the "give" command.<br />
<LI>Puppy school is a great place to go to reinforce commands under tremendous distraction. It was also a great way for him to meet puppies his own age. It took a while for Kobe to learn how to play with smaller dogs, since he so rarely encountered them during his daily travels.<br />
<LI>Kobe's a really picky eater. We were trying to switch him to another brand of dog food, and when we got to a 60/40 mix of old/new, he would actually pick out all of the old dog food and leave just the new dog food in his bowl!<br />
<LI>Not all rawhide is made the same. The stuff that we bought at Costco was infinitely better than the stuff that we got from a local pet shop. And it was cheaper too!</LI></UL><br />
<P>All in all, he's a great dog. He doesn't have an aggressive bone in his body, and he absolutely loves to meet other dogs and other people. He's still a little bit nippy at times, but that is getting better as well.</P></p>
