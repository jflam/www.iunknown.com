                <span id="Label1">When Guerrilla Marketing was first published in 1983, Jay Levinson revolutionalized marketing strategies for the small-business owner with his take-no-prisoners approach to finding clients. Filled with hundreds of solid ideas that really work, Levinson's philosophy has given birth to a new way of learning about market share and how to gain it. In this completely revised and expanded third edition, Levinson offers a new arsenal of weaponry for small-business success in the next century. Filled with strategies for marketing on the Internet (explaining when and precisely how to use it), tips for putting other new technologies to work, programs for targeting prospects and cultivating repeat and referral business, and management lessons in the age of telecommuting and freelance employees, this book will be the entrepreneur's marketing bible in the twenty-first century.</span>

                    <span>I love anything related to guerrilla marketing. As a small business owner, with not much budget, I find tips and techniques from Jay's writing to work. I know there are many guerrilla books which is why I was glad to see him come out with Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days. That book works the same as the rest but offers plans to make it happen quicker. I recommend anything by Jay Levinson. </span>

                    <span>Contrary to what the name may imply to you, Guerrilla Marketing is not about taking advantage of customers in some unsuspected way, it's about deepening your understanding of your customer so you can serve them better. Guerilla marketing is not about mere sales, it's about maximizing profits by getting more "share" of your customers-not just market share. If you are ready to turn up your profits, while making the most of your customer relationships, you are ready for Guerrilla Marketing. If you'd like to stop "closing" sales, and start "opening" relationships that lead to friendships and profits, you are ready for Guerrilla marketing! 
<br />
<br />"An ordinary marketer sells to markets. A Guerrilla Marketer sells to individuals" - Jay Conrad Levinson
<br />
<br />Jay really removes the mystery of marketing and makes it practical to the small business leader. He even shows you how to build relationships with other companies, working with them as "fusion partners". Imagine how you can cooperate with other businesses instead of competing with them to maximize your profits.
<br />
<br />Guerrilla marketing is the kind of marketing you do when you don't have a lot of money. Guerrilla marketing exchanges the power of the dollar, with the power of time, energy and imagination. If you are a small business, and you don't have a lot of money to spend on marketing, you'll like what you learn from Guerilla marketing!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Levinson's "Guerrilla Marketing" provides the reader with uncommon leverage, giving him the ability swing with the big guys at a fraction of the cost but equal value.  The original "pop-up" ad strategy of hitting your target market at all opportunities smacks of an underdog trying to get his footing in a highly competitive and increasingly over-marketed world.  His strategies make sense, are affordable, and provide measurable results that allow you to personally maintain control of the marketing projects you launch.  Think of this book as a desktop marketing reference offering a multitude of executable strategies to succeed.  Well done, a victory for the entrepreneur!</span>

As a small business owner, www.resources-results.com site, I found this book to be helpful in providing ideas for inexpensive ways to market.  The resource section is great.  I give this book as a door prize when I speak at organizations because it has been so well received by my clients.  Worth the time investment to read it and experiment with the suggestions.</span>

The thing is, that author has written this book 20 years ago, but it has more to offer.  This book is definitely a real thing.  It is also good to suppliment this book with Michael Levine's books.</span>
