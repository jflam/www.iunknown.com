                    <span>My wife and I read "Start Late, Finish Rich."  We figured our latte factors, our expenses, our debt, our net worth, and so on.  We worked out a plan.  Then I spent ten bucks on this workbook and discovered we'd already done everything in it.
<br />
<br />If you've got the original book, you don't need to waste your money on this.</span>

                    <span>If you've read (or are reading) "Start Late, Finish Rich" or any of Bach's other books on personal finance, remember your Latte Factor and avoid buying this workbook.  Everything you need to know is in his books.  You can figure everything out with your own paper and pencil.  
<br />
<br />If you're planning to buy "Start Late, Finish Rich," please read my review of it first and save yourself a lot of grief!</span>

                    <span>I have read a lot of money books and this book by far was the most helpful, easy, current personal finance book I have read. It is interactive and makes you write down your financial details in depth so you can really see what is your financial situation and apply the techniques given by David Bach. 
<br />It also gives a new perspective of what your goals and values are and how you should plan your finances to acheive your goals and BE the person you want to be.
<br />It is very thorough and gives REAL specific information eg. myfico.com was so helpful, numbers and websites of investment companies etc.
<br />It allows for people with all types of goals and incomes to improve thier financial knowledge and situation in thier own terms.
<br />I have also read automatic millionare which was good too but this interative workbook will give you a kick in the pants to actually make you change the way you deal with your money. Writing it down makes all the difference. </span>

                    <span>This book will educate you from ignorance to near-expert levels by simply following along with the step-by-step sytem outlined so simple in its pages.  It is every bit as powerful and effective for its subject-matter as Tom Leonardi's "Secrets of Sensual Lovemaking" and Clint Arthur's video guide "New Sex Now".  I would highly recommend that readers get this book if they are serious about mastering their personal finances, and get the other two if they are desiring improvement in their personal relationship with a loved-one.  These are all very great products which are e-z to use, simple to learn, and very effective.</span>
