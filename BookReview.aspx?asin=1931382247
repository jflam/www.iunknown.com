                    <span>First of all, Going Long is not a rehash of Triathlete's Training Bible. TTB gives you everything you need to prepare yourself physically to get to the starting line. Going Long gives you what you need to get to the finish line.<P>The book addresses psychological and emotional issues during races, nutrition issues specific to ironman racing, not ironman training, as TTB does, and provides a lot of other useful information, such as race strategies.<P>Compared to the other offerings available, this is one of the few that provides long distance racers the wisdom and experience of the author's years racing, and can be put to immediate use.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>At first a lot of the information in this book seemed to be a rehash of "The Triathlete's Training Bible" as stated in my original review. But after reading the book carefully and really pondering what the authors have to say, there does appear to be a lot dedicated toward the art of completing an ironman triathlon. In all fiarness, I must change my review. And if some of the information has been printed in "The Triathlete's Training Bible," at least in this book it is all arranged with one purpose--to finish a full ironman. <P>First, I must applaud the authors for their inclusion in the introduction. They admit that anyone can finish an Ironman triathlon if they have one thing: will. The down-to-earth tone permiates throughout the entire book. <P>There are excellent lists for pacing on the bike, mental condition, getting the most from nutrition and the common sense notion that endurance on the bike leg is the most important portion of a successful ironman seems so simple that one does need to constantly remind oneself about it. <P>Too often triathletes train, train, train, and then train some more. I get sick of hearing about macho-style workouts, and triathlon is just one portion of my life. If you work, have a family, practice toher hobbies, actually give yourself to others, and don't spend every dime you make on triathlon, the philosophies in this book will suit your lifestyle. The authors make a very convincing argument for having three major endurance workouts a week--75 to 100 minutes for the swim, 5 to 6 hours on the bike, and 90 to 150 minutes for the run. Instead of the megablock weekend torture fests that most triathletes brag about, they suggest doing runs in the middle of the week, and the bike on the weekends. All other workouts are secondary to these three. They also suggest that if you cannot find a purpose to a workout, simply leave it out and get more sleep. <BR> <BR>If you are preparing to embark on your first ironman or if you are a repeat customer, buy the book. 20 dollars now, might save you hours of wasted training time and minutes (if not hours), and personal suffering in your big race.</span>

                    <span>I've been in search of the right Ironman training book for a while. Most regular tri books devote little time to IM training, and others are so complicated they're intimidating (The Triathlete's Training Bible has great information, but I find it really complex.) This gets it right. If you're a nerd like me who likes to understand the logic behind a training program, you can get it here. You can also skim for tips or workouts if you just want to know what to do and when. Especially great is the nutrition section -- Gordo has some very logical, no-hype tips that really work.</span>
