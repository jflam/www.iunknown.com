                    <span>The problem with C# is that it is a product created by Microsoft solely for Microsoft's programming environment (Visual Studio .Net and SQL Server 2005) and hence is really of no use to anyone who is interested in LEARNING the FUNDAMENTALS of programming. C# programming can really ONLY take place in a Visual Studio .Net IDE and thus - unlike platform and IDE independent Java, C++, and C - has not been adopted by the academic community. College textbooks on programming tend to focus (almost exclusively) on Java, C, and C++. Please see any textbook by Walter Savitch or Cay Horstmann to learn the fundamentals of programming. As someone with basic programming skills you would then be ready for this book. But this is not a book to learn how to program. That being said this is an excellent introduction to the Visual Studio .Net IDE.        </span>

                    <span>This book is a great introduction to the C# language.  The only drawback is that you need Visual Studio.NET to be able to complete the exercises; but then again, C# is an invention of Microsoft si it is understandable.
<br />Some reviewers have expressed concern for it not being for beginners.  Be aware that the object oriented model of programming has been an integral part of every language since the invention of C++ in the 1980's.  If you are interested in non-OOP languages you can try C.  If you like to understand a little more about OOP before starting this book grab Beggining C# Objects as an intro both to the language and the method.</span>

                    <span>It has been a number of years since I touched a programming language, and none of my experience was in Object Oriented stuff.  This book has been patently unhelpful.  I'm not sure who the audience is - It does not provide much in the way of explanation as to how the architecture works - it just lays it out.  It is near useless for a beginner.  On the other hand, an experienced programmer is likely to get bored with the "Open this code and change this line" approach.  Too bad.  This could have been a good book.  Unfortunately, I don't know if there are any good alternatives if C# is your first language.</span>

                    <span>Granted, it probably helps if you're migrating from another language (like I was - from VB), but it's an excellent text which gives you plenty of background & extra information, then takes you into step-by-step exercises to reinforce what you just read. This methodology really worked for me, and I highly recommend this book. Initially, I was concerned that it was going to be literally just step-by-step instructions on how to use C# and Visual Studio .NET, but the information between the exercises, plus additional notes and best practices really helped me out with learning the language and some potential gotchas.</span>

                    <span>The book strongly relied on C# projects supplied with the included CD.  The teach method is to have you open a project and add or change a line or two of code in order to illustrate a concept.  If the subject matter were of a less complicated nature (programming), I'd almost say this book was for young children learning C#.  At some point, I just decided to skip the examples and just focus on the text until I finally got tired of the book altogether.  I also have another .NET Step By Step book and I see that this learning method is common with the entire series.</span>
