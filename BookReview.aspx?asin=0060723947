                <span id="Label1">Debbie Ford's straightforward, heartfelt style makes an old-fashioned idea seem fresh in <I>The Best Year of Your Life</I>. Her concept of "dream it, plan it, live it" is a detailed version of advice we've all heard about the need for clear plans, firm action and a refusal to be sidetracked--but with her gentle voice and step-by-step suggestions, the message comes across in a new way. In particular, her advice on creating mental snapshots of specific memories provides an excellent new technique for the ages-old concept of living in the moment.  <P> Each of the three short sections include writing activities to help track your own process and short, regular affirmations that, if made part of a daily routine, can assist you in staying the course you plan for yourself. She demands plenty of honesty with yourself, and refuses to allow excuses any room on a regular basis. The result is a refreshing mix of support and toughness that lets you set your own pace as you work to map out your life goals and  aim towards acting with what Ford describes as "conscious intent".  <P> A number of stories from her own life and clients are included, and provide inspiration for readers at different stages. The examples cover a wide range, from losing a few pounds and keeping it off to making explosive changes in a relationship or career, and the resource guide that finishes the book is a welcome accompaniment if you're looking for more details on a specific technique references in one of the stories. <I>--Jill Lightner</I></span>

Using a combination of life coaching, transformational questions, and examples of a life lived from intent ... Ford offers an action path to take ownership of your life. The book also contains a directory of resources to begin supporting you towards the best year of your life and beyond!</span>

                    <span>Before buying this book, I noticed that there were substantially more reviews submitted by women than men.  I would like to note, however, that this book has excellent insights for both sexes and would make a great gift.  Although it stands to reason that the basic principles should be universal, some self help books have a decidedly sexist slant.  Anyway, I enjoyed this book immensely.  The chapters were brief and interesting.  After finishing the book, I was able to go back to the end of each chapter for the basic building blocks necessary to start the best year of my life.  The steps aren't overwhelming or complicated, but they make good sense.</span>

                    <span>I find that Debbie Ford and I always seem to be writing or speaking about the same current vibrational energy.  For instance, a few years ago, when clients were carefully delving into their individual shadow sides in a solid attempt to own and integrate them, it was reassuring to be able to recommend her very accessible books The Secret of the Shadow and The Dark Side of the Light Chasers.  And, when counselling couples were open to exploring the silver lining in their dissolving union, it was a great comfort to be able to refer them to Debbie Ford's Spiritual Divorce.
<br />
<br />These days, I often find myself working with clients who haven't yet stepped into a whole life but are instead waiting, hoping and watching. They may have dreams but they have a difficult time manifesting them into reality. I often tell them that the opposite of waiting is creating and Debbie Ford's latest book carries the same philosophy.  The Best Year of Your Life: Dream it, Plan it, Live it provides the reader with a proven and practical plan of action for creating that life here and now.  It does so with wise guidance and teachings, positive stories and an abundance of questions and exercises - which really help to get the ball rolling! I'll be recommending The Best Year of Your Life for a while now.

                    </div>
                    <span>First, the bad: Debbie Ford is not the best (the most eloquent, the most deep and intellectual, etc.) writer. I suppose some people like the down-to-earthness of the language, I personally found it simplistic. Additionally, the book could use a bit more proofreading. 
<br />
<br />I could also do without the references to "God".
<br />
<br />One other thing: I do not recommend that you visit her website, or watch the video of her with Alanis Morissette. The fakeness is disturbing... This is someone who allows herself to talk about "impeccable integrity"??
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I am not letting my personal preferences disqualify the merit of her ideas (and the usefulness of this particular book). They are very motivational and *will* work if given the chance. One reviewer said (negatively) that this is pep talk in book form. Well, sometimes that's exactly what one needs.
<br />
<br />And to address another reviewer, who found a problem with the implication that there is something wrong with us that needs fixing - that is so missing the point. Where does she ever say that the self is NOT inherently good? And let's face it, if everything in your life was going just swell, you would not be considering getting this book. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I really enjoyed Ford's empowering message for motivating action!
<br /> 
<br />I want to "make over" my whole life, including the need to lose weight so for Christmas I asked for Debbie's book along with Deborah Low's, "Quest for Peace, Love and a 24-Inch Waist" and have discovered that both authors support the same thought processes--very motivating and inspirational--answering the question, "how can I stay committed to my dreams and goals?", with practical, inspiring advice.
<br /> 
<br />Since completing them both, I am able to see my life as a creative, ever-changing experience of which I am in complete control. If you need to make overall changes in your life, get Debbie's book but if you need to make peace with your body and lose weight, get Low's. If you can afford both, do it. </span>
