                <span id="Label1">"Throughout training I kept having the thought,<br>WELL, ALL THEY CAN DO IS KILL ME.<br>It seemed to help."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>SEALs are the world's toughest soldiers. Working in squads and platoons that make up SEAL teams, they are trained in everything from underwater demolition to high-altitude parachute drops. Now John Carl Roat, graduate of Class-29, one of the earliest SEAL training classes, has written the only book devoted to the training of that exclusive warrior force. With unflinching honesty, Roat describes the brutal six-month program that took young men well beyond the endurance limits even of gifted athletes and created warriors who could proudly take their places in the teams. It was a program so demanding that by the end of Hell Week, the third week of the course, the original class of one hundred and thirty-four physically fit young men had been sliced to sixty-two.<br><br>After retelling his own class's experience, Roat visits today's SEAL program and reveals how the program has changed over the last thirty-five years to include more classroom training and better and more sophisticated equipment-- without at all lowering the physical demands. SEAL training is still the best, and the toughest, training in the world.</span>

                    <span>In the words of Rush Limbaugh, "War is about killing people and breaking things." Personally, I think Rush Limbaugh is a jerk. And I assumed that John Carl Roat's book, CLASS-29: THE MAKING OF U.S. NAVY SEALS would be about training a bunch of 20-something jerks with inflated egos and terminal testosterone poisoning. I was wrong.<P>The candidates for SEAL training may well have started out that way, but by the time the few survivors had graduated (a minescule percentage of the original applicants) they were very different men indeed. <P>In an odd sort of way, Roat's CLASS-29 is a love story. We watch as the young trainees learn from their own experience that no matter how tough they think they are, they can only survive with help from the guy beside them. Soon this evolves into a sort of reliance, as they learn that they will only survive as a team; and then into genuine affection and respect. These kids come in all puffed up and clueless, and they come out as men who would lay down their lives for the good of the team, for the survival of their teammates. That they are superbly conditioned fighting machines is secondary - vitally important, but secondary none the less. Now that macho attitude has a vital core of respect and integrity.<P>It's a wonderful story. Roat spins a good yarn. The physical challenge of the training will make your hair stand on end. That these guys were able to joke in the midst of it is a tribute to their resiliance. That they came out of it imbued with absolute respect for another as well as love of country is a tribute to the training.</span>

                    <span>I've read other books by authors that either are SEALS or studied them. They seem to either be the autobiographical sort or the "we went there an blew this up". Mr Roat's account falls into the former category but it's unique in that it centers on one of the things that sets SEALs apart from the rest of the Special Operations Community, their training. This book offers the opportunity for the reader to understand part of the mechanism that makes a SEAL what he is. An outstanding book that is a great read.</span>
