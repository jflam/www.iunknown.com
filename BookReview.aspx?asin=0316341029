                    <span>Pete Hamill's name should be familiar to everyone in the New York area: in addition to rubbing shoulders and bending elbows with New York City's elite, his celebrated articles in the NY Post eventually landed him the highly coveted job of editor. In A Drinking Life, Hamill recounts the story of his life, with a particular emphasis on his childhood in Brooklyn. The son of a heavy-drinking, one-legged, Irish immigrant, Hamill lost his innocence early and found refuge drawing his own comic books and playing the street tough. This dichotomy seems to follow him throughout his life: on the one hand his roots have made him a brawler, a drinker, and a swaggering toughguy; on the other, him mother's influence helped to shape a sensitive young man who couldn't stand the site of blood on the face of his street fight victims and who longed for the life of a bohemian artist in Greenwich Village. In time, Hamill leaves his drawing and illustrating behind and begins to write.<P>Throughout all of this, there is much drinking; however, to call this a book about alcoholism would be inaccurate. This is a memoir of a life... one to which drinking is inextricably tethered, but not one that revolves around the art of drinking. Hamill began drinking early, and then as a reporter spent most of his time in bars, and his storytelling ability leaves no doubt that he was probably the center of attention in these bars more often than not. In the end he kicks the habit, for fear that he has been peforming his life rather than living it. He still visits his old drinking haunts, but now sits there quietly with a Coke in hand.<P>This memoir is well told, and Hamill sees himself with a very clear eye. His voice is unarguably that of a reporter: there is very little fanfare or elaborate language, and the story of his life is always moving. Fortunately for the reader, it is an eventful life, filled with street fights in Brooklyn, mischief at camp, passionate sex with mysterious women, gunshots and jail in Mexico, and much more. The memoir genre is growing tired lately, but this is one of the books that set the craze off, and it is easy to see why.</span>

                    <span>Pete Hamill is a New York Treasure. Hamill grew up in blue collar Brooklyn in the 40s and 50s in a working class "dysfunctional" famlly. His father had lost a leg during a soccer match in distant Belfast prior to his immigration to the United States, His hardworking, wise and wonderful mother raised a large family while remaining faithful for a drinking husband who was a heavy drinker by night and a low paid employee at many jobs during the day.<BR> Hamill takes us with us on his boyhood as he dreams of becoming a cartoonist. From the streets of Brooklyn where stickball reigned to incarceration in a Mexican jail the life tale woven by Hamill has many unexpected twists and turns. Despite his many faults Hamill has succeeded as a famed newspaper columnist and novelist. His book is easy reading and better than the much more heralded works by Frank McCourt. <BR> The language used by Hamill is rough, often scatological and may be offensive to genteel readers. However I found it well written and engaging. The book is worth a read by anyone interested in Irish American culture, newspaper life or the journey of a man from poverty to prominence.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Hamill has written a book about the drinking life which doesn't mention drinking. Nowhere does he talk about the experience of drinking, why he liked drinking, or any of the other issues central to a drinker's life. I'm a non-drinking alcoholic, and I find it hard from the evidence provided in this book to conclude that Mr. Hamill ever drank at all.<P>I suppose the answer is probably that Mr. Hamill, in order to remain sober, has repressed all that. Well, more power to him. When you know what alcoholism is like then you want every other non-drinking alcoholic to use whatever means possible to stay sober. However, what we end up with is a highly intellectualized account of Mr. Hamill's drinking life which omits the crucial factors and ends up substituting for them cheap shots at his father.</span>

                    <span>Quite honestly, I expected much more from this book, but was quickly disappointed. Despite the advice found in these reviews, you can find much better books to transport you into the old days of the New York streets. If you want a real memoir to read, one that tells the true tragic story of an Irish boys life with an alcoholic father, stick to Frank McCourt's "Angela's Ashes." It's written better, has much more feeling, and content.<P>Hamill whines, and complains about his life, and it's apparent that he is telling the story in a pity party circle. After reading the book, it's clear that he should just get over it, because his life isn't, and wasn't bad at all. Even his drinking problem pales in comparison to any NYC bar fly.<P>Stick to Hamill's fiction.</span>

                    <span>A highly rewarding read is what this book offers. One of the reasons I enjoy reading of another's life is to see the twists and turns that occur in the course of events. Most of the time (never always) the route is circuitous before a life's occupation is finally realized. In this case Pete Hamill is talented from childhood due to a creative brain and the ability to draw. This lead to many many adventures and the final destination of author. What a trip! Everything is well written and his amours are something to behold. I coudl not put this book down and read it quickly.</span>
