                <span id="Label1">Now, let the record show that Amazon.com is not, in fact, for dummies. It's good to see that <I>Amazon.com for Dummies</I> has finally arrived on our virtual shelves. This book will introduce even experienced Amazon.com customers to some of the less obvious features of the online emporium, such as corporate accounts, travel services, and the super-fun Friends & Favorites area. Read and learn from Mara Friedman how Amazon.com can provide you with information and (through zShops and the Associates program) make you money. <p>  Friedman briefly covers Amazon's collection of Web Services, which are utilities available to programmers who want to embed Amazon.com functionality (like book searches and popularity monitoring) in their own applications. What's here is clear and stylish (and sometimes funny), and will certainly make you aware of features you don't know about yet. Amazon.com is unusual as a business in that it rewards exploration and study. This book acts as your guide through the electronic aisles. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to locate and buy the things you want. How to advertise and sell the things you have. How to meet people and have fun on Amazon.com.</span>

But, if you are somewhat experienced and seeking deep and substantive information, this is of little help.  The illustrations may require a magnifying glass.   The bottom line: this is pretty superficial, and certainly appropriately titled.</span>

                    <span>My friend sent this book to me because they know how much I order from amazon - last count it was over 1400 items in a little over two years.  I send gifts around the world from amazon, love their gift certificates, am an amazon associate for my website.  So they thought it was a cute gift.  The book is very well done, and tells you all about the ins and out of many of the amazon features, but....all this information is already here on the amazon website - FREE.<p>Why would someone pay for a book that is slightly, ripping off amazon's own words?  Oh, well, as the commercial review said, they have arrived...</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as a gift for my grandma because she wants to do more online than email and read her newspaper, but when she went to Amazon.com the first time she had an anxiety attack and needed me to come over to help her. I don't have time to deal with this stuff, so I bought her the book. <p>But before I drove it over to her house I took a quick look. I must say, what I didn't know about Amazon was a lot. I do a lot of checking out reviews for products before I buy them and take a look at favorites lists (which I think is called listmania) and I thought that was all there was to it.  The book, though, goes into the whole selling side of Amazon. It talks about Zshops, auctions and Advantage. The coolest thing, though, that I found in the book was this thing called Associates which is basically a referral program. You link products from your site and Amazon pays you a percentage of sales. There's a blurb in there about a gift site that doesn't sell anything but just provides info and recommendations and stuff and links from these products to Amazon. This site makes approximately $30,000 dollars a month in referral payments from Amazon. This got my wife and I scheming on how we could get in on this. I have web development skills. I can do this. Maybe then I can quit my day job.<p>A cool book all around.</span>
