                    <span>This is the first book on eBay selling that you should read. The book has a nice layout that makes it easy to read. More than any other book I read, this book makes the entire process seem easy. It contains pretty much everything you need to know about selling on eBay.
<br />
<br />After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:
<br />---Beginner with eBay and computers---
<br />1. The Official eBay Bible
<br />
<br />---eBay Seller---
<br />1. Sell it on eBay
<br />2. eBay Hacks
<br />
<br />---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---
<br />1. eBay Strategies
<br />2. eBay Business the Smart Way</span>

                    <span>From Joe Catal, author of the book "Telesales Tips From The Trenches".  If you really want to make money on E-Bay, you must read this book.  It teaches you everything you need to know to be successful.  How to list your product, how to price it, what days of the week to list and not list, the rules of E-Bay, Handling disputes, Pictures, and just about anything you can imagine. Before you start any business venture you first have to read about it. Cut your learning curve by 80% with this book. I personally use it and it's working great!</span>

                    <span>This book is very easy to follow and simply covers the steps to selling in great detail, with good illustrations.  This is an excellent book for anyone who is uneasy with technology and wants to sell on eBay.  I think ebay for dummies does a better and more rounded job though.
<br />
<br />If you have any experience with eBay, or are looking for something that will help you maximize your returns, this book will be of no value (eBay secrets is a great alternative, how to do everything with an eBay Busibess is also good).
<br />
<br />I can see why this book has extremes of reviews, I didn't find it helpful. I borrowed it and I am glad I didn't pay for it.  That said, I work with computers day in day out.  Great book for people who don't.</span>

                    <span>As you read this you should be hearing Copelands "Fanfare for the Common   Man" since this publication was written for the common man. No jargon or computer buzz words, only plain English.  But more importantly the organization and layout was well planned and thoughtfully arranged to make it easy to follow and help is provided. For example, if a procedure is written to do certain steps on the eBay forms, a section of the exact eBay form is provided with lines leading from the text to the exact spot on the form. There are many small paragraphs for the specific function detailed with its own bold title so that it stands out on the page along with profuse illustrations and examples. <br>I suggest that the best first step is go to eBay as browser and examine how things are searched and displayed to get a feel of what eBay is all about. Then as you explore the intricacies of the steps leading up to a complete understanding of the selling requirements you will see the value of the linearly progression of the steps outlined.  <br>    It is very important to read the "READ ME FIRST" on Page ix. Do not skip the eBay basics They are the stepping stones to the deeper water of selling your items. Remember you are getting into the real world and it is populated with real people and if you make a misstep you cannot shut down and restart as you would a computer game.<br>     This book is a very valuable desktop reference but you should seriously read it before diving into the "selling" pool.</span>
