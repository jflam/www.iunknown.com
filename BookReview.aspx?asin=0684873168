                    <span>Two of my favorite contemporary writers have died unexpectedly in the past few months - the Mississippi writer Larry Brown and, more recently, Hunter S. Thompson, who committed suicide on Feb. 20. 
<br />
<br />Both were deaths that affected me greatly.  Usually when I hear of a notable passing, my reaction is, "Oh, no," but in both of these cases my first thought was to hope that the news wasn't true.  
<br />
<br />In the days following Thompson's death, I found myself going over some of his work - a documentary on the Criterion "Fear & Loathing" DVD, "The Great Shark Hunt" and "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas." 
<br />
<br />But the book that I found myself reading the most, and finding a kind of solace in, is this one: Thompson's collected letters from 1968-76.
<br />
<br />I used to work in a bookstore and there was always a question of where "Las Vegas" belonged.  It obviously wasn't fiction but it also couldn't be entirely true, and that's part of its genius.  But with "The Gonzo Letters, Volume II" there is no doubt that this is the genuine article, this is probably the closest look we'll get at what Thompson was like.  The sheer fact that he wrote and saved so many letters in the first place tells you a lot about the man himself.
<br />
<br />The correspondence here runs the gamut: letters to Oscar Acosta, Tom Wolfe, Charles Kuralt, William Kennedy, Jann Wenner, his brother, his mother, his broker and anybody he had a beef with.  The letters take us through his early ups and downs, his campaign for sheriff of Pitkin County and we not only get to follow him through the success of "Las Vegas," but also part of the process of him refining surrealism and colorful exaggeration into the style he'd use in that book. 
<br />
<br />And tucked away in the book, on page 181 is a letter that gave me a smile and a shiver of sadness as I read it with the news playing in the background on TV.  It's a May 19, 1969 letter to the Disabled American Veterans Association, in response to a solicitation for a donation.  Thompson opposed the then-raging war in Vietnam and was flabbergasted that the DAV would support it.  His reply is so fierce and funny and sad that it even stung me, a bystander, 35 years later. </span>

                    <span>...'course you'll have to work for it.  This is a massive book that in my opinion isn't meant to be plowed through, but rather enjoyed from time to time.  <p>A complition of his letters written over a decade or so (during his rise from a relatively obscure journalist/writer to cult hero) most every letter is interesting in one way or another, some are so funny that you'll be laughing about them for days.<p>HST's humor is unmatched in my opinion by any writer I've read.  This book is an extraordinarily private, very insightful, often hilarious glimpse into one of America's most interesting social figures.<p>Enjoy...</span>

                    <span>When I started to read this book - I must admit, I was disappointed. Having read everything that Hunter Thompson had written, I was a lttle under whelmed at first. However, I started to warm to the book as the years ran by. I could picture the events described in his letters - the Vegas book, the 72 campaign trail, fall of Viet Nam, the fall of Richard Nixon thru his eyes - it brought back my own memories of the events. In the end, the Gonzo style of prose took over and I found myself devouring the book in big chunks. For anyone who wants to remember the crazy, wild times of the late 60's - mid 70's, there isn't a better book.</span>

                    <span>I was a big fan of volume 1 of his letters- it was new and fresh and unlike anything I had read before. It seems as Hunter ages he sours rather than mellows, which for someone of his ilk isn't surprising. However it doesn't always make it for compelling reading either. He is so proud of his opinions, so righteous, with each letter trying to outdo the previous it gets like a one joke movie. <br>I also wish he would write what he knows and leave out the letters with personal opinions that aren't relevant, only there to wound and lift his pedestal a little higher. Specifically his anti-Christian tirade on page 55 in a letter to a reader of his remarkable "Hells Angels". Hunter explains that the Angels had no attitude toward Christianity, fine, he knows. However, not enough just to report, he puts down the pen and picks up his sword and writes, ". . . they (the Angels) have been spared the millstone of one of history's greatest lies." Really? Why? Couldn't leave it at just answering the question? Ego rules over reason again.<br>Read his first collection, its fresher and energetic. This collection is like visiting with a bitter old man who believes his opinions on everything are "breaking news".</span>

                    <span>This is the most thorough account of the up to date mind of the outlaw journalist Hunter S. Thompson. After searching around in the Journalism section for pure leisure, I spotted, removed from the shelf, and bought this book for no reason but pure attraction. I read the back of it and I liked the reviews -- I read some letter's and couldn't get myself to put it back on the shelf, just coudn't. This was no more than 7 months ago, and now I have all this mans books on my desk -- all I have read, and all I have praised.<br>The energy Thompson portrays in his letters gives most (if not all) of his readers strong adrenaline. He inspires, and therefore is a true poet. He never dissappoints or bores me, or anyone for that matter, when he has something to say. I find myself reading his words to wake up, to get new ideas (for my own writing), and to think as far out of "the box" as I can. He is the only human being that gets crazier and more energetic the older he gets. It's as if "he's trapped inside the body of a teenage girl," as said at the end of Kingdom of Fear. Very interesting....<br>I hope, as many people hope, that this is truly a TRILOGY of letters -- I'll get one hell-of-an adrenaline rush when I find out that the Vol. 3: Gonzo letters, will be in bookstores soon. Jesus! Even thinking about it makes me feel The Rush. <br>Those Sunday nights that I spend writing until the early morning hours of Monday morning ... waiting patiently for the new Hey Rube column on ESPN -- what would life be worth without passion, entertainment, and joy. Some people refer to it as "Hell," ...and that's probably as accurate as it can be without irrelevant connotations being risen. <br>I recomend this book to any Thompson fan, literary junkie, and for those people who need a good laugh to keep sanity in check.</span>
