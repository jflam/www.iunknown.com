                    <span>Disclaimer: I am a Red Sox fan.  If you are a Cards fan, well, you probably won't want to buy this anyway.
<br />
<br />This DVD is enjoyable, but I personally found the NESN video to be superior.  The main difference is that the MLB version is a little more sanitized than the NESN one.  For example, except for a very brief clip that's used in a transition, the MLB DVD makes no mention of The Slap by A-Rod.  I interpret this as MLB not wanting to put one of their more marketable players in a bad light (even when he richly deserves it).  The NESN video, on the other hand, does not hesitate to document this critical moment.
<br />
<br />Also, this video has a bit less material about the ALCS than the NESN video.  But even the latter is too brief- that series deserves it's own DVD; I aged a good 5-10 years over the course of those 7 games.
<br />
<br />In sum, the NESN DVD (Faith Rewarded - The Historic Season of the 2004 Boston Red Sox) is a bit better than this one, but if you're a Red Sox fan, you'll want both.</span>

                    <span>If your Red Sox fan on planet Earth.  I have a message for you buy this DVD it is just a must-have.
<br />
<br />For my point of view.  I enjoy faith rewarded the NESN DVD more whereas my father enjoyed this one more.  So you have to buy them both.  This ones naration is done by Denis Leary, which I like a little better than the faith rewarded video, but it talks a lot about the curse of the Bambino.  I mean tons whereas faith rewarded has none (okay one comment)
<br />
<br />So keep this in mind and enjoy the ride!
<br />Peace Out</span>

                    <span>As a die-hard lifetime (and long suffering) Red Sox fan, I thought this 2004 World Series DVD was well done and a great addtion to any Red Sox fan's DVD library.  
<br />
<br />My expectations for the DVD certainly weren't very high - I wasn't immediately impressed with MLB using Denis Leary as the narrator - but I have to admit that Leary does a good job in the film.  The pace is very good and more time is spent on the memorable American League Championship Series than I had expected, although even more time should have been spent on the Red Sox' historic victory over the Evil Empire.  God Bless 'em.
<br />
<br />The best part of the DVD for me were the extras. Included are the ALCS Game 4 Walk Off Home Run by David Ortiz, as well as his RBI to win ALCS Game 5.  I've rerun these two hits over and over this winter -- it just warms the heart.  Also included are the last outs of the ALCS and World Series as well as the post-game celebrations.
<br />
<br />The interviews with Red Sox legends Carlton Fisk, Dwight Evans and Fred Lynn were terrific and added a real sense of history to the Red Sox miracle World Series' victory.
<br />
<br />All in all, MLB did a good job on this DVD. Red Sox fans will love it.</span>

                    <span>Though MLB is not known for their film production like the NFL is, this DVD was done well. A little to much "curse" talk, but a great reveiw of a long waited for season.
<br />
<br />Every Red Sox fan must have this along with Faith Rewarded.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a Red Sox fan, I ate up just about every recapping of the season that was available, and saved this DVD as a special Christmas treat. I've seen virtually all of the "Official" Major League Baseball Productions (tm) videos since the production was taken over by organized baseball, and most of the pre-historical documentaries about the World Series of years past that have been repackaged in VHS and DVD as being the 'official' histories, and I will say that there's been a steady improvement in the production values and storytelling.
<br />
<br />However, within the limits of the storyline that a rather mundane four-game sweep can provide -- and I say this as an ardent Red Sox line -- there was a weirdly parallel-universe feel to how the story was retold in this video. While this was an entertaining and well put-together video, it seemed to be lacking a certain attention to the story line, not even to say selectively editing the history to the point where I had to go back to my scorecards to verify that they had indeed left out many important moments.
<br />
<br />In the past, the official World Series videos have usually focussed on a parallel structure, showing how each World Series participant reached the big dance through the playoffs. This year, not that Cardinals fans are going to want to be remembering this series much, they just jettisoned much of what went on in the NL to focus almost exclusively on the journey of the winners. There's an obvious commercial reason for this: the Red Sox fans, desperate for their championship, like I, will eat this up, and that's the primary market for the DVD. Yet that also hurts the story line: the Cardinals were the best team in baseball and overcame the Astros in an incredible NLCS, and perhaps it would have made more of the inherent drama of being a Red Sox fan and knowing, just knowing, your team was going to find a way to choke to emphasize the Cardinals' extreme talents. There are many minor details along these lines -- such as, as one reviewer has noted, the failure to even show the controversial A-Rod interference call or the important role that reversed calls made in the LCS, or the injuries to the Cardinals which hurt them so badly in the World Series, or even the emotional role played by Ellis Burks, who wasn't even on the post-season roster yet was the personification for many fans of the perseverant old-school Red Sox. I don't want to be overly extreme, but there's a faintly Stalinist air to the 'Official History' when it skips so many interesting details.
<br />
<br />I am not a Dennis Leary fan, but honestly the Leary narration didn't bother me much. The '2004 World Series' shares a lot of footage with the NESN-produced DVD 'Faith Rewarded' (which also has its strengths and flaws), and overall the narrative script of this DVD, while focussing much on the less than dramatic World Series, was of much higher quality than the NESN video. 
<br />
<br />Oddly, this DVD ends with the inferior version of 'Tessie' by the Dropkick Murphys, in the "play it too loud too long" school of overhyped stadium music blaring, while the NESN video eschews the local boys for ending with the Standells' "Dirty Water". I'll wait for the perfect video of the 2004 Red Sox triumph to come out, because it's not either one of these two films -- maybe they'll use 'Sweet Caroline' to end that as yet unproduced documentary.
<br />
<br />The extras on this DVD focus on highlights of the games and formal interviews; the extras on the NESN 'Faith Rewarded' video focus a bit more on things Red Sox fans will probably find more delightful, such as a montage (without narration) of the victory parade-rolling rally and an odd segment of David Ortiz cooking that seems to have been left out of some local TV show. That, in essence, is the way the two videos stand in contrast: this video focusses more on the MLB Property, the World Series, and is a selective history of that series using the season as a minor prologue, while the NESN video is a somewhat more poorly-produced yet down-homey review of the entire season that Red Sox fans may find more to their taste. As odd as it is to say this, both are essential purchases for the Red Sox fan and perhaps take it or leave it for those outside the nation due to their inherent flaws.</span>
