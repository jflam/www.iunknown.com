                    <span>"Blind Spot" is an interview with Traudl Junge who, as a young woman, worked as one of Adolph Hitler's secretaries, living alongside Hitler and other prominent members of the 3rd Reich between 1942 and 1945. Before Frau Junge died, at the age of 81, she gave this interview to filmmakers André Heller and Othmar Schmiderer in which she recounts her experiences with and her impressions of Adolph Hitler and the last days of the Reich. Frau Junge (née Humps) was entirely unsophisticated in political matters and an aspiring dancer when she took a job as a secretary in the Chancellery in Berlin. At her well-connected brother-in-law's urging, and in spite of her initial disinterest, she applied for and got a better position taking dictation for the Führer himself. Hitler was kindly and protective toward her, and she liked him. Her close proximity to him gave her firsthand knowledge of Hitler's health, his ideals, his private manners and personal habits, his paranoia, and the attempts on his life, which she describes as best she can in "Blind Spot". Perhaps understandably, Frau Junge had considered her position close to the Führer and his generals as an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the War and of Nazi policies, as she would be so near their source. Not until later did she realize that, being privy to Hitler's inner circle, she was actually in a "blind spot", sheltered more than anyone from what was going on in Germany. Frau Junge's description of the activity within the Chancellory in Berlin during the last few weeks of the War constitutes at least half of the film. Her account of the bizarre events of April 1945 is truly gripping. The audience can sense the panic and hopelessness that permeated the Chancellory as the Nazi empire came crumbling down. Frau Junge's description of the harrowing political and emotional roller-coaster that impending defeat set in motion is striking.<P>Blind Spot" is not a good film cinematographically. It consists only of interview footage, apparently taken in a living room or den, with an occasional glimpse of Frau Junge watching her own interview, which is awkward. But the film's content is revealing and provocative, a must-see for any student of World War II or for anyone curious to understand the character of Adolph Hitler. Traudl Junge's attitude toward her own role in the Nazi regime raises an interesting question. Frau Junge was not a member of the Nazi party, nor did she do anything to harm anyone. She took dictation. After the war, she felt no guilt about working for Adolph Hitler, and no one seemed to hold it against her. It wasn't until much later, when she realized that other young Germans had not all been so ignorant of Nazi policies and that many had died trying to fight them, that Frau Junge began to feel guilty for what she had not known and eventually fell into a serious depression. At the age of 81, she still seems preoccupied by feelings of guilt for having liked a man who caused so much suffering. This begs the question: To what degree are individuals responsible for the consequences of their ignorance and/or stupidity? In this Information Age, are we all obligated to understand the things we do and say, particularly if those things affect others? Are we to be condemned for the consequences of our ignorance if they are bad? If the answer is "yes", I fear that all of humanity would be damned. Perhaps the answer is, "It depends." Traudl Junge is no longer as naive as she was as Hitler's secretary. In "Blind Spot" she articulates real understanding that she has gained of how and why Adolph Hitler "manipulated the conscience" of an entire nation. Her insights are important and interesting. But I found the questions of guilt and ignorance that her experience raises to be the most relevant and provocative aspect of her story. In German with a choice of English, French, or Spanish subtitles. There are no bonus features on the DVD.</span>

                    <span>"The longer I live, the more I feel this burden, this guilt because I worked for a man and I actually liked him, but he caused such terrible suffering," observed 81 year old Traudl Junge, secretary to Adolf Hitler from 1942-1945. In 2002, after almost 60 years of silence Junge reflected on her past in a riveting 90 minute documentary.<P>Othmar Schmiderer, a respected film maker and noted social justice advocate, does himself a disservice with obvious and sometimes amateurish camera and sound work. The off camera questions and followup from interviewer Andre Heller suggest a skillful exchange with the subject that is never intrusive. There are no photos or vintage film footage of Hitler and his generals. Just a camera where a troubled soul grapples with the meaning of her past. <P>The film provides no revealing personal, historical, or political insights into Hitler or the era. Junge's testimony, however, is an important look into the human psyche. She acknowledges "I was so unaware and so thoughtless. I didn't notice or pay attention. That feeling has oppressed me more and more."<P>The viewer sees a person trying to find closure and, just as important, meaning to her life. Clearly, 3 years out of her 61 as an adult, consumed her. At points in the film she is shown viewing archival material. She becomes animated. Sighs. Pulls away. And goes back to reading pages in a book. Although an octogenarian, her sharp, crystal blue eyes were as penetrating as they were sullen. Her face had a deep melancholy. <P>"I wasn't a fervent Nazi," she said. "But nevertheless I find it hard to forgive myself for everything." Junge never had knowledge of battle plans or the horrific final solution. She took dictation on personal matters - notes to friends, congratulatory letters to dignitaries, and the like. <P>The secretary also spent the last days with Hitler and his core staff in the underground bunker in Berlin. Her description is dismal. Bombs, gunfire, and discussions of suicide among the staff before the Russians arrived. Dark humor dominated most conversations as Hitler became increasingly withdrawn and isolated.<P>Junge never lost her humanity. Innocence as a young woman prevented her from knowing about the reality of Hitler's reign. As a woman in the sunset of her life she reflected, "I should be angry with the child I was, that juvenile young girl . . . for failing to recognize what horrors that monster caused."<P>Her melancholy turned into deep depression after the war when she "was walking past the memorial in Franz Josef Street to Sophie Scholl, a young girl who opposed Hitler. I realized that she was the same age as me and that she was executed the same year I started working for Hitler." Junge concedes that her youth was no excuse for ignorance.<P>Days before the documentary premiered in Berlin Schmiderer and Heller called Jung to say goodbye. She laid dying in a hospital of lung cancer. Junge told them, "I'm starting to forgive myself." Forgiving ourselves and others is perhaps one of the greatest human challenges. Junge may have started to forgive herself, but would she, or anyone, ever forgive Hitler?</span>

                    <span>If this film did not show nearby your multiplex, don't be surprised. Maybe it showed for a week at an arthouse cinema near your major university. Or on a campus. Traudl Junge is not a household name in America, where probably 5 of 10 people can't name the Vice President.<P>This film is not politically correct, but any citizen should see this movie. It is in German with subtitles. However, imagine your grandmother explaining how, as a young girl, she ended up being the personal secretary to one of the most notorious criminals (Verbrecher) of all time, who usurped the conscience of a society (i.e., he told them he would take on all responsibility for the actions of his government)...and the rest is black history. Think of it as a film noir. It is not entertaining, it is a tragedy.<P>However, there is nothing different except for a few changes in wording from the 50-years-post reminiscences of just about any young person who takes a job without thinking of the consequences. They come back to haunt you. What kind of company did/do you work for? Or, like so many Americans, do you actually derive your income from the government, even if you aren't in the military.<P>I recommend watching this film with friends, and discussing it over a Beck's beer--which hasn't changed since it was standard cargo on Hitler's U-Boat Flotillas. Or, perhaps, at a dealership of one of the major businesses that benefitted directly from the carnage of the third Reich--still on the Fortune 100.<P>And then ask yourself, who bears the guilt? Very stimulating.</span>

                    <span>I am stunned by the fact that many who write reviews claim to be interested in the Third Reich, but have no idea of the current situation in the BRD (The current German government) If you are inquiring as to why Traudl Junge does not give a detailed description of her time spent as Hitler's secretary, or air more "dirt" take into consideration that as "free" as the current BRD would like the world to believe they are, that is hardly the case. At least when it comes to speaking of the Third Reich. That being said, one must also take into consideration that there have been countless attempts to get Traudl Junge improsoned for her job as Hitler's secretary. She has been tried, and found not guilty, thus her understanding of the consequences of airing too much knowledge of the Führer or inside information of the Reich, to avoid getting herself in hot water. It is quite unfortunate that due to the BRD people are afraid to tell inquiring minds more of what we want to know. <P>I think that Frau Junge is not as remorseful as she might want you to believe on camera, and that she does show a sense of pride in being appointed the position of Hitler's secretary, after all he was the most saught out after man in Germany at the time, not to mention one of the most powerful men in the world. I found this film to be be very interesting, and definitely worth watching. At some points I felt her answers to questions were coached, perhaps by leagal counsel, but what can I say, she is covering herself. <P>One more note worth mentioning, I must correct anyone who believes that people followed Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist party, simply because he had a way of mesmerizing an audience. The German people followed National Socialism because it restored a sense of pride in a people who have always been proud, but during the time were suffering the shame under the Treaty of Versailles. People were starving in the streets, unemployment was at an all time high, not to mention crime, and of course many Germans, especially those who served in the military in the First World War did not feel they had lost the war, but were stabbed in the back from the politicians at home. Put all of those together among other things, and you get a people desperate for a leader who is powerful, and who will rid the people of all of these problems.</span>

                    <span>we rented this video just recently,as i have taken a sudden interest in the unbelievable slice of history we call the third reich.the box of the cd boasted all the awards it's won,so we were dissapointed to find the whole thing done in videotape,which led me to think right away i wasnt going to see much of a movie,but perhaps a great documentary.but we sat and kept waiting for the real 'dirt"......some type of further insight into how a whole nation could be blinded and manipulated so well by a mere mortal man(perhaps subhuman being a better word)....one thing i learned......this is apparently,an intelligent woman,capable of landing an important government position,and what we get from her is a series of trivial remarks with a few little tidbits indicating perhaps she knows much more than she's willimg to discuss,so i learned what people will do for power,money and security.it's frightening to say the least,and as americans,we must realize we are not immune to having the wool pulled over our eyes for the lure of world power,plenty of oil,and a starbucks franchise in iraq.<BR>as a documenatary....also not very good.poor editing and almost zero camera work.i am reminded of geraldo's thwarted attempt at making a tv show out of capone's vault.3 stars for getting this woman on tape,but it was a bore.</span>
