                    <span>Over the years I have, for some reason, developed a interest in the idea of a life in seclusion.  I don't think I could ever actually do it since I am quite attached to life in the modern world.  But still, I sometimes think that getting away from it all would be worth giving everything up.
<br />
<br />Also, events over the past few years and the blurring of boundaries between religion and politics has lead me to do some reading on Christian writers who have a progressive (liberal) worldview.
<br />
<br />Naturally, these two interests lead me right to Thomas Merton.  The Seven Story Mountain is the first book of his that I have read and it has inspired me to read much more of his writings.  I am not a very religious person and sometimes have a hard time not rolling my eyes at his professions of faith and statements.  However, I know that everything he writes comes straight from his heart and that gives an emotional edge that allows readers like me to absorb it instead of skimming over it.
<br />
<br />Sometime in the next couple of years, after I have read some of Merton's other writings, I am going to reread this book and I think it will have a much more profound impact on me.
<br />
<br />Highly Recommended</span>

                    <span>This is a timeless masterpiece from a man who always seems to speak to me in ways that mere words could not.  Father Merton takes the reader on a beautiful journey of faith and seeking God, ultimately leading to his ordination as a priest and the monastic life.  I have found myself going back to this book from time to time, always seeming to come away with something new.  This book has stood the test of time, as its words are as relative today as they were the day they were written.  Highly, highly recommended.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Merton's book offers refuge and sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of modern life. Like the monastery to which he fled as a young man, this book is an island of peace and serenity in a world that often seems geared to over-stimulate us and make us forget what's truly important in life.
<br />
<br />"The Seven Storey Mountain" describes Merton's life from birth to the beginning of his religious vocation as a Trappist monk. Along the way, the reader watches as Merton grows and develops, travelling across Europe, dabbling in Communism, educating himself at Oxford and, later, Columbia, seeking fame and fortune as a writer, and wondering at last if he might be called to the monastery.
<br />
<br />Merton's true gift is an ability to describe his life while also transcending it. He writes not to explain his life, but to explain what he's learned about all life, about our relationships with each other and with God, about how we strive for spiritual development and how we sometimes fall short.
<br />
<br />One major flaw with this book is its lack of frankness when dealing with Merton's college years. The book's vagueness about his decision to leave England and come to the U.S. leaves the reader wondering if Merton is making much ado about nothing. What many readers may not know is that Merton had gotten a girl pregnant and was told by his stepfather that he should leave the country and restart his education in the U.S. Years later, when writing the book, Merton had reportedly wanted to detail this episode of his life, but was overruled by members of his religious order. Because of this, the book suffers, and the uninformed reader loses some sense of the size of the mountains Merton climbed to reach his final destination.
<br />
<br />In the end, though, flaws and all, this is still an indispensable book. It often seems to be speaking directly to the reader, offering insights and wisdom that linger long after the final page is turned.</span>

                    <span>Part literary analysis, part theological speculation, and largely spiritual autobiography, this 467 page tome is a much easier read than one might initially expect.   There were times when, as a non-Catholic, I got bogged down in some of the particulars of the tradition, but much of the book has a universal appeal.  The Seven Storey Mountain tells of Merton's journey from agnosticism to Catholicism, from self-absorbed young man to contemplative monk.  The work is well enough written to have captured the imagination of countless readers, and it has even been translated into 20 languages.  The Protestant reader may be either annoyed or amused (depending on his personality) by Merton's jabs at Protestantism.  He does, however, have the magnanimity to frequently compliment Protestants for having "at least that much of religion."</span>

                    <span>A true classic in Christian literature.  The man was truly a saint and a sinner who knew his need of forgiveness.  His life was shaped by many early experiences and he shares them openly in this extremely well-crafted autobiography.  Deeply encouraging and inspiring, it left me wanting to read everything he ever wrote.  A passionate, sensitive, and powerful autobiography. </span>
