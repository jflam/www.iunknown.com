<h3 class="title">Scalable API's</h3>

<p><P><A href="http://www.simplegeek.com">Chris Anderson</A> <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/05.html#a160">wrote today about scalable API's</A>, and in particular about how MVC is not an abstraction that should be applied liberally across all types of applications. </P><br />
<P>I couldn't agree more. After spending a limited amount of time working with the Cocoa frameworks on OS X, one of the things that struck me was how much friction was involved in writing a simple event handler. MVC is used everywhere in Cocoa. While Interface Builder abstracts away a significant amount of the details in making this work (it creates an in-memory object graph that defines the View that&nbsp;it serializes to disk for you rather than generating code), you still have to manually do things like define your model and controller classes EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to build a UI. </P><br />
<P>The amount of friction involved in this process is substantial. It is nowhere near as simple as double clicking on a button in a traditional RAD-style dev tool and having your editor drop you into the Click event handler. </P><br />
<P>That said, the challenges involved in building a "scalable API" are considerably greater than "let's not do MVC". One of the things that I hated about the way classic Windows controls operated was the fact that they held a <EM>copy</EM> of the data that they owned, rather than delegating ownership of that data to some (and almost always more appropriate) application data structure. The last time I spent significant amounts of time writing windows client apps, I almost exclusively used the virtual list view and virtual tree view controls since they finally provided me with the flexibility (and performance) that I required in my app.</P><br />
<P>The other thing that also needs to be done in the client app dev space is to provide reasonable hooks to enable unit testing of user interfaces. I would love to see an external mechanism whereby I can drive the entire UI of my application from a test script. Currently, I manually build this layer in the software that I'm writing, but it would be really nice to see a unit-test centric windows client framework in the future.</P></p>

<p>Um.  Isn't "manually creating models" far easier than having populate and keep the ui component synchronized with your internal data structures?<br />
I find MVC more 'declarative'.  It makes things more scalable, and IMO, easier to work with.<br />
Microsoft (with windows forms) seems to be behind the times.</p>
