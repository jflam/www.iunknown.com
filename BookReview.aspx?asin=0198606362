                    <span>The "Concise Oxford Dictionary" is arguably the best dictionary in this price range. <P>The defintions are up-to-date, the text is easy to use with each entry in bold, and the physical size of the book is very easy to use. The number of defintions, well over 200,000, is more than adequate, and the thumb index makes it easy to find what you need.<P>I've looked at many dictionaries (and I own more than one) and I've found that in least some "current" Webster's versions that certain definitions are almost archaic. You won't have that problem with this book. <P>If you're looking for a general use dictionary that has as many definitions as possible, but doesn't weight ten pounds, this is about the best choice you'll find. It's almost perfect for both college students and for everyday use.<P>The only problem with this version is the quality of the paper which is rather thin. I highly recommend this dictionary, but I would be hesitant to give one as a gift to someone who I know is rough with their books. The pages feel as if they could tear quite easily. This is likely one of the reasons that the book is so compact and easy to use. So you have the trade off of compact size versus durability. If this is an issue I would recommend paying a little more for one of the heavier Oxford dictionaries.</span>

                    <span>I found this book quite interesting, although the lack of a plot and main characters left much to be desired. Compliments to the author for creating such a realistic and engaging atmosphere, but i feel more action was needed to really kickstart the book. Overall, a very good read and highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>I returned the Oxford English Reference Dictionary, and the Oxford Dictionary of English. Both are excellent reference books selling for the same price. The former has a noteworthy appendices. The latter is the most descriptive English dictionary (without an appendices) behind Oxford's world class 20 volume Dictionary of English.<P>The Concise Oxford English Dictionary Thumb Index Edition was half the price and weight. This less expensive version contained the words EEPROM, i-Mode, and off-gas. The Oxford Dictionary of English did not have the first two words. The Oxford English Reference Dictionary did not list the three words.<P>I needed a dictionary that would be no-nonsense, current on common words, and under $45CAN. With Chapter's September 2003 $10 discount coupon for purcases over $30, this was the dictionary to buy. And since I am Canadian residing in Canada, this dictionary contains the British spelling of words used in Canada.<P>The Random House-Webster English Dictionary rivalled the Oxford Dictionary of English and was the only dictionary sold at Chapter's to have the word lauan. Unfortunately, the Random House-Webster is an American style dictionary which normally would not be used in Canada.</span>

                    <span>This is a great dictionary for the intermediate literate. The definitions give precise senses the word is used; Each sense being exact and distinct of the rest. In other words, it's definitions are not simply reworded to many definitions. I would suggest this dictionary in assimilating the full concept of the word.</span>
