                    <span>Perhaps it was the high recommendation for this book that left me a little disappointed.  I have seen this book recommended in a number of software developer books (most notably perhaps, Code Complete 2E).  The author discusses possible obstacles (mental, cultural, etc.) to creativity, some of the psychology behind creativity, and some 'vehicles' to greater creativity.  All in all probably very worth reading, but the reading is dry, with the occasional exercise breaking the monotony slightly.  I highly recommend this book, until I can find a book that says the same thing in 25% of the space, which I think is possible.</span>

                    <span>This is mostly a list of why people can't create. The book provides few techniques to boost creativity. However, the blocking mechanisms are clearly explained. Identifying the problems is the path to a solution.... <br>I will look around to find books that describe some methodology to create more effectively.</span>

                    <span>According to my experiences and learnings of many expressions in books, my individual opinion is, that those expressions are depending very closely on what has been harnessed in their 'brain neurons' while that makes ones peception of what has been unfolded by the author's intelectual and perceptual recorded facts of experiences. The sensitivity of receiving information through 'objective' and 'subjective' dimensions are obviously supported when persons don't have negative stress that could interfere in the 'inner management of thoughts'. I'm a lecturer for the Indonesian territory of 'Psychorientology', since 20 years, named popular 'The Silva Mind Control Method'. I'm very convinced about what has been unfolded through his coursework 'Basic Lecture Series' and the 'Ultra Mind ESP'. It's a system that indeed changes behaviour and attitudes into high morality and ethics, as results of scientific research of nearly 56 years, that now a days are declining very fast in this world because of 'Stress' as the main reason which could ampel be solved by the lack of 'Mind Control'. If every human being, naturally uses the right and left brain hemispheres at a balanced way, the world would be a planit of peace and harmony throughout all the phases of human evolution. It's worse to try and not to critisize without having a thorough inside on what the exact meaning and results are of a certain system that has been developed through scientific research without any 'modifications' of other systems. This is my contribution of thoughts coming from a 'subconscious management'. Regards and Success.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps more for the layman than the professional scholar, this book can help you to see why you keep coming up short in finding answers to the recurrent problems that plague you.  I have bought at least ten copies since it's first publication because when I loan it out, I seldom get it back.</span>

                    <span>James Adams' classic book, Conceptual Blockbusting, is a definite read for people who want to expand and deepen their true creative thinking skills.  Since reading it many years ago I have re-read it often, then referenced it  and recommended it to others in general, workshop participants plus  students.  Managers will benefit greatly by reading and re-reading this  book to discover how they are squelching, killing or sideswiping creative  thinking in the people they are responsible for managing.  All others can  benefit by becoming more aware of the well-structured approach he has used  to depict the many varied forms of creative blocks Adams discovered during  his many years of teaching.  No this is not a book for those who already  think they are as creative as they can be, nor is any other book actually.</span>
