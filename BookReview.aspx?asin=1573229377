                <span id="Label1">Anger can be one of the most frustrating emotions, carrying us headlong away from ourselves and depositing us into separation and dismay. Vietnamese monk and world teacher Thich Nhat Hanh tackles this most difficult of emotions in <I>Anger</I>. A master at putting complex ideas into simple, colorful packages, Nhat Hanh tells us that, fundamentally, to be angry is to suffer, and that it is our responsibility to alleviate our own suffering. The way to do this is not to fight our emotions or to "let it all out" but to transform ourselves through mindfulness. Emphasizing our basic interdependence, he teaches us how to help others through deep listening and how to water the positive seeds in those around us while starving the negative seeds. Serious though lighthearted, <I>Anger</I> is a handbook not only for transforming anger but for living each moment beautifully. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>Written by a monk since the age of sixteen who has also written many others of poetry, fiction and Eastern philosophy for more than 30 years he has been in exile.
<br />
<br />In one moment of anger, lives can be ruined and spiritual development destroyed.  Fear is based on ignorance, and this lack of understanding is also a cause of anger.  If you learn not to fear this turmoil and suffering, you learn to embrace them with mindfulness (on which he has since written a book) and to transform them into something useful.  It is most important not to keep your anger and fears repressed.  Let it out (get it out of your system) but, whatever you do, don't take it out on others, especially your best friend.  Love is the key to happiness.
<br />
<br />To be happy is to suffer less, but true happiness must come from within.  Bitterness results from repressed anger, and the 'hurt' person complains and blames others for his problems.  When someone says or does something to make you angry, you suffer; thus, you may retaliate 'in kind' to make the other person suffer.  But he may try to find 'relief' by making you suffer more.  It becomes a vicious cycle.
<br />
<br />We live in a time of sophisticated means of communication.  Information can travel via computers to the other side of the planet almost instantaneously, but the family members cannot speak freely of their feelings.  If they can't restore communication, happiness will never be possible.
<br />
<br />He gives exercises and suggestions on how to succeed in this process.</span>

                    <span>Just one of the many useful bits of gentle advice in this gem. TNH says chickens are angry. Chickens should be angry, their lives are misery and their deaths are brutal and if you eat angry chickens, you in turn will become an angry human and do something awful, like torture chickens and KFC employees who mess up your order of deep fried tortured chicken pieces.
<br />
<br />Seriously, everything this gentle soul writes is truly inspiring and full of well earned wisdom. The chapter on Compassionate Communication alone is worth the price of the book.
<br />Buy it. Read it. Use it..and eat free-range, or you'll come back in your next life as a chicken.</span>

                    <span>When one is angry inside and at the world, and everyone in it, it is hard to see any good in anything, including yourself. Hanh explains that we shouldn't punish ourselves for having anger, but gain the knowledge of where it's place is within us. Getting rid of the anger is not what we must do...it is about being mindful and taking care of the anger so we can live peacefully. I was very moved by this book and I felt so much calmness within me and how I looked at things. Don't feel ashamed for having anger that is controlling your life, because you can get that control back and Hanh will be there to guide you.</span>

                    <span>I have not experienced and cannot imagine a better tool for increasing patience and compassion. It was truly revolutionary for me and I am forever grateful to Thich Nhat Hanh for his teaching.
<br />
<br />While at times it might seem simplistic and repetitive, there is a point to the method. The teachings are deep and have been applicable not only to my everyday, but to every moment and will be a sound foundation for the rest of my life.

                    <span>I liked this book better than the other 2 I'd read previously ("Thundering Silence" and "Creating True Peace"), but I'm still not all that impressed.  Yes, TNH seems very sincere and authentic, but he's also very hard over left wing (I prefer a more balanced approach to life), simplistic, Eastern (see the works of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, for example, to see how an Eastern master can adapt ancient Buddhist teachings to the West), and monastic.  Some of his techniques could be useful under certain circumstances, but certainly not as general principles.  His approach seems very Feeler (using Myers-Briggs or Jungian terminology) oriented (I'm in the middle between Thinker and Feeler so I don't particularly enjoy either extreme).  Frankly, I was dealing with Anger as a personal issue especially regarding the 3 poisons of Buddhism (anger, attachment, and ignorance).  This was one of 3 books and 1 video I experienced (including his "Creating True Peace").  I found the other 2 items far better: "Working with Anger" by Thubten Chodron and "Good Medicine" (the video) by Pema Chodron.  They have very simple, yet quite effective (and time tested) Buddhist techniques one can use.  They helped me tremendously.  I cannot, however, say the same for the 2 TNH books I read.  So, you can read this book and get something out of it, but it's not definitive, and there are far better sources and techniques IMHO.</span>
