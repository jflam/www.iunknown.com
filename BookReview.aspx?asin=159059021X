                    <span>I am a programmer, familiar with old fashion languages and having had some experience with ASP, SQL Server, Access.
<br />The book has some useful information and tips, shows where to start. However, it is only a set of quick tutorials and I had to order a solid beginner's book anyway.  
<br />I find the author's abundant humor very simplistic and annoying.  For example when he returns to button control this is what his readers get, "Okay, so you've seen this one before, but I'm feeling repetitive. Repetitive. Repetitive. What, not even a sympathy laugh? Sheesh.  That's the thanks you get. Anyway, it's a button.  You click it; it does stuff.  Whoop-de-doo."  Then there is list of 5 key properties, 2 key methods, 2 key events and one line of sample code.  No explanation provided for any of them.
<br />
<br />I don't know why this book got a lot of positive comments.</span>

                    <span>Moore uses a light, conversational writing style which occasionally borders on the downright silly, yet is sure to  assuage the fears of first-timers to programming, and/or those unfamiliar with Object-Oriented Programming.<p>Just the opposite of a dense and dull textbook...</span>

                    <span>The author, while having an amusing style of prose which does wear on the reader at times, covers a wide range of topics in this book, so much so that rarely does it give you enough to feel like an adequate programmer in that area. Also, most of the time author say "do this" and rarely does he explain well the theory and design behind why you are doing it. I would have given it a slightly worse review, if not for the Tip/Tricks Section (chapter 8) which is an excellent chapter on how to do various tasks in ASP.NET and VB.NET. You will need another book(s) to explain ADO.NET, .NET, and the OOP aspects of it.</span>

                    <span>This was one of the first VB .NET books I bought. I thought i would come online to give it a review as it was so good. i thought perhaps i would help it's sales... but there are so many already!! The only extra thing i can say is that this book rules, it's great, and it's fantastic to kick start your .net adventure. Well done!!</span>

                    <span>I took this book on holiday with me to Majorca.. it was fantastic to read a tutorial book without having to even be in front of the computer. Mr Moore teaches in a way that makes you read and want to learn more. If you're new, or are porting to .NET, this is the book you HAVE to buy!! (ps. it arrived next day for me)</span>
