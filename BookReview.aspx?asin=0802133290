                    <span>i read soft machine by WSB by recommendation of one of my best friends.  he said WSB and many of the other Beats were off the edge.  i watched the movie "Beat" as an amusing insight into a portion of WSB, after reading Soft Machine.  Soft Machine, and forgive me for being an ignorant blah-putz, is REALLY difficult to get into.  the first couple of chapters are nothing but random rants and raves.  it sounds like the man was going for drug cocktails and rectum-stretching in some south american country.  i just couldn't see the benefit to literature that WSB provides.  i know he's a good writer because everyone says he is, but i'm not seeing it.  to me, the emperor DOES NOT have any clothes on.  oh well, i guess i'll die ... ignorant ... never knowing the greatness of WSB.  <p>...</span>

                    <span>This is possibly my favorite, I remember a lot about it. Just as if not more so on the lines of Wild Boys, except those boys are replaced renegade military types who go haywire and destroy the civilized control towers and such with the ubiquitous words "Calling partisans of all nations-Shift linquals, vibrate tourists-Word falling, photo falling-break through in grey room!" Wonderful. Mostly stream-of-conciousness, including the immensely garbled and mind blowing (atleast to me) chapter "Trak!Trak!Trak!" (either that or Trek)...he just keeps going and going, but not like the Energizer Bunny becuase that peice of fluffy pink machinery is a commercialized 'soft machine' and Burroughs is its arch enemy. Wouldn't it just be marvelous if the 2 duked it out on some adulterated Japanese animation like Cowboy Bebob? Err. BREAK THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE...OF LITERATURE AND LUNACY! <p>Other particularly memorable scenes that stuck in my internal synapses include a chapter where a news reporter infiltrates backward Mayan codices (where a hollogram image of an old master controls the migrant workers) and penetrates the machine and punches the hollogram in the gut and screams out freedom and aw, it was beautiful. Also feast your eyes on voodoo doctors taking advantage of their drug induced patients, boys in the forgotten hills, traveling shifty, where am I going with this? Whatever, just read it, boys and girls.</span>

                    <span>When I first started reading this book not much of it made any sense. I just let it from whatever it had to feed in my right brain (visuals). The second step came on the chapter Public Agent where I kept with the imaging  and connected this imaging together so that it made some intellictual  sense.  From these experiences I found out that in this book Burroughs  communicates in a language that streams together the sound, image,word.   This book with its cut/up induces creativity and will also boost anybody's  vocabulary skills.  If you liked the cut/up used in Natural Born Killers  then you'll like this book,which Natural Born Killers was probably born  from.</span>

                    <span>I think the genius comes in when Burroughs takes the stories apart and scrambles them back together to make silly but surreptitiously truthful little sideswipes at reality.</span>

                    <span>A satyrical ride across boundless waves, an insane book that may be  difficult to read, but can also flow like a faucet once into the pages.  It  jumps and leaps like a frog on smack, but has more than a few laughs and  can produce some serious imaging that you may wish you never had.  A book  in the Burroughesque style of insanity.</span>
