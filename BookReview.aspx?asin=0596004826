                    <span>This book is basically the MAN pages included with Linux, and all versions of UNIX. But it's in a form that can be held and browsed through making it much more usable and convenient.</span>

                    <span>This is a great reference book.  In my opinion, THE Linux desktop reference.
<br />
<br />It is well written, concise, clear and complete.  If your budget is limited to one Linux reference, this is the one.</span>

                    <span>If you understand what "in a nutshell" means, then you shall be pleased with this book. It is not a tutorial, it is not a beginners' guide, it is not a theory book... it is a reference book, featuring entries that are succinct, to the point, sparse in places, but complete in breadth and indispensable for the serious Linux jockey. </span>

                    <span>I've used Unix on and off for over 20 years, and I've never gotten an appreciation of the on-line documentation. So when I decided to dabble with Linux, I went searching for a command reference. This is the one! All you need to know about the command line programs as well as additional chapters on the top window managers, editors, shells, resource control, boot managers, and other topics that seem to come up frequently. O'Reilly comes through again!</span>

                    <span>After spending a fair bit of time with FreeBSD  and needing some information regarding Linux installations I thought this book would be a good way to speed things along. Wrong. It's not that this book is too expensive, or poorly put together, but it's little more than a cursory overview of the Linux operating system and a listing of the commands to get things done with a terminal. But even to find the commands to do simple things such as renaming files, is too time consuming to be bothered with. Simply doing a Google for the stuff you want to know is much quicker and more comprehensive.<p>Whole chapters are committed to such stuff as Emacs and KDE. But, yet again, there are specific websites with  HTML help manuals for this, and more. <p>These Open Source books are pretty much a waste of paper, simply because, being Open Source, it's all available online, or in the manuals provided with the distros.</span>
