                <span id="Label1"><blockquote> <p> Our tendency is to be interested in something that is growing in the garden, not in the bare soil itself. But if you want to have a good harvest, the most important thing is to make the soil rich and cultivate it well. </p> </blockquote> <p> In a beautiful companion volume to Shunryu Suzuki's first book, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, this is a collection of thirty-five lectures taken from the last three years of Suzuki's life that has been masterfully edited by Edward Espe Brown, bestselling author and one of Suzuki's students. </p> <p> In <i>Not Always So</i> Shunryu Suzuki voices Zen in everyday language, with humor and good-heartedness. While offering sustenance -- much like a mother or father lending a hand -- Suzuki encourages you to find your own way. Rather than emphasizing specific directions and techniques, his teaching encourages you to touch and know your true heart and to express yourself fully. </p> <p> Wise and inspirational, <i>Not Always So</i> is a wonderful gift for anyone seeking spiritual fulfillment and inner peace. </p></span>

                    <span>I just want to clarify something written in a previous review, that seems to suggest some sort of consistency between Suzuki roshi's teaching and Kapleau's. I personally think it is pretty important to bear in mind the vast ... in teaching style and in stated purpose between these two schools. When, a few years ago, I read Kapleau's book I was startled and disturbed by it. As a practitioner in a lineage similar to Suzuki's I felt Three Pillars of Zen was antithetical to what I had experienced in my zen practice. Just a word of warning for those who might think Kapleau's book is a complementary text to Suzuki's.</span>

                    <span>When you think of Zen Buddhism, chances are the first name that comes to mind for you may be Roshi Shunryu Suzuki. His bestselling book, "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind," has remained a monolith in the area of Zen literature for years, and rightly so. The title of this particular book captures the ongoing paradox of Suzuki's teaching style, stemming from his often used phrase, "It may be so, but it is not always so." What this means is that people so oftentimes cling to their own understanding to the point where they cannot flex or learn anymore. We might become experts without even knowing it, even experts on not being an expert. This is possible. Yet everything changes in our world, that includes even truth. In order to help this world as well as ourselves, we must be willing to bend some and let go of our linear thinking. <P>Life is a process of learning. But learning alone is simply not enough. There isn't a good practice or a bad practice, there is only practice. That means you, "vow to save all beings suffering everywhere." That's not good or bad. That's your job. Roshi Suzuki helps each and everyone of us step into the world that is eternally present and free from all opposites. Where everything we encounter is, "Just like this." Only that. Every action leads to understanding, so please don't separate anything; this is Roshi's most precious gem he has left behind for all of us. Buddhist life is just life. It's going to work, caring for the garden, and taking a walk. I do hope you'll buy this book so you may step into the world of practice as stated by Suzuki here, because it's the key to all of the happiness humanity can ever know. The happiness of no happiness. Hopefully you understand that point. As Korean master Seung Sahn would likewise state, "Only go straight." Enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>One of the most insightful books I've ever read. Even so, I didn't understand some of it. His teachings seem multidimensional, fluid, and sometimes difficult to pin down. His emphasis on the present everday life is also unique among the Zen books I've read. Example: "When you observe the precepts without trying to observe the precepts, that is true observation of the precepts." Others devote many pages to what Suzuki expresses so succinctly.</span>

                    <span>Although I could not fail to enjoy anything collected from the speeches and writings of Suzuki, this book was not as meaningful to me as the first book for which it is the sequel, Zen Mind, Beautiful Mind. It repeats itself more, but there is still much to be learned from it. It seems to contain more of Suzuki's humor than the first book, and has a casual feel as it is taken from his in-person lectures.</span>
