                <span id="Label1">Follow the people who follow the storms. Prepare to take a ride inside some of the most extreme weather conditions experienced on earth. Hurricanes, monsoons, and tornadoes are the stars of "Stormchasers" (38 min.), an exhilarating large-format film by MacGillivray Freeman Films. Weather is one of the most evolving and exciting areas of science, one that we experience every day. In "Stormchasers," we join storm-chasing meteorologists who track extreme weather conditions in order to understand how they form. Ever wonder "how did they do that?" "The Making of 'Stormchasers'" (29 min.), shot in High-Definition Video, takes you behind the scenes.</span>

                    <span>As a severe storm lover, I eagerly awaited this DVD. The opening sceen starts out wonderful with beautiful DTS sound. Then it quickly goes down hill from there. It interviews a few "Hurricance Experts" and chasers, shows video of them flying through the eyewall of Hurricane Emily. From there, well it really does not show much more on Hurricanes. Then Tornadoes are discussed. Video of only one tornado and the chase! I was disappointed! I was expecting lightning, towering thunderstorms and a few more tornado videos. If you want an excellent storm video, get National Geographic's "Natures Fury". It is superb compared to this. More footage and great sound.</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure if it was the huge screen, or what, but when I saw this feature in Omnimax it was much more impressive! The video is good, the sound is awesome on a surround sound system, but there is little storm footage. If I wanted to watch the people who chase storms, I could turn on TLC or the Discovery channel. <P>Spend your money on Twister if you're looking for a storm flick! Sure the tornados are Hollywood-made but at least you get to see them for more than 60 seconds!! This DVD ...! I want my money back!</span>

                    <span>I expected to see some spectaular footage of storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, especially considering the creditionals of the director. Instead we are shown some pretty lame footage and some barely interesting descriptions of the methods and equipment the stormchasers use. Sound was pretty good with the right setup, but at 38mins you do want to be "blown away" by the content. This just does not deliver. Check out "Everest" if you want to buy an IMAX DVD.</span>

                    <span>An experienced and masterful director, Greg Macgillivray raises the industry standards while using the available technology with clear intentions: entertain, wonder and educate the viewer without loosing the edge of the story. An Imax expert, he has also stunned the viewer with The Living Seas (with a beautiful Sting soundtrack), the Everest and Discoverers. Here, he takes you for a rough ride inside Hurricane Emily-to its very peaceful eye- and later he chases a very large and freightening tornado. He also visits India to report the monsoon season. He succeeds as usual and stays commited to his credo: raise the quality standards. The audio is impressive and the image has the tipical yet outstanding Imax beauty. Check out the "making of" section and share the exitement of the film crew and cientists involved. A real masterpiece. BUY IT!.</span>
