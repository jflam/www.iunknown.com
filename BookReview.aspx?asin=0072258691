                    <span>This book was helpful from start to finish. It really helped me to work on taking my Ebay selling to the next level. I had many of the basics, but needed some "fine tuning". This book provided that.  </span>

                    <span>Too many eBay books have nothing more than common-sense and filler that is easily picked up from the eBay help pages. This book is different because it does not waste time on the basics and draws on the experience of successful sellers. Even seasoned PowerSellers will pick up enough ideas to make it an excellent investment.</span>

                    <span>One of the best "how to do eBay" books I have read. Even the most experienced eBay sellers will find many helpful tips and useful information about all aspects of selling on eBay. We found several ideas that have helped improve our six year old eBay business. The info is up to date and worth every penny this book cost. A great resource for all levels of sellers.  Especially interesting was the "Meet a Power Seller" section at the end of each chapter.</span>
