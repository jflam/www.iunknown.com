                <span id="Label1">"He was," as <I>Salon</I>'s Gary Kamyia notes, "20th-century drug  culture's Poe, its Artaud, its Baudelaire. He was the prophet of the literature of pure experience, a  phenomenologist of dread.... Burroughs had the scary genius to turn the junk wasteland into a parallel  universe, one as thoroughly and obsessively rendered as Blake's."   <P> 	 Why has this homosexual ex-junkie, whose claim to fame rests entirely on one book--the hallucinogenic  ravings of a heroin addict--so seized the collective imagination? Burroughs wrote <I>Naked Lunch</I> in  a Tangier, Morocco, hotel room between 1954 and 1957. Allen Ginsberg and his beatnik cronies burst  onto the scene, rescued the manuscript from the food-encrusted floor, and introduced some order to the  pages. It was published in Paris in 1959 by the notorious Olympia Press and in the U.S. in 1962; the  landmark obscenity trial that ensued served to end literary censorship in America. <P>  Burroughs's literary experiment--the much-touted "cut-up" technique--mirrored the workings  of a junkie's brain. But it was junk coupled with vision: Burroughs makes teeming amalgam of allegory,  sci-fi, and non-linear narration, all wrapped in a blend of humor--slapstick, Swiftian, slang-infested humor.   What is <I>Naked Lunch</I> about? People turn into blobs amidst the sort of evil that R. Crumb, in the  decades to come, would inimitably flesh out with his dark and creepy cartoon images. Perhaps the most  easily grasped part of <I>Naked Lunch</I> is its America-bashing, replete with slang and vitriol. Read it  and see for yourself.</span>

                    <span>Naked Lunch was not written to be easily understood...after all it was writen by a person in a herion induced state of altered consciousness.  Difficult to hang through, but well worth it to gain an insight into the mind of a "junky."  It is disturbing, with gut-wrenching imagery.  I'd read "Junky" first to gain a bit better idea of what he was experiencing when "smacked" out of his mind.  Between the 2 books, if after reading them you ever put a needle in your vein, then just put a large caliber gun to your head and ventilate your mind, as you'll be doing all of us a favor!</span>

<br />NAKED LUNCH is the ultimate cut-up/quote bible/scrapbook of what it was like to be alive and a free-thinker in the Fifties. As well, the horrors of the "oil-burning junk habit" and the worlds in which the visionary dwells, are covered in great detail. There is somewhat of a back-story, dealing with a kind of Rodgers-and-Hammerstein-meets-HR-Giger-meet-sthe X Files cabal of aliens and other species infiltrating the human race. Burroughs sees himself as a catch-as-catch-can reporter on all this, "like an agent who has forgotten his own cover story [but] all agents defect and all resisters sell out." 
<br />
<br />This book is one wild ride, and as I said, should be read as a poetic scrapbook. Burroughs' contributions to all forms of media have been absolutely invaluable. This book was declared innocent of obscenity charges by the United States Supreme Court in 1959, and thus are we allowed to cuss (to an extent) on TV and on the radio. Burroughs made a great leap for free speech that is still being felt today: if a work uses questionable material within contextual merit, then it is not obscene. And NAKED LUNCH is anything but a hemmorhage of the imagination. 
<br />
<br />The role of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavor, the role of the writer as idol-breaker, and the very form of writing itself. His work is hard to access, and very much an acquired taste. But when you acquire the taste....the world never looks the same. Pick up a copy of this great book, and take your time. If nothing else you're bound to appreciate the exotic settings, Burroughs' imagination, his dry caustic wit, and some gorgeous surreal visuals: i.e. take in the Mugwumps (p.46): if this is not worth the price of a book, nothing is! Another one-of-a-kind cult novel I'd like to suggest is "THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez

                    <span>To read this book one must have an open, objective mind and in some places a strong stomach.  Burroughs pulls no punches describing a junkie's world and what goes on within his mind whether it's real, imagined or while in a narcotic stupor.  I now understand many things after reading this book. For example, some content of Salvador Dali's paintings.  Accounts are that he painted while under narcotic influence; the descriptions in 'Naked Lunch' match many scenes within Dali's paintings except in more detail.  Before reading this book, I saw within Dali's art distortions similar to Picasso's work....graphic hallucinations, for want of a better word, without explanation; now these are defined and explained thanks to Burroughs. Also, his description about living a life of addiction, to me, is hell on earth... a fate worse than death....if faced with that or death the latter is preferable to a life centered around ones next 'fix.'  'Naked Lunch' is not for the young or weak...but is enlightening if one sheds prejudice and subjective assessment before opening the cover flap.</span>

                    <span>I had a bit of a problem with Naked Lunch because there is only so much monster on young boy gay sex I can read about on the train each morning before work. I don't know - this book definitely has its moments - Burroughs was obviously is brilliant man with a fantastic way with words, but the "non-linear" way Naked Lunch is written is just not for me. I have seen very intelligent people rave about this book, but I just can't get into it. I do think it influenced Layne Staley of Alice in Chains though, so all you Dirt fans might want to check it out. But yeah, this is a weird book to read in public because you keep thinking the person next to you is going to peer over your shoulder and see what you're reading - I had the same experience with American Psycho (an excellent book). </span>
