                <span id="Label1">Paul Revere's midnight ride looms as an almost mythical event in American history--yet it has been largely ignored by scholars and left to patriotic writers and debunkers. Now one of the foremost American historians offers the first serious look at the events of the night of April 18, 1775--what led up to it, what really happened, and what followed--uncovering a truth far more remarkable than the myths of tradition.  <P>In Paul Revere's Ride, David Hackett Fischer fashions an exciting narrative that offers deep insight into the outbreak of revolution and the emergence of the American republic.  Beginning in the years before the eruption of war, Fischer illuminates the figure of Paul Revere, a man far more complex than the simple artisan and messenger of tradition.  Revere ranged widely through the complex world of Boston's revolutionary movement--from organizing local mechanics to mingling with the likes of John Hancock and Samuel Adams. When the fateful night arrived, more than sixty men and women joined him on his task of alarm--an operation Revere himself helped to organize and set in motion.  Fischer recreates Revere's capture that night, showing how it had an important impact on the events that followed. He had an uncanny gift for being at the center of events, and the author follows him to Lexington Green--setting the stage for a fresh interpretation of the battle that began the war.  Drawing on intensive new research, Fischer reveals a clash very different from both patriotic and iconoclastic myths.  The local militia were elaborately organized and intelligently led, in a manner that had deep roots in New England. On the morning of April 19, they fought in fixed positions and close formation, twice breaking the British regulars. In the afternoon, the American officers switched tactics, forging a ring of fire around the retreating enemy which they maintained for several hours--an extraordinary feat of combat leadership.  In the days that followed, Paul Revere led a new battle-- for public opinion--which proved even more decisive than the fighting itself.  <P>When the alarm-riders of April 18 took to the streets, they did not cry, "the British are coming," for most of them still believed they were British.  Within a day, many began to think differently.  For George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Thomas Paine, the news of Lexington was their revolutionary Rubicon. Paul Revere's Ride returns Paul Revere to center stage in these critical events, capturing both the drama and the underlying developments in a triumphant return to narrative history at its finest.</span>

                    <span>The book is actually two books in one: the first focuses on Paul Revere and how his life was shaped and changed by events of the day. And his role leading up to the morning of April 19th, 1775. The second is an incredibly descriptive narrative on the first battle of the American Revolution. Names, places, times are all referenced and the reader feels as though they have become a part of the story. And for those who love details, the Appendicies are outstanding. Fischer has delved into every possible account given by those who actually took part and were there on the battle field. This book is really worth a read and will become a favorite reference book to all of those who are lovers of Colonial American History. If you ever get a chance to visit Minuteman National Park, bring a copy of the book along with you to read as you stand upon Lexington Green, the Old North Bridge, Meriam's corner or the many other places referenced in the book. Much has changed but much has remained the same. It'll make the whole trip that much more worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>As I read the introduction to the book, I found myself wide-eyed that I may be wrong about my knowledge of Paul Revere. The folklore of his midnight ride (and the song) has strongly influenced what I thought. Fischer addresses that, then writes a great narrative to show you the true patriot.<P>First, I knew that Paul Revere rode to warn the colonists and Dawes rode as well. What I did not know was that they were part of a vast communication network set up by Paul Revere and his colleagues. The reader sees how successful this is (even with Revere being captured) through the explanation and maps of the troop movements. <P>The book is not a biography about Paul Revere though it does go into some detail about him. This book is primarily about the incidents leading up to the ride and the incidents immediately after. The reader will hear about all the things going on within that span of months. Paul Revere's perspective is not the only one covered.<P>I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in American history. You will finish the book feeling enlightened.</span>

                    <span>Fischer writes exceptionally well. He smoothly conveys the life of Paul Revere, and the events leading up to and following the famous night of April 18, 1775. Throughout the book, we see how Paul Revere was more than just a mere messenger that alerted the people around Massachusetts. He was a strong member of society, a businessman, a determined and faithful American, and a gentleman. His journey did not make him the man he was, but rather the journey was a catalyst that exemplified the character and standards that he firmly adhered to no matter the situation. Revere is remembered today because of his famous ride, but that is not all there is to the man he was. Through the text, we can see that Paul Revere exemplified the majority of the citizens then and how their determination and perseverance allowed for the Revolution's success.</span>

                    <span>In Paul Revere's Ride, David Hackett Fischer revisits the familiar story of Revere's midnight ride, but from a different angle.<P>My first impression of the book is that the title does not accurately describe the scope of the book. Fischer's tale is not narrowly focused on Revere's adventure, rather it tells the story within the wider view of the revolution's nucleolus in New England.<P>Make no mistake, were this a movie, Revere would be the leading man, but Fischer also gives prominence to General Thomas Gage, the commander of British forces in North America, and strong supporting roles to the lesser figures that played important parts in the action.<P>I found this to be a fascinating story that reads well. To call this book "action packed" would be an overstatement, but it certainly did not want for drama. I also greatly appreciated Fischer's telling of events from the British point-of-view as well as the colonial. <P>This is a well rounded story of the beginnings of revolution, anchored around the midnight rides of Revere and William Dawes, and should be an enjoyable read for anyone interested in early American history.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book so that I could better understand the experiences of my ancestors who fought in the early days of the Revolution. I was hijacked by this book, as well as by another Fischer book, Albion's Seed. Both books kept me reading until late at night, and sometimes I nudged my husband awake at 2 or 3 a.m. to read him a particularly fascinating passage. The research is impeccable, the writing clear and captivating. He could not have done this any better!</span>
