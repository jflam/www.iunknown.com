                <span id="Label1"><P> The leading historian of SOG, the elite commando unit in Vietnam, tells the astonishing story of the SOG warriors who penetrated enemy lines in operations directed at the Ho Chi Minh Trail. <P> The warriors of SOG -- code-named the Studies and Observations Group -- were a secret operations force in Vietnam, the forerunner of today's Delta Force and SEALs. Highly skilled Green Berets, they were the bravest of the brave, the most highly decorated unit in the war. Chief among their activities was observing the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the main North Vietnamese supply route into South Vietnam, and disrupting its operations. SOG warriors secretly penetrated deep into Laos and Cambodia to identify bombing targets, destroy troops, ambush trucks, mine roads, and, in their most difficult assignment, capture North Vietnamese soldiers for intelligence purposes. <P> Operating in the most dangerous conditions imaginable -- always outnumbered, often by as much as 100 to 1 -- SOG commandos matched wits with an un-relenting foe that hunted them with trackers and dogs. They suffered an extraordinarily high casualty rate. Ten entire teams disappeared and another fourteen were overrun and annihilated. Many of the missions run by SOG fighters were rescues and attempted rescues  of fellow soldiers and downed helicopter pilots who supported SOG missions. <P> In <I>Secret Commandos,</I> a riveting account of his years in SOG from 1969 to 1971, John Plaster describes his own remarkable covert missions as well as those of dozens of his comrades. He takes readers from his grueling training for SOG to his heart-stopping first assignments to his experiences as a SOG veteran and team leader. Even as SOG's field of operations became more limited late in the war, these accomplished warriors continued to give their all, fighting for each other.</span>

                    <span>While his previous SOG books have focused on the overall history of covert organization, John Plaster's latest book on SOG covers his own personal military experiences from Special Forces training, his time in SOG as a recon team leader through his departure from Vietnam. <P>"Secret Commandos" is one of the best military history books I've read this year without a doubt. The book gives the reader a ground-level view of what it was like to run recon deep in Laos day in and day out, making it a hard book to put down once you start reading. The courage and sacrifice of these brave men who served in SOG is amazing- I hope more Americans hear thier story.<P>"Secret Commandos" (along with Maj. Plaster's two other SOG books) brings belated attention and honor to some of the greatest (but unknown) soldiers this country has ever produced.</span>

                    <span>This book is without question one of the best I've read on the Vietnam War. It serves as an excellent companion to John Plaster's book SOG, conveying a personal account of the actions of the ultra secret Studies and Observations Group. Along with SOG this book gives an insiders account, in vivid detail, of the numerous missions that Plaster and this teammates ran behind enemy lines. In this book, Plaster takes readers beyond all the politics of the Vietnam War and brings readers a first hand account of the Special Forces actions deep inside of Laos and Cambodia. <P>This book is extremely well written and the details of the missions Plaster and his teammates ran are amazing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!</span>

                    <span>Once you start reading about the heroic efforts of some many men it was hard to put the book down. The teasers at the end of the chapters had you wanting more. I now have a greater appreciation for what these many brave individuals did not only for their country but for their commrades in arms. John gave real insight into the highs and lows of a SOG soldier. Even as the war was winding down these heros never gave up the fight. We must admire their grit,determination and sacrafices and be proud of the way they represented our country. Can't wait for the next book !</span>

                    <span>John Plaster's account of SOC missions into Laos are great. I was there as a helicopter gunship pilot with the 189th AHC Ghostriders/Avengers between 11/68-10-69. I was in the SOC Kontum Compound for numerous briefings before flying into Laos and from my personal knowledge John Plaster could not have written a more accurate book of real warriors in Vietnam. If you want to see a true dead man walking, grinning from ear to ear, look into the face of a SOG member after 7 days in Laos as I have at Dak To. My helicopter company was not the only one involved in SOG missions in Laos. Just ask any of the additional brave warriors that flew the helicopters in support of SOG. These brave aviators/crews were only 20 & 21 years old and belonged to the following companies; 57th AHC Gladiator/Cougar, 119th AHC Gators/Crocs, 170th AHC Bikinis/Buccaneers, 189th AHC Ghostriders/Avengers and 361st AHC (Cobra) Pink Panthers.

                    <span>John Plaster and I flew dozens of missions together over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. He is the real deal. This, of all his great books, let me know as a FAC pilot what REALLY was going on, on the ground. I am humbled to have flown with John and ALL the green berets of SOG who demonstrated such awesome courage. No purple hearts were won there for minor scratches. Each page is riviting and puts the reading in the jungle surrounded by hundreds of NVA bent on taking out the teams. John's tribute to the Covey FACs (part III) was particularly moving. Hand Salute to you "Plasticman."</span>
