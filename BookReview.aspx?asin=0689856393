                <span id="Label1">In Cynthia Kadohata's lively, lovely, funny and sad novel -- winner of the 2005 Newbery Medal -- the Japanese-American Takeshima family moves from Iowa to Georgia in the 1950s when Katie, the narrator, is just in kindergarten. Though her parents endure grueling conditions and impossible hours in the non-unionized poultry plant and hatchery where they work, they somehow manage to create a loving, stable home for their three children: Lynn, Katie, and Sammy. Katie's trust in, and admiration for, her older sister Lynn never falters, even when her sisterly advice doesn't seem to make sense. Lynn teaches her about everything from how the sky, the ocean, and people's eyes are special to the injustice of racial prejudice. The two girls dream of buying a house for the family someday and even save $100 in candy money: "Our other favorite book was <I>Silas Marner</I>.  We were quite capitalistic and liked the idea of Silas keeping all that gold underneath the floorboards." When Lynn develops lymphoma, it's heartbreaking, but through the course of her worsening illness, Katie does her best to remember Lynn's "<I>kira-kira</I>" (glittery, shining) outlook on life. Small moments shine the brightest in this poignant story; told beautifully and lyrically in Katie's fresh, honest voice. (Ages 11 to 14) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>Kira-Kira is an awesome book! It is about a Japanese family that is poor and the parents have to move their family to Georgia where their Aunt, Uncle, and cousins live so their parents can get a job. Katie and Lynn are best friends even though they are sisters and are four years apart. Katie is the youngest and Lynn is the oldest. Lynn is a genius but Katie isn`t that sharp. Everyday, Lynn goes to school and gets made fun of because they are Japanese, but when Katie starts school, Lynn tries to protect her from that. Every night, their dad gives them a nickel to go buy a treat at the grocery store. But when their mom has a baby, things change. Their apartment is falling apart and they want their own house. So Katie and Lynn start to save the nickels they get from their father everynight for a new house secretly. Soon, Lynn gets older and pretty and popular at her school. She has a best friend now and has grown apart from her sister. Then, Lynn gets gets a terrible illness that could kill you. She misses school everyday and has lost her bestfriend. She gets medical bills and her sister does everything she can to keep the family together.What will happen to Lynn? Read the book to find out!!</span>

                    <span>This poorly written book didn't deserve even a star. This book is not deserving of a Newbery medal. Beware of buying this book for your children and for the school library. A Newbery medal is not a mark of approval. This book is only chosen by a dozen member of the committee without critical background and literary sophistication. This book is not deserving to be in the ranks of classic Newbery books like "The Giver", "Tale of Despereaux", "Bridge to Terabithia", "A Wrinkle in Time," and "A View from Saturday". Beware of kid's reviews and blind supporters of the author for they are the victims of veneration withour understanding. </span>

                    <span>I can't believe it won, really. I did justice reading the book first before I believe the nationwide, if not global, disappointment of the current Newbery winner. Bad reviews are spreading like forest fire within the literary circle. I also can't believe kids and teens--who are unsophisticated readers--gave this book 4 or 5 stars. Maybe their teachers forced them to read this for a book report--how unfortunate. Newbery is established to provide excellent literature for American literature not to honor mediore readings to kids these days. So, lets get straight to the point. Why is this trash? First, the characters are cardboard, stereotyped. Second, the situation is so contrived and trite. Third, this is "writing down" to kids which is an insult to young minds. Fourth, there nothing new to this book. Fourth, as a matter of fact, this is recycled fiction. Fifth, this is totally formulaic (i.e., use of first person sentimental tone with "disease of the month" sprinkled with racial issues). If Cynthia Kadohata has dignity to herself, she should not accept the medal. And to the Newbery Committee, shame; that's it: shame.</span>

                    <span>  I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say that Cynthia Kadohata's Newbery winner "Kira-Kira" is a book that you either love or a book that you loathe to the fullest.  Well, I'm a thirteen-year old and I enjoyed it to the fullest.  And what really bugs me is that it is ADULT reviewers who are saying this book is too depressing for children.  ADULT!  Have you people ever heard of Bridge to Terabithia.  It was just as depressing, if not more (though, brilliant I might add).  I'm not even gonna mention last year's Olive's Ocean.
<br />
<br />  I'm a reader and fan of E. Bird's reviews, but she's got this one all wrong (well, except for maybe the bear trap part).  Thank you Amazon, for letting a teen vent!
