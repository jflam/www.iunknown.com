                <span id="Label1">In the opening of Lance Armstrong's memoir, <I>Every Second Counts</I> (co-authored by Sally Jenkins), he reflects: "Generally, one of the hardest things in the world to do is something twice." While he is talking here about his preparation for what would prove to be his second consecutive Tour de France victory in 2000, the sentiment could equally be applied to the book itself. And just as Armstrong managed to repeat his incredible 1999 tour victory, <I>Every Second Counts</I> repeats--and, in some ways exceeds&#151;the success of his bestselling first memoir, <I>It's Not About the Bike</I>. <p>  <I>Every Second Counts</I> confronts the challenge of moving beyond his cancer experience, his first Tour victory, and his celebrity status. Few of Armstrong's readers will ever compete in the Tour de France (though cyclists will relish Armstrong's detailed recounting of his 2000-2003 tour victories), but all will relate to his discussions of loss and disappointment in his personal and professional life since 1999. They will relate to his battles with petty bureaucracies, like the French court system during the doping scandal that almost halted his career. And they will especially relate to constant struggles with work/life balance. <p>  In the face of September 11--which arrives halfway through the narrative (just before the fifth anniversary of his diagnosis)--Armstrong draws from his experiences to show that suffering, fear, and death are the essential human condition. In so openly using his own life to illustrate how to face this reality, he proves that he truly is a hero--and not just because of the bike. In <I>Every Second Counts</I> he is to be admired as a human being, a man who sees every day as a challenge to live richly and well, no matter what hardships may come. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I></span>

                    <span>We all know what Lance did these last five years. We all kind of sort of know about his failures, the Olympics, his failure of his marriage. What we did not know is that Lance was evolving into a thoughtful and introspective human being. This book isn't about the bike either. It is about life, it is about teams, it is about competition, it is about living. Most bike enthousiasts probably won't like this book because Armstrong and Jenkins did not go into the minutiae of training, racing, and the grueling pace of the Tour. What they did accomplish is to follow Lance along in his thought process and his reaction to the amazing things that have happened to him since he started winning the Tour de France consecuetively and deal with his reaction to these events. <P>I enjoyed the book thoroughly, as a coach looking for motivational material, as a person who is searching for meaning, as sportsman looking for people who understands competition and honor. <P>I would recommend this book to any thinking person who is not looking for a quicky celebrity bios, because you would be disappointed with this book. If you are looking for blunt, intelligent, sometimes funny, sometimes philosophical inquiries into a life, then this book is for you.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I've been a fan of Lance Armstrong's since his first Tour de France victory in 1999. How could you not be? The man came back from testicular cancer which spread to his brains to win possibly the most grueling sporting event on the planet. You think that's a hyperbole? Have you tried riding a bike six hours non-stop? For three consecutive weeks? Somedays scaling over 15,000 feet of French mountains?<P>Oh yeah, do that after you grapple with, and narrowly defeat, a cancer that made him a sterile 'uni-baller'. A cancer that required a chunk of his skull popped open for brain surgery. A cancer that was cured by, literally, poison coursing through his veins.<P>But what cemented my sentiments was reading his first book, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE. Lance Armstrong, in spite of all his super human feats, is as human as you, me, and uncle Joe. That's what won me over for good.<P>His second book w/ the venerable Sally Jenkins cannot possibly match IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE. I don't think that's the purpose of EVERY SECOND COUNTS, either. <P>EVERY SECOND COUNTS is the happily ever after part of the end, and how there really isn't such a thing as happily ever after, nor is there really an end to begin with. The book is heavier on the philosophical side--namely, Lance's cancer-shaped philosophies on life and living. He discusses, in the familiar, Jenkins-molded candid manner, struggles of repeating victories and how when you're at the top, you've got nowhere to go but down. Everyone is gunning for you, including the French bureaucracy, which spent 21 months digging for proof of illegal enhancing substances and then grudgingly admitting Lance was as clean as the pope's robe on Sunday Mass.<P>The highlight of the book are the behind-the-scenes peek at his four other victories since his 1999 comeback, with this summer's victory number five tacked on the very end, barely making it for publication. Lance spends most of those pages selflessly praising his teammates, and telling anecdotes about the USPS team's experiences during training and on the Tour. "When I wear the yellow jersey, I figure I only deserve the zipper. The rest of it, each sleeve, the front, the back, belongs to the guys," he says.<P>Some of the dialog and taunts Lance trade with consumate teammates like George Hincapie and manager Johan Bruyneel are side-rippingly hilarious. When he talks about his son and daughters, there is a genuine tone of wonder and love in the words. When he talks about his wife Kik, there is flat out respect, and admist the marital trouble, a little regret. EVERY SECOND COUNTS skims this subject, preferring to keep the details in strictest confidence, and I respect that.<P>The book reads like a journal, held loosely together by chronology. It's a lighter read, and like IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE, I finished it in an evening. I realized this book was written for the fans. Fans who wish to revisit their old friend Lance, who has since won five consecutive Tour de Frances. How has he been doing? We see his stoic interviews on TV and emotion-less press releases, but we want to know more, what he really thinks. How are his kids? Luke must be starting pre-school soon. Are Grace and Isabelle, beautiful twin daughters, aware of their father's colossal status in the sports world yet?<P>Lance didn't have to write EVERY SECOND COUNTS, but he did anyway, for his fans. More specifically, his cancer-riddled fans who count on him for hope. His cancer foundation raised over $7 million in 2002. He makes personal visits to patients chained to hospital beds by an IV drip pole. He doesn't enjoy being a conventional celebrity ("...the main thing I know about it is that it's not good for you"), but he'll bend over backwards and play Twister if a Leukemia-striken kid asked him to. "I will never get tired of befriending people with cancer, and I'll always say, 'Come on over here, get right up next to me.'"<P>Now, how can you not be a fan of that?</span>

                    <span>This is a beautiful follow-up to Lance's first book (It's Not About the Bike). In this book, Lance shares what it is like for him as person who is also a "superstar bicyclist", "cancer survivor", and "cancer philanthropist". Though a young man in terms of age, Lance speaks with deep wisdom about what it means to live, how to feel alive, and dealing with life's non-life-threatening complexities. And then there are remarkable and thrilling stories about his Tour de France experiences. I loved reading this book! It is spectacular, especially in conjunction with his first book.<P>Review by Evan Finer, author of "Effortless WellBeing"</span>

                    <span>If every second counts for you, you should probably skip this book and read something a little more worthwhile. Unlike his previous book "It's not about the Bike" this book lacks the drama and general interest for the common reader. That being said if you are a cycling fan you can probably find some behind the scenes stuff here to be interesting, but basically this is a recap of Lance's racing since the 1999 Tour De France win. Which means if you are a cycling fan you already know everything in this book and if you are not a cycling fan you wont care what's in this book.<P>Overall it is more less just another puff piece athletic biography that seems more interested in re-enforcing Lance's status as a sports hero than it does delving into one of the most fascinating sports figures of a generation.</span>
