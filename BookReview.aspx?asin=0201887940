                    <span>Susan Quinn does a wonderful job of describing the hurdles that Curie's family had to overcome during the occupation of Poland by Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The interesting fact is that all of her siblings were bright and well educated despite the denial of public education. Reading this book has been a delightful experience.</span>

                    <span>This book did an very good job in explaining the science of Marie Curie to the average reader, However it's not a book I would read for fun. This book was long and tedious with extensive descriptions of things that often seemed almost completely unrelated to her life and work. If you're looking for a book that will make you like who Marie Curie was this is not it. It depicts her as cold, aloof and almost neglectful of her children. It also seems to end abrubtly. There isn't a conclusion of any sort to a book that goes on for 433 pages.If you need to know about her life and work this book certainly does a more than adequate job in covering it, but it's a long slow read that you have to force yourself through in parts of it.</span>

                    <span>Growing up in Poland, being interested in science and scientists and loving biographies "made me" reach for Susan Quinn book, Marie Curie: A life. A life,...what an accurate title! The book is about one of the scientists of its (and even current) times, but it is titled modestly, "...:A life". This means, Susan Quinn introduced this intriguing woman as a normal, day to day character. Such "normalcy" did not take away my admiration and inspiration in my own professional pursuits. She, the author, simply presented an extra-ordinary woman in a very ordinary way, just as if she, Maria Sklodowska-Curie, were your or mine neighboor. <p>The language of the biography is percise but also nostalgic. Susan Quinn proved to be excellent researcher and "mood creator". She was able to write as if she was walking in Sklodowska-Curie shoes. She captured non-essential detail that took a reader right in the middle of the action. The details she used were accurate and true. It brought a Polish reader back to Warsaw. There, the streets were just as she described them, the smell and noise and politics of XIX and XX c Poland were so accuratly painted that as I continued reading it I could no longer remember I was in USA. I thought I were at Nowolipki street or Saxon Garden. Memories of my country history and history of scientific world were rekindled in my heart.  <p>This is a very rich book. It will bring memories or create some for those who are not familiar with scientific revolution of Europe in late XIXc and early XXc. It is a book about heroism, loyalty, determination, passion, love and friendship. It is also a book about rejection in professional world. But most of all, this book is about victory of one extraordinary woman. This is the only woman ever who received two Nobel Prizes. And she happened to come from a country that was constantly occupied by its oppresors, from Poland. Both the author and the heroin did a fantastic job.</span>

                    <span>Her story seems but simple, yet her life is quite compelling. The story of a human-being living poorly, yet still remembering education, remembering that education would hold her together. Her brilliant mind kept through  life and her husband taught her to love science more so. She grew up in  Poland and never lost faith in what she believed. In the 430 pgs this book  tells about the human spirit and how the mind is what keeps you going. It  is detailed, telling about events going on during that time, especially  very useful because of its index. Her life was a true science, that you  must read to explore!</span>

                    <span>As a woman scientist myself, and a long time admirer of the work of the  Curies, I was struck by how much this book allows us to see beyond the  legend, to the heart of Marie Curie. She emerges as a fascinating,  brilliant individual of great depth, and a woman who endured great losses  and emotional trials. Her character, emotional depth and her ability to  follow her own moral code are what struck me most deeply. While her work  has been greatly appreciated in the latter half of the 20th Century, the  neglect and condemnation heaped on her in her day is not well known.  It  makes her accomplishments all the more remarkable and due our respect. This  very fine biography should be on every scientists' bookshelf.</span>
