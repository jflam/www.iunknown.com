                    <span>I'm not a project manager by training, (I've had no formal 'lessons' in the craft,) but I do perform the work of a PM, and this book has been a life-saver at times.  It has helped me understand the basics of what I need to do in my current role, and helped me understand what to focus on first to ensure I don't flounder too much.  Thank you Mr. Lewis for putting this book together!  (I also have your more basic "Fundamentals of Project Management" paperback, also a good buy!</span>

                    <span>I haven't completely read the book yet, but it's been very helpful so far.  The book is definitely a page turner and does not get too wrapped up on dry theory.  The author rapidly fires through most all of the key topics for project management, often citing experts in the field that you can read to learn more.<p>The author points out that most projects fail because of poor definition.  It's unfortunate his book doesn't fully describe how to prevent this, especially when it comes to really connecting to customers and understand what they need out of the project.  This might be very obvious if your customers of the project work in your same firm.  Of course you may also be the customer of the project.  If you're not though, you're going to need more than this book to deliver the *right* product.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for all project managers. The concepts are presented with lots of examples which makes it easy to read. The chapter on EAV is great!!<p>Recommended for all new to PM and a reference book for all practicing PMs. It should serve as a handy reference book for all level of PM's.</span>

                    <span>If more project people read, practised and internalized the principles in this book, fewer projects would be out of control.  I've been through the text completely, twice, and refer to the sample forms and checklists,  often.  Have recomended the text to client project leaders who are new to  the concept.    The Checklist for Managing Projects in the Appendix is a  must have for the PM controlling the team.   The first few chapters speak  to the people side of project management.  The middle section is devoted to  the computations, PERT, and other statistical measures of project tracking.   The final chapters ease back into the management styles needed, dealing  with resistence, how to mold the team, and leaves the reader fairly  optimistic that the project can be had on time and on budget.</span>
