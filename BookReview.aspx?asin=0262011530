                <span id="Label1">Abelson and Sussman's classic <I>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</I> teaches readers how to program by employing the tools of abstraction and modularity. The authors' central philosophy is that programming is the task of breaking large problems into small ones. The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together.<P> The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question "What is programming?" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of "What is data?" and "What is a procedure?"<P> The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book's concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming.</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic book. I agree with the reviewers that say this book as little to do with contemporary software design and practice, and that's a shame, because if this book HAD more influence on contemporary software design, programs would work much, much better.
<br />
<br />This is a book about writing software, controlling complexity, identifying abstractions. It is filled with intelligence and wisdom. It is also a lot of fun.</span>

                    <span>Barry Mazur (talking about mathematics, not programming) once characterised the encounter with a genuinely new concept in terms of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's experience on reading the first lines of Kalfka's Metamorphosis, when he literally fell off the sofa in shock, thinking 'I didn't know you were allowed to do that'.<br>I still remember the same shock, even if I didn't literally fall of my chair, when, as an undergraduate, I encountered the first edition of this on the new acquisitions rack in my departmental library: I must have been the first person in the University, in Northern Ireland even, to read it, which I did, from cover to cover, over several days sitting in the library, even before it was released into the stacks.<p>The reason why Structure and Interpretation is the best there is, is that it manages, not just once, but several times, to deliver that fall-off-a-chair intellectual jolt. People who complain that you can only do such things in Scheme, and therefore that the ideas are pointless, are missing the point.</span>

                    <span>Of all of the computer programming texts I have worked with, this is by far the worst and most confusing I have ever seen. But besides being confusing, it is also pointless. I've been programming for quite some time, and I have never had to use 90% of what is in this book. (Mostly because virtually all common languages come with high level constructs in their libraries for performing the kinds of low level operations that this book wants you do to by hand.)<p>The book attempts to introduce object oriented concepts using a language that is not at all suited for object oriented programming. But worst of all, it doesn't even explain these concepts using analogies that people can understand. And so beginning computer science students are throughly confused by the content of this book.<p>The language used (Scheme) has no practical real-world application. It is not even well suited as a teaching language because its syntax and constructs are unlike anything used in any common language today. In fact, trying to understand this book if you already have Java or C experience might be worse than starting from scratch, because Scheme is such a backwards language.<p>Basically, a confusing and poorly written textbook that teaches a totally irrelevent language which has no real world use (and doesn't do a very good job of teaching it at that).</span>

                    <span>I never heard so many interesting and different views expressed for any book.some call it a waste of time and others a classic.Some refer it as an apptitude test for comp sc and others a book that has nothing to do with modern software engineering.<br>I think everyone is right at its own place. It all depends on how you look at things.Their is a set of inquistive ppl in the world who wants to know why and how of every thing .. why this apple is falling towards the ground and not the otherway .. isn't this a stupid question, a lil crazy for Newton to think this way so is this book.<br>The author starts by exploring what a program is. what is data,procedure,abstraction,modularity what we can do with it .how to model systems and why ? well all these are trivial questions and why do we care..we are living in a world of MFC's,API's,Integrated Environments..True thats why this book is a waste of time and has got nothing to do with modern software engineering.<br>But if you care why the apple is falling towards the ground and if you have the faculty to wonder you are going to like this book. It will give u insight in to the programing will make u think in terms of programming and not languages.. may be will add to ur creativity..This book is not easy to read.I think this book is equally difficult for a fresher and a 10 yrs exp guy.It all depends on how gifted u are. if u have it, it doesn't matter how many years u have put in to comp sc. <br>If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.SICP is all about this.</span>
