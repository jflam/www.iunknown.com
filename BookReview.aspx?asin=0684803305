                <span id="Label1"><P> <B>Here is Cornelius Ryan's masterly chronicle of the greatest armada of troop-carrying aircraft ever assembled for a single battle -- culminating in the most grandiose and devastatingly tragic struggle of World War II.</B> <P> Now in a new edition for the 50th anniversary of VE Day, <I>A Bridge Too Far</I> tells the classic story of the battle of Arnhem, one of the most dramatic battles of World War II, which cost the Allies nearly twice as many casualties as D-Day. In this compelling work of history, Cornelius Ryan narrates the Allied effort to end the war in 1944 by dropping the combined airborne forces of the American and British armies behind German lines to capture the crucial bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem. <P> Focusing on a vast cast of characters, from Dutch civilians to British and American strategists, to common soldiers and commanders, Ryan brings to life one of the most daring and ill-fated operations of the war. <I>A Bridge Too Far</I> superbly recreates the terror and suspense, the heroism and the tragedy of this epic operation, which marshalled some of the greatest resources of the war yet ended in bitter defeat.</span>

                    <span>Famed author Cornelius Ryan has a unique and appealing way of telling a story that makes his books quite unique, and this huge best seller is no exception. He lets the disastrous story of the wrong-headed Allied decision to risk an immense day-light paratrooper drop with "thunderclap surprise" (catching the Germans with their proverbial pants down) for the first time in the European campaign unfold as an ill-conceived effort to capture a series of bridges critical to a fast and successful prosecution of the Allied thrust into the heart of Germany. <P>This tale retelling the Allied miscalculation of potential German resistance and the speed with which they could proceed up the one road needed to support the airdropped forces is a riveting tale. Its total cost in terms of human life and unnecessary destruction is a cautionary lesson for history. Like his other books, this is a story told at every level, but concentrating on the faithful recollections of the actual participants in the action. Thus, the reader is wept into the action as we get a voyeur's view of the moment-to-moment development of the story as it unfolds in all its horrific detail.<P>There is a cornucopia of information presented here, and Ryan's approach is scrupulously faithful to the facts, all of them, regardless of the source. Therefore, there is a great deal of attention paid to the recollections and experiences of the German armed forces and noncombatants as well as the Allied invaders. Unlike some other efforts on this subject, there is no apparent effort here to color the results and make the Allies more circumspect and less provocative in making and activating their ill-conceived plans. One gets the sense on reading this book that this is the whole story as best Ryan could determine it, and he makes an extraordinary effort to include as much relevant information by way of using both recollection and contextual data to bolster a comprehensive picture of the battles as they unfolded in the air, and then more fatefully on the ground. <P> Ryan was one of a handful of masterful storytellers and historians who emerged from the Second World War. Like John Toland, William Shirer, and a number of notable others, Ryan illuminated the human stories of war and destruction, and brought these otherwise unbelievable and incomprehensible experiences home to an entire generation of otherwise bewildered citizens. This is one of the best of the efforts, shining the light of truth on a still controversial and provocative Allied action that could have expedited the end of the war, but instead resulted in large scale death and destruction.</span>

                    <span>This is a gripping account of Operation Market-Garden and the tragic failure to reach the Arnhem bridge. Ryan's writing is detailed and reads like a novel. Montgomery's failure too reach Arnhem and take in to account the geography of Holland ...shows a complete disregard for common sense. He should have taken Antwerp first. How he convinced Eisenhower, I do not know. And the failure of the RAF to give air support is puzzling. The Germans got their planes in the air. Ryan discusses the failures without any real criticism for the commanders. He lets the facts speak for the themselves. I like that. His vivid accounts of the brave determination the British 1st Airborne division makes this book a must read. their defense of the perimeter and at the bridge is something I had not read about in much detail. The contrast between the British regular Army and the airborne is fascinating. I do have one criticism and I must agree with a previous reviewer: the lack of good, detailed maps of the battle and more photographs (ground level) are necessary to visualize properly. but it's worth finding your own while you read this wonderful book. It's a must for the military history buff. It is shame Mr. Ryan did not live to see his last book become a movie.</span>

                    <span>This book is the gripping account of World War Two's most tragic battle and thats the story of the Red Devils(British Paratroopers) at Arnhem. This book covers in wonderful detail of the events of Operation Market-Garden. Ryan writes his masterpiece with hundredes of accounts from te soldiers who were accutally there. This book is packed from cover to cover with stories of heroism, courage,and bravery. Like the story of Col. Frosts small band of tough Red Devils who hold Arnhem for four days against two S.S. Panzer Divisions, or the story of the 82nd Airbornes crossing of te Waal river 2 take Nimejan Bridge in daylight. If I could i would give it a 7 star rating!</span>

                    <span>Just like in "the Longest Day" in which the 2nd Ranger is erroneously depicted as failing in their mission, Ryan depicts operation Market/Garden as a total failure since they failed to secure the final bridge. As with "The Longest Day", had Ryan fully reserched this subject, Ryan would have discovered that a major objective of the offensive was to open desperately needed port to shorten the allies' line of supply. As a result of this offensive, the allies attacked northward from their positions which were as far east as Nimigen and opened the port of Antwerp in Belgium. This was an important onjective to the overall European war effort.</span>

                    <span>A Bridge Too Far is one of the greatest books ever written about a major combat operation during World War II. In writing this book, Cornelius Ryan interviewed dozens, if not hundreds of participants from high-ranking generals to civilians. This book fully exposes the sheer stupidity and overconfidence that characterized both the planning and execution of Operation Market Garden by the Allies that was supposed to end WWII in Europe by Christmas, 1944. <P>A true classic war book.</span>
