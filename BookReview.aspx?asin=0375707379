                    <span>I defer to the thorough review titled "Consumption and Greed" below for a synopsis of this book.
<br />
<br />The subject matter of "A Consumers' Republic" is engrossing and the book reveals many truths that are now forgotten and swept under the rug.  Cohen uses an impressive plethora of examples to demonstrate her points, and in the end I know much more about the United States' economic and social history from the 30's to the present.
<br />
<br />Unfortuntately, Cohen's writing often becomes convoluted and difficult to read due to frequent lengthy and difficult to follow sentences.  While reading, many times I had to re-read a sentence or paragraph in order to grasp the author's intent.  A few times I even wanted to put the book down and pick up a less academic book - perhaps some fiction - to give my eyes and brain a break.  Much of the book is well written and flows well, but these occasional roadblocks require determination to get through and prove frustrating.  However, having finished this yesterday, I'm happy I persevered.  The incredible amount of research and well thought out and supported thesis' are worth five stars, but the writing brings it down to four stars.</span>

                    <span>The above quote from the book reveals its fundamental problem.  Consumerism is stretched to include (for example) racial equality, housing policy, and politics: this dulls any edge the concept might have as an analytic tool.  What is a consumer?  We're told "the word's original meaning" - - "to devour, waste and spend" - - but not its current one.  The author tries to distinguish between the "citizen consumer" and "purchaser consumer".  The supposed dichotomy between these roles was no more obvious to me than to those consumer advocates who - - to the author's apparent surprise - - "found it possible to endorse both simultaneously".  
<br />
<br />So the book is a kind of grab bag of the USA's post-war social problems, often using the author's home state as an example.  At times, she seems on the verge of dissecting New Jersey as Mike Davis does Los Angeles (high praise from me), but never quite sustains such a level.  For example, there's a fascinating account of how policies of "upzoning" were used to create homogeneous suburbs of large, expensive, detached houses.  But when explaining how this led to racial polarization - - in an era of supposed desegregration - - she can only show us the 'after' map, not the 'before'.  However, the use of photos, advertisements, and newspaper cartoons is exemplary: often amusing, sometimes shocking.  
<br />
<br />Towards the end of the book, the author finds it necessary to expand the concept of "consumer" to "consumer/citizen", and finally to "consumer/citizen/taxpayer/voter": a clear sign of a dead end.  On the final page, her vision is vague and feeble: we "could reinvigorate the liberating aspects of the purchaser" and "could seek to reverse the trend toward the Consumerization of the Republic by not shrinking from articulating the important things that only government can do".  Hardly a programme of action.  But maybe that's too much to expect.

                    <span>Lizabeth Cohen's "A Consumers' Republic" does much to explain how citizenship has been significantly redefined by consumerism in postwar America. The thoroughly readable book is full of insights and should interest all readers of 20th century American history. It will also prompt many to ponder how America might try to heal its frayed society while there is time available to do so.<p>In the Acknowledgements, Ms. Cohen explains that this impressive book was written over the course of ten years. Her thesis profited from audience feedback at numerous college lectures and presentations she made during this time and with able assistance from a number of talented student researchers. With over 400 pages of text and 100 pages of notes, the book represents a remarkable achievement and is a testament to Ms. Cohen's intelligent use of the academic research process. <p>Ms. Cohen is in top form when she chronicles the struggles of women and African-Americans to assert their rights in what she calls the "Consumers' Republic" of 1945 to 1975. The author provides background material by documenting how a variety of bread-and-butter consumer issues mobilized millions into action from the Depression through WWII. Ms. Cohen then shows how power gained by women and minorities through their contributions to the war effort later found expression in the Civil Rights, women's liberation and other movements of the 1950s and 1960s.<p>However, Ms. Cohen explains that policy makers in the aftermath of WWII were influenced and corrupted by, among other things, unparalleled levels of corporate power and ideological rivalry with the Soviet Union. Mass consumption was seen as a solution to help keep manufacturing profits high and was propagandized in order prove to the world that the U.S. was practically a classless society. The reality was different, of course. The author discusses how racial, gender and class biases were reaffirmed and institutionalized by the GI Bill and other legislative acts. As a result of Ms. Cohen's extraordinary research, the reader comes to understand that the increasingly stratified post-WWII American society that resulted was not inevitable but was shaped by powerful interests who privileged private sector solutions at the expense of the public.<p>In my view, the only shortcomings in this ambitious book are Ms. Cohen's failure to discuss the environmental consequences of consumerism and her omission of the student revolt against the military/industrial complex in the 1960s. But overall, these are minor quibbles. "A Consumers' Republic" delivers plenty of thought-provoking material and is a pleasure to read. The book is highly recommended to everyone who might want to gain perspective on contemporary American society and further consider where it might be headed.</span>

                    <span>To say you are an America is to say that you are, de facto, a consumer.<p>This word is a defining aspect of our American world...  Consumerism covers daily life, whether it be drug discounts, tourism, marketers, insurance, cars, homes, technology or just plain old product reviews.  We Americans are defined by our consumption. <br>		<br>Lizabeth Cohen has given us a thoroughly researched, readable history on consumerism, and how it came to be such a force and part of our lives in America.    She argues that after WWII the "Consumer Republic" was launched, full force, affecting life styles, government and even belief systems.  Though the beginning of a consumers movement had occurred before 1940, the "Consumer Republic" took form and force after the second world war.<p>Cohen's writing style is informative, to the point of being academic.  "A Consumers' Republic" is a history book.  Thus, it may be a bit more pedantic than most general readers would like. <p>I found a few omissions that distracted from the overall excellence of the book. One being that Cohen does not investigate how consumerism has been incorporated into, and seriously affected, American Christianity.  She does not address how Christianity, especially considering the `Protestant work ethic', helped to shaped and drive consumerism into being.  She does not explore `why' Americans live to consume, "shop til they drop."  Neither does she reflect on the effects that unbridled consumption have on both the social fabric of our nation  or the ecological impact on our land.<p>That said, this book is a "need to read" for students of American history, marketing, those involved as consumer activists, and business.  Recommended. 3.5 stars</span>
