                    <span>Biscuit is a little puppy who wants to go to school like his owner.  He follows the little girl to school one day.  Once at school Biscuit wants to join in with the other boys and girls.  He wants to play ball, hear a story, wants a snack and meet the teacher.  The little girl is worried that the teacher will be angry that Biscuit came to school.  It turns out the teacher and the students enjoy Biscuit being with them. <p>This book is a great book for young dog lovers.  There are very little words per page.  Beginner readers will enjoy this book.  The pictures are also very cute.<p>I would recommed this book for young children because it will keep their attention well.  This is one is a series of other Biscuit books.  If they enjoy this one they will look for others by the same author.</span>

                    <span>My daughter loves Biscuit and I love the illustrations.  This is one of the original-style books like Biscuit, Bath-Time for Biscuit, Biscuit Finds A Friend, etc. and not one of the larger format books (Happy Chanukah Biscuit, Happy Thanksgiving Biscuit, Biscuit on the Farm, etc.).<p>In this book, the adorable puppy tries to follow The-Girl-With-the-Purple-Sneakers to school.<p>Pretty basic reading and excellent illustrations.  Good for young kids who can't read as well as a good book for kids just beginning to read on their own.</span>
