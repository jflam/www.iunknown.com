                    <span>if you've ever dreamed of turning on the stove for your speaker volume, the is for you. you can learn just how to fix/ mess up the whole house. if the neighbors come over, you can simply open the fridge in the basement to turn off the tv. how cool is that? it's also useful for fixing your home electronics. house builders and di-it-yourself husbands will find it useful .
<br />
<br />   but I have just shared what I would use this for. it also is useful for putting in a new light, doorbell, etc. etc</span>

                    <span>This book is filled with simple clear COLOR illustrations.  It is a great reference for everything from wiring 3-way and 4-way switches to kitchen remodelling.  I used this book to help wire a four bedroom home and it was perfect.</span>

                    <span>I did my electrician course last year and the books that I read to do the courses weren't even close to teaching me as much as this one. Everything is so clearly wrote and explained. The pictures are amazing too. I'm building my new home next year and I'm not worried to do the electrical myself now that i've read this book.</span>

                    <span>This originally was two separate books, Basic and Advanced Wiring, that B&D combined into one book. Extremely well written, with lots of photographs, this is an excellent book for a do it yourselfer with a project in mind, or for a home owner to keep on hand to have when the need arises. The book covers basic repairs and maintenance, with a not too complicated introduction to electricity, but quickly gets down to the basics, with chapters on Wall Switches, Receptacles, Light Fixtures, Doorbells & Thermostats.  The second half covers how to do more complicated electrical tasks. The first half is repair and maintenance, the second half moves into renovation and remodeling, with chapters on project planning, tools & techniques, Wiring a Room Addition, Wiring a Remodeled Kitchen, Installing Outdoor Wiring, etc. From this book I learned how to install new breakers in the main fuse panel, a project I was terrified of trying. This really is a very good book for the non-professional.  It was a good idea to combine the two books into one, a handy reference and guide</span>

                    <span>I recently renovated 100% of my home's electric (which was largely knob and tube prior to this). I had no previous electrical experience, and this book walked me through everything I needed to do this work, pass all inspections and stay safe. I always keep it handy as a reference when I am working with electricity. The "general inspection guidelines" in the middle of the book is particularly useful.</span>
