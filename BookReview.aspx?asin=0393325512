                <span id="Label1">Over 1,000 images teach shooting and Photoshop techniques in easy lessons for anyone wanting expert advice on digital photography.  <P>In 2003, digital camera sales will explode following a 35 percent increase in 2002. Rick Sammon, one of North America's most widely read photocolumnists, covers all the steps in the digital photographic process.  <P>Sammon begins with basic advice for those new to photography. Experienced film shooters will enjoy Sammon's ample coverage of Photoshop and digital image techniques. And in a bonus section, Sammon offers advanced tips such as taking glamour shots, producing e-books, and setting up a home studio.  <P>Sammon answers questions such as "How do I select a digital camera? How do I store my images? What are the first things I should do when using Photoshop?"  <P>Sammon's approach of "learning to see and seeing to learn" uses pairs of images, software screen shots, and the best photographs from his own vast library. The 107 lessons take the reader through each topic in friendly, concise steps. Includes a CD-ROM with "The Camera Looks Both Ways," a mini-course in photography. 1008 color illustrations.</span>

                    <span>Someone else used the word "pedestrian" to describe this book and I think that says it all.  I can see where this book might be easy for a beginner to understand, but I would guess you can find something else just as good for a lot less money, or you may even find free tutorials on the internet.
<br />
<br />The book is written for beginners, so why does the author spend most of his time discussing pro cameras costing thousands of dollars in the camera section?  A more thorough discussion of what to look for when buying a consumer or prosumer camera would have been a lot more helpful.  There is also an error on p. 164 in the "features and benefits" section.  The table is titled "prosumer digital SLR" when he is discussing "prosumer digital 'ZLR' cameras," it's very confusing. On the next page he gives only scant attention to "consumer" cameras. 
<br />
<br />A much better book for someone who wants more depth is "Real World Digital Photography, 2nd ed."  It just costs a few dollars more and has so much more useful information.

                    <span>To be fair, Rick does have some good information in the book. However, almost all of the lessons and comments relating to processing images in Photoshop are confusing and sadly lacking accurate instructions on how to accomplish the various processing steps. It's one of those books that requires one to read, re-read and then re-read the instructions again thinking you missed something. Well, you didn't miss something; it's not there. I would hope a revision be done to provide more accurate details because I think the author is a very good photographer.</span>

                    <span>This book is very easy and interesting to read, it has great illustrations and is packed with helpful and easy to understand tips. I'm an intermediate amateur photographer and I knew a lot about digital cameras and digital photography before I got this book. But I still found it very helpful. Even though I knew a lot on the subject of lighting, exposure and composition, this book helped me to learn how to use that knowledge in practice.</span>

                    <span>Rick Sammon's Complete Guide to Digital Photography is aptly named in that it covers a very wide range of topics.  The hardware of photography is covered; cameras, lenses, flashes, memory cards, computers, RAM, graphics tablets, card readers, scanners, printers, backup storage, and more.  The software of digital photography is covered; organizing photos, editing photos (mostly with Photoshop), and some special effects software.  Photographic techniques and how to take better and more interesting photos are covered.  There are sections with advice how to treat people you photograph, making macro images, what to do for travel photography, and even advice on getting started as a freelance photographer.  There are many things covered that I have not listed.  The book is written in a very easy to read conversational style with lots of tips and advice scattered though out.  There is an abundance of pictures in this book illustrating everything that is discussed in the text. This book may not go as deep into every topic as some other more narrowly focused books, but it goes more then deep enough into each topic covered to be useful and meet my needs.  The only issue with the book would be that the photo editing software used is Photoshop which maybe too expensive for people starting with digital photography.  Even though Photoshop (which I don't have because of the price)  is used for the editing lessons, I have found that the concepts and techniques are still useful for the more affordable Corel Photo-Paint that I use.  Most of the same things can be done same way as in Photo-Paint, they are just in different menus and have different names.  Also, most people who don't want to pay for Photoshop could afford Adobe Photoshop Elements, which is very similar to Photoshot and has almost all the capabilities of Phtotoshop.  Even without the photo editing sections (which is about one third of the book), there is plenty of good material to make the book worth while.</span>

                    <span>This book is worth every penny. It comes with FULL COLOR. So it is easy for you to see every detail of the sample pictures. I started my digital phtography experience with Canon S400. The book gives me an opportunity to become the person who knows how to take the great pictures. Therefore, if you are a beginner like me and want to buy your first book in Digital Photography. This book will be your first one.</span>
