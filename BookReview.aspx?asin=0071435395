                    <span>Another book about sales? By now, what could possibly be "new"? Indeed, over the years, there have been many brilliant books written about the art and science of salesmanship. For example, Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling, Michael Bosworth's Solution Selling and CustomerCentric Selling as well as Stephen E. Heiman and Diana Sanchez's The New Strategic Selling and The New Conceptual SellingÂ®. This volume clearly deserves to be included among them. 
<br />
<br />According to Eades, "Solution Selling" is a sales process which consists of a philosophy (the customer is the focal point), a map (how to get from where you are to where you want to be), a methodology (it includes tools, job aids, techniques, and procedures to succeed), and a sales management system (by which to analyze pipelines, qualify opportunities, and coach skills). Thus summarized, "Solution Selling" may seem to many, especially those with years of sales experience, to be simplistic. In fact, Eades offers some thought-provoking and unorthodox perspectives on what is seldom (if ever) simple: Persuading a sufficient number of people to buy whatever you offer for sale and then continue to do so, and at a margin sufficient to ensure sustainable profitability for your organization. Amazon and Borders offer this volume for sale in combination with Bosworth's book of the same title. Yes, there is much common material but also significant differences which reveal themselves when both Bosworth's book and then Eades's book are read in sequence. 
<br />
<br />FYI, I am among those who believe that (a) marketing and sales are separate but interdependent areas of activity, and (b) directly or indirectly, everyone within a given organization should be involved in both. With his material carefully organized within five Parts, Eades explains "Solution Selling" concepts; how to create new opportunities (e.g. "Diagnosing Before You Prescribe"); how to engage in active opportunities (e.g. "Selling When  You Are Not First"), how to gain access to people with power, control the selling process, and close; and how to manage the sales process (e.g. "Creating and Sustaining High Performance Sales Cultures." Once marketing initiatives have created or increased demand for what is offered, the sale must then be made. Literally [in italics] everyone [end italics] within a given organization can and should -- directly or indirectly -- support marketing and sales initiatives. 
<br />
<br />Of course, it remains for each reader to determine which of Eades's ideas are most relevant, and, how best to apply them within a given competitive environment. However, I presume to offer a concluding word of caution: Make certain that you have a [in italics] repeatable, integrated sales execution process [end italics] rather than a grab bag of disconnected, often contradictory ideas about sales. When a horse is designed by a committee, the result frequently does resemble a camel. </span>

                    <span>This is a useful guide to one of the hottest subjects in sales: selling solutions, not products. Author Keith M. Eades offers a methodical, step-by-step approach to implementing a conversational approach to selling. The principles underlying "solution selling" are simple and straightforward, and the process is hard to fault, although it demands a great deal of record keeping and charting. The author's explanation of the procedures gets a bit mechanical and jargon-riddled at times. But on the whole, we believe every salesperson is apt to find something of value in this book, even if it's a reminder of what once was known but has been forgotten. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In my business humor book, "A Job Ain't Nothing But Work," I made a joke about everyone selling solutions these days.  "My wife won't give me any.  Got a solution for that?"  But in the new book "The New Solution Selling," solutions are all business.  It begins with a clear definition of what a solution selling is: "a system of methods that includes tools, job aids, techniques, and procedures that help salespeople and sales teams navigate the selling steps that close more sales faster."  After this clear definition is given, author Keith M. Eades, founder and president of Sales Performance International and Solution Selling Inc, uses his expertise in sales for teaching the reader the necessary steps of selling, including pre-planning, cold calling, and the very important closing of the deal.<p>     "The New Solution Selling" is not your run of the mill business book that typically renames and regurgitates business practices that have been in place for years.  Instead, the book not only gives valuable information on the sales process but it also gives reliable examples.  This includes sample pre-calling letters, thank you letters, and letters that ask for more business.  Examples can be put into place immediately after reading the related chapter.  It is perfect for the salesperson looking to penetrate the Fortune 500 market.<p>     The book addresses major issues in the sales world, including what to do when your top salespeople are promoted to management, how to respond when you're not the first in line, and how to identify and respond to the pains your customers are facing.  <p>     Having graduated from business school and worked in sales for a number of years, I can tell you that this book is the real deal.  It has found a permanent place on my business book shelf right next to "Who Moved My Cheese?" and "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."  This is the kind of book that should be on college campuses all across America.  It is a very informative and easy to follow book that every salesperson should own.</span>

                    <span>Solution Selling helped me clarify what I was doing right and wrong a little over 10 years ago.  Over the years my company sent me to workshops to coach the methodology and reinforce it into my psyche.  It was a great experience and I would have to credit this sales methodology with making me a lot of money in selling and managing technology distributors/business partners<p>I am disappointed that Keith Eades did not have the insight or maybe it is the ability to write something new that would have been beneficial to Solution Selling practitioners.</span>

                    <span>Finally a version of solution selling that is not condesending. Keith takes a different approach to Solution Selling that is very conversational, talking to the reader, not "at" the reader. I found that this is a book where you can take a yellow marker and capture important pointers that can be used in the sales process. Different than the original Solution Selling (and Customer Centric Selling for that matter)where they were much more like a text book. I like how he took the orignal Solution Selling thoughts (excellent ones might I add) and updated it to include many of the needed tools for modern day selling. If you are a Solution Selling customer now, READ IT and live it! If you are not a current Solution Selling customer you may want to read it for the excellent ideas, suggestions and data Keith presents to enhance your sales abilities and sales process.</span>
