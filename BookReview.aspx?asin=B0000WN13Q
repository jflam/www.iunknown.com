                    <span>A film by Jeffrey Blitz<P>"Spellbound" is an Academy Award nominated film (Best Documentary) that focuses on eight children who are competing in the 1999 National Spelling Bee. We are given a look at the kids as they prepare for the Regional Spelling Bee. Each kid wins the regional and goes on to the National Bee. The first half of the movie is introduction. We are given a fairly in depth look into the lives of each of the eight kids: Harry Altman, Angela Arenivar, Ted Brigham, April DeGideo, Neil Kadakia, Nupur Lala, Emily Stagg, and Ashley White. This opening part shows how each child (the child must be in eighth grade or below, and be younger than 16 years of age) prepared for the spelling bees, what they study, and what their lives are like. Some of the kids are more interesting than others. I know that is a bad thing to say about real children, but I think it is valid when we talk about the movie. After the segments on five kids I start wondering when the actually Spelling Bee will begin and how many kids are left to introduce. I understand that this is necessary because this distinguishes them from the other children participating in the Bee. <P>Halfway through the movie we get to the National Spelling Bee. We follow each of the kids through the opening rounds and while we do see the other kids in the Bee, the most time is spent on our eight subjects. As we move into higher rounds, some of the subjects miss a word and are eliminated. After each elimination we hear the responses from the parents and the contestant and without exception they are positive responses. There is joy as the kids do well and they is disappointment when one is eliminated (I had a couple of favorites throughout the movie), but by the end this documentary made me care about an event that I would never have given a second thought to. <P>Since I am somewhat bookish, I loved this documentary. It was fascinating, interesting, and presented a well told story of the National Spelling Bee. "Spellbound" is an absolutely terrific documentary and is well worth your time to watch.</span>

                    <span>JEFF Blitz's astonishing documentary follows eight children in their early teens as they prepare for, and take part in the National Spelling Bee. As they progress from their regional competitions to the televised finals in D.C., they are shown researching and testing themselves, romping through well-thumbed dictionaries and running the spellcheck gauntlet.<BR>Had this been the sum of it, this would have made a mildly interesting film about competitive children. But Spellbound explores the family background of each child, stealthily revealing the roots of their obsession. The result is a powerful, moving and often very funny exploration of what it is to be an American.<BR>Widely differing in social class, ethnic origin and levels of wealth, the families show support for their children in many different ways. Angela's story is particularly extraordinary. A pale teenage girl with a mouthful of braces and a ready smile, she is the daughter of Mexican illegal immigrants, neither of whom speaks a word of English. Her self-taught English is impeccable and she devises methods of word-association with graphs and maps that would credit an etymology scholar. Watching her pore over her handmade charts while her ranch-hand father rounds up the cows is unbearably moving.<BR>Equally touching is the story of Ashley, the oldest daughter of a black single mother living in the projects. With two uncles " incarcerated", Ashley calmly reveals that she prays to God to assist her in overcoming the many obstacles of her underprivileged position.<BR>Then there is the hyperactive Harry and the hulking Ted, an isolated giant with a near-genius IQ and serial killer's eyes, who lives in a trailer with his parents and a brother who "loves guns".<BR>Blitz chances upon several moments that serious documentary-makers would die for. A sign put up by the community to cheer on their local champion, a young Asian girl, reads "Congradulations Nupur". During the tense finals, the heavily pressurised Neil, a serious East Indian boy whose parents are the nightmare aspect of the American Dream, has to spell "Darjeeling" - a word entirely unknown to him.</span>

                    <span>Spellbound tell the story of 8 of 249 kids at the National Spelling Bee. It's an interesting documentary, even though it's a little slow during the D.C. spell-off. Also Harry, kind of ruined the doc. too. Way too hyper.</span>

                    <span>My husband and I are veterans (and champions!) of adult-level spelling bees, so I felt really close to this movie. In fact, the movie had only been on for 11 minutes and I'd already started crying tears of joy when Angela won her regional bee, securing her place at the national Scripps-Howard bee in Washington, DC. <P>The kids profiled in this movie are fantastic. I found myself rooting for all of them, even the one or two who I didn't really like. I wanted to take little Harry home with me -- his facial expressions and his extended rambling about whether or not he could be considered "talkative" are just hysterical.<P>The parents are interesting as well. All of them are supportive of their children and have different ways of showing it. Neil's parents (especially his father) are a little intense, and it's easy to see them in a negative light, but when Neil is knocked out of the national competition, their reaction is to be supportive of their son. Nothing wrong with that. April's mother is nutsy, with huge red-framed eyeglasses. She's constantly giggling, "Beeeeee Happy! B-E-E!" April comments that her mother reminds her of Edith Bunker, "because she's kinda dumb."<P>The competiton is nail-bitingly suspenseful. I found myself whispering the spellings of the words as the kids struggled, hoping they would somehow hear me. A couple of the kids have heartbreaking moments where you can see the anguish on their faces as they struggle to make sense of a word. One girl nearly starts crying; it was all I could do not to cry too!<P>My one criticism of the movie lies in how they handled the winner of the national bee. First they tell you who won, and only a few minutes later do they show you the winner spelling the winning word. What could have been a superb climax is completely defused. The rest of the documentary stirs up so much emotion, I can't imagine why the filmmakers chose to utterly derail what should have been the climax of the movie. <P>Overall, however, this is a charming, exciting film -- one that I will watch more than once, and may even purchase for my collection. I imagine that, for most people, this is a "watch it once" film, a curiosity about geeky brainy kids and an odd bit of Americana, and that's fine. Even if you're not a word nerd, watch this film once and see how the other half lives. Even if you think these kids are weird for caring so much about spelling, you're bound to learn something, whether it's how to spell a five-syllable word, or the kind of dedication and diligence a mere 12-year-old is capable of.</span>

                    <span>In the past, I've occasionally stumbled upon ESPN's live coverage of the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee contest conducted in Washington, DC. I never paid much attention because the event never seemed to be all that exciting. However, this 2002 documentary of the 1999 National Spelling Bee is anything but boring.<P>In the beginning, the viewer is given brief but informative backgrounds on each of the film's eight subjects. The one thing that begins to come across almost immediately is how much these kids care about competing and succeeding and the fact that the parents of each care almost as much (or perhaps even more in some cases) as the kids themselves. Most of the parents spend their free time helping the kids practice spelling words. <P>We're told early on that nine million kids participate in spelling bees every year and that only 249 will make it to Washington, DC. The fact that these 8 (and the other 241 who are not a focus of the film) have already won numerous local and regional spelling bees within their own states is an accomplishment itself. That one will end up being the best speller out of nine million (and beat the best of the best), is simply amazing.<P>As the film focuses more and more on the national competition, I found myself becoming nervous right along with the kids and parents, hoping that I wouldn't hear that little bell at the end of a misspelled word which tells the participant that they may now exit stage right as it is all over with. I wanted all eight to win but the one I found myself rooting for the most was Neil Kadakia, a 12 year old Indian boy from San Clemente, California. His dedication, as well as that of his parents (particularly his father, who makes some encouraging and appreciative comments about the USA) was incredible. It is mentioned that Neil and his father studied thousands, yes thousands, of words a day in preparation. I'll not spoil the outcome for those who haven't seen it. Maybe one of the eight wins, maybe they don't.<P>Moreover, this is a remarkable depiction of dedicated people. Unlike some so-called "documentary filmmakers", director Jeffrey Blitz is content to make a true documentary by allowing his subjects and their surroundings tell the story. Like other great documentaries (Harlan County USA, American Dream, The Thin Blue Line) this is also a great film.</span>
