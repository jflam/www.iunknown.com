                    <span>This was a real disappointment because I wanted a DVD to watch with my little leaguer to get him excited about the game and what could be done on the baseball field. He was bored as it was mostly talking heads with very little actual footage of great moments. Lots of behind the scenes and historical reminiscing about great moments....but only a moment or two of actual game footage. <P>This DVD is not a highlight film...it's a talk show.</span>

                    <span>The 30 moments are great, but how bout replacing Ichiro's rookie season with at least the 1997 World Series. that 97 Series was as exciting as the 91 and 01 Series. Ichiro's rookie season will only live up to Pacific Northwest fans and Asians.</span>

                    <span>As an avid fan of the game and follower of the history, I was looking forward to this DVD very much. I had seen a bunch of these clips in ESPN, which I thought were very well done. This DVD has some masterful footage ranging from Gehrig's speech to Hubbell's strikeouts to Maris' chase of the Babe into Barry and Number 73. The special features piece is also interesting -- as an example, to hear Billy Ripken and his outtake on Cal coming through in big games, or each of the milestones homeruns that Bonds has reached in his career. <P>The one tiny piece lacking and again, I say this as an avid fan, was that all the clips have been edited to fit into this DVD. So what you will find is a 9 minute segment is now a 4 minute segment...but hey! to find all 30 memorable moments in one DVD and have about 135 minutes of footage (including the special features) ..makes me give this two thumbs up.<P>A great gift for a baseball fan, or any sports fan for that matter.</span>
