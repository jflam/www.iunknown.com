                <span id="Label1">Bearing W.P. Kinsella's trademark combination of "sweet-natured prose and a richly imagined world" (Philadelphia Inquirer), The Iowa Baseball Confederacy tells the story of Gideon Clark, a man on a quest. He is out to prove to the world that the indomitable Chicago Cubs traveled to Iowa in the summer of 1908 for an exhibition game against an amateur league, the Iowa Baseball Confederacy. But a simple game somehow turned into a titanic battle of more than two thousand innings, and Gideon Clark struggles to set the record straight on this infamous game that no one else believes ever happened.</span>

                    <span>After reading "Shoeless Joe" my craving for W.P. Kinsella needed to be taken care of. When I picked up "The Iowa Baseball Confederacies" I did not expect to read it entirely in one day. But Kinsella has that kind of effect on a reader. He intertwines fiction with fact, reality with fantasy. He develops characters so well that you feel their pain when things don't go their way, and you share in their joy when things do. The story of Gideon Clarke and his obsession is a page turner for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels, and a healthy knowledge of baseball wouldn't hurt early. His use of the greatest double play tandem in baseball history, Tinkers-Evers-Chance, lets the reader associate reality with Kinsella's fantasy world. The story of the Iowa Baseball Confederacy and their 40 day baseball game versus the eventual World Champion Cubs of 1908 is a book I strongly reccommend</span>

                    <span>I first picked this up off the bookstore shelf because of that Kevin Costner movie that came out in 1989, but I knew Kinsella for his writing ability before that. What made me buy the book was the back cover's description of a baseball game that lasts over 2,000 innings and the protagonist's insistence that it really did happen.<P>I wasn't disappointed, although I have to say that this novel doesn't offer the simple wish fulfillment of Shoeless Joe or the movie based on that novel. The Iowa Baseball Confederacy spends the first hundred or so pages describing how Gideon Clarke's father wrote a Master's thesis in History about a baseball league that noone else remembers, how the thesis was rejected and ruined his father's life, and how he (Gideon) inherited this "knowledge" of a non-existent league and this obsession upon his father's death.<P>Gideon seems to be following the same fruitless path of trying to prove the existence of the mythical Iowa Baseball Confederacy, when the (un)expected happens: he's taken back to 1908 to see the events occur that have so far only existed in his and his father's memory.<P>And then things get strange, in a bizarre and wonderful way: As the game stretches on, the flood waters rise higher, statues become animated, all manner of nature comes to life, love blooms, and the ballpark is repeatedly visited by Drifting Away, the Native American whose destiny is tied up with this small town in Iowa.<P>While the plot of the novel resembled Darryl Brock's If I Never Get Back, or T. Coraghessan Boyle's short story, "The Hector Quesadilla Story," The Iowa Baseball Confederacy reminded me of nothing so much as the Magic Realism fiction by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jorge Luis Borges. Indeed, at times, I felt like was reading a shorter version of Marquez' A Hundred Years of Solitude, only this time placed in the turn of the century American Midwest.<P>I did say that this book is not about wish fulfillment like Kinsella's more famous Shoeless Joe, but I didn't consider this a weakness. The fantastic does occur in The Iowa Baseball Confederacy, but only with the caveat that fantasy doesn't always help one's reality. Kinsella does entertain the reader with all kinds of strange imaginings, but Gideon is still searching for fulfillment in the same ways that the rest of us do. Some may be disappointed with bittersweet quality of this book, but that same quality only makes the novel true to life. In spite of all the bizarre twists and turns of plot.<P>And by the way, the game descriptions are wonderful reminders that baseball truly hasn't changed that much over the years.</span>

                    <span>I love books and I love baseball and I love the way W. P. Kinsella mixes fantasy with reality in his novels. I've known people who think there was simply a bit too much fantasy in THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY, but, for me, there wasn't. This is a more complicated story than SHOELESS JOE (on which the film, FIELD OF DREAMS was based), to be sure, but, like SHOELESS JOE, THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY contains magic. Not just magical realism, but magic.<P>THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY begins when Matthew Clarke is struck by lightning. Coming to, he realizes that he "knows" something no one else knows: that on July 4, 1908, the Chicago Cubs played an almost 2000 inning game in Onamata, Iowa with a little known amateur team called the Iowa Baseball Confederacy. Although, Matthew writes his Masters thesis on the game, everyone denies the existence of the Iowa Baseball Confederacy and Matthew can find no trace of it anywhere...but in his own mind. With his life seemingly in ruins, Matthew, in 1978, allows himself to be hit by a line drive, committing suicide. Matthew's death, however, doesn't mark the end of the search for the Iowa Baseball Confederacy. Upon Matthew's death, his son, Gideon, discovers that he has "inherited" his father's memory of the game and must set out on a quest of his own to prove its existence.<P>Gideon and his friend, Stan, know there must be some logical (or even illogical) reason why no one can remember this historic game or even the Iowa Baseball Confederacy. Together, they find a way to travel back to July 4, 1908 and watch the game, and learn the truth, themselves. What they see is nothing like what they expected. Involved are floods, a Native American and even Leonardo da Vinci, who floats by in a hot air balloon. And, Onamata was, in 1908, not called Onamata. The second half of THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY is filled with the strangest baseball game anyone will ever read about, anywhere, but it's certainly one I wouldn't have wanted to miss.<P>W.P. Kinsella is an extraordinary writer and he's one of only a handful of writers who can really handle magical realism well. While his short stories are filled with melancholy and loss, his novels are a mix of the homespun, the real and the fantastic...and, more importantly, he pulls all of this together and makes us believe. The characters in THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY are very well drawn and I could really feel their hope and their pain. The subplot revolving around the minor league player who finally gets his one big chance is quite poignant and bittersweet.<P>Kinsella successfully mixes fact and fiction in THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY. There are "real" people in this book: Bill Klem, Three Finger Brown and Frank Chance, and they only serve to help make the forty day game more real.<P>While THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY is infused with just as much magic as SHOELESS JOE, it is a far denser story, with many more subplots. People needing a more straightforward story might be better off to stick with SHOELESS JOE.<P>If I have one complaint about THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY, it's that the Biblical symbolism was a little too heavy for me. But it wasn't so heavy as to reduce this book from a five star read to a four star one.<P>No one writes about baseball or the people involved with the game better than W.P. Kinsella. I would definitely recommend THE IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY to anyone who loves baseball and can suspend his or her disbelief long enough to let a little magic into his life. It will certainly be worth it.</span>

                    <span>I just finished my sophomore year of college. I have had the Iowa Baseball Confederacy in my room forever but I waited until the semester was over to start reading it because I wanted to give it full attention. I read Shoeless Joe a couple of years ago and it is still my all-time favorite book. I went into this one with high expectations. However, they were not met. I just didn't like the characters, didn't care about them. The Plot seemed like a bunch of short stories together that made no sense. <P>Magic is a key element in Kinsella stories. However, this one just seemed too fantastic. I don't know how players coming back from the dead in Shoeless Joe seemed more realistic than the time-travel, magic Indian, and the obsession with the game in the Iowa Baseball Confederacy, but it just does. <P>The book is worth a read if you're a Kinsella Fan but don't waste your time otherwise. Read Shoeless Joe again.</span>

                    <span>Its pretty difficult to put this book in a genre. Sports novel? There's a 2,000 inning game in here. Mythology? The characters seem plenty real to me. Lets just say that it belongs in the genre of books that defy classification.<BR>I'm not sure whats so great about this book. I guess its just the fact that when Kinsella says there was this totally fantastic event, you believe him. Who knows why? The man is an amazing writer, and this proves it. By the way, if you are a teacher by all means, assign this book to your class instead of the tired old 19th century british class warfare novel.</span>
