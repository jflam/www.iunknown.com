                    <span>This book is great for just learning about OO concepts and their related functioning in Perl.  Most of the other important Perl texts are very large and tend to summarize many concepts.  This text takes Perl OO concepts and presents them in a very interesting and helpful format that is easy to follow.  Perl is more than just a scripting language and this text helps you to understand this language from a different prospective.</span>

                    <span>I don't know why it is so hard to get a decent book on Perl. Every author seems to have a weird idea on how to present material. Perl programmers often seem to be devoted to the culture and celebrities of Perl. Randal Schwartz is perhaps the best of Perl authors. 
<br />
<br />This is a decent book but I don't particularly like the style. He teaches by example, ie he walks through an example, once you have understood this useless example he introduces a new point and you are supposed to have your interest raised and leap into the instruction part enthusiastically. Personally I don't like this style, give me the facts and *follow* up with examples. I don't want to waste my time wadding through a story that I can forget in 5 minutes, it also makes reviewing the material difficult.
<br />
<br />Having said that the examples are good. Many books get very abstract and terse. Gilligan and his boat and coconuts is easier to relate to 'foo' which is a pointer to a scalar called 'bar'.
<br />
<br />You need to sit down quietly and spend time reading this. I am a harried administrator and I don't have much time. </span>

                    <span>Last Fall I attended a session on object oriented programming with Objective-C. When discussing various languages with object oriented capabilities, the speaker remarked, "Don't even talk to me about Perl." Many people feel that way about Perl without even having to talk about object oriented programming. 
<br />
<br />Randall Schwartz and Tom Phoenix, the authors of the Perl primer "Learning Perl", take on the task of talking about Perl and object oriented programming. Since Perl does not have object orientation as its principal structure, they have a significant task to pull off. 
<br />
<br />In the Foreword of "Learning Perl Objects, References and Modules" Damian Conway draws attention to Perl's particular magic in implementing object oriented programming: "[Perl] takes a collection of Perl's existing non-OO features...and then--with nothing up its sleeve--manages to conjure up fully functional objects, classes and methods."
<br />
<br />This particular nature of Perl shows up in the nature of the book's content. "Learning Perl Objects, References and Modules" is not about why or when to use object oriented programming in Perl. It is about how to magically turn references and anonymous data structures into object oriented programming. In that way, it is more of a tactical book than a strategic book. The history and concepts behind object oriented programming are touched on only lightly in its 180 pages; however, the book follows a steady progression to the goal of making and distributing Perl modules. 
<br />
<br />Eagerly anticipating the publication of the book, I bought it as soon as it was available. I reaped immediate benefit from the first few chapters as they demonstrated how to accomplish the goals I had for a project that I was working on. I lost interest shortly after chapter 4. The book has sat on my coffee table for most of the last year. I paused for a great deal partly due to the vagueries of my personal life, but partly due to the odd pacing of the book. Without being able to give explicit examples, I can say that the book feels like a first edition.  
<br />
<br />The book seems squarely targeted at a point between "Learning Perl" and "Advanced Perl Programming." And that's where I'm at. It certainly has helped me develop the ability to use more complex data structures in my Perl programs. However, it is not a thorough discussion on object oriented programming. If you've grown beyond "Learning Perl", you may find "Learning Perl Objects, References and Modules" worth talking about.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to learn about Perl objects and this book is not for me. I need an easier book for me (thats just me)<br>I cant study the material at all once I got to Chapter 4.<br>I feel degraded and stupid because I read all the good reviews.<br>The examples are good until Chapter 4. After that the code is fun to read and learning is not all hard with just some effort. Very scary indeed though on Chapter 4! I think most of the readers here have already a C background.<br>Its not the book is bad but very strange indeed on Chapter 4.<br>The part where the author talks about auto vivication is very strange because there is no mention of how you should analyze the data nor any code example. I got scared and have lost my confidence trying to learn perl. I honestly just dont like <br>Chapter 4; and all the time I have tried to decipher what the author is trying to teach. I just love to waste my time when Im not working and sitting here for 5 hours trying to figure out the example, however the book is to be read and Im sure I'll figure out the difficulties! So take time to read this book. Those are just the examples I found that I did not appreciate.</span>

                    <span>This book does a great job on helping you grasp the concepts of objects and oop related concepts. I already know perl well, and use daily as part of my job. But I'm so used to procedural programming that I sometimes forget the details about oop. This book helps remind me about oop, and I try to use the examples here when coding new stuff :)</span>
