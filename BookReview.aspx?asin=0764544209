                    <span>Buy this book for your aging parents rather than trying to teach them how to search the Internet. Saved me from so much frustration, I would have paid twice the price. I only wish I'd thought of this before I tried in the first place. I'll never have to research my mother's vacations or mutual funds for her online again.<p>Plus, I consider myself a power searcher, and I even learned quite a bit I didn't know from this book.</span>

                    <span>When I first saw "Google for Dummies," I thought, "A whole book about Google? How much can you say about an online search engine?" I browsed the table of contents and discovered how misinformed I was. After reading the book, I can say that author Brad Hill has done an excellent job of presenting how Google goes far beyond simply spitting out search results and swanky holiday logos.<p>"Google for Dummies" goes over all the functions, features, and fun tricks associated with the phenomenon that is now part of daily language. To "google" something is synonymous to finding information, and "googling" has become an indispensable research tool for knowledge. However, quickly spinning off from its primary purpose of trolling the 'Net for information on specific words and phrases, Google is now also into news, shopping, dictionary assistance, ad words, games, online journaling, and marketing. Brad Hill talks about all these in attention-grabbing detail.<p>And true to Dummies tradition, the language of the book is straightforward, simple, and brilliantly humorous. Editors' notes ("While our backs were turned, Brad Hill snuck some chocolate-covered espresso beans. We are now feeding him through a tube."), cartoon quips (I love The 5th Wave!), and the "Remember," "Tip," and "Warning" icons enhance the book's appeal to both the Google beginner (if there is still such a creature) and the googling geek. I especially appreciate the hundreds of screen shots that help me visualize what the author is trying to explain. And many thanks to Brad Hill for confirming that Google does not plant spy ware, and Dr. Mellifluous Boolean did not prophesy the Internet.<p>In short, if you want step-by-step instructions on how to optimize your Google search, how to use the Google Toolbar to enhance your browsing experience, or how to tap Google's functionalities to fire up your site's popularity, "Google for Dummies" has it all -- and much more, actually (heard of Boogle.com?). - Ruby Bayan (www.OurSimpleJoys.com)</span>

                    <span>First, let me say, that I did enjoy the first half of the book. I learned several things. The best part of the book was learning about the answer feature of google that I knew existed but never ventured into it because of the fee-based feature. If anything, he said to check how the researcher use google to answer people questions.Good information! And several key word operators were helpful. So,as a reference to check into once in awhile is not bad.But at 22 dollars I will explain why I was disappointed.<br> Mr. Hill spends way to much time on silly, worthless topics that are indirectly related to google. For God sake, he talks about a site that called elgooG that emulated google but everything is reverse.Why would I want to know that and how will that help me find information on google?<br>After the first half, I was ready to dig into it and waiting for some concrete examples of doing research with google. <br>In part 3, Putting google to work for you, I thought this is it. But rather then give numerous example how you can use google (using the main features )to get what you want, he talks about downloading google toolbar, or changing the language interface, duh! Anyone that has use google for than 1 month knows all that. <br>The book misses an oportunity to show how an expert researcher will use google to acquire information. Rather than spend time on stupid google games, alternatives to google,google site that mirrors google in reverse, I wish more time would have been spend on google and how to do kick ass research using one example and going through all the features and operators.</span>

                    <span>Part how-to and part reference, Google for Dummies is Brad Hill's newest title in the For Dummies series. Hill, whose Internet Searching For Dummies has undergone three updates, says that if he does another, it will contain the single sentence "Go to Google." He cites Google's 36-word home-page design, its accuracy and ability to almost read minds, and its behind-the-scenes offerings. <p>Google lets you access an enormous images database, as well as news, directories, and groups, get instant stock quotes, search pages of thousands of mail-order catalogues, look up words and translate text, find someone's phone number or address, search in only the titles of web pages, play Google games, navigate search results using keys rather than the mouse, become an expert at specialty searches, get answers with Google's for-pay research service, and try out Google Labs, an open testing area.<p>Want to start your own weblog? Google helps you do it for free on its Blogger.com site. <p>For Dummies fans know you will find concise information laced with humor - lots of it, loads of icons and other navigational aids, a tear-out cheat sheet that highlights the best features and shortcuts, and lists of tips. You're guaranteed to chuckle when you translate your favorite English words into these languages: Elmer Fudd, Pig Latin, Hacker, Interlingua, and Klingon.<p>The downside is learning that the Google Toolbar, which the author says is guaranteed to change your life by streamlining and consolidating search abilities, is not available to Mac users. You won't be able to use the pop-up ad blocker or practice one-click blog posting from the Google Toolbar. This book may contain more about Google than you ever wanted or needed to know, and it's not cheap. But if you want to discover all the nuances of Google, which daily searches over 200 million queries in 90 languages and has better brand recognition than Coca-Cola and Starbucks, you'll want to own this title.</span>
