                <span id="Label1">Bruce Weber once called her the "green-fingered queen." For more than twenty-five years C. Z. Guest has been coaxing readers into the garden and offering invaluable advice through her nationally syndicated weekly column <i>Garden Talk</i>. After noticing that readers had the same questions from one year to the next, she compiled all her answers and advice into an informative, easy-to-follow, and very practical gardening resource. This comprehensive and user-friendly volume helps gardeners plan for each season, plant and maintain their gardens, and overcome any gardening problems. Most important, it teaches the joy of gardening. "I have always thought that having a garden is like having a true and loyal friend," C. Z. says.<br><br>Organized by season and with a thorough index, the book will provide all the gardening information needed by either a novice or an expert, from when to plant bulbs to keeping your vegetable garden pest-free. As C. Z. says, other garden experts make everything complicated, but "that doesn't encourage anyone. No matter the audience, I keep things so simple that even a 6-year-old could grasp them."<br></span>

                    <span>Contrary to the first review of this book, I ordered it anyway & feel that once you understand the concept of it (what to do each season of the year rather than in general) it can be a great help, especially to beginners. It tends to read like a novel with headings alphabetically arranged in each season. I very much like this book. It would be great for those who like to read the entire book instead of having neat headings for each topic.</span>

                    <span>C.Z. Guest has been providing garden knowledge to readers for almost 30 years through her newspaper columns and has finally compiled some of the most common questions into one place. Geared towards the novice gardener, Guest's book is organized (or dis-organized!?) according to season and then, alphabetically. Despite some good basic (very basic) information, the book's lack of flow and sensible organization makes it a disaster to read or to use as a reference. Each "season" section contains varied information that may or may not pertain to that season, and some things appear more than once. For example, annual flowers are discussed under the Winter section because there is the briefest of paragraphs suggesting starting annual flower seeds in the winter, but an annual question also appears in the Spring section. Trying to follow alphabetically within the season is also futile since titles are inconsistent - some plants are discussed specifically while others are grouped together, etc. Thankfully it is fully indexed so you can get a quick look-up by subject. Information provided throughout the book is pretty mundane and something you will most likely know if you have been gardening for any amount of time. Guest's entire comment on daylily in the Spring section is: "You can plant day lilies in the spring or fall since they tolerate a wide range of growing conditions. Some bloomers are better than others, such as 'Happy Returns', a compact 18-inch yellow variety that will bloom all summer long. It is a true yellow and will blend beautifully with other flowers." There is a longer comment on daylilies in the fall section - but there is no indication that the reader should look there for more detailed info. This book may be worthwhile afternoon scan (the library's copy, of course) but does not stand alone as a garden reference guide worthy of the avid gardener's shelf.</span>
