                <span id="Label1">Microsoft Windows 2000 internals have a very logical structure. In  <I>Inside Microsoft Windows 2000</I>, David Solomon and Mark Russinovich explain  what goes on behind the curtain as Windows 2000 manages memory, regulates access  to input and output devices, controls persistent storage, communicates with the  network, and does the rest of its duties as a modern operating system. This is a  text for programmers, and it's packed with call-by-call documentation of what  happens when Windows 2000 is told to perform various operations. There's not as  much code in this book as you might expect--mostly, it's text. Once you have the  architecture figured out, you should be able to implement your code more  easily.<p>  The chapter on memory management exemplifies this careful approach to Windows  2000 internals. What memory management does is discussed (it maps the virtual  memory range of threads into registers on physical devices, and handles overflow  from volatile memory onto disk). Then, you learn the more obvious ways of  observing and tweaking memory performance (the Performance tab in Task Manager  and the Registry). Finally, you get detailed information on how Windows 2000  handles mapping, and the use of dozens of memory-related Win32 API calls.  <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system kernel and  its internal operations; the specific behaviors of various subsystems, including  memory management, threading, security, caching, and network communications.</span>

                    <span>I have interest in mechanism of microsoft windows 2000/NT, since windows isn't a free OS, I have to read books instead of source code. The book is a famous one focused on system mechanism of win2k,I read it, sure, I got much knowledge from it,but I find it's a little mussy, and not very clear, it's also not detailed enough to understand microsoft win2k/NT.<br>The book "Understanding the Linux Kernel" By Daniel P. Bovet, Marco Cesati is much better than this one.</span>

                    <span>This book is interesting for people who want to learn about what goes on under the hood of Windows 2000. The authors' style is clear and easy to understand and there is a good wealth of precious, in depth information.<br>It would have been even better if more details were included: some system mechanisms are mentioned, but the details are left out (particularly on LPCs). Also, the book is not oriented toward experimenting with the system by means of writing kernel mode code: nearly all of the experiments are based on the usage of tools. I think the book could have had room for something more if a number of pages of data structures listing (returned by Kd commands) were left out, particularly since these listings have very few comments and therefore add very little to what everyone can get from the debugger.</span>

                    <span>This book explains windows 2000 internal workings in reasonable breadth and sufficient depth. This book is MUCH better than the 2nd Edition of Inside Windows NT, perhaps because of Mark's contributions. <br>The only problem with this book is that, inspite of being huge, it is only one volume. I think Windows 2000 is too extensive to fit in one book, and though the book is great for getting at many of the principles, you need to look at the DDK/SDK documentation to get more details, and actually use them in your work. At this level the book provides a great starting point to delve into OS internals, but perhaps someone needs to write a book for each chapter to do justice.</span>

                    <span>As a former systems programmer on Burroughs (Unisys) systems, I was always used to knowing how the OS did things. It is a real treat after working on PCs for so long, to finally get a book that makes it interesting to learn the internals again. This book is full of things that will give you an appreciation of any OS, but the way it cracks into the guts of 2000 is great. The experiments in this book make it really easy to learn how 2000 is organized and apply it to existing programming projects. Learning 2000 from the inside via the debugger is just a great way to do it. No offense to David, but Mark's influence is obvious. If you are a fan of his Internals column, you will like this book even better. The fact that he does it without source code is even more amazing. Wait a minute...why hasn't Microsoft paid these guys whatever they want to build the next version of 2000?<br>If you appreciate a good OS and an even better manual on it...Buy This Book...</span>
