                    <span>Thomas Leech is a nationally known consultant on presentation making.  In this book he distills his years of experience into a single volume of useful information.  The book is packed with tremendously valuable information to make sure that your presentation is a winner.  <br>No stone is left unturned as he goes through a complete system for creating the presentation.  Not only are the technical aspects discussed but also gauging your audience and customizing your presentation to meet the needs of the audience.  He even covers special problems in presentation such as an international presentation.<br>This is the best book on putting together a successful presentation that I have seen.  Whether you are presenting an position internally to change the direction of a business or externally to generate new business this book is extremely useful.  For generating additional business and presentations to potential customers I would recommend using it in combination with Tom Sant's book on Proposal writing.  A winning presentation and a winning proposal results in winning business.</span>

                    <span>While working on an assignment for a graduate level managerial communications class, I browsed several books on business presentations.  Mr. Leech's book was the one I chose to use. It provides a wealth of  information, while being very readable. Reading this book added to the  knowledge I gained from the class. This book will become a valuble part of  my business library.</span>
