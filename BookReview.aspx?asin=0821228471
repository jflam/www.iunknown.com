                <span id="Label1">The first book of its kind, STYLE AND GRACE: AFRICAN AMERICANS AT HOME, is devoted exclusively to presenting the African-American tradition for flair and creativity in home design and decoration. This unique book celebrates the distinctive style of notable homeowners such as hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons, photographer Gordon Parks, and Congressman Charles Rangel, as well as leading bankers, lawyers, artists, and other professionals who have utilized cultural elements and icons to create gorgeous home environments. Sumptuous original photography created expressly for this book by Mick Hales portrays the stunning elegance of the homes, while delightful accounts of each domain and its inhabitants will draw readers into these private worlds. This book is a rich portrait of African-American homes of style and beauty.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for a beautiful, decorative coffee-table book to fill space in your living quarters, look no further. STYLE AND GRACE: AFRICAN AMERICANS AT HOME is a beautiful escape inside the home of African American celebrities. Showing a diversity of styles and tastes, the reader is given a glimpse of quiet elegance, sophisticated clutter, and even over-indulgent artifacts. Showcasing the houses of celebrities such as Russell Simmons and Gordon Parks to Nancy Lane and Michael McCollom, this book is resplendent, and quite an inspiration to those who can afford to hire someone else to fix up their house.<P>Photographer Mick Hales has beautifully portrayed areas both inside and outside of each house. And, while I did think the book was beautiful, it was a bit annoying that it only focused on celebrities as if to say that other African Americans do not have style and decorating abilities too. It would've been nice to see a section devoted to those who do their own interior decorating.<BR> <BR>Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers</span>

                    <span>I bought this book hoping for decorating inspiration. It's attractive but I wish the author could've visited the homes of a few non celebrities. Another thing I noticed, after looking at only a few pages you begin to realize the each home is very much like the other. It could've been better.</span>

                    <span>I was thrilled to come across this book as the marketplace has been needing a book like this for a long time. In my home library of interior design books, there has been a hole when it comes to african-american style and design and this books fits the bill perfectly. Some of the people whose homes are shown are well-known, such as Gordon Parks and Russell Simmons, but others who are less-known, but professionals in their field, have beautiful homes nevertheless. I loved seeing how culture and design are interwoven and that modern pieces can be paired with antiques, heirlooms, and artifacts. I highly recommend this book.</span>
