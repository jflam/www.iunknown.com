                <span id="Label1">"Nobody likes me!" is a complaint that parents hear all too often, and few utterances make them feel more helpless. Now help is at hand: This practical and compassionate guidebook enables parents to sharpen any child's social skills by pinpointing the child's particular social strengths and difficulties. Some children have trouble resolving arguments, some find themselves in a constant clash of wills, and some have trouble making any friends at all. Each chapter--from "The Shy Child" to "The Little Adult," from "The Short-Fused Child" to "The Sensitive Soul"--uses case studies that focus on the specific social conventions that certain children don't "get," and offers drills that parents and teachers can use to help children understand the unspoken underpinnings of social situations, the knowledge essential to building, sustaining, and repairing relationships.</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute must for parents AND teachers who want to guide children through the mastering of essential social skills for building friendships. The all inclusive presentation of means and methods for knowing and implementing The Unwritten Rules will spare many children from the pain of unknowingly inviting social rejection. It's all within The Unwritten Rules...clearly visible to the mind and heart. The authors admirably and impressively answer many children's calls for help.</span>

                    <span>I have watched my child suffer from shyness. This book made me realize that there are some specific skills that she could learn that would help her feel more confident and be more successful in social situations. Instead of saying to her, "Of course they will want to play with you, you're such a great kid," I now give her specific tips, like: "Smile and say hello and say the person's name when you see them" or "If all the kids are playing tag, just join the game, instead of waiting for them to ask you to join." I am so glad that I found this book while she is in early elementary school so we can work on the skills together and avoid some unhappiness down the road. This book offers very practical advice that will help parents guide their children to learn "friendship skills". What greater gift can we give our children? I found Unwritten Rules to be very compassionate towards all kinds of children. I gave a copy of it to my friend who was at her wit's end with her child who has been taking on the role of bully of the playground. She found it helpful too!</span>

                    <span>Well-organized with chapters on different types of children --the shy child, the different drummer, etc. States unwritten rules which elude many children in dealing with peers and others. Lots of examples and practical how-to professional advice. Gives parents tools to help their child overcome problems in making friends.</span>
