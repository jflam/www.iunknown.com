                    <span>This is the most effective leadership book I have ever read.  It is straightforward and real.  It contains all of the information that leaders know, but don't want to hear.  What is significant, is the title.  It's not titled, "Listen Up, Manager."  It's "Listen Up, Leader."  Leaders must influence, engage, and enroll employees.  Managers complete tasks and oversee.  This book provides all of the employee thoughts and whispers that you may not hear.  The content is invaluable and timeless.  Everyone in leadership needs to read it.  Ten times better than "Who Moved My Cheese?"  </span>

                    <span>This short book is powerful.  If you are in management, and take things personally, you may believe Mr. Cottrell is writing about you.  Written from the perspective of "your" employees, he has compiled several  managerial issues along with solutions. I recommend this book to ALL  managers, Presidents, V.P.s, COO's, CEO's,CFO's, (the list goes on).  If  you have people working for you, read this book.  If you want to be the  best manager you can possibly be, APPLY this book as a management tool.  If  you have managers working for you, make sure you GIVE them Listen Up,  Leader.  IT'S THAT GOOD.</span>
