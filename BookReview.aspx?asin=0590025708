                    <span>I read several books to my 5th grade reading group before we move into the lesson of the day. They loved this book. They saw themselves in many of the characters in the book. One chapter about a little boy who had trouble reading,sparked hope iin one of my students who has trouble in the same area. I came to Amazon.com hoping that this author wrote some other books - and he did. I can't wait to read the next one. Keep them coming!</span>

My favorite story in this book is 'Above the classroom' last chapter of this book, its about this teacher who people think his die already, but........IT LIVED ABOVE THE CLASSROOM! Howard and Frances find out.........and.......<P>Find out yourself!</span>

                    <span>I rate this book 5 stars because It was a very entertaining book. It was really funny but some parts were disgusting. I had a great time reading it and every time it was time up, I wouldn't want to put the book down. Every time my friends would look at me while I was reading you saw me always smiling, laughing, eyes filled with interest, etc. This book i would have to say is one of my favorite books if not the favorite. It was a fantastic book and I encourage any readers interested to read it to. I promise you will enjoy it like i did!</span>

                    <span>A great book full of laughs and comedy. You want to keep seeing what zany situations turn up at the Walter Melon Elementary school. The zany elements make you remember your third grade year and compare it to this book. I liked it because it had a lot of humor, and I could DEFINITELY relat this book to my third grade class.</span>

                    <span>Each September I begin the school year by reading this book aloud to my third-grade class. It has never failed to win their enthusiasm and attention. From the start my classroom fills with laughter and pleas for me to read more. Highly recommended.</span>
