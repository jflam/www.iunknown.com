                <span id="Label1">Expanding on the idea that the best parts of technical books are usually the nuggetized elements--the hints, tips, and sidebars--Joseph Lowery and Andrea Buraglia have written <I>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX Killer Tips</I> with nothing <I>but</I> such elements. The strategy works, freeing them from having to write--and the reader from having to read through--the largely pointless passages that might otherwise connect useful chunks of knowledge. The strategy also eliminates dwelling on basic subjects with which most readers will already be familiar, as interesting details can be pointed out without the need to drill through obvious stuff first.<p>  A typical page of this short but fact-dense book (which is printed entirely in full color--a real advantage for a book so focused on graphic design) contains two tips. They sometimes have to do with design ideas and occasionally deal with elements of HTML, JavaScript, or stylesheet code, but more often concern little-known capabilities or user-interface details of Dreamweaver MX. For example, in a section about aligning text between two flanking images, the authors explain the exact procedure to follow and offer some warnings about how it's possible for the strategy to go awry. More useful to browsers than as a reference, you'll almost certainly expand your knowledge of Dreamweaver MX with this book. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to convert your mere competence with Dreamweaver MX into profitable efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Some tips were a little mediocre, but for the most part a great collection of tips.  These killer tips books seem to be mostly for novice users of programs, and in this case that remains true, but since I'm a novice in Dreamweaver, I loved the information contained within.</span>

                    <span>This book is probably best suited for Intermediate level Dreamweaver MX users who are looking for ways to improve their productivity. This is a 200+ page book that is very colorful inside and has a killer tip per page. If you tried to learn these productivity and usage tips on your own without this book, you could spend at least an hour on each tip and still miss quite a few tips. This book will eliminate 1-2 years from your learning curve and save you hundreds of hours that can be spent on doing more projects. <p>Here's an example of how valuable these tips are - if you encounter a fatal exception error while working with Dreamweaver, do you know how NOT to lose your work? This tip alone saved me a lot of time when it happened to me (given enough time, it will definitely happen to all users). Another invaluable tip is on using Dreamweaver MX to check how your web page will display in the various browsers out there without actually having all those different browsers!<p>Some of the tips may not be real killer tips but there aren't that many that gave me such a feeling. In most cases, I am wondering if I just haven't encountered the problem yet and hence fail to see the power of the killer tip. <p>The best part about the book is that you can open the book on any page and learn something new for the day. If you spend a lot of time designing web sites, you won't regret reading a tip or two per day and in the process benefit tremendously from the time spent with the book. The price is not too bad either so don't hesitate to buy this book. Enjoy the hundreds of killer tips!</span>

It is well published in full color and easy to read/flip thru. It is *not* a how to guide for the beginner.<br>Very simple example from the book: add a standard toolbar so that you can have common buttons such as new, undo, redo at your fingertips (go to view->toolbars->standard) It will appear above your document.<br>Want more? check out the the author's website: dwkillertips.com</span>

                    <span>I buy many (ok, maybe TOO many!) web design and programming books every month.  Most aren't worth the high cost of computer books these days, but Macromedia Dreamweaver MX Killer Tips by Joseph Lowery and Angela C. Buraglia is worth the money.  The book is filled with wonderful and useful tips for the Dreamweaver MX user.  Yes, some of the tips are basic items you would find in a normal users guide, but some are worth the price of the book alone!  Save time AND money if you do any serious web development with Dreamweaver MX and get this book!</span>
