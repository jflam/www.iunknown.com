                    <span>Dr. Dwyer explains the methods he has learned in his studies of Eastern energy techniques to explain the origins of "OM" and "AH" meditations. Dwyer's voice guides listeners through both morning and evening meditations. The crux of the CD is about the power of releasing the wish to the Universe for fulfillment. Not an easy task in an attachment-driven society. </span>

                    <span>I could not even start to meditate to this CD. A cd of "Ah" and "OM" is not helpful. This was not even re-recorded for the CD, it keep on referring to the "tape"
<br />I have a "scarecrow" where I hang my old cd's to scare birds away from my garden. I think playing this cd will work better! </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I'd just like to make a couple of observations about this CD:
<br />
<br />1) The CD is most useful as a supplement to Wayne Dyer's book "Manifest Your Destiny". The book gives a much more complete explaination of the "Ah Meditation" and how to pratice it. Given the amount of additional information in the book, I don't feel like the CD really stands on its own. The book is  excellent, by the way, and if you've gone so far as to buy the CD, definitely check out the book.
<br />
<br />2) The "Ah Meditation" involves focusing on two to the body's energy centers, also known as chakras. If you are new to the concept of an energy body, seperate from your physical body, the cd is likely to confuse you. There's no explaination of chakras here, just the assumption that the listener has some foreknowledge, and even then it can be confusing. Specifically, Dr. Dyer refers to the "root chakra" and the "sex center" interchangeably. My understanding is that these are not the same: the root chakra is the first major chakra located at the base of the spine, thus it's name. The sex center, is definitely the second chakra. So, this inconsistancy in naming the chakra, without offering a precise physical location, is a bit confusing. The book does not clear this up either. 
<br />
<br />I think it's safe to assume that it is the second chakra, the sex center and not the root chakra, that Dr. Dyer means.  Between these two chakras, the second a more logical point of focus: it is clearly the center of our sexual energy.
<br />
<br />The other chakra involved in the 'Ah Meditation' (besides the second one, or 'sex center') is the third eye, or sixth chakra. Dr. Dyer does give the location of this chakra so there is no confusion about where to focus.   </span>

                    <span>This CD manifests all of my children to the bathroom everytime I take a shower.  I find Aaaaahhhhhing and Ommmmmmmmming most effective when accompanied by hot steaming water and a great head massage while shampooing my hair.  My children will begin chanting with me outside the door, soon all 5 of us are Aaaaaaaahing in unison.  The baby really gets into it too.  I recommend this as a family nite activity. It also works well for expelling cockroaches or an annoyed husband from the room.   </span>

                    <span>This CD teaches one to raise the Chi up the spine without also teaching that the Chi must descend the spine. This course of action can cause serious damage you. I do not recommend it to people unless they are very experienced in yoga. Also, the manifestations I was hoping for did not occur. There is hope, however, look up psycho-cybernetics, matt furey, and zero resistance living. A little costly, however, Matt Furey's "Magnetic Mind Power" has already got me past the first round of interviews with Morgan Stanley after five days of practice. </span>
