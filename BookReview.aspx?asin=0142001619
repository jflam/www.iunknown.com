                    <span>Filled with interesting information, if a few too many recipes, Salt makes for a great read.  Who knew the aquisition of salt played such a prominent role in human history?  The narrative is easy to follow along, interesting, and paints a picture that was completely new to me.  If you like following historical threads, then this is a must-read.</span>

                    <span>Having read and loved "Cod" by Mr. Kurlansky, I was looking forward to "Salt".  Cod was interesting, readable and entertaining as well as being a comprehensive history of an interesting and little known topic.  I thought Salt would be the same.  Perhaps the best way to sum up the difference between the successful Cod and the tedious Salt is to note that Cod was 294 pages and Salt, 449.
<br />
<br />Salt is tedious and redundant.  There is no central theme.  The author takes us all around the world, salt lick by brine spring to relate how every salt producer produced the salt and then distributed used or distributed it.  There were plenty of trees, but Mr. Kurlansky never found the forest.  Every chapter was merely a new stop on the tour.  The tour was so disorganized that it did not proceed geographically nor by time.
<br />
<br />A few hundred pages shorter and this would have been so much better.  A few examples of salt production types and an overview would have improived it to be readable and interesting.
<br />
<br />There are some pearls such as the Chinese were producing salt with the aid of natural gas while Europeans were virtually still in caves.  The Egyptian mummification was also interesting.  Unfortunately, these were in the first chapters.  
<br />
<br />Interestingly, Mr. Kurlansky's history virtually ignores the twentieth century.  Very little is included about the 20th and 21st centuries except a few excerpts of salt producing areas that went under and the noting that Morton and Cargill are now the two largest producers.  Virtually nothing was included about how they got that way or how salt use and production compares today with 100-200 years ago.
<br />
<br />This is a very tough read.  I would not recommend it after the first 80-100 pages.  With those read, unfortunately, you've got the book.</span>

                    <span>Salt is well written... it opens with a short personal experience which hooked me.... the book covers the historical development/discovery/usage of salt... there is description on the various types of salt and how it is derived.... the author takes you on a globe trotting experince throughtout history...
<br />if you are interested in history or books on everything about "one" thing ..then salt will appeal to you... I love this book!!!!! read it!!!!!! even if you hate reading!!!!</span>

                    <span>Kurlansky is a passionate researcher and a good writer. He has written books on different subjects, all of them characterized by a love for historical detail and a good writing style. He has written books on apparently trivial topics and in this book he choose to give importance and historically characterize an element of everydays gastronomy: salt. In the past, when refrigerators were no available, salting food was the most efficient way of preserving it. And obtaining salt from seawater is not as easy as one may imagine. For those reasons the history of salt is an interesting and surprising one. Kurlansky has focused on some special moments in the history of salt and has depicted its importance in economy and sociology as well as in food preparation and gastronomy. As a result the book may interest the historician as much as the food expert. The book is rich in trivia and never fails to surprise for the accuracy of information. For being a book about common kitchen salt this book is very long, but one can hardly blame the author for being so enthusiastic and complete in his excursus. This book is not memorable and is probably not going to change your life in any way, but is good and entertaining reading. </span>

                    <span>At first glace a book on the topic of Salt would seem mundane and somewhat pedantic.  Upon reading, however, you begin to realize the impact that salt in its various forms, its production, and its use in preserving food has had in shaping major historical events.  From the colonization of the new world, the rationale for the wealth and success (and fall) of old world cities, and the US civil war, salt has been a major influence on the course of history.  It is an interesting lens through which to look at world history.</span>
