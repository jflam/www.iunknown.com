                    <span>I used this book to prepare for my Exam 1z0-031 but not as main reference. I used it to supplement the Sybex Study guide. It has some errors but I would say it is a decent book to use as preparation tool. I liked the practice exam questions. I did not have to buy any sotware for my practice exam questions. Those already in this book helped me.<br>I give 3 stars and I will definitely recommend this book as supplement to the Sybex study guide if you are preparing for OCP exam Exam 1z0-031.</span>

                    <span>I used this Oracle Press book, the Sybex book, and the Self Test Software prep questions to pass the Oracle Fundamentals I exam.  <p>This book has received justifiable bad press.  I bought it anyway, as I did not want to risk missing any material that might be presented in the "official" Oracle exam guide.  I'm sure you'll buy it for the same reason.<p>The Oracle Press book was difficult to read.  The issues go beyond spelling errors and the many "Oracle 8I" references that should say "Oracle 9i".  I can correct these errors myself. This book has serious editing issues that will impact your ability to understand the concepts presented.  The author knows his stuff but the editor really dropped the ball.  Oracle should take pity on certified hopefuls and rewrite it.<p>However, not all is lost.  You can avoid getting mired down in Oracle's presentation by printing the exam objectives from the Oracle web site and focus your studies around this outline.  Consider buying the Sybex book as an added guide.  Pull details from both books using your exam ojective outline.  The only exam objective I found to be missing from the Oracle Press book was on NLS.  NLS is covered in the Sybex book.<p>Good luck!</span>

                    <span>This book blows.  I read to book cover to cover and it misses alot of the key concepts covered on the exam.  It dosen't go into enough detail in areas that need to be and goes into to much detail into subject such as utilities such as OEM.  I don't even remember the book covering NLS topics.  I suggest ordering a different prep book for this exam and buying STS software.</span>

                    <span>- Lacks typical reference structure, making it tedious to find information.<br><br>- Index is sorely lacking and doesn't have enough terms in it.<br><br>- No quick reference lists or comparisons to differentiate 9i from previous versions.<br><br>- Paragraphs used when bullet, numbered, or outline lists would have explained the concepts better.<br><br>- Only a minimal amount of 9i specific information is included, which can be good/bad depending on one's experience level.<p>Conclusion: Buy it used if you must indeed buy it.</span>

It could be handy on the job to verify and possibly improve the procedures you have implemented, especially if the procedures have been in place for a while and you have upgraded recently.</span>
