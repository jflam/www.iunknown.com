Also explored: the Golden Section, geometrical shapes on the plane, geometrical shapes in space, crystal lattices and many other fascinating topics.<br></span>

                    <span>I'm not a mathematician, but I still found this book to be readable. It is largely focused on the Golden Section (Phi) and related proportions, including Fibonacci numbers, sqrt(Phi), etc. The explanation of how to derive this number is clearly explained in the first few chapters. The following chapters show how Phi is related to most things we see everyday, including architecture, 5-point animals, crystal latticies, art, and music. This book is quite old, so the illustrations seem rather antiquated. Nonetheless, the quantity and clarity of these illustrations are impressive.<P>The writing was clear, but the concepts were occasionally difficult to understand. The author made mention of "gnomic" growth a number of times without really giving a single clear definition. Also, I felt that a number of the tie-ins between Phi and architecture were a bit of a stretch. Most likely you could overlay any graph over a blueprint and see any proportion you'd want to see. At any rate, this book has gotten me interested in this subject, and I will be looking for more books on Phi.</span>

                    <span>This excellent book, written in 1946, still remains in print, and for good reason. Ghyka shows mathematically that objects in nature are not randomly formed, but all have regularity and harmony.<BR>Beginning with the concepts of ratio and proportion in the plane, the Golden Section, and then to regular polygons and geometric shapes in 3 dimensions, Ghyka demonstrates these patterns with simple algebra and geometry, and plenty of diagrams. <BR>He explains the logarithmic spiral and its role in harmonious growth in nature, with photographs and diagrams. He shows how ancient builders used the Golden Section in their architecture and in their art. This book is a wonderful weaving of philosophy, mathematics and science, covering a lot of ground, and is very well-written. It is nothing like trying to wade through H.M.S. Coxeter! This book would be a fine companion to Cook's "The Curves of Life," fleshing out the concepts presented there.<BR>This little book is a gem -- there is a tremendous amount of information packed into its 174 pages, yet it is understandable to the layperson. And it is aptly titled. It truly is about "The Geometry of Art and Life." <BR>If you are one of those observant persons who is looking for a more detailed understanding of the underlying patterns in nature, art and architecture, and you don't mind spending a little time going through some simple algebra and geometry, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>Why are beautiful works of art beautiful? What makes a striking piece of architecture striking? Why is it we find such pleasure in admiring a flower, or a tree? Rather than addressing these questions from a subjective standpoint, Ghyka analyzes the mathematical geometry of classical art, architecture, and biology and attempts to find a common thread to bind them all together. It's a wonderful mix of mathematics and history with a touch of philosophy to season it well. The math is simple, the sort of high-school geometry we've all had and forgotten, but it's critical for the understanding of his argument. If you hate math, you're probably not going to enjoy this book, but if you love art, and are willing to entertain an opinion as to _why_ you love it, I'd recommend suffering through it anyway - I've certainly developed a deeper appreciation of art and aesthetics in reading this book, and think it could be very valuable to serious (or not so serious) art lovers and artists.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a ver comprehensive approach in proving how everything exists in one way or the other according to definite mathematical calculations. This book is serious reading for everyone, especially persons whose profession depends on mathematics such as engineers, architects, teachers, artists, mucicians, financial analysts etc. Wall Street experts who follow the theories of the legendary W.D. Gann would be aazed to see a diagram on page 31 & 166 that resembles the Gann :master squares."</span>
