                    <span>Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman is the subject of this well-written and thorough biography by James Gleick.  Feynman's life proves to be a fascinating one, and Gleick delves without hesitation into his eccentricities, clearly portraying the way his offbeat personality influenced his interactions and conflicts with other members of the science community, notably R. J. Oppenheimer, Hans Bethe, Julian Schwinger, Freeman Dyson, and Murray Gell-Mann.  The book is divided into sections according to where Feynman lived and worked, giving a clear-cut path to trace throughout his life.  From his early life in Far Rockaway, a small town in New York, through his schooling at MIT and Princeton; from his work at Los Alamos with that fated group of scientists who produced the world's first nuclear weapon to his teaching job at Cornell, and from his work at Caltech and with NASA to his death from cancer in 1988, Gleick illustrates the remarkable achievements of this man who affected all with whom he came into contact, for better or worse.  Although for the most part vivid and witty, Gleick's prose tends to bog down from time to time, especially when he enters the abstract world of quantum mechanics, which formed the basis of Feynman's work.  The author's explanations of theories and concepts put forth by Feynman as well as work submitted by his contemporaries can quickly cause a layman to have to reread sections several times, and one almost wishes Gleick would curtail these sections; however, once understood (and it is possible!), the explanations are invaluable in appreciating Feynman's work.  Despite this, Gleick does an admirable job of recounting Richard Feynman's accomplishments without glossing over his shortcomings.  When reading <u>Genius</u>, it is easy to see why Gleick would be attracted to this colorful character as the subject of a biography.  Feynman's life was so full and so multidimensional, and his discoveries in the world of physics were such landmarks, that it is impossible not to admire him - especially once you manage to grasp the theories he put forth, which are truly enlightening regarding the physical world around us.  For anyone with any background or interest in physics, if only at a high-school introductory level, this inspiring novel is an absorbing and thought-provoking read detailing arguably the most influential life in the physics community in the twentieth century.</span>

                    <span>...one of the best non-technical books I've read in a year or so.  I do physics so I certainly liked the author's technical tidbits along the way.  If possible, this book can be read side-by-side with the collected works of RPF to get a sense of the work the author refers to.  The depth to which the personality of RPF is portrayed is amazing, going so far into his issues with love and meaningless sex in an era when such was unspeakable.  The only criticism is that so much of the information given in this book can be found elsewhere, including freely in his Nobel lecture, but the contiguous nature of this work is more satisfying, perhaps.
<br />
<br />As an editorial aside, if you're speculating about who's a genius and trying to prove how keen you are by pointing out the author's  small mistakes, you haven't understood RPF's purpose in life at all.  I pity you.</span>

                    <span>This is the only book I will ever give 5 stars, because reading it is a spiritual experience.  It came from my old supervisor's library collection and later I purchased my own copy.
<br />
<br />Gleick's conception of physics is quite accurate, and his writing style is sufficiently colourful, that this is one of the few books I always go back for passages.  His writing of Feymann, his colleagues, and certain events are almost like reading a novel, adding charm to the otherwise blend perception to the world of science.
<br />
<br />More importantly, it is Gleick's portrayal of Feymann as human -- with flaws, feelings, friends and enemies -- than a mystical figure, that makes it wonderful to read as a biography.  He made no attempt to glorify his achievements, nor did he praise his talents.  This, I find, a very humble gesture.
<br />
<br />In fact, this is such an impact to me, when I finished reading this book, I decided to quit work and persue my Ph.D., which I am doing now.</span>

                    <span>When I was in graduate school, this book was an inspiration.  It remains one of my favorite biographies.  Those who criticize Gleick for not understanding the physics have not read his other books, and do not understand his unique approach to science journalism.  Like an impressionist painter he gives the 'feeling' of the science, through metaphors and simple examples, and then lets those examples motivate the character and emotional life of his subject.  This isn't a book about science, but about the interaction between science and scientist.  It actually reaches a crescendo about halfway through, when Gleick offers his personal meditation on genius.  Given his more recent biography on Newton, one can see this theme running throughout his works: what is it that elevates the scientific genius from the masses?  A true masterpiece.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I actually thought Gleick did a fairly decent job of conveying how Feynman's interest in physics developed, how he worked, and how he contributed to the development of science.  His relationship with Freeman Dyson and how Dyson helped bring Feynman's QED theory to the physics world is a good example.  As other's have pointed out, the book does gloss over the last few decades of Feynam's life, which is unfortunate.  Only a couple of chapters cover the years after Feynam's nobel prize.  
<br />
<br />Its when Gleick's attempting to explain quantum mechanics and Feynman's work in physics that he tends to get into the most trouble.  Its very technical, esoteric stuff, and Gleick's expanations just seem incomplete or impossible to follow.  Since they often go on for pages, this makes for some difficult reading.  
<br />
<br />Gleick would have been better off keeping his explanations of the science to a very general level, I think.  This is not to say that avoid the science completely, not at all.  Its just that a truely deep, thorough explanation of this stuff would require a book in itself.  Let the reader know why Feynman's theories on QED were important, how it changed the way phsyicists thought about this stuff, that Feynaman's diagrams were a great scientific tool.  Leave it to other books (like those by John Griggon) to explain things further, to get into the nuts and bolts of it, where they can do it justice. </span>
