                    <span>This is how a photo guide should be:  excellent photos, detailed maps, ideal time of day, optimal season.  Additionally it is compact and reasonably priced.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I love this book!!  Thank-you to Michael Frye for taking on this project.  I hope he goes to other national parks and writes more books.  Michael not only shows photos and tells where to get them, he goes into great detail about what time of day, type of film, use of filters, depth of field, exposure... everything a "professional photographer-in-the-making" can use.</span>

                    <span>...It has illustrations for all kinds of photographic techniques including advice on seasons, film, lenses needed, important time of days etc. Definitely worth buying it. You can finish reading this book in couple of hours in car while somebody else is driving. i did the same.  In my opinion it would really help if the authur included some kind of readmap you can follow so that u can be at right places at right time. (although considering the vastness of yosemite, i am sure it will be a difficult job) All in all great little book. i would recommend to buy it in advance...to take full advantage of authur's suggessions.</span>

                    <span>Michael Frye has done a wonderful job guiding the photographer be they a novis or pro through most of Yoesmities jewels.  His experience and wisdom of the art of photography are real treasures that make this book a "must" for anyone traveling to the area.  Yosemites beauity and tips to capture it in pictures are explained in simple yet profound detail.</span>
