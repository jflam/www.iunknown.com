                    <span>For those who are interested in the management of organizational knowledge and intangible assets, 'Valuing intangible assets'should prove to be highly practical. There are many knowledge management frameworks out there that assist business executive to manage their intangible assets (such as Sveiby's intangible asset monitor), the practical usage of these frameworks would be greatly enhanced by incorporating the valuation aspect of intangible assets. The author provides a comprehensive illustration of both the 'scientific' & 'artistic' aspects of valuating intangible assets. The book is easy to read with useful examples, it is a rare one in the market.</span>

                    <span>A larger portion of the value of a company nowadays comes from Intangibles (brands, patents, workforce & related contracts, durable customers etc.). This holds true in several industry sectors. Measurement of intangibles is a fascinating subject, but until this book was published, there was no single body of knowledge available to guide the general reader, or a Valuation professional. You had to work in one of the reputed valuation firms to be exposed to the techniques. This book is by far the best practitioner-oriented Intangibles Valuation book I have come across. It is very comprehensive in terms of the topics it covers, and does a wonderful job of covering almost all intangibles of interest. Each chapter is written by a relevant expert, and this invariably leads to variations in quality and some lack of consistency. However, for the most part, it is very well written, and definitely worth the price it sells for.</span>

                    <span>A great book for anyone or performs valuations of intangible assets or wants to learn how. I believe that this book will become to intangible valuation what Pratt's book is to business valuation.</span>

                    <span>The authors rely on their extensive professional experiences in this field to provide a comprehensive description of the three valuation methods for intangible assets--cost, market, and income methods. Easy to read, this book explains the nuances of each method in more detail than similar books available in the market. It reads more like an accessible textbook than a vague primer on the subject. It also contains many insightful and valuable case examples of how the methods are applied to different real life cases. As an MBA student, I have benefitted greatly from this book and will probably use it as a reference in the future.<P>I hope future editions will include option pricing valuation methods.</span>
