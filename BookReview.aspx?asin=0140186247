                    <span>Will you enjoy reading this book? The answer is no. But if you were to ask me if you should read this book then I would have to say absolutely. Borowski wrote with an honesty that I found amazing. He gave me a small window to look through and see what my grandparents might have gone through. This book while often shocking and always disturbing allows a little understanding into what life was like inside the death camps. Not for enjoyment but education.</span>

                    <span>Borowski's account of life in Aushcwitz is a classic.  The brutality, inhumanity, and gruesome daily life in the hell-on-earth that was the Holocaust is matter-of-factly, even non-chalantly described and recounted in _This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen_.  Little wonder the author put his own head in a gas oven in the years following his experiences.  The images are haunting.  But what I found to be most disturbing was the simple language Borowski used in retelling his experiences.  <p>Borowski, a Pole, lived separately from the Jews who were daily incenerated.  And while his life was unimaginably difficult, by some measure it was better than that of the Jews.  A sense of guilt - call it survivors guilt, or regret, or perhaps at its most elemental level, deep and profound sadness - permeates the book, as it should.  It is a remarkable read, profound and stunning.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>First of all, the narrator is not Jewish; he is a Pole that lived apart from the Jews in the camp and therefore got better treatment.  Apart from that, what really makes this an interesting read is the way that the narrator sort of looks at life in a concentration camp rather non chalantly.  There's a great variety of different emotions being presented here.  He gets bored, tired, lonely, and angry, all while telling of the horrors of the camp as a sort of backing.  The perspective really makes it interesting, and its small, and written in an easy to read manner.  You could read this in about two hours if you really tried.  Read the story about the Russian soliders being executed.  Its almost as horrifying as a Lovecraft story!  For anyone interested in the Holocaust, this is a definate must read.</span>

                    <span>Borowski's depiction of his days spent as an inmate in Auschwitz are totally gripping.  Because the book is short stories, he is able to give different pictures and perspectives of the "Auschwitz Life" through the experiences of numerous inmates and incidents.<p>Incredibly, Borowski has a tremendously talented way of describing the virtually indescrible horror of the scene, without being grisly and gory.  But his point is so poignantly made with the book, that it is really almost a must read for those interested in just how horribly people can treat other people.<p>While suicide is very rare amongst Holocaust survivors, the ones who do commit it, have a very high percentage of authors, poets and artists.  These being the ones who felt the pain so deeply, that at some point, they could no longer live with what they had seen.  Sadly, Borowski did take his life, and perhaps ironically, he gassed himself to death.<p>Once the reader has read his rendition, it is easy to understand why he cannot live with what he saw anymore, and in fact, it is hard to understand sometimes why so many other Holocaust survivors don't take their own lives.  <p>The book is beautifully written, almost poetic at times.  And it is hard to imagine anything about Auschwitz being poetic, but Borowski does manage to do it in this book.  I would recommend the book to anyone who really wants to get a picture of just how low humanity can sink in extreme conditions.</span>

                    <span>This is an account of a life lived in the shadows of the crematoria. It is based on the author's experience as a non-Jew, in a German concentration camp.  As a non-Jew, Borowski was entitled to certain privileges.  He maintained his position in the hierarchy by following the orders of the S.S. guards: by ordering the Jews to line up on their way to the gas chambers, and by sorting through the luggage of the dead.  This book is dark, dark realism, and Borowski doesn't shy away from the details (descriptions of the pit where corpses were burned are especially difficult to forget).  Borowski lived at a time when, as Jan Kott writes in the introduction: "individual human destiny seems as if shaped directly by history, becoming only a chapter in it."  Borowski provided us with this, his chapter.  His destiny was suicide, and this direct, raw account of a terrible ordeal helps us to understand why.</span>
