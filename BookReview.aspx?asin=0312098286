                    <span>For over a year I've been practicing the spirtual beliefs of the I Ching through this book, and I've yet to find a better translation of it's teachings.  Frustrating as the teachings are (in that they are so simple, plain, and seemingly obvious), once you begin to cultivate the teachings, you cultivate the superiors in yourself, and as long as you follow the path of the Sage, you will see the change in yourself, and thusly, the change in your environment and those around you.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book several months ago based on the Customer Reviews. It has had a profound effect on my life.Its answers are consistently amazing, deep,nuanced response to my situation. Thanks to the reviewers who took the time to respond--but a special thanks to Brian Browne Walker.</span>

                    <span>Okay, I'll admit it. I've tried several times over the years to understand the traditional translations of the I Ching, like the Wilhelm/Baynes. Frankly, they're much too steeped in ancient Chinese cultural thinking for me to understand. And I think I'm a pretty smart fellow.<p>Brian Browne Walker's translation is amazing. I find it to be a tremendously helpful oracle. The wisdom contained in this translation is a great testament to Walker, and of course to the ancient Chinese authors.<p>This book has helped me countless times. It never ceases to be an aid to me in times of confusion. I'm not sure *how* it works--but it does! This is one of the most helpful books I own.</span>

                    <span>Of the books I have reviewed, this book is by far the most "user friendly" to a beginner.   Mr. Walker's book is a great starter on the journey towards studying and achieving a deeper understanding of the I Ching... one that won't scare the reader off at the outset.</span>

                    <span>I'm sad I had to find this book at [a local store] before I saw it here!  (This book didn't come up in my Amazon searches for "I Ching" when I searched the first time.)<p>In any case, I first encountered this book at my local library while doing some general browsing.  For someone who had not previously studied the I Ching before, it was easy, accessible, and devoid of any difficult esoteric philosophies to comb through while utilizing this absolutely valuable tool.  If you are looking for a great, simple book to begin your education in the I Ching, I absolutely recommend this book.  With this book and three cents, you have the keys to the wisdom of the universe!<p>(An exageration, perhaps, but the book is THAT easy to grasp and use.  At the same time, it's THAT profound.  Use the I Ching's wisdom, or ignore it--at your peril.)</span>
