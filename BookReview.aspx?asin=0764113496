                    <span>If you are serious about studying a foreign language, the most important thing you can do is learn to conjugate verbs correctly. Russian is no exception to this rule. This book is an excellent tool for anyone who has trouble with conjugation. Each verb is fully conjugated with perfective and imperfective forms, as well as past and future tenses. More than any other reference book this one will help you to drastically improve your speaking abilities.</span>

                    <span>The supposed value of this book lies in the fact that it lists verbs in all their conjugations and tenses. Whereas this may be helpful for beginners, the fact of the matter is that once you learn the grammar rules governing verbs, you won't need this book!<P>However, in all fairness I must write two good things about this book. First, seeing all the conjugations and tenses of a verb laid out on one page is helpful in making sense of the various verb forms, especially in terms of keeping them distinct from each other. And second, this book provides a list of some of the most useful verbs that you can study as a beginning student of the language.<P>My advice is to examine your own personal learning style and ask yourself if you really need this book, because once I learned the rules of verb formation, this book did little more than gather dust on my shelf.</span>

                    <span>Unlike Turkish or Japanese (in which the irregular verbs can be counted on the fingers of one hand, at least in the case of Japanese), Russian, like Latin, Spanish, German, and many other languages, has lots of both regular and irregular verbs. Spanish, which I know better than Russian, has 22 commonly used verbs that are irregular in the present indicative tense, and the same 18 are also irregular in the present subjunctive. But 12 of those have the same pattern in the present indicative, so once you get this idea, the situation is not as bad as it at first seems. There are similar patterns in Russian, and it helps to have them laid out for you and explained, which this book does. As someone pointed out, the hundreds of pages of regularly conjugated verbs really aren't needed once you get the pattern for the regular ones, and this book could have been reduced to a few pages that way, but for beginners it's still useful to have that. <P>Considering that language learners now have the choice of getting handheld language translation computers like the well-known models from Franklin, which aren't that much more than this book, and which will give you the definitions of 60,000 words, along with other notes on the grammar, games, word completion, and other features, it's interesting to see that these books are still surviving so well.<P>One useful feature is the section where the colloquial uses of various verbs are explained, which is useful too, and the Spanish version of this book has the same feature. This section focuses on commonly used verbal phrases that are not unlike the ones in use in English that cause so many problems for foreign speakers. These are phrases like "run away from, or come up on," in English. But since English has done away with case markers and now mostly relies on word order, there are many more thousands of them in English than in Russian or Spanish. NTC's recent dictionary of English verbal phrases and phrasal verbs listed 12,000. <P>But getting back to this book, this is still an excellent reference for the beginner to intermediate speaker and I can recommend it for that.</span>

                    <span>I'm a beginner and a language lover, and when a friend of mine gave me this book as a gift I was thrilled. It lists Russian alphabetical order in the front, which is helpful for newbies like myself, and also has an index in the back where you can look up the English verb. As a beginner, this is very helpful. I have never not been able to find a verb here. However, I would not recommend it for someone who has not studied Russian at all. It does not describe the different forms of the verbs, and it can be a little confusing at first. Also, the ability to read Cyrillic is a must; there is no romanization.</span>

                    <span>A great reference guide for any beginner or intermediate student of Russian. Verbs are organized nicely as well as conjugated clearly and thoroughly. If you are a high school or college student feeling overwhelmed by the "russian verb system," buy this book and see the improvements in your compositions, reading abilities, and conversation.</span>
