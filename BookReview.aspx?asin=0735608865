                    <span>This book is the final word on windows debugging. Not surprising since it comes from one of the authors of the award winning software: "Bounds Checker"<p>I really enjoyed the chapter on x86 assembly. It covers what needs to be known to read through assembly code when the debugger tosses it at you.<p>Trying to list all the good stuff in the book will take more time than I can devote right now. What I don't understand is why the book is now out of print. I'm sure some people out there still want to stick to native code and these people deserve to have this book. I'm happy I got mine before it went under.</span>

                    <span>I have four debugging books on the shelf above my monitor.  This is the one I refer to most.  I have over 30 years programming experience, about ten in C and C++, and I find that this book is an excellent resource.  I still haven't read it cover to cover, and the CD is still sealed - much of it is on MSDN in some form anyway - so some of the other review complaints may have merit.  Notwithstanding all of those, this is an excellent book, and you will probably get a good return on your investment in time and money.<p>For the record, the other three books are:<br>- Windows 2000 Kernel Debugging - may be more useful for device driver debugging<br>- Debugging Windows Programs - not bad, perhaps a little less intense than this book<br>- Debugging C++ - This is probably a little light for me, but I have a lot of background in debugging from other platforms.  If you find the John Robbins book too challenging, this may be a good start<p>And this last brings up the only possible shortcoming of this book.  I think the reader needs a certain level of knowledge, experience, and commitment to being a professional Windows programmer to get the most value from it.  If you have these qualities, this book is invaluable.  If not, you may find it very useful as you get more experience.  Excellent choice in any event.</span>

                    <span>You deliver a product. Soon an e-mail arrives - its crashed. "The register are .., the stack (and values) is .., the process address space is partitioned as follows (with values) .., the OS is ...". Now get real !! This book will give you the full info on how to get all that info from a crash (ie. to **write your own "core" dump**), and the user can send it to you - then you can hopefully backtrack to its origin. It gives you all the necessary info on assembly language (the book is worth getting just for this), but also the deep knowledge needed to track down almost any bugs - this is because it **actually shows you how to write a debugger**, and this imparts to you the "deep" info you need to know. Normal debugger usage is covered, but I regard this as trivial compared to the rest of the book. Compared to McKay's book, it is much deeper and goes into the "dirty stuff" that a "real" application programmer would need. An earlier review stated "why would anyone want to know how debuggers work"; all I can say is that anyone who thinks like this should not get this book (and should not be coding either). Oh yes, I am sorry to say I am also not going to give any petty criticism about something missing off the CD. But I will say that .COD files should have been mentioned. You can get these by setting the listing option on the VC++ project/options/C++ tab to source/assembly/machine_code - these are indispensable (with or without a .PDB - look at them and you will know why), but this is forgivable considering how good this book is. Get McKays book as well - it is still a very good book but the focus is at a higher level.</span>

                    <span>I'm a conference speaker and author myself (and no, I don't know John personally ;-)). I recently read this book while on train to/from a developer conference and there's just one word: excellent!<p>If you need to understand how debuggers work and how to work through x86 assembly during debugging this book is for you! Even though I'm not a C/C++ programmer but instead concentrate on the .NET Framework using C#, I guess this book is one of the best I ever read - and .NET definitely doesn't make it obsolete in any way. And it's not only the information provided in this book but also the author's writing style which make it exceptional fun to read.<p>Thanks for a great book!</span>

                    <span>John Robbins book is clearly written and easy to follow.  He has valuable insights and provides wonderful examples and utilities.  His BugSlayerUtil has been extremely useful in tracking down bugs within my software.  Such a useful tool should not go unheralded.<p>John has taken some hits becasue he was not able to include several .lib and dll files on his CD.  This is not his fault but rather Microsofts licensing agreement.  He goes out of his way to explain this and point you in the right directions to obtain the files.<p>This book is a must have among serious developers.<p>ETH</span>
