                <span id="Label1">This tenth anniversary hardcover edition celebrates the Great Basin wilderness in all seasons. "The Great Basin is one of the least novelized, least painted, least eulogized of American landscapes. Stephen Trimble has opened it up with the perception of a frontier scout, but for  a different set of people this time: people more eager to know than to possess, more eager to understand than utilize."-Barry Lopez, from the foreword  <P>The Sagebrush Ocean "will be a revelation to those who have habitually steeled themselves to drive across the desert at seventy miles an hour, generally at night. They have been missing something fabulous. . . . It ought to be in the pack of every desert camper and every off-road recreationist, just to teach them respect for what they use so freely. It ought to be on the seat of every car that starts across from Salt Lake to Reno, or vice versa, to give even seventy-mile-an-hour travelers some notion of what that apparently monotonous sagebrush ocean contains of the diversity and mystery of life."-Wallace Stegner  <P>"The Sagebrush Ocean is one beauty of a book, a triumph of regional literature of the kind we need, to relate more closely to his land of ours."-Harold Gilliam, The San Francisco Chronicle</span>

                    <span>If you were to only have one book on the Great Basin - this should be it. It covers the flora & fauna of this least know section of the lower 48 in a comprehesive, yet not belabored fashion. Plenty of salient details with a minimum - though adequate - smattering of scientific jargon. Even though I have worked for a public land management agency in the "Basin" for over 2 decades, I learned much and enhanced my understanding of things I did know. The photography by Trimble captures the inescapable beauty of the area that is unknown to the typical drive-through-as-fast-as-you-can tourist. There is no finer book - verbiage or photographic - on this largely unpopulated jewell of complex arid ecosystems.</span>

                    <span>This book was GREAT! Between the pictures and maps I found an author who shows a great deal of expression, passion and dedication to his work. Using common names for plants and animals except when specific subspecies are mentioned made the book much more readable for a layperson such as myself.<P>My next trip to the Great Basin in Oregon will be more fulfilling and educational as much of my ignorance about this special area has been dispelled.<P>To date this is the best money I have spent on a book about the Great Basin.<P>(Originally wrote this in 1999 and feel even stronger about this book in 2004!)</span>

                    <span>If I were to recommend a single "must have" book about the Great Basin Desert, this would be the one! It is the single best one-volume introduction to the natural history of the Great Basin that I know of, and is well illustrated with his own photography. He was writing on behalf of the Desert Research Institute, and spent six years on this particular project. Stephan Trimble exemplifies the best traditions in writing about Natural History. He combines the scientific reason and clarity of a Voltaire, with the poetic sensitivity of Rousseau. My copy is so bedraggled from being packed all over the Basin, I've got to get a new one soon!</span>

                    <span>This book is a must-read for anyone who loves the smell of Sagebrush after a rain and the austere wildness of the Great Basin. It is apparent that Stephen Trimble loves this land and makes it clear that the country between the Wasatch and the Sierra is brimming with life. Trimble evokes the Great Basin like no other. If you respect writers like Edward Abbey, 'The Sagebrush Ocean' is a great factual resource to back up any conservationist leaning.</span>
