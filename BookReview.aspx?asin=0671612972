                <span id="Label1">Ben Hogan's premise in this 1957 classic is driven home in bold letters: "THE AVERAGE GOLFER IS ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF BUILDING A REPEATING SWING AND BREAKING 80." Religions are founded on less, and Hogan's detailed analyses and illustrated demonstrations of grip, stance, posture, and the two basic components of the swing make up a sacred book. Though its very simplicity seems dated, this is the tome of technique that should serve as the foundation of every golf library.</span>

                    <span>It's true. Leadbetter and McClain have both found problems with Hogan's Five Lessons, especially for those who do not share his physique or his typical swing faults. Mann's Swing Like a Pro describes the modern golf swing much better, and the LAWS of the Golf Swing describes how golfers of different physical styles tend to strike the ball most effectively.<P>Still, this book is a classic that every golfer should own.<P>By today's standards Hogan was short, wiry, with unusually powerful shoulders and arms. What Leadbetter and McClain do not mention is that people who share Hogan's physique (like me) can pretty much take every word as gospel. If you have the same sort of physique and follow everything in this book, from the grip and stance to the backswing, the backstroke and swing planes, driving with the hips, and supinating the left wrist through impact, then you will get a very impressive swing, especially with irons. Woods may take a little adjustment, and for the short game and putting see Dave Pelz's Bibles. For pure ball striking, this is a perfect description of the classic golf swing.<P>I've been told that though Hogan was a deep thinker on the subject of the full swing, that he was the best putter on tour during his winning years. It's too bad he didn't put his thoughts on putting down on paper, because if he had, it would be THE classic on that topic too.</span>

                    <span>I purchased "The Fundamentals of Hogan" by Leadbetter at the same time. I'm glad I did. While Hogan has written an excellent book which I'm sure will be a classic read long after I'm dead, Leadbetter was able to put it in perspective. Hogan explains the swing as it worked for him. While many of the fundamental aspects of the swing are applicable to everybody, trying to implement some of his techniques can really mess you up if you don't understand how the golf swing can be different for different people. Leadbetter gave me this insight. I would recommend buying both or if you only have money for one or the other then buy Leadbetter's book.</span>

                    <span>This classic is an exceptional, readable, and all-encompassing study of the golf swing. I learned much about my swing studying this book. The only problem I encountered was none of the information was very relavant to me or the vast majority of golfers who suffer from a slice.<P>Ben Hogan had a strong hook and much of this book includes his corrections to overcome this deficit and straighten out his swing. However, for the slicer, these corrections do the opposite - my slice was worse than ever after following Hogan's advice and I couldn't correct it.<P>An excellent book, for starters or as a follow-on to Hogan's "Five Lessons", is Leadbetter's "The Fundamentals of Hogan". Leadbetter reviews the Hogan swing, then tells why it doesn't work for most (Hogan was double-jointed, Hogan was correcting his hook, etc.) and what you should really do. After Leadbetter, I did straighten out my swing. <P>Both books break the swing down into 5 parts: Grip, Stance, Backswing, Downswing, Summary.<P>While Hogan's book was groundbreaking and certainly deserves a read, if you want to learn a basic swing, Leadbetter's is far more encompassing and just as readable.</span>

                    <span>There's only so much you can learn from a book. Ben Hogan basically invented the modern golf swing but I think lessons would be more helpful. Save your money and go play a round or two, its the best way to improve.</span>

                    <span>Not to be too overly gushy but this book revolutionized my golf game. I have shot in the 100+ range my entire life (35) and after reading this book a few times and practicing the techniques at the range I instantly started to shoot in the 90's. His instruction is simple to understand and the pictures are a great help to visualize the actions. I know refer back to this book at least once a month if my swing starts to get out of whack. It is the best $10.00 you will ever spend on your game.</span>
