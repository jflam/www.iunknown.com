                <span id="Label1">All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire&#8217;s richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world&#8217;s largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.<br><br>But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the &#64257;rst time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta&#8217;s sixty-mile main line&#8212;somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.<br><br>Attilius&#8212;decent, practical, and incorruptible&#8212;promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work&#8212;both natural and man-made&#8212;threatening to destroy him.<br><br>With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of <b>Archangel</b> and <b>Fatherland</b>, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.</span>

                    <span>I liked Robert Harris' Pompeii. I read it in a few days, enjoyed it, and found the story to be well written. But - there is a but - it could be boring at times. It was definitely not the 5* nocel I had expected it to be. Anyway, I loved the ancient setting in the Roman city of Pompeii with all it's hustlers, decadent senators, prostitutes, slaves and gladiators. The main character is the young engineer Marcus, who has travelled from Rome to take over the job as water-engineer in the area around Pompeii. He soon discovers that something is wrong, and the story takes place on this the last days of Pompeii. Will Marcus get out of the city before the volcano erupts? Will he be able to save the girl he can't stop thinking about? Will he find out what happened to the missing water-engineer of Pompeii? The novel is full of interesting questions plus a good deal of 'lessons' about volcanoes, earthquakes and so on. A fairly good read, entertaing.</span>

                    <span>Harris' Pompeii does a very good job of combining history with fiction. Through the research I have done, I have found the novel to be very historically accurate. This is a plus for the book considering the fictional plot is very simple and doesn't have a lot of development to it. The characters also are one-dimensional for the most part, all though there is some change in attitudes in Ampliatus, Corelia, and Attilus. This doesn't bring down the book though, because the way Harris uses historical data to make the novel interesting is superb. I found it to be a book I couldn't put down, as I always wanted to see what would happen on the next page. I was a little disappointed with the ending of the book. I felt like Harris did a good job of building up to the climax, but then the book just seemed to drop off. Almost as if the last chapter was missing. This is the only complaint I have of the novel. Overall packed with high energy and lots of excitement. A good and easy pleasure read. Recommend to all.</span>

                    <span>I cannot say I liked this book. It had its moments, but they were few and far between. Basically the plot is about an Aquarius(A guy who manges the aqueducts of Rome) and a Volcano with a little romance mixed in. Very boring indeed.<P>Premise: The entire story is about the aquarius and his quest to go to Pompeii to fix the aqueduct. Along the way he makes enemies, you don't really know why. He meets a girl, who he likes, but she comes and goes in passing. You meet one really bad guy, but he doesn't come across as really that bad. The main character instead comes off as a panzy woose.<P>There is poor writing and very poor characterization. Each character is briefly described if at all. The ending comes off very fast, and not properly dealt with. In the last 1/8 of the book the mountain explodes, a round about rescue is performed, the bad guys dies and the girl rescued, the end.<P>Avoid this book if possible.</span>

                    <span>Just finished Pompeii, which didn't come alive for me until the last half of the story. The characterizations are a bit shallow, with the exception of Pliny Elder, who is brought to life as a living person rather than the historical icon he'd always been to me. Some of the excesses of Roman society are set forth in a truly revolting fashion! What this book does so well is place the reader on the Bay of Naples, from the initial portents of the volcanic eruption, through the inferno with its deadly hail of rocks, to its completion and the smothering of the cities and their inhabitants. Makes it all real. The only other description of doom and destruction that I've seen done so well is the harrowing artillery bombardment presented by Michael Shaara in "Gettysburg".</span>

                    <span>Having read all of Robert Harris' books, Pompeii is the best of the lot.<BR>His other books, though tantalizing in range and idea often fall flat by the end, but using the backdrop of the eruption of Vesuvius in CE 79, Harris has finally reached the summit.<BR>It starts slowly, but builds to a believable crescendo and does not leave you wanting.<BR>Once the novel picks up speed, there is little you can do to keep from turning its pages.<BR>Even if you are not interested with ancient Rome, you will find the story enjoyable and approachable and most importantly original.</span>
