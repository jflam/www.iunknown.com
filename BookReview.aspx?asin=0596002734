                <span id="Label1"><I>Access Database Design and Programming</I> covers a lot of ground quickly but lucidly.  Steven Roman begins with a description of general principles of database design, then describes the "relational algebra" that defines the meaning of such operations as unions and joins, introduces SQL syntax, and finally dives into the details of using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to write Access code. The result is a single book that can teach you all the basics of building database applications in Access.  Portions of the book are heavy with logical equations whose effects can be hard to visualize, but Roman's judicious use of sample data makes it much easier to follow the operations being described.</span>

                    <span>I haven't read this book, yet.  But, reviewer, Shannon, complained about not being able to get it to work with DAO. The problem is in References.  Her database is probably set with a reference only to ADODB.
<br />
<br />In Module View, just select Tools | Reference and select DAO (Data Access Objects) as the reference.  Then, you should be fine.</span>

                    <span>For a ColdFusion developer, to graph where your interests would probably be, it would look like an inverted bell curve: the beginning is splendid, the middle just wouldn't apply, and the end is worth coming back for.
<br /> 
<br />The beginning of the book talks about stuff that we need to make sure we get down well, regardless of our database platform: Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase - doesn't matter. The first couple of chapters 
<br />talk about stuff that is universally applicable, and under-appreciated:
<br />* Normalization of tables, including first, second, and third normal form. As most experienced database designers know, you may not be able to glance at a database and know second from third, but you 
<br />should take the time to learn the principles of normalization.
<br />* Referential integrity between parent and child tables
<br />* Relationship types: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many
<br />* Join types: inner and outer
<br />
<br />Up to about page 120, ColdFusion developers are all clear. About there, Chapter 7 gets into Access VBA specific problems about accessing and manipulating data, creating DAO connections, and how to 
<br />programmatically manipulate data using VBA. This is interesting stuff in and of itself, but probably not to a ColdFusion developer.
<br /> 
<br />Picking up in Chapter 19, "Some Common Data Manipulation Problems," the party starts again, talking about complex select queries and joins.
<br /> 
<br />From an Access standpoint, this book is chock full of goodies. From the point of view of a ColdFusion developer, I would say this much: if forced to choose between this book and the previous, the Cookbook, I would probably go Cookbook. But, as I mentioned in the previous review, if you work with both Access on the desktop and on the web, using ColdFusion, both of these are good, useful, handy references. Having a greater appreciation of what goes on behind the scenes in Access may help gain a greater appreciation for the larger picture.</span>

                    <span>This is a good first database book, even if you do not use Access. The first five chapters cover material that apply to all DBMS's. Chapters six and seven present universal topics, but elucidate them using Access. For those who are complete novices, you may want to also read Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes by Ben Forta concurrently. I would reccomend reading Roman Chapters 1-4, then Forta chapters 1-6, then Roman Chapter 6, then Forta 7-14, then Roman Chapter 5. Read the rest of the book if you are working in Access. After tackling these two books, you may want to read Practical Issues in database Management by Fabian Pascal. For more specific topical help on Access, read either Alison Balter's Mastering Access Development (different books for different versions), or the Access Cookbook by Getz, Litwin & Baron.</span>

                    <span>I really liked the book, especially the detail with which relationships were described. I have an older version so the programming examples are for DAO. This means you'll get errors if you try the examples in Access 2000 which defaults to ADO. You can add DAO to your components and the examples then work I just ordered a newer version of the book which has updated it's programming section to include ADO.</span>

                    <span>I find some of the complaints about this books to be interesting.  First of all, I have always liked this book (refering to 2nd edition) for its concise simplicity (I wonder if the person who compares it to quantum physics has actually ever studied quantum physics?).  And secondly I suspect that those who complained about dao do not realize that to use DAO one must first establish a reference to it in the vba window (Tools, References, check "Microsoft DAO x.xx Object Library).  The program does not automatically provide reference to both dao and ado because of the overlap of objects in their respective libraries.  Anyway, it is an excellent book.</span>
