                <span id="Label1">A stunning architectural tour of 28 abandoned estates that loom as mysterious ruins along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany. Many of the now-faded mansions were designed by Stanford White, the premier architect of New York's gilded age, and were owned by such illustrious families as the Vanderbilts, Astors, and Whitneys. The author's evocative, sepia-tinted photos capture the architectural splendor of these once luxurious homes, as well as the ravages of time, from the houses' crumbling turrets and spires, porticos, columns, gargoyles, and weed-choked courtyards and gazebos, to their interior vaulted ceilings, spacious ballrooms, and huge, empty libraries. Paired with ghost stories and legends about the estates, this book is a haunting reminder of a bygone era and lifestyle.  </span>

                    <span>This volume is dedicated to a subject that, to this day, continues to be underserved by photographers and writers. The reasons for that aren't close to clear. The compelling images and folklore are there. Anyway, I accept this book -a cynic might say charitably- in a spirit that factors in the scarcity of material on the topic. <P>I was not convinced by some of the staged-looking "ghost" photos. I didn't think the subject required any such reaching. Without this spook show punching-up, the books images of stately homes, long abandoned and encroached upon by the elements, one completely engulfed, with the waters of the Hudson right up to its foundation, is legitimately the stuff of dreams -or nightmares. But a gaffe or two doesn't come close to destroying the experience. If you want to like the book, I think you will have no trouble doing so.<P>If you have heard of these ruins, but never seen anything more than perhaps an extended magazine article on them, I feel sure you'll enjoy this book. In my opinion, the photography isn't nearly as bad as another reviewer suggests.</span>

                    <span>I'm thankful to Ms Randall for providing a well written comprehensive guiebook. Regretfully, her photographic attempts do not match the subject - they are amateurish in the worst sense of the definition. Her technique and taste require a lot of development.</span>

                    <span>Randall's book is a fantastic feast for the eyes with her sepia tone photographs and her well-written, can't-put-it-down narrative. Her clever way of blending the history of the houses with any supernatural happenings kept me turning the pages. In fact, I have read the book once and am re-reading it again with fresh eyes. With each chapter, however, I felt an extreme sadness at the thought of all those magnificent houses gradually disappearing. A must read for a quiet evening.</span>
