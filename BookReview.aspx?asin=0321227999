                    <span>I don't often give 5-star reviews but I think this book deserves one. It is clear and easy to follow, and has lots of good examples to get you going. I have a number of digital photography/Photoshop books and and this one stands out because it is very useful, but without being a 500-page encyclopedic volume on all things digital. I think if you become familiar with only a quarter of the techniques in this book you'll be a much improved digital photographer and photoshop user. </span>

                    <span>I was looking for a book that concentrated on using Photoshop and digital photography together without getting too wild or too complex in skill level. As a person who has used Photoshop for 5 years, both for work and at home, I still felt like I wasn't getting the most out of it. And after taking 4,600 digital photos last year alone, I decided I wanted to actually do something interesting with them. So I poured over the plethora of books out there on Photoshop: tricks, tips, how-tos, guides, shortcuts, etc. at the bookstore for 2 hours. Some books were too novice, some too difficult - - I really don't need to know how to make a surreal collage of a planet pouring a waterfall into a floating baby's outstretched hand behind a rainbow thank you. What I was searching for was a basic primer on real-world techniques with some fun stuff thrown in to give my images punch and snap, but nothing too involved. I wanted something that would get me results the same evening. "How To Wow" is that book. Having been a photographer for half my life and worked in photo labs for years and then as a digital designer, this book still completely changed the way I see a digital image. I have gone through the book cover to cover and done all the techniques, tips and tricks and THEY WORK. Even the ones I didn't think I would like ended up pleasantly surprising me. Like if you want to convert a color image to black-and-white, don't use MODE-GREYSCALE, use the Channel Mixer instead. You do have to know a little bit of basic Photoshop, but most of the tips are 3-4 steps and the results are great. These guys write well and make it absolutely clear what your result will be and how to get there. I couldn't be happier with this book! The CD that comes with the book contains all the sample images, so you can use those or your own. I found it best to use theirs first, then try it on my own image to really get the feel of the technique. My favorite chapter is  "Enhancing & Exaggerating"  and using glows and tints. Your digital photos will never look the same! I guarantee you will add new pop and life to your images. The CD also comes with a gaggle of free presets, so you can load those up and do one-click framing styles and other cool stuff. I also liked that this book wasn't cheesy. A lot of Photoshop effects look like obvious filters and give a cheesy result. Not these - these effects are elegant and stylish and often subtle and don't have that "Photoshopped" look. I printed out many of my images and they translate well to paper. I just can't rave enough about this book. It's already dog-eared from me taking it with me everywhere. Get it if you've used Photoshop a bit but feel like you could do more with your images.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. As an amature photographer with so-so skills, I have turned my photos into great looking pictures. This book gives you the tools within Photoshop to understand how to fix those so-so errors.
<br />In addition, this book has help me to take better pictures since I now think of picture taking from the viewpoint of how might I have to fix this picture later? 
<br />There is also an underlying wit in this book, which I appreciate. This book is not just a tutorial on how to fix certain problems, it is written as if Jack were in the room with you explaining how.
<br />One of the better books for understanding how to fix your photo issues.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best I have read on Photoshop.  It has more practical and useful techniques than any other book, and I have read a bunch of the best known books on this subject.
<br />
<br />I liked the book so much, I ended up buying Jack Davis' DVD set of the same name from Software Cinema.  The DVD's are the movie version of the book and very useful if you are a photographer.
<br />
<br />Other reviewers have spelled out many features in the book.  I particularly found interesting the lucid explanations, for example, of Dodge and Burn with Layer Masks.  The book's explanation and practical examples of using the Blend-if options with Layers is the best I have seen anywhere.  And the really best way to use the power of Hue & Saturation command - mind-boggling.
<br />
<br />I used Photoshop Elements for a couple of years and bought Photoshop CS a few months ago and felt lost for a while.  Of several books I got on Photoshop Cs, this one has brought me up to speed.</span>
