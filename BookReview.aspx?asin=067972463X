                    <span>I just finished this book and I really loved it.  Yes, Gertrude Stein is very conceited, and yes, sometimes the language is difficult to work through, but if you take the time to get through this book you will not regret it.  It was so witty and subtley funny that I was smiling almost the entire way through.  This book is definitely worth the time it took to read it.</span>

                    <span>This book is an interesting look at the art and literary scene of Paris at the turn of the century.  This book is actually more of an autobiography of Gertrude Stein, but supposedly is written through the eyes of her longtime companion Alice Toklas.  Many who knew Toklas said that Stein imitated her voice and style perfectly, and perhaps that is why it is considered such a great work of literature.  For my part I enjoyed the narrative, thought I was not particularly fond of the way it was written.  I realize this is a style unique to Stein, but it just didn't work for me.  <br>	<br>The most fascinating part of this work is seeing such great figures as Picasso and Hemingway through the eyes of Stein/Toklas.  Even TS Eliot makes a brief appearance.  The narrative is very interesting for this reason--with all these great figures around, how could it not be amusing?  And, of course, Stein does not hesitate to use the medium of Toklas to proclaim that she is one of the three actual 'geniuses' that Toklas has ever met (incidentally, this short list excludes both Hemingway and Eliot).  In fact there is an awful lot of egotism apparent throughout this book, and it is very irritating at times.  Still, this is a very interesting look at Paris before, during, and after the first World War, and provides fascinating insight into a circle of painters, musicians, and literary figures that I'm sure many people would gladly give a limb to have belonged to.</span>

                    <span>Gertrude Stein was a self-proclaimed genius. In order to announce this fact to the world, she chose to write about herself in the words of her whatever, lover, Alice B. Toklas (probably secondarily most famous for her marijuana-laced brownies during those flower-power hippie years).<br>Stein's writing is, um, difficult. Yeah, difficult. And convoluted and innovative and unusual in the extreme - and totally egocentric. This purported autobiography of Alice B. is in reality the autobiography of Gertrude Stein. Here's the most famous line from the book: "I may say that only three times in my life have I met a genius and each time a bell within me rang and I was not mistaken." One of the 3, of course, was herself, Gertrude. Sheesh. Fortunately, sublime conceit is tempered with wit and irony, which makes the reader willing to continue slogging thru this epistle.<br>It ain't easy, though. While this 'autobiography' is one of Stein's most accessible works, it's still pretty hard going for the average literate reader. I think we can thank posterity that this particular experimental style of writing didn't prove to be universally popular.<br>For a wonderfully original take on the relationship between Toklas and Stein, read the wickedly innovative The Book of Salt.</span>

                    <span>Those looking for a straightforward narrative, go elsewhere but those looking for charming insights into the heart of the Parisian bohemian scene from roughly 1905-1933, this is the book. Stein's genius was to write the book as if one was actually having a conversation with her partner, Alice B. Toklas. Famous figures come in and out of the story: Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Fitzgerald, Hemingway. Not only is this a book about people but it's also a book about the heady days before World War 1 and the general unease and regrouping that was done after the war. You get plenty of insights about the art scene, and by the end of the book, find yourself wishing you could be sitting in Stein's salon, looking at all the paintings.<p>This book can be read straight through from cover to cover or it can be read in bits and pieces and there is no lack of enjoyment from reaidng it either way.</span>

                    <span>Despite what all of the other reviews say, Stein is not a genius.  The previous reviewers were simply regurgitating what their professors insisted upon in college.  This book is Stein's most accessible--do read it, just so you can know what kind of sense the book does NOT make.  The best part of this novel is the format (autobiography, but written by someone else), which is unique; however, the stolen style, nonsensical delineations, stale dialogues, and immobile plot definitively strip away any claims that this rich, disturbed woman was a genius.</span>
