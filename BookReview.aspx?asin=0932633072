                    <span>Perhaps I bought this book with expecting too much. The books does talk about general system thinking, but:<br>  - I find the book itself rather unsystematic and jumpy<br>  - The style really annoying<br>  - Most of the material is primitive<br>On the positive side, if you do want to get a feel of system thinking, this might be one of the books. I would also recommend to check out popular books on Complexity (such as Complexity by Mitchell Walldrop).</span>

                    <span>One of the wonderful things about the Weinbergs' early series of books -- and this one in particular -- is that the ideas and the examples really make you think. With examples chosen from many fields, the book illustrates its central ideas with a cross-fertilization that helps one think outside ones box. <p>It starts with a very simple idea -- stability. Things change so little most of the time we hardly notice. And yet stability usually requires active forces to sustain it. As an information systems designer, Weinberg helped me see why this simple idea, and a few simple ideas that follow, turn out to explain a great deal about why projects information technology projects fail, and how they can be made more successful.</span>

                    <span>An outstanding follow up to the first book Weinberg wrote(An Introduction  to General Systems Thinking, 1975).  Anyone who considers themseleves a  systems thinker must read this book!  Whereas the first book attempts to  answer the first question  in the systems triumvirate, "Why do we see  what we see?", this books tackles the next question, namely "Why  do things stay the same?"  As a marriage and family therapist,  understanding systems is crucial to my work.  This book is clearly written,  and provides real world examples of sometimes difficult topics.  I have  read this book cover to cover 3 times in the last 2 years, and continue to  get something new from it every time.  One of the best books around to  think about the organization of systems, regardless of the context.</span>
