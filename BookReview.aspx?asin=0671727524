                    <span>This book gets its points across quickly.  It is a short book that is long on good ideas.  The author includes many examples to illustrate his points.  The book focuses on conversations, but it also includes helpful material on giving speeches and on written communications.  Anyone who wants to improve his communications skills will find this book to be a valuable addition to his library.</span>

                    <span>I bought the tape for 50c at a thrift shop. I thought it would help me get my point across quicker before I lose my train of thought :).
<br />In this culture, we value directness and not wasting time so much that we might have forgotten that indirectness, subtlety, niceness, politeness, the use of metaphors, humor, etc. are other ways of communicating and could even be more effective in more ways than being "straight-to-point'.
<br />The book or tape is helpful though for people like me who have trouble expressing themselves succinctly. It helps in setting objectives and keeping focused on your message. 
<br />
<br />Message? What message???</span>

                    <span>Basically, it's turning your message into a commerical since the average person can only hold their attention for 30 seconds thanks to (M)TV. It's useful in getting a message across to individuals who either don't want to talk to you or are too busy quicky. It can be seen as "brute honesty" if it's news the individual doen't like to hear, especially, regarding personal performance.Could be very useful in sales and retail. The book uses the 3 Ks (KKK). Unfortunately, it's not a good (PC) memory aid. I perfer the 3 Cs. "Catch Em", "Ceep Em", "Convince Em". I love the saying "Talking to many is the same as talking to one." <br>Worth a look at about 110 pages. You can finish it in one sitting.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent.  It's written for the average Joe; no technical jargon -- it can and should be used by everyone.  It's a short and sweet read...brief and to the point, it can be read in approximately 1-2 hours.  I'm a radio announcer, and this book is one of the top 5 that I insist other people read ... but get your own copy! In my opinion "How to get your point across in 30 seconds or less" is equal to AT THE VERY LEAST one half semester of a college course in Public Speaking 101.... and it's much cheaper! This book should be required reading for everyone who opens their mouth in public.</span>

                    <span>I actualy got this book as a joke so I could pick up women at the bar. It's funny though...the author makes you realize how much time we all waste...and words too. <p>I work in an adult entertainment store so a lot of people bumble b/c they're nervous or whatever. The point of this book is JUST SAY IT. Also, people LIKE people who come out and say it anyways. <p>The main thing--actually there's three according to the author--is TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. If its women, you can use this book to get the message across quick because sometimes in the bar you only have 30 seconds which is the most time any woman ever gave me. SO in other words a good book and relatively cheap too.</span>
