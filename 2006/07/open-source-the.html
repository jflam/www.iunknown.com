			<p>Scott Hanselman just <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx">blogged about the demise of the NDoc project</a>. I&#8217;m amazed by the amount of sense of entitlement exhibited by people in at least this one instance. Kevin Downs, who was apparently the sole contributor to NDoc <em>was being threatened by some anonymous coward</em> for not working hard enough to release a .NET 2.0 compliant version quickly enough!</p>


	<p>Now I&#8217;d like to think that this is an edge case. There weren&#8217;t any sessions this year at <span class="caps">OSCON</span> on how to survive, evade, resist and escape :) However, this points to a larger problem that is discussed often in the open source community: how do I feed my family while working on open source projects?</p>


	<p>Some projects lend themselves naturally to small user contributions that can be combined into a large product (e.g. an operating system or NAntContrib). However, there are other projects that require the focused attention of committers who pretty much do this stuff full time (e.g. an operating system, a virtual machine, or IronPython). Note that the same project can span the spectrum.</p>


	<p>Now how should companies who are at the heart of that software ecosystem support the efforts of the open source community? How should a Sun, or a Microsoft or an <span class="caps">IBM</span> support these efforts?</p>


	<p>In the operating system arena, it&#8217;s well known that most of the core contributors are on staff at large companies, and it is their <em>job</em> to work on open source. That works well for projects that have a broad strategic impact like an OS. It also works for technologies like Iron<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">Python</a>, or the recently acquired <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=Phalanger" title="Phalanger"><span class="caps">PHP</span>.NET project</a> whose job it is to support the Microsoft platform.</p>


	<p>However, what should we do for smaller projects like RubyCLR and the next generation <span class="caps">IDE</span> experience that I&#8217;m building? I have the gracious support of my business partners at <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com">ObjectSharp</a>, but that&#8217;s about it. If I really wanted to do this project properly, it&#8217;s probably in the neighborhood of 3-4 person years worth of effort. That&#8217;s asking a lot of a small company like ObjectSharp especially since the time that would be required is partner time (mine).</p>


	<p>This week, I&#8217;m at Microsoft for the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/">Lang.Net symposium</a>. I&#8217;m also meeting with a variety of folks to see if I can figure out how to fund projects like RubyCLR. Now obviously, I&#8217;m doing this in my own enlightened self-interest, but I&#8217;d also like to bring up the more general problem of funding open source projects in the Microsoft community.</p>


	<p>Scott already floated the idea of using the existing <a href="http://www.ineta.org/"><span class="caps">INETA</span></a> infrastructure to distribute grants. This idea is promising, but only works for relatively small contributions, much like the <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google Summer of Code</a> projects for students. But perhaps it could work for larger investments, but then you have the problem of trying to pick the right projects.</p>


	<p>Please leave a comment or send email to jlam at this domain if you have ideas that I can bring up during our meetings. That would help out <strong>a lot</strong>.</p>


	<p>Thanks.</p>

		<span id="comment-100053568-content"><p>I&#39;m not sure how Brian&#39;s idea of combining these three Ruby-CLR-bridge efforts would be a &quot;solution&quot; to JOHN problem or that of Open Source developers in general.  It might help get this project &quot;done&quot; sooner or without burning out.  It is true, that when you &quot;spread&quot; the pain around maybe it doesn&#39;t hurt so much.  But significant projects really REQUIRE the devotion of key individuals or else nothing gets done or you end up with a hodgepodge of democratic constructed &quot;Politically Correct&quot; group-think software.  That means somebody ends up &quot;giving it away, like a teenager full of raging hormones&quot;.  But unless the person doing this is supported financially this behavior is not sustainable and leads to burn out and the demise of otherwise great projects.</p>

<p>Brian&#39;s idea reminds me of something my girlfriend often says: &quot;Americans tend to jump for solutions (often the first one that pops into their head) before trying to really understand the problem... good solutions (IF they are actually even necessary) tend to become visible only AFTER you truly understand the problem&quot;.  </p>

<p>One reason she &quot;picks on&quot; Americans is because I am one (she&#39;s Italian and here I am living in Pisa which makes me kind of conspicuous) and the other reason is that she is RIGHT about us, as a general rule (I&#39;ll admit that our &quot;from the hip, cowboy behavior&quot; can also be a VIRTUE if properly balanced... but at the same time it CAN and OFTEN DOES get us into a mess).  Brian might not be an American but his statement reminded me of one (this is NOT a bash at Brian, just a statement of fact).</p>

<p>John&#39;s problem, and that of many (maybe most?) Open Source developers, seems to be that he needs to feed his family and pay the rent with money left over for retirement.  It is not too much to ask, I think.</p>

<p>But his biggest problem (and virtue) is that he seems to be ETHICAL and unwilling to subversively cheat on his day job.  He seems to feel guilty for not contributing more toward the success of his paying business venture.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but it is my impression that is how most open source projects are funded, on the backs of employers who don&#39;t know they are supporting it (or who turn the other cheek, like a wife to a mistress, and tolerate it in order to get a precious slice of some talented person&#39;s time).  I prefer John&#39;s approach, frankly.  It is honest, fair, and correct.  And I wish more people were like that!</p>

<p>Maybe John (and most Open Source developers?) is somewhat like a struggling actor passionately wanting to &quot;make art&quot;, and waiting tables to pay the rent, while also hoping he might someday be compensated for the &quot;dues&quot; he has paid.  But the big driving force is the urge to succeed at acting and do something significant.  Hope that&#39;s not too bad a metaphor, John.</p>

<p>John might need a &quot;Patron&quot; who basically says to him &quot;go forth and make art&quot; and supports him financially so he can explore his talents and do what he loves.  Yet I don&#39;t know if that is what he wants, because I don&#39;t know what motivates him.  Maybe he wants a &quot;really big house and corporate jet&quot;.  In which case he either needs a really big patron or should focus on the paying gigs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert on this, but I believe most of the great artwork of the renaissance happened under such patron supported conditions.  I think it was the norm.  And I think it is called for now.</p>

<p>In reading John&#39;s blog, I got the feeling he might have been &quot;pinging&quot; for just such a patron.  And frankly I hope he finds one.  Are any &quot;potential patrons&quot; listening out there?  If so, toss some coins (or bank notes) into this man&#39;s hat :-)</p>

<p>Less selfishly, John also seems to be &quot;championing the cause&quot; for some form of &quot;meaningful&quot; support to deserving people doing open source work.</p>

<p>I think the most pressing priority is finding a patron FOR JOHN.  If that can happen, the championing can continue without burning out and other&#39;s can benefit.  So being brutally selfish first but not forgetting the roots makes a lot of sense, I think.  While you are up in Microsoft land, be *aggressive*.  Ask for the direct financial support for YOURSELF rather than bashfully pushing for generic assistance to open source community (not suggesting you are bashful, John, just saying to be extra assertive while you might be speaking into the right ears).  This is the time to be a salesman, I think.</p>

<p>Best regards and good luck,<br />
Pat</p></span>

<p>Yes, I am looking for a patron, and hopefully something will come out of my meetings here this week. </p>

<p>I do like the struggling artist / actor metaphor although I&#39;m not really struggling thanks to the support of my business partners. Without them, well, the only way I could continue my work in this area would be to take a job at Microsoft. </p>

<p>Not that this would be a bad thing - it&#39;s just that I (and my family) are very happy where we are right now.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-100053574-content"><p>Hi &quot;null&quot;,</p>

<p>It was mighty brave of you say your name in public.</p>

<p>You asked:<br />
&gt; Doesn&#39;t expecting to be paid for <br />
&gt; OSS work also belong in the &quot;sense <br />
&gt; of entitlement&quot; box?</p>

<p>How about cooling it with the clich??s, they are kind of &quot;null&quot;.</p>

<p>OSS means &quot;Open Source Software&quot;... NOT working for free just because you think you are some kind of hero.  It means that the source code is free to anyone.  NOT that it is somehow taboo to be paid for developing it.</p>

<p>The problem really isn&#39;t about people doing OSS work in their &quot;spare time&quot;.  That is fine.  The problem is when someone invests so much of their time in doing worthy OSS work (stuff that is not just fun little project FOR THEM SELF) that it often turns out to not be spare time any more... it becomes their life.  Why should such persons starve???  Why should they be punished for contributing to the world?  Maybe you think it is better to just NOT have this great work get done???</p>

<p>Why do you have it in with someone for wanting to be paid for doing something worthy.  And what is more, isn&#39;t the &quot;patron&quot; who is willing (knowingly) to pay for such work (that they don&#39;t own rights to) a noble thing?  Even if they do make a profit in other ways?</p>

<p>The reality is, and you know it, many OSS developers (but certainly NOT all) *steal* from their employers to support their &quot;climbing&quot; on the OSS software mountain.  Come out of your denial and get real.  OSS isn&#39;t all about being a hero... there are a lot of people doing it for &quot;free&quot; while actually being paid by their employer (unknowingly for that mission) because they are bored in their day jobs.  Even if they don&#39;t &quot;code on the job&quot; they do often &quot;think about their beloved OSS work&quot; while supposedly &quot;working&quot;.  And if they do that without the knowledge and consent of their employers they are unethical and dishonest... not exactly heroes.</p>

<p>Your attitude seems to me like you want to shoot good people in the foot just because YOU think this is a bad thing.  If you don&#39;t like people doing this... then YOU don&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>Maybe you are just envious and *wish* you were &quot;good enough&quot; to be paid for doing OSS work.  John certainly is from the perspective of both a software developer and a contributor to society at large in terms of public awareness of important issues (so say nothing of his beautiful pictures).  How much of your freely given development time has turned into something useful for other people?  Where is YOUR development blog full of GREAT and USEFUL information?  How many of your thoughts (along with your blunders) have you documented in the light of day for everybody to see and use, for &quot;free&quot;.  Where are your &quot;say it like it is without political correctness&quot; commentaries on software, political, and life issues?  Nowhere, I would guess, given that you don&#39;t even have the courage to post your name.    </p>

<p>Thanks for listening, &quot;null&quot;</p>

<p>Pat</p></span>

		<span id="comment-100053576-content"><p>Well... hmm...</p>

<p>Rails does a couple things I think are interesting. First they make it easy to collaborate by using Trac. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, Trac is not my fave piece of software, but as far as collaboration efforts and bug reports go, it&#39;s pretty effective. On the .NET side Jira seems mildly popular, but it&#39;s a lot more confusing IMO.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s one. And easy way to be heard.</p>

<p>Another is the TextDrive relationship. I signed up with TextDrive for two reasons: They supported Rails on their systems, and half my money (or something like that) goes back into the Rails project itself.</p>

<p>I was/am happy to give that financial support. In fact, I&#39;m still paying even though I haven&#39;t touched that account for months (I moved to VPSLand) and the QoS was about the worst I&#39;ve experienced from a hosting provider.</p>

<p>Now I need to get around to cancelling that, but I think the idea of &quot;Value Added&quot; deals like that has merit. It worked for me anyways. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s got to be a .NET/Ruby business out there that would happily make a deal to accept donations for the RubyClr. Would it be enough to keep you busy full-time? I&#39;d be surprised... but what do I know?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-100053578-content"><p>John, you pose one of the most interesting problems facing open source software.  </p>

<p>Your idea of finding companies that have a vested interest in developing a free / open piece of software works in more scenarios.  Take bar code scanning for instance.  There are a LOT of companies that would benefit from contributing to an open bar code scanning libray.  These are not necessarily very big companies either, they could be your average ISV that builds an inventory tracking application for a particular vertical market.</p>

<p>The trick is to entice a company enough to allow a developer to work on this project part or even full time.  The other model is for them to donate financially.  A bounty system seems to be one way to pay for developers to work professionally on these types of projects.</p>

<p>Sourceforge already has a &quot;donate&quot; button but more must be done to educate CTOs and CEOs that developing open libraries to get &quot;x&quot; done will save them from having to deal with crappy 3rd party proprietary SDKs royalties and poor support.</p>

<p>Just take the Java world as an example, there are hundreds of great open source solutions to the very problems your company needs to solve in it&#39;s own enterprise and commercial applications.  Without this eco system Java would not be where it is today.</p>

<p>The old ways of charging for components and SDKs that do things the community can build, support, and fix itself are going away.  I don&#39;t know of a developer that wouldn&#39;t rather use open source when a solution is available.</p></span>

I&#39;ve been brainstorming on this topic a lot recently too. I don&#39;t have any magic solutions for you, but I did enjoy reading your article.</p>

<p>You might want to take a look at this article on my blog. It&#39;s about OSS business models:<br />
Open Source Needs More Innovation<br />
