		<description>sorry about the double click...   I wanted to add that the title of your blog (less is better fits nicely with my there here.)
I&#039;d also like to add that I don&#039;t want to ruin anybody&#039;s fun, just keep it away from my fun.

		<description>SO WHAT?
The technology is impressive, but how much of the information conveyed in that picture is in actually relevant to what a real meeting or conference would be about?  I need to know what the speaker is saying, and I might want to know what other participants think of the speaker or what they have to contribute... I don&#039;t need to know where other participants are sitting, especially when they&#039;re not really sitting anywhere.  I don&#039;t need to know what they look like, especially if they don&#039;t really look like that.
I attended a lug (linux user group) meeting in Second Life, and it was incredibly static and boring.  Nobody moved, everybody just sat there.  It was like an oil painting of Dogs playing poker.  and the real information, the meeting part of the meeting,  was deemphasized,  a tiny line or two at the bottom of the page.
I saw in article in Fortune about how Second Life will be more successful when you don&#039;t need to be a techie to use it, but you don&#039;t need to be a techie; you need to be a gamer.  I&#039;m a lot better at the Linux Command Line than I am at dragging my avatar through the brightly colored streets of virtual nowheresville.  To non gamers, it&#039;s a big bloated cumbersome interface, and it adds nothing.
Virtual reality will always be important for flight simulators or whatnot, but I can&#039;t see where this sort of thing has any applications other than entertainment and advertising.  I&#039;m hoping that the internet of the future will help us shape and process information, not just envelop us in information that isn&#039;t even real.

		<description>I started out in SL with the idea of creating and selling content to cover my tier (monthly land cost). I&#039;m now not only selling the virtual &quot;things&quot; I make in SL, which are definitely scripted, textured, photorealistic...but I am now teaching others as well.
Building teaching aids in SL is a snap..and there are some exceptional tools that push scripts..push samples...track student attendance...
In Real Life my son is finally motivated to write code/LSL Script in the Teen Second Life Grid...Woohoo!
Drop me a line in world...

		<description>Hi John,
I&#039;m Mocc Spatula in SL, and a Toronto Beach resident in RL.
Weird serendipity here - I was just reading David Crow&#039;s blog a few minutes ago, where your name came up - then I was googling some SL info, and I found this post of yours.  Spooky.
Drop me an IM in world sometime. Or maybe we&#039;ll run into each other at a BarCamp or something.
Cheers.

		<description>I&#039;m exploring a bit in the evenings after the kids go to bed. A guided tour would rock - I&#039;ll definitely ping you in the next few days to learn more about what&#039;s going on in there.
Thanks!

		<description>Hey, there are lots of people in SL probably much older than you and me ;-)
I am just wondering if you are now exploring it. If you need some hints, just ping me :-)
(great photos, btw :-) )
