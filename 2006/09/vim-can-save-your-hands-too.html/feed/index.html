		<description>Thanks for your initial VibrantInk port to Vim!
I made an actual Vim color scheme out of it, and added support for 256 color terminals.

		<description>I used vi almost exclusively for four years while in college.  It was made clear early on by upper-classmen that vi was the cool editor, emacs was for the &quot;weird&quot; people, and there was a third editor (I forget the name) that was for &quot;dummies&quot;.
I became an advanced vi  &#039;er, but after 10+ years of Visual Studio and other BRIEF editors I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d even know where to begin with vi anymore.  It&#039;s good to see that that editing model is so widely available though.

		<description>I do use TextMate in a limited set of cases (like editing blog entries). However, I really need a cross platform editor (Windows / Mac) as well as having something with a very efficient input model. TextMate isn&#039;t cross-platform, so that&#039;s a bit of a deal-breaker for me since I spend most of my time writing code on Windows.

		<description>Seems like I only leave commercial messages on your blog, John.
We added vi keybindings to Komodo this go-round, alphas still available for free at http://www.activestate.com/komodo
I personally find it still strange using vi keybindings in a GUI editor,  but you can&#039;t beat the dot command.
On topic, back in college we used to play vi golf games -- carry out a task in the fewest number of keystrokes.  Knowing how to use m, single-quote, and Unix commands can get you quite far relatively quickly.

		<description>I&#039;m a heavy user altough not an expert with Vi and derivatives. I do like the fact that there is a version of Vi in almost any platform. Most of the time I use Vi in Solaris but also have it on my Windows PC and in my FC4 partition.
I like simplicity and with Vi that&#039;s the name of the game.

		<description>You can also do a bunch of fun stuff with both remote mode and the WIN32API calls for vim.
