                    <span>As a novice web surfer, Resaerching Online for Dummies (like me) by Revea Basch and Mary Ellen Bates was just what the doctor ordered. From the world behind the web to thinking and working like a researcher, Basch has provided the basic information necessary for understanding what the web is and what it does and does not do.<P>Before reading this book I thought a search engine was something a mechanic used to find the infamous "clunk" noise no one at the car dealership can hear. However, it wasn't long before I found my self saying things like "maybe I should try excite." Or, "I bet I can use GO to get what I need." Is this OK to post in public?<P>But, by the time I read the chapter on specialty search engines I felt like I was cruising the inormation superhighway like no one had ever done before. Dot com this and dot com that.<P>As I continued through the text I did find myself becoming a little annoyed at the pejorative nature of the writing. I guess that's why the title is Researching Online for "Dummies." This minor distraction aside, Basch has done an excellent job of making sense of this hypertechnical computer lingo. One thing is for sure. "I won't leave my home page without it."</span>

                    <span>I've been researching online since 1994 and I found something that I didn't know on almost every page of this book. It is informative enough to keep a seasoned researcher entertained but simple to use for a first time web searcher.<P>I may have to have my copy hard bound somewhere to keep it from falling apart through overuse.</span>

                    <span>Readable, entertaining, informative, and valuable. What more can you ask from any book? Unskilled researchers wanting to learn something from the subject will find an excellent overview of the necessary skills, tools, and resources, an online researcher needs. Skilled searchers will find a handy reference containing thought provoking ideas. The only problem with the book is due to the etheral nature of the Internet...several examples in the book no longer work as described. Newbies may become disconcerted when following along and finding invalid sites or differences between what the book shows and says and what is experienced on the "real" (?!) internet. To her credit, the author gives ample warning that this may happen. It is the only book of its type that I keep within arm's reach.</span>
