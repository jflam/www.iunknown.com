                    <span>This books has a conversational tone to it.  I found it relaxing trying to learn a subject which, though easy, has so many parts to it that you can get confused.  
<br />
<br />You learn how XML works and how it works with all the other modules.  It's not a "kit" for putting things together for you.  Using this book, you can write XML pages which work and you'll understand why it does.</span>

                    <span>This is a good XML book for those that have no previous knowleadge of it. It starts slowly and speed up as you read the chapters.<p>Unfortunately as with all printed media some references and items discussed have already evolved and replaced.<p>The DTD/XML Schema is one example.<p>Still a good book if you want to start from the basic.</span>

                    <span>The first few chapters of this book on the basics of XML are good, but stay away if you're a software developer wanting to learn about XML in depth. Even if you're an XML author, you will find this book lacking in the latter chapters. Almost all the discussion is extremely general and theoretical. Occasionally the author sprinkles in a few fucntional XML snippets, but they are not nearly enough. Furthermore, there are only about a dozen complete examples of functional XML available in the tar/zip file available online at O'Reilly.<p>The paucity of examples was particularly frustrating in the XSLT chapter. By its very nature, XSLT screams out for illustrative examples showing 'before' and 'after' transformations, but the author provides very few such examples.<p>Another thing that really irked me was the condescending writing style of the author. Here's an example from Ch. 4 on CSS:<p>"A CSS stylesheet is a collection of rules... An analogy for this process is painting-by-numbers. In this activity, you purchase a painting kit that comes with paints..."<p>Really now! This style of writing is not necessary and is frankly offensive. XML inherently is not a beginner's topic; a reader who picks up this book is most likely an IT manager or a developer and does not need to be talked-down upon.<p>If you're a java developer, I suggest you take a look at "Processing XML with Java" by Harold.</span>

                    <span>I have to say that the first 5 chapters, served as a good introduction to XML. It was much much better than any Dummies book of the subject. Actually I found them to be treating the subject at some depth.<br>But then came the most important chapters on XSLT & Programming Tools. It was completely confusing not because the subject was a tough one, but because the treatment was bad.<br>I would have given 1 star had it been not for the first chapters.</span>
