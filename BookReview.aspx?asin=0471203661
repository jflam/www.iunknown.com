                    <span>One have to think on scientific research. There are lots of good books on research methodology for social sciences, engineering and other technology related sciences. But for business and management this one is the best I found. Comprehensive, logical and easy to follow. Very suitable for undergraduate students.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for the business student or consultant that has to frequently perform research and data analysis. Several methods and concepts are outlined. The topic of "research methods and data analysis" is not the most exciting; so don't have your expectations high that it's going to be interesting reading. On the other hand, if your objective is to learn how to apply certain techniques in data analysis, research, or conducting surveys, you'll find this book helpful....<BR>I had bought this book...(used, but in excellent condition) so it was a great buy...</span>

                    <span>Now, I bought this book for my degree requirement. The explanation might be long winded at some time, but the examples given are really good. It make me able to comprehend it easily. The graphics in this book is not too good as the publisher tends to use only one colour which can make reading become boring. This book can be used as a good reference as it explains steps about conducting research and how to present written report. This book can be more interesting if simple,direct explanation is used.</span>

                    <span>This book is not as advanced as the PhD level, but it is a good supplement to PhD material. If you've ever been there, you know Cook and Campbell can be hard to understand, and Sekaran explains most concepts at a very easy level.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because it is the prescribed text for the unit I am studying.<P>I could not read it for more than 15 minutes before my eyes turned to lead. It states the obvious much of the time and is very dull and boring.</span>
