                    <span>This book was awesome! I just finished reading it today and I am amazed of how much I learned.
<br />
<br />I disagree with the comment that rates it bad for not talking enough about Visual Studio.... There are good books about "Visual C#" which target this audience, however the best developers are those who learn how to build software from scratch without fancy tools.
<br />
<br />Trust me, before this, I had no idea what was all the code Visual Studio (and even SharpDevelop) generated by default.
<br />
<br />Recommended path:
<br />I read 1 chapter a day; then took the chapter quiz, and did all the exercises.
<br />
<br />Also play with the "Type and Run's", they are a lot of fun!
<br />
<br />I am now writing my own C# applications (Console, Windows-based, Web, and even for my Pocket PC).
<br />
<br />Excellent book, great job Brad Jones!</span>

                    <span>This book is just fantastic. You can really learn a lot from it. I am only 14 and already know how to create a simple program. I'm looking to get into the gaming industry and this book will definently help me get there. I recommend it to everyone who wants to learn C# without the hassle of using up a lot of time. 5 Stars.</span>

                    <span>I'm very glad to finally see a book out that doesn't require people to spend a vast fortune buying Visual Studio, while that is fine for corporate development many personal developers can't afford the rather steep price tag associated to Visual Studio.

                    <span>Just know this book has you developing code in the SDK, not Visual Studio .NET.  If anything that should turn you away from buying this.  
<br />
<br />Any .NET programmer WILL be working with Visual Studio and not an SDK.  
<br />
<br />The SAMS teach yourself C# in 24 hours was completely written for VS .NET, so I am confused as to why this book was not.
<br />
<br />Get another book as this one will be only of use for terminology and OOP theory.  It was a waste on Money for me.

                    <span>I started out as a big fan of this book.  The introductory chapters were great.  But the book soon lost its focus.  It seems the authors started writing chapters on individual aspects of C# without a clear idea of what they were trying to teach and how it all worked together to produce functional C# code.  I was disappointed after being excited at the beginning.  I've had much better luck now with the C# How to Program book from the Deitels.</span>
