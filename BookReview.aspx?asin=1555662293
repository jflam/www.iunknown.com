                <span id="Label1">"Katie Lee&#146;s "All My Rivers Are Gone" is a unique book. It is a journal filled with strong emotions about a wondrous place on the American landscape. Her entries tell the sad saga of the decision to flood Glen Canyon on the Colorado River. Her words and songs make the canyon come alive and they provide a vivid picture of what has been lost.  <P>"Katie Lee uses eloquent and forceful words to present a compelling case for restoring Glen Canyon. Her steadfast efforts to educate a new generation of activists about the beauty of this mystical place is important to us all.  <P>"All My Rivers Are Gone" is an exciting trip to a magical place. It is a must for all those who care about rivers and our environment."  &#151;Dan Beard, former Commissioner, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (1993-95)</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best and most special books I have read. Katie Lee really gives you the experience of Glen Canyon--it's beauty, wildness, and uniqueness. I fell in love with the place through her words, and felt her loss deeply when the damn dam was built. This act (the building of the dam) was truly a dark time in our history. I thank Katie Lee for sharing her thoughts and feelings and cheer her for her openness in those closed times.</span>

                    <span>Katie Lee has written a beautiful & powerful love story & funeral song to a place some considered the most beautiful on earth, now drowned under Lake Powell. The book is largely exerpts from Katie's river journals from 40+yrs ago & has an immediacy that left me feeling like I was in Glen Canyon with her. She mentions that she shared early drafts of a fiction version with Ed Abbey, who told her to just write her own story. That she couldn't make up anything better than her own experiences. Ed Abbey was right. I devoured the book in one emotional sitting, then spent the rest of the day wandering aimlessly with dreams & visions of lost desert canyons in my mind.</span>

                    <span>Katie Lee has led a remarkable life. But while she may be a fine story teller for a live audience, she is a poor writer. I found it a slow book to flog myself through- despite an enormous interest in the subject. Too bad she couldn't have put her ego aside and sat down with a professional writer. I can think of several women writers of the west that would have been a boon to the project. I look forward to the Katie Lee biography from one of them.</span>

                    <span>Katie Lee has given us a wonderful glimpse at a lost treasure. Her discriptions of the river and side canyons tell of her love of this lost world. My 2nd greatgrandfather went through Glen Canyon in 1872 with the second Powell Expedition and Katie has given me some feeling as to What he saw and the places he visited. I never understood what a treasure Glen Canyon was to Us till I read her book. Thank You Katie Lee</span>

                    <span>I really can't add to the other reviews other than to say this book moved me in ways few others have. You will want to savor and ration it, lest you reach the end. <P>I was recently hiking in Coyote Gulch and while marveling at its incredible beauty, ran into a Park Ranger who said "...and just realize, this is but a remanent of what they destroyed with Lake Powell".<P>Thank you, Katie Lee, for what you have given us.</span>
