                    <span>I used this book to help prepare for the evil verbal portions of the SAT at least three years ago. And did it pay off (although I have forgotten a lot of those words out of a lack of usage and practice).
<br />
<br />Here was the study plan (cycle):
<br />15 days: Study 10 NEW words a day, review those that you already know. Make a sentence, make another one. Make sure that you know how to use it (You can build from what the author has already included). Be creative; the craziest sentences help you remember better.
<br />16th day: Review all studied words from last 15 days. Basically what I did was read through all the words at least 3 times. It takes about an hour.
<br />17th day: Self-quiz. Sort of like covering the meaning, looking at the word, figuring out if I can remember what it meant and use it in a sentence. Go back and re-study those words I did not remember.
<br />At least once every two months: Review every word from day one; not just those from the last 15 days. I did this separately of the 16th-17th day from the above cycle.
<br />
<br />Overall, if you're preparing for standardized tests, and you have something like a year to prepare, then definitely this can work out (You can also check out Word Smart II by the same company). It can give you mastery over the vocabulary long enough to last through the SAT. Whether or not you retain that knowledge afterwards depends on how much you use the vocabulary.
<br />
<br />On a side note, an even better way to remember the vocabulary is by incorporating them into papers for school. DO be sure you know what you're talking about, though...</span>

                    <span>This book is essential for anyone taking the SAT/GRE/GMAT/LSAT.  I'm currently studying for the Law School Admissions Test, and this book has saved me from misunderstanding entire paragraphs before.  There is no worse feeling come test day than coming upon a pivotal sentence and then not knowing what it means because you're drawing a blank on the meaning of the verb.  
<br />
<br />Even in day to day affairs, like watching the news or reading for pleasure, the words contained in Word Smart and Word Smart II have helped in my understanding of various issues.  Clearly, if you want to participate in the "educated" community that (barely) exists in America, then Word Smart and Word Smart II are essential reading. </span>

                    <span>Very good book for International students preparing for TOEFL/GMAT/GRE<br>I used when I was taking my GMAT. I knew about 25% of the words that it had such as prolific or excentric but there were some good ones that I still remember such as vociferous and verdant. I found it very helpful to use during short periods of time when I would have a few minutes between meetings or in the public transportation on the way home. Generally, a very pleasant book. It has good white paper and each words has a full page. Remebering was easy too, but forgetting was not hard. Sometimes I caught myself that I would remember the picture but would not remember the definition. In any case, this is a much faster way to learn words than mere memorizing.</span>

                    <span>As always Word Smart is a great way to study for the SAT, GRE, and standardized tests. These 800+ words not only help you do good on standardized tests but also enrich your vocabulary for everyday conversations. I especially found the pronunciation keys for every word very useful. It doesn't really make you look very smart if you mispronounce a word does it? I found it really funny that books never gave you pronunciations and was so pleased when I finally saw them in Word Smart. The sentence examples are also a great way to learn how to use these words and Adam's humor definitely shows up in some of them:) The word root list and GRE hit parade were also very helpful.<p>I recently got a score of 700 on my verbal section of the SATs. A large part of the reason was Word Smart. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I feel that you need to also purchase Word Smart II to get all the words that you absolutely need to know for the SATs. There are also some words in this book that are way too easy. Come on, ironic? Who doesn't know what that means. Otherwise this book is a must-buy for anyone taking the SATs.</span>
