          <div class="entryTitle">Great injet printer review site</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-26</div>
          <p><P>Over on <A href="http://www.dpreview.com">DPReview</A>, there were some folks who <A href="http://www.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1003&amp;message=3441048">posted this item</A> in their forums about their <A href="http://www.thenichols.net/Printer_Eval/">new inkjet printer review site</A>. This site is extremely well done, and a must-read for folks contemplating a new inkjet printer purchase.</P>
<P>I've been very happy with my rather old <A href="http://support.epson.com/hardware/printer/inkjet/sc860_/">Epson Stylus 860</A>. In side-by-side comparison prints with a calibrated <A href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/printers/s900/">Canon S900</A>, I felt that my printer held up quite well, considering that it only uses a 4 color (CMYK) ink system. After reading the reviews, I'm seriously considering purchasing a <A href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/printers/s9000/">Canon S9000</A> so that I can print 13" wide prints at home.</P></p>

          <div class="entryTitle">Flash</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-23</div>
          <p><P>I went and looked in a section of the bookstore that I don't normally look at: the section on web design. You know the one, it was full of HTML books just 6 months ago. When I looked around today, I only saw a handful of HTML books. The rest, probaby 100+ titles or so, were ALL Flash books.</P>
<P>Could it be that Flash is now the dominant web development platform? After looking around at a few Flash <A href="http://www.flashkit.com">community sites</A>, I'm getting the distinct impression that Flash is rapidly replacing DHTML. </P>
<P>Macromedia claims better than 98% market penetration with Flash, which is largely due to very clever licensing deals with Microsoft. Since Flash is bundled with every copy of IE, as IE's market share grows, so does Flash's market share. However, with the amount of mind share that Flash has, it's quite remarkable that Macromedia as a company is <A href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/news/articles.asp?guid={BD3567E2-D7F0-4F43-99FF-1AD126F90A1C}&amp;newsid=800543481&amp;symb=MACR&amp;sid=11695">doing so poorly</A>, posting a loss of net loss of 3 cents a share for 1Q2003 on revenues of $83.7M.</P>
<P>It might have something to do with the <A href="http://dynamic.macromedia.com/bin/MM/store/US/catalog_software.jsp">ridiculous pricing of&nbsp;their toolkit</A>. Flash MX sells for $499 US, and Macromedia Studio MX sells for $799 US. This has led to the rapid adoption of low-end tools like <A href="http://www.swishzone.com">Swish</A>, which boasts over 100,000 registered users of the $50 product. </P>
<P>Macromedia should wake up and smell the coffee: a $99 "standard" version of their Flash toolkit would make their toolkit so much more accessible to folks who are curious, and can only help to solidify their position as DHTML's main contender. Adobe gets it, with their $99 Photoshop Elements software. So does Microsoft, with their $99 "standard" versions of VB.NET,&nbsp;C# and VC++.</P></p>

          <div class="entryTitle">Intentional Programming</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-19</div>
          <p><P>The recent announcement of <A href="http://www.edge.org/digerati/simonyi/">Charles Simonyi</A> founding <A href="http://www.intentionalsoftware.com/corporate.html">Intentional Software</A> with <A href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/">Gregor Kiczales</A> is not that big of a surprise. Here's the facts: Microsoft killed the IP project at MSR, the two founders are both leaders in their respective (related) fields, and one of them is also capable of self-funding virtually any kind of start-up.</P>
<P>I've had the privilege of meeting some folks in the IP community, as well as the AOP community. I was very caught up in the AOP movement recently, and was quite convinced that it had a strong chance of being "the next big thing" in software development. I also had a chance to view Microsoft's famous "IP video", which is an amazingly well-produced documentary of what IP represented circa 2001.</P>
<P>Once I had a chance to calm down and take a step back from AOP to see the forest for the trees, I had a change of heart. This stuff is just too complicated. For most folks, the challenge will be&nbsp;dealing with cross-aspect interactions and / or creating aspects that are free of side-effects (and as a result being that much less interesting / useful). There are&nbsp;some AOP-like&nbsp;concepts in IP, which is why I suspect that Gregor was&nbsp;brought on board at IP.</P>
<P>I predict that AOP and IP (which has one of the coolest editors / IDE's that I have ever seen) will most likely be a niche market. I hope that the IP editor gets a life at Intentional Software, and that the world gets a chance to see this thing. </P>
<P>Does this change of heart mean that I'm abandoning my AOP work? No, but it means that I'm no longer trying to create a general-purpose AOP tool. The weaving engine continues to live on, but in a vastly different product space than what I had envisioned when I started my CLAW project. More on what that is when&nbsp;we get closer to a beta cycle.</P></p>

          <div class="entryTitle">Photos from Mt. Rainier</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-16</div>
          <p><P>I was teaching my Programming ASP.NET class out in Seattle this past week. I had a great class, the students were unusually experienced and <EM>very</EM> enthusisatic. </P>
<P>The weather in Seattle this week was nothing short of spectacular. Brilliant blue skies the entire week. When Friday arrived, I was getting worried that my weather luck might run out, but the weather stayed awesome until Sunday, when I flew home.</P>
<P>On Friday afternoon, I drove to Mount Rainier National Park. There, I took a bunch of photographs, which I've uploaded to <A href="http://www.pbase.com/jlam/mount_rainier">my PBase gallery</A>. The first photograph, <A href="http://www.pbase.com/image/4850177">the sunset one</A>, was taken on my drive to Mt. Rainier. I was going to miss sunset on the mountain because of nasty traffic delays, so I stopped off along the way and managed to get this great photograph of the sun setting over an inlet whose shores were covered with tree stumps. </P>
<P>Most of the photographs in the gallery were taken using filters. Just before my trip, I purchased some Cokin 1 and 2 stop "Grey" Graduated filters (models A120 and A121). These are as close to "Neutral Density" (color-neutral) filters that I could get without shelling out a whole pile of money, and they were able to expand the dynamic range of my photographs enough to show some detail in the photos that would otherwise be pure white or black.</P></p>

          <div class="entryTitle">Information Overload</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-10</div>
          <p><P>My name is John, and I am an information junkie.</P>
<P>I came to this realization during <A href="../Weblog/TheGreatHoneymoonTrick.html">my recent honeymoon trip</A>. During this trip, I had zero connectivity to the outside world, an experience that I found to be unusually refreshing. </P>
<P>To try and preserve this feeling, I systematically unsubscribed from all of my mailing lists when I got home. Almost at once a sense of calmness settled over Outlook. After an initial adjustment period, I find that I no longer miss the daily torrent of messages that invade my mailbox. I am now free to spend my time focusing more intently at the tasks in front of me, instead of constantly being distracted by the dinging of the email bell.</P>
<P>With the installation of <A href="http://www.deersoft.com/sp_pro.html">Spam Assassin Pro</A>, I'm now also free from the 20 or so annoying pieces of spam that show up in my mailbox each day. I foolishly forgot to leave Outlook running on my PC at home, so as I write this from sunny(!) Kirkland, WA, I still have to delete my spam manually. You live and you learn.</P>
<P>Hopefully this post will help inspire others who have similarly suffered in silence. There is hope at the end of your SMTP channel, it's called UNSUBSCRIBE.</P>
<P>Peace.</P></p>

          <div class="entryTitle">Update on VB.NET code generation</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-10</div>
          <p><P>Thanks to Scott Ellis who wrote in to explain why VB.NET is generating the extra local variable in a function declaration. It's due to the fact that you can assign the return value of the function to the <EM>name of the function</EM> in VB.NET. Scott sent along the following code snippet that illustrates the usage of the extra local:</P>
<P><code>Public Function AddThreeAndSevenAsn() As Integer<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim a As Integer = 3<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim b As Integer = 7<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AddThreeAndSevenAsn = a + b<BR>End Function</code></P>
<P>When you disassemble this function using ILDASM, you'll get the following:</P>
<P><code>.method public instance int32&nbsp; AddThreeAndSevenAsn() cil managed<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; // Code size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 (0xb)<BR>&nbsp; .maxstack&nbsp; 2<BR>&nbsp; .locals init ([0] int32 a,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [1] int32 AddThreeAndSevenAsn,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [2] int32 b)<BR>&nbsp; IL_0000:&nbsp; nop<BR>&nbsp; IL_0001:&nbsp; ldc.i4.3<BR>&nbsp; IL_0002:&nbsp; stloc.0<BR>&nbsp; IL_0003:&nbsp; ldc.i4.7<BR>&nbsp; IL_0004:&nbsp; stloc.2<BR>&nbsp; IL_0005:&nbsp; ldloc.0<BR>&nbsp; IL_0006:&nbsp; ldloc.2<BR>&nbsp; IL_0007:&nbsp; add.ovf<BR>&nbsp; IL_0008:&nbsp; stloc.1<BR>&nbsp; IL_0009:&nbsp; ldloc.1<BR>&nbsp; IL_000a:&nbsp; ret<BR>} // end of method Class1::AddThreeAndSevenAsn</code></P>
<P>This totally makes sense to me now. </P></p>
          <p><a href="../Weblog/UpdateonVB.NETcodegenerat.html"><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" border="0" title="Permanent link to Update on VB.NET code generation" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:HaloScan2('Weblog/UpdateonVB.NETcodegenerat.html');"><script type="text/javascript">postCount('Weblog/UpdateonVB.NETcodegenerat.html');</script></a></p>
         
          <div class="entryTitle">Code generation: C# vs. VB.NET</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-06</div>
          <p><P>I spent a bit of time today investigating the CIL generated by the VB.NET compiler vs. the CIL generated by the C# compiler. Consider the following VB.NET code:</P>
<P><CODE>&nbsp; Public Function AddThreeAndSeven() As Integer<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim a As Integer = 3<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim b As Integer = 7<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return a + b<BR>&nbsp; End Function</CODE></P>
<P>When run through vbc.exe using release settings, this is the CIL that is generated:</P>
<P><CODE>.maxstack 2<BR>.locals (int V_0, int V_1, int V_2)<BR>L_0000: ldc.i4.3 <BR>L_0001: stloc.0 <BR>L_0002: ldc.i4.7 <BR>L_0003: stloc.2 <BR>L_0004: ldloc.0 <BR>L_0005: ldloc.2 <BR>L_0006: add.ovf <BR>L_0007: ret</CODE></P>
<P>Consider exactly the same function written using C#:</P>
<P><CODE>public int AddThreeAndSeven()<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; int a = 3;<BR>&nbsp; int b = 7;<BR>&nbsp; return a + b;<BR>}</CODE></P>
<P>This is the CIL that is generated:</P>
<P><CODE>.maxstack 2<BR>.locals (int V_0, int V_1)<BR>L_0000: ldc.i4.3 <BR>L_0001: stloc.0 <BR>L_0002: ldc.i4.7 <BR>L_0003: stloc.1 <BR>L_0004: ldloc.0 <BR>L_0005: ldloc.1 <BR>L_0006: add <BR>L_0007: ret</CODE></P>
<P>As you can see, the VB.NET code allocates space for an additional local variable <EM>that is never used</EM>. This is behavior is consistent between debug and release builds. I'm rather surprised by this behavior, but I'm certain that the JIT catches the unused variable and allocates space in the stack frame appropriately.</P></p>

          <div class="entryTitle">More Red Arrows Pictures</div>
          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-03</div>
          <p><P>I went back up on the roof yesterday to watch both of the shows that the <A href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/reds/redhome.html">RAF Red Arrows</A> performed. Here's a selection of the shots that I got of the planes flying by our building. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.pbase.com/jlam/raf_red_arrows">http://www.pbase.com/jlam/raf_red_arrows</A></P>
<P>They seemed a bit more restrained today, they didn't do the dramatic flyby that they did on Sunday, where one Red Arrow passed probably 100 feet over our heads on the roof of the building, while another 5 flying in tight formation passed 100 feet to the eastern side of our building!</P></p>

          <p><P>I've finally gotten around to uploading some of my photos from the Alaskan cruise that Carolyn and I took on our honeymoon. You can check them out in my PBase gallery:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.pbase.com/jlam/honeymoon">http://www.pbase.com/jlam/honeymoon</A></P>
<P>I'll be adding more to this gallery in the near future, especially wild animal pictures. We saw quite a few humpback whales, sea otters, harbor seals, and sea lions during our trip.</P></p>

          <div class="entryDate">2002-09-01</div>
          <p><P>I just got down from the roof of my building here in Toronto. The 53rd Canadian International Airshow is taking place all three days this long weekend. The <A href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/reds/">Royal Air Force Red Arrows</A> <EM>really</EM> love buzzing our building, unlike many of the other acts in previous years. This was the best shot that I got of the Red Arrows as they passed by:</P><SPAN>
