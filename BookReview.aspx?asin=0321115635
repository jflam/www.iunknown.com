Photoshop guru Ben Willmore believes the only way tomaster Photoshop is to go beyond simply memorizing steps, and gain anunder-the-hood understanding of the program. He does the job masterfully in<b>Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Studio Techniques</b>, a well-known favorite that delivers the essential information you need in a fun, well-written, easy-to-read style. Rather than detail every mind-numbing feature of Photoshop, Willmore's compact book cuts through the fat to focus on the concepts, features, and techniques that will truly make a difference in how you use Photoshop 7 every day. If you've ever wanted to understand complex concepts like curves and channels, or learn the logic behind Photoshop's keyboard commands, look no further.<P>Fully updated to cover the new features of Photoshop 7, <b>Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Studio Techniques</b> starts with the working foundations of Photoshop--thebasic tools, palettes, layers, and masks--and quickly moves on to real-worldproduction techniques, such as how to sharpen scans, correct and optimizeimages, and use color curves to your advantage. By the time you finish thebook, you'll have explored the creative aspects of Photoshop, such as how toblend or enhance images, master colorizing techniques, and create advancedtype effects. Included is an entirely new chapter on color management thatgives you practical instruction on implementing a color-managed workflowfrom monitor to press. A section on Web graphics rounds out the book, withchapters on image slicing and rollovers, creating effects for interfacedesign, animating effects, and optimizing images for Web. If you want to getbeyond conventional step-by-step instruction and become "Photoshopenlightened," this is the book for you.</P></BODY></HTML></span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book to help you really understand Photoshop. Ben Willmore's Photoshop 7 Studio Techniques is a book required by my latest Photoshop class. With a previous professor I was using Classroom in a Book. What a difference everything makes! <P>First thing, you open the book and it is filled with lovely color pictures. Imagine that? Sounds silly, but maybe, gasp, all computer graphics books should be in color? After all, we don't live in Pleasantville. <BR> <BR>Second, the book is easy to read. When you read a chapter you don't want to be bogged down reading a page for half an hour. The book informs you well, with a flow that makes you feel as though Ben is right there in a chair next to you. <P>Third, the book doesn't make you follow directions without letting you know the how and why of it all. This book actually teaches you how things work, without the pocket-protector. Anybody with the most basic understanding of their computer should easily learn from this text.<P>Fourth, all computer books should be accompanied by a cd-rom. There is also a web site mentioned in the book that the author runs that is well worth a bookmark.<P>I actually wanted a Classroom in a Book for an Illustrator class, because I was used to the format, and now I only wish that Ben Willmore wrote books for that program as well. All textbooks should be this informative and easy to read. Worth every penny.</span>

                    <span>I come from a strong photographic background and have been using Photoshop since version 4.0 for preparation of web and print material. I only wish I had this book 4 years ago instead of wasting my money and time on a dozen fluffy Photoshop books. If you only buy one Photoshop book, this is the one to get.<BR>Willmore has a gift for explaining the most complex subjects in a way that is very easy to understand. He holds your hand through many excercises but doesn't fall into the trap that most writers do by telling you step by step, you will learn Photoshop much more thoroughly with Wilmore's method.<P>Thinking of taking a college Photoshop class? Buy this book, work through all the chapters and you probably will end knowing more than than most teachers, this book is that good. <P>If you want to really learn Photoshop and not just follow steps 1 - 10 like most books do (and end up just knowing how to follow steps) this is the book to get.<P>The section on color management and color correction is worth the price of the book alone!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I had to for a class. I really didn't use it that much but when I had a problem or wanted to do something I found this book very useful. Before this book I would do a google of my question but often online explainations are weak. This book not only answered my questions thoroughly but gave examples on how to do things from time to time. If you want to learn how to use Photoshop, I would definitely reccommend this book. I would also reccommend this book if you are just want a reference guide for Photoshop.</span>
