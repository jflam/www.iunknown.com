                    <span>I purchased this book/DVD after seeing a very moving display of actual World Trade Center rubble. I was greatly impressed with the book. It goes into great detail of the timeline and events that occured that day. However the DVD really only had a few moments of live coverage then turns to clips of past 60 Minutes and 48 Hours. In the hour and a half that it takes to watch this DVD, there are barely 10 minutes devoted to the flight that crashed in PA. The book is something that I would reccommend be in every home, but if the DVD was scratched beyond repair it wouldn't be so bad.</span>

                    <span>This book, with its accompanying DVD, is a must for every public & personal library.  It chronicles the events that occurred during and after the events, both on a personal level for the families & survivors as well as for the companies affected.  What is revealed in this book is the response of American & United Airlines while their planes were missing--something that not many have written about.  The composure & professionalism maintained by Bryant Gumbel is a perfect example of journalism at its best.  A note about the DVD, it is not the complete coverage of the event as events unfolded but rather snippets.  Some of the footage & descriptions within the book are a little hard to take, even after two years, so I recommend reviewing the DVD before allowing children to see it.  Other than that, it brings back the memories we've had of that day.  This book will surely make it into the "Works Cited" pages of research papers on the topic for years to come.</span>

                    <span>I will never forget that day.  I was just getting up and flipped on the TV and set the channel to NBC (Today Show), to see what was going on in the world.  They had just come back from commercial's and there LIVE on TV was a live shot from a helicopter high above the NY skyline in the morning, showing the whole world a tall building, with billowing smoke coming out of it.  I remember she reported that they believed a small commuter plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers at the WTC.  I remember saying to myself "Bummer".  Then after about 8-10 minutes I was on the phone with my boyfriend telling him he was missing a great call in NYC, but we lived in New Jersey. <br>(He is Firechief here in our town.)  He was on his way home to see what was going on and after I hung up with him, I turned my attention back to the TV right to see a live shot from one of the helicopters the second plane to hit the other Tower.  I knew something was wrong.  The whole day we watched and just couldnt believe what was going on.  As the months went on and we began to pick up the pieces, I was shopping at our local Target and came across this book that had just came out.  I grabbed it with out even looking at the price and knew I had to have it.  I am a history junkie and would love to have a copy for future memories and to share with family and friends.  I was not disappointed with this book, the DVD was alittle off and drifted from the main plot, but I will still always remember where I was when I heard the news. Like people say they remember where they were when they heard about JFK being shot, the Shuttle exploding (both times), Princess Diana's death and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Great book to have around for reference and to share the stories with if you have small children who wouldnt remember that day.</span>

                    <span>I have to believe that CBS News could come up with a better DVD on the events of 9/11 than this one. I was hoping to see the CBS live coverage of the tragedy but was greatly disappointed. Outside of about 10 minutes of live coverage of the world trade center attacks, the vast majority of the DVD is nothing but segments from 60 Minutes and 48 Hours. Human interest stories are great to fill out this sort of thing but there is far too much of it here. I was astounded to note that CBS apparently had no live coverage of the collapse of either tower. And no mention at all was made of Flight 93 as the events unfold in this program - such coverage only occupying an isolated 5-10 minutes halfway through the DVD. CBS had an opportunity here to give us and future generations a real feel for an historic event as it unfolded ... and they blew it.</span>

                    <span>I didn't get to see the events of September 11, 2001 unfold. Sadly, I spent most of that day sleeping, as I had worked the night before and needed to rest up for a busy night at work. Too bad I didn't realize that while I was sleeping, the world as I knew it changed forever.<p>We all know how bad 9-11 was for American and world society. It is probably the most crippling thing to ever happen to this country. I always wanted to see what it was like that fateful morning, to see how news reporters reacted to the shocking development of a commuter plane crashing into a tower in the World Trade Center, to the horryfying conclusion that a terrorist group was trying to destroy America.<p>Fortunately, CBS News decided to release a book/DVD set called "What We Saw". I cannot recommend this enough, as it features in depth analysis of what witnesses saw that day, and step-by-step recounts of the aftermath of the destruction that took place in New York, Washington DC, and a little town in Pennsylvania. <p>The book is well written, thought provoking, and has deep insight into the true meaning of September 11. But the reason I bought the book was for the enclosed DVD, and it did not disappoint. For those of you like me who were unfortunate enough to not have seen the events unfolding that day, you can now experience the horror and find out what made 9-11 the worst day in American history.<p>If you see this book, do not hesistate to buy it. It's also for a good cause, as 10 percent of all profits go to the Robin Hood Relief Fund, who provide support to the low-income families of the tragedy.</span>
