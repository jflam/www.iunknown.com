                    <span>Ms. Noonan's book is as relavent now as the day it was published, and certainly a more important resource. In today's quagmire of conservative revisionist texts and nostalgic Reagan speaking points, the 1980s are fast becoming those "good old days" that people speak foldly of, yet whose true image has been blurred. "The Revolution" provides its readers with an eye witness perspective whose case has not been marred by the passage of time. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a good book, although with some flaws.  It's clear that Noonan is a good writer, and a lot of the book is very affecting.  It's largely a bunch of sketches strung together by her loose reminescences and/or her exposition of some abstract theory, each taking up a chapter.  This makes it very fun to just pick up the book and flip around - the theories are often pretty convincing and the sketches (typical Washington memoir stuff, although with a few concealed identities) are interesting, of course.  
<br />
<br />The drawbacks are that such a literate book has flashes of really cheap partisan snipping.  When you consider it, what made Reagan (and Noonan's book) successful is their tapping into not just a Republican wellspring of thought, but into an American one.  Noonan reads FDR to get the "voice" of the presidency, for example (hard to imagine that happening with W's minions).  So it's jarring when in the midst of her book she makes some passive-aggressive, straw man attack on liberals, who of course aren't able to defend themselves.  I remember Reagan used to make a speech in the 1980 campaign about how "some people will tell you America's day has passed, that its glory days are behind it, that it can no longer lead in the world today" or words to that effect.  Carter did not say that, and no one with a clue ever would.  Reagan could have made the same point about American heming and hawing without the straw man method.  
<br />
<br />So it is with Noonan: every now and then she'll make some comment about how Democrats are ashamed of the lower class, or some aside about how extreme some person is, and of course she can get away with it - it's her book.  But it takes away from her appeal as a thoughtful conservative.  It's ironic to see her do this and then, for example, absolve Pat Buchanan of any extremism by noting, "wow, he likes Auden!"
<br />
<br />Which brings me to the other flaw: as the above review noted, she acts like a schoolgirl towards Reagan.  He is SOOO perfect, nice, dreamy, etc.  Gimme a break - has she ever heard of Truman, for example?  But so much for conservative individualism: she seems content to worship the king to no end, to embarrassing and detrimental effect to her book.
<br />
<br />So final verdict: well-done, but with flaws, but definitely worth it.  </span>

                    <span>By listening to Media Gods you would never know that there are women who are conservative and can read and write and actually believed in Ronald Reagan.
<br />
<br />Well, there goes all the invitations to fancy Manhattan parties. No more power-lunching with the hairy-armpit wing of feminism.
<br />
<br />Rather than get pure policy and political argument, you get the perspective of a detached, amused observer in the middle of the White House world. 
<br />
<br />Noonan creates an image of what it would be like to run into Reagan, shake his hand, and say a few words. There are memorable images of Reagan's staff.
<br />
<br />But Noonan gets beyond sensory data and provides historically important information: some on Reagan's staff and the administration tried to steer Reagan's speeches away from his convictions.
<br />
<br />The myth is that Reagan was managed, handled, and marketed super-cynically. The truth is, through his speechmaking and Noonan's assistance, he stayed true to his principles.

                    <span>"Specificity is the soul of credibility," Noonan tells us and goes on to earn her credibility through the detailed descriptions presented in this masterful slice of American history. The quote actually refers to the editing of a canned stump speech edited slighted for various locations so that local politicians and locations distinguish one place from another on the tour.<p>Noonan allows readers to capture the flavor of the internal fighting among the powers that be in a presidential administration. Nearly everyone can identify with the "experts" being totally wrong in their advice. She discusses several incidences where she was second-guessed by people trying to "help her" improve her speeches and shows how the ones that were unedited were the best received. Virtually anyone in communication can identify with that sort of experience at some level.<p>There's an element of mystery included. She talks about Reagan giving her a joke, mentioning that someday she could use it when she did other things. When he hung up the phone she says, "he knows something I don't know. He knows I'm going to write about these days." She did and the result tells a lot about human nature, politics, and dysfunctional systems. In spite of the dysfunctions, worthwhile accomplishments were made.</span>
