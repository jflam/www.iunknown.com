                <span id="Label1">Forget about those old bed-in-a-bag deals--California Design Studio's gorgeous book, <I>Bedrooms</I>, is ready to help you create a personal, comfortable haven that is totally unique. Dazzling photography combines with suggestions straight from designers to form a book as lovely as it is practical. Finishing with a source guide, you can get started on redecorating right away--although most stores are located in California, there's plenty of national chains and mail order choices as well.<p> Practical considerations cover adding a home office or bookshelves, as well as appropriate choices for window coverings and mattresses. The sections devoted to rooms for guests and children show special thought for the different concerns in those areas--tired guests deserve a truly relaxing space, while it's important that children's rooms can grow with them (avoid that Pokeacute;mon bedspread--will they like it as teens?)  Simple updates made with paint and fabric are suggested repeatedly, making the point that there's no need to break your budget to achieve a new look. However, this book doesn't provide much in the way of step-by-step instructions for those improvements, but certainly, for providing inspiration, it's one of the best.  As it's a lightweight paperback, it's perfect for curling up in bed with in the evening. Who knows what changes you'll dream up? <I>--Jill Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>If you feel stumped for ideas on how to design a bedroom, and you have a limited budget, Bedrooms will help release you from that in-the-box mentality that you get from strolling through one too many furniture showrooms that encourage you to buy a complete bedroom set.  Do not be fooled by the "(California Design)" in the title, this is not a book of California-esque bedroom design, rather, it's a book of interior design for the bedroom by a collection of California designers.  The designs covered range from minimalist, to grand, to traditional, to just plain homey.  Certainly, the numerous color photographs throughout represent people who, in most cases, probably spent a lot of money to have their bedrooms designed as shown, but it is not at all hard to imagine how to apply the same methods to your create own dream bedroom even with things you buy at a flea market.<p>From this book I learned that I could mix and match furniture, not just in the bedroom, but elsewhere, and utilize the eclectic "stuff" I already own to create a comfortable atmosphere.  You will not find a step-by-step guide in these pages, rather you will find lovely photos and frequently asked questions covered such as: Should a TV be in a bedroom and how? What can one do with a small room? How can I create a romantic bedroom? How can one design a room that will not look dated too soon? What paint colors are best for a bedroom?<p>Aside from the design-ideas aspect of Bedrooms, I just enjoy looking at the photos for relaxation.</span>
