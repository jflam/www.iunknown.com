                    <span>My husband loves this book and I actually started to get more interested in baseball. If I had to choose one sport to watch, it would be baseball or tennis. While I would rather be watching a romantic movie, this book was to say the least, entertaining. <P>When I showed this book to my husband, he was intrigued. I also immediately noticed the "inside of the baseball" picture and never realized how many layers there were. There is also a picture of the "type of hits" which was a bit enlightening for me, being I am a baseball newbie. <P>So, come and explore baseball in pictures. The equipment, history, teams, techniques, rules and personalities of America's National Pastime are all included. Do you want to know the secrets of the success of Major League players? Discover why baseball has been a important part of American life for more than 150 years? Well the concise text and carefully researched definitions are user-friendly for people of all ages. This is a source for the specialized vocabulary of baseball and I would recommend it to all wives who's husbands are baseball addicts, to young players and to all baseball fans. <P>I am in love with visual dictionaries at the moment. This one is packed with full-color photographs and hundreds of terms and historical facts. The comprehensive Index, Appendix and Glossary also direct you to the illustrations you are looking for. <P>In this book you will learn about the origins of the game, the Diamond, the rules, bats and balls, baseball gloves, uniforms, catcher's gear, fielding positions and techniques, batting, pitching, baserunning, managers and coaches, umpires, ballparks, keeping score, statistics, The American League, The National League, The World Series, The Baseball Hall of Fame, Baseball Cards (very important), youth baseball, softball games and baseball around the world. <P>Author James Buckley, Jr., is a veteran sportswriter. He has worked for Sports Illustrated and other national magazines for both adults and children. As a former youth baseball coach, he has also written many articles on baseball and other sports. He brings a wealth of knowledge to this book and is also the author of Super Shortstops, Strikeout Kings and Home Run Heroes.<P>My husband enjoyed adding this to his baseball book collection. He also collects baseball cards and I am starting to realize why they are so important to him.</span>

                    <span>The quality and beauty of this book are first-rate. As a long-time baseball fan myself, it is a pleasure to peruse this book's wealth of photographs and trivia that give baseball its unique richness. Even better, this book appears to be a useful tool in developing an appreciation of the game by my wife and children, who are actually fighting over who gets to read the book each night! Now we're ready for the season to begin! Play ball! Go Dodgers!</span>

                    <span>I was with my kids at a friends house recently and came across a copy of this book. My kids and I spent an hour with it and they couldn't put it down. Being an avid baseball fan myself, I was intrigued with this new perspective of the game. My kids loved the pictures...it's bluntly true that a picture is worth a 1000 words (which happens to be the maximum length of this review!). They wanted to go out and play baseball right away. We liked it so much that we're buying a copy for our own house!</span>
