(She reads a chapter of <I>The Imitation of Christ</I> every night before sleep.) <I>Imitation</I> has exerted immense influence on Christian worship, ethics, and church structure, because it gives specific yet broad-minded guidance about the central task of Christian life--learning to live like Jesus. Better to read this book a little here and there, now and then, than to try gobbling it cover to cover. <I>Imitation</I> is no triumph of orderly thinking, but it's a great monument and incentive to deep living.  <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I></span>

Invest the time to read passages of this book regularly and your life will get better, period.</span>

                    <span>The author has a spirit of humility that permeates the entire work. He is a man of God indeed. What a legacy we have in this truly inspiring book! This is the kind of reading that will transform your life for the better.
<br />
<br />Nuggets of truth are found throughout the whole book. The insight he shares is for any culture, any place, and all generations. His closing comments give a flavor of what one can find: "If the works of God were such that they could easily be comprehended by human reason, they would not rightly be called either wonderful or unspeakable."
<br />
<br />This 500 year old book is so much more relevant today than a lot of what is being turned out on the press now. It helps you to put things into proper perspective.</span>

                    <span>I read this book perhaps more frequently than any other book. Quintessential Christian reading. Following Christ isn't just about joy. We are called to deny ourselves daily, and to carry our crosses. More than console, this book calls us to imitate Christ, to do the real tough work of living in humility and obedience. It is beautiful, passionate, powerful, and challenging. Read it.</span>

                    <span>Whether you're a Christian looking for inspiration in your faith or a non-Christian after an amazing insight into the spiritual side of the church, this book won't disappoint! It is generally a pretty easy read with short chapters on defined topics. As such, the translation seems quite good. Thomas a Kempis soaks the pages with the love and peace that he has acquired from hir religion. The book contains many moral and ethical lessons on peace and humility that as needed in our world as ever. And this is done in a tone that is far from the dry dogmatic style of many other Christian fathers.<p>It's easy to see why, outside the Bible, this has been one of the most popular Christian books!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Second only to the Bible itself, this book speaks directly to the heart and spirit of the Christian. It makes a great devotional, as it lends itself best to careful reflection, a little at a time. It demands to be reread as one matures as a Christian, always with fresh insight.</span>
