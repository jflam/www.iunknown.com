Then a storm exploded on the mountain, ripping the team to shreds, forcing brave men to scratch and crawl for their lives. Rescuers who reached Weathers saw that he was dying, and left him. <br><br>Twelve hours later, the inexplicable occurred. Weathers appeared, blinded, gloveless, caked with ice &#8212; coming down the mountain as a &#8220;dead man walking.&#8221;<br><br>In this powerful memoir, Weather describes not only his escape from hypothermia and the murderous storm that killed nine climbers; he describes another journey, a life&#8217;s journey. This is the story of a man&#8217;s route to a dangerous sport and a fateful expedition, as well as the road of recovery he has traveled since.<br><br>In <b>Left for Dead</b>, we are witness to survival in the face of certain death, the reclaiming of a family and a life, and the most remarkable adventure of all: what we can do when we&#8217;re offered a second chance. <br></span>

                    <span>I believe that I am one of the few who actually enjoyed this book. I started reading with low expectations. I had seen Dr. Weathers speak.He is an engaging person, but after listening to Dr. Weathers, I knew his book would not be a another version of INTO THIN AIR, John Krakauer's tale of the 1996 Everest disaster. However, I like the book's format. I wanted to hear his family's and friend's input. This story is about physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. Dr. Weathers was a very self-absorbed man. He abused his body in preparation for the climbs besides abusing himself during all the climbs. None of the climbs were magical or wonderful but a case study in surviving under the most brutal conditions. Dr. Weathers emotionally abused his family by being an absentee husband and father. He emotionally abused himself by not seeking help for his severe depression. He psychologically abused his wife by ignoring her and leading a seperate exstence within their own home. How his family survived and stayed together is truly the miracle. The book does not to attempt to find all the answers to Dr. Weather's troubles. In fact, I would like to know the financial costs for all his expeditions to climb the highest peaks. He never discusses them. His partners probably would not given enough credit. How was Dr. Weathers able to take so much time off from work? He was gone for 4-5 weeks several times. Most of us employed or in my case, self-employed, can not accomplish this feat.</span>

                    <span>To be perfectly clear, I am glad I read this book. The problem is that I'm only glad to have read about 20% of it, the rest is stuff that I frankly could care less about. Now, there are people would appreciate the soap opera Weathers describes as the relationship between he and his wife deteriorates. You can find these people in the trash-novel section of your local booksture. The folks who browse the mountaineering section of said bookstore are more interested in the 20% that I was referring to above - The actual experience on everest and its aftermath, which is presented honestly and is quite intriguing. Even gripping. It has value. It is worth the $7. It is the reason why I gave this book two stars, not one. However, the majority of this book is a chore to read.</span>

                    <span>I read this book and was severely disappointed in the story. I've read a lot of the accounts from the 1996 tragedy and Beck Weathers story was particularly fascinating. I truly expected someone who came back to life to really have something good to say, lessons learned, but that was not what I got out of the book. He does not seem contrite that he left his family alone most of the time for years for his climbing pursuits, comes back half dead needing them desperately. The book makes me think he'd do it over again and did not learn much from his ordeal. His wife seems extremely bitter (probably not unjustified).</span>

                    <span>The subtitle is "My Journey Home From Everest" which should actually be the title. By page 99 out of page 340, Mr. Weathers is out of the mountains trying to cope with being back in civilization after going through lleh. <P>I didn't read the subtitle when I was buying the book and was expecting most of the book to be about his time on Everest. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. By page 160 when he is battling with his psychological demons, a problematic family life, etc., it was time for me to put the book down and move on to other books. While he was successful with most of his battles and no doubt is inspiring, he uses his Mount Everest experience to springboard into his personal spiritual battle.<P>If you want to read this book, read it as a spiritual conquest by someone who happens to climb mountains.<P>Do not read this book as a mountaineering book.<P>I have listened to a speech that Mr. Weathers gave to the American Bar Association and think the world of him and what he went through on the mountain. Unfortunately I think very little of his book here. :-(</span>

                    <span>Somehow, Beck Weathers managed to write a book about the tragic climb and descent and death and coming back to life atop Everest totally boring. Enjoyed Beck and Peach's chapters on their cats more than anything.</span>
