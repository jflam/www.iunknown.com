                    <span>The first thing you will notice if you are wanting to study 'feng shui' , is the sheer volume of publications available. Browse any book shop or 'new age' centre and you will undoubtedly see shelves upon shelves of books 'claiming' to be written by 'masters' and claiming to offer you a 'quick fix' to increase both your wealth and happiness by 'apparently' using the ancient art of Chinese Geometry (feng shui) - hang a wind chime here, a mirror there, add a bowl of water and BINGO! health, wealth and happiness are sure to follow.... Hmmm! Really?! Ever wondered why they never worked, ever wondered why they are rather thin on actual facts and formulas ('feng shui' is a science after all) - well the reason is that when the 'feng shui' badwagon rolled into town, every hippy-dippie and their wife, mother or cousin who had an inclin towards; crystals, new-age or the occult was there waving their flag ang joining in. Hence forth soon you couldn't see the real for the false, the masters for the charlatans, and all confusion broke out. The people you were inviting in to 'read' your homes were largely un-qualified or possessed the mere basics, and so their 'cures' seldom worked. Step forth 'modest' Master Larry Tsang to put things straight. I am not saying that if you are of Asian descent you know more that 'westerners' - not at all, but what I am saying is bring forth a modest man, immensely knowlegable, a man who understands this science inside out, back to front AND upside down, see a man such as this and you KNOW he speaks and writes the truth. 
<br />There are VERY vew people on this earth who can claim to be really such an authority on 'feng shui' as to actually write a book on the subject. I mean how many people are really capable of writing a chemistry text, or a physics one? very few I suppose. So then why is it SO MANY people think they have a right to offer their thoughts on this ancient Chinese science? As Loa Tse says in the Dao De Ching 'He who does not know speaks, and he who does not speak knows'.
<br />The first thing you will notice when you open Master Sang's book, is that there are no colour photos, no windchimes, no pictures of old Chinese people practicing 'Tai Chi Chuan' nor any smiling couples holding babies. 'Feng shui' is a SCIENCE and so this looks like what it should, a 'science' text book. Besides that difference you will also note that this book contains information, not tall stories and myths. It contains formulas, calculations, charts, tables and CLEAR, succint explanations that will empower you to be able to read your own home, and furthermoor, UNDERSTAND it, it's problems and most importantly it's REMEDIES. This book is a full-on, no holes barred 'feng shui' experience and I admit that if you aren't used to reading very 'academic' texts you WILL need to go back through it, and through it and through it before the penny drops, but once it has dropped, you will begin to see for YOURSELF, how all the things fit together, and you will begin to see how just about all the other books are pure fable.
<br />As I said, although the book is very clear and logical, it is pretty tough going, simply because of the sheer volume of the information you have to take in.
<br />
<br />One final thing is that, as this text forms part of the curriculum of the America Feng Shui Institute http://www.amfengshui.com if you check that site you will find all manner of extra explanations and notice boards where you can learn or clarify questions you have, you can even study 'on-line' to further increase your knowledge and understanding. I wonder how many other so called 'feng shui' masters or teachers can lay claim to such dedication or motivation to spread the word of 'feng shui'?</span>

                    <span>The strength of this book is that it describes fairly well external features in the environment and how they affect the feng shui of the house. However this only covers eight mansion style, not flying star feng shui.  The weakness of the book is that the information is not organized well and is confusing to decipher, especially if it is the first feng shui book you read. When so many other excellent books on compass feng shui are currently on the market there's little reason to consider getting this one.</span>

                    <span>I was very intimidated by the 'compass school' of feng shui (I had listened to too many of my new age friends who were looking for "quick" feng shui cures - ala Black Hat Sect philosophy.) but I didn't feel the 'bagua type' feng shui really worked for me.  It seemed to be missing something.  Finally, I picked up Master Sang's book and voila!  I understood the basics of the 'compass school' feng shui!!!!  This book spells it out in an easy to read manner - I can't believe how much it helped me in my feng shui studies!  It is a great introduction to the art of traditional Chinese feng shui.  I would recommend this book to every person interested in feng shui - it's clear, it's concise and best of all - it works!</span>

                    <span>this is the 2nd book i have read related to this subject and i found this one hard to understand. I don't have a LO Pan for one thing and the constant use of chinese symbols that i cannot read were unnecessary. I just found the whole thing confusing.</span>
