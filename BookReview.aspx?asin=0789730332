                    <span>On occasion, I teach a course with a title having the form, "Introduction to Microcomputers", where the goal is to introduce students to some of the fundamentals of how computers work and what they are used for. Generally, the material that they find easiest to understand is that which can be illustrated by examples demonstrated on a computer. In second place are the concepts that are explained using high quality illustrations.  That is where this book is extraordinary.<br> The author and illustrator clearly put a great deal of thought and effort into the structure and appearance of the illustrations, they are the best demonstrations of computer fundamentals that I have ever seen. The publishers are also to be commended for using high quality coloring and paper, which makes the pictures very easy on the eyes, although there are a few times when the contrast between the text and figure colors is not enough to make it easy to read the text. They quite correctly let the illustrations do as much of the explaining as possible, resorting to text only when necessary.<br> It is split into eight parts:<p>* Boot-up process.<br>* Microchips.<br>* How software works.<br>* Data storage.<br>* Input/output devices.<br>* Multimedia.<br>* How the Internet works.<br>* How printers work.<p>covering all of the material that is the normal coverage in an introduction to microcomputers course. There are also occasional segments of glossary, where the key terms in the section are defined.<br> This is a high quality book, the best introductory material on how computers work designed for the novice that I have ever seen. If study questions were included, I would start using it as a textbook. <p>This review refers to the seventh edition.</span>

                    <span>When i first pick this book i expect to have  a book with some nice pictures about how computers works, now that i{m reading the book i have to say that i become adicted to it. Easy to understand, and very interesting topics about the different devices that computers and thecnology can bring to us explained in a very nice manner and with incredibly clear draws and diagrams. PLUS a very nice cd rom with a virtual tour inside a computer and better yet some nice links to get more info.And it doesn{t stops there, because the cd rom have some really useful SW you can use and try in your computer. It{s been a long time since the last time i pick such a nice book.Give it a try it worth each dollar you invest on it and more.<br>And for the end i never write reviews so it tells how much i like this book.</span>

                    <span>I work in the IT /  Computer Repair industry, and I personally feel that this book is very helpful to most individuals, especially those who have little familiarity with computer systems, internal structures, gadgets and whatnots.  <br>I found the detailed and heavily-illustrated sections regarding chipsets, processors, memory buffers, etc. to be very helpful.  Most computer manuals are very technical and assume you know a computer inside and out, already (despite constant development in the industry and the fact that by the time a computer hits the shelves it is out-dated).<br>These "How Computers / Internet," etc. books are wonderful manuals for those who just want to know "how the heck does this crazy thing work, anyway ?!?!"<br>You won't be able to pass your A+ Certifications with this series of books, but you will understand much of the jargon people throw-around in the office, and you will see flow charts of "How Computers Work."<br>    I sincerely appreciated the diagrams of a Techtronix Printer!<br>    Suffice to Say, if "a picture is worth a thousand words," this book is pricesless for the novice and very helpful for the beginning (uncertified) Techs in the computer repair field.  The usual Black & White Illustrations in computer manuals aren't exactly condusive to really getting a feel for the stuff you might be yanking out and replacing.  However, this book is full of numerous full-color, full-page illustrations.</span>

                    <span>with this book. You want a fun, entertaining introduction to computers? Get this book. The excellent pictures and diagrams clearly explain how all that hardware and software interacts in plain english. This book is good enough it can actually be a great aid in studying for A+ certification. I've met a lot of supposed "techs" who could actually gain something by reading it. When I took it to work people would laugh - until I handed it to them and they started reading.  They quit laughing and many of them quickly aquired their own copy soon after.<p>It won't make you a computer guru. If that is your eventual goal you'll need other books. But everyone has to start somewhere and this book can make the process more understandable and enjoyable. The cd is fun to watch and is yet another way to continue learning. For those who own Macs there is a Mac version of this book that is every bit as understandable and fun to read.</span>
