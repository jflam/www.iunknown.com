                    <span>I've been looking forward to the DVD version of this film for ages. It's funny, and goes against form in showing the "heartless" capitalist as a moral, likable person. The proxy battle scene is one of my favorites in all of film, with Gregory Peck and Devito forcefully advocating different views on the purpose of a company. 
<br />
<br />I will go against popular opinion and say it is strange that Devito's character falls madly in love with Penelope Miller's character. She does a lousy job playing a sexy street-smart lawyer, and all the revealing dresses in the world couldn't cover that ineptitude. Thus the 4 star review.
<br />
<br />The DVD is a pleasant surprise. The wide screen reveals what the cinematographer was going for with the short, stocky Devito strutting across the screen. It's both comic and adds to the character seeing a little man who walks like a giant. I saw this movie on my new Dell LCD monitor and the colors are deep and beautiful, with no noticeable dirt on the print: an excellent transfer for an obscure movie. Nothing special in the way of special features, but what do you expect?</span>

                    <span>This DVD is of pretty good quality, not "remastered", but normal DVD quality, and it is in "widescreen" format, the audio is fine. There are no extra features.
<br />
<br />I wondered if this was ever coming out on DVD, and why not? Look at the cast - Danny DeVito, Penelope Ann Miller, Gregory Peck, Piper Laurie, Dean Stockwell. It did well at the box office, but then....nothing. Well it's finally here.
<br />
<br />I agree that the match-up of Danny DeVito and Penelope Ann Miller seems a bit odd at the beginning, but as the movie unfolds, you begin to understand the attraction. Danny's attraction to Penelope's character is for obvious reasons, but her's are NOT so obvious.  However, as she gets to know him she finds that, in spite of his appearance, he is not only rich and powerful, but also a smart, funny, romantic, caring person who also provides her with the most powerful aphrodisiac of all - he admits he's madly in love with her. We all find THAT very attractive in another person, don't we? Still, this movie doesn't provide that usual "guy gets the girl" ending, but leaves it hanging as a possibility, since Penelope's character, in spite of her attraction, is still somewhat put off - both by his appearance, and his profession.
<br />
<br />This is a great movie about the "merger and acquisition" frenzy of the 80's, and has absolutely stellar acting and writing. I also like that Penelope's character doesn't mind using her obvious physical assets to her advantage. After all, if you've got the smarts to back it up, then why not? All's fair, and so on. All-in-all a very enjoyable movie, maybe not for everyone, but certainly just right for some.
<br />
<br />And it really points out that you CAN'T judge a book by it's cover.</span>

                    <span>This movie is entertaining from beginning to end, although it's a wee bit stagey (it's based on an off-Broadway play). I disagree slightly with the other reviewers in that this film reminds me more of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl" than "Wall Street" -- the Danny DeVito character is much more human than the Michael Douglas character in "Wall Street." Larry the Liquidator likes to make money as much as he likes to eat donuts, but he's also capable of loving someone else (I thought the donuts in the flower box and the violin-by-telephone touches were very sweet). Gregory Peck was perfect as well (and as usual).</span>

                    <span>Danny DeVito is the right actor to play Larry the Liquidator. He doesn't have to say that he uses big piles of money to compensate for the lack of love in his life. We know. We can see it in Larry's eyes, which sparkle when he talks about accumulating other people's money, but turn into the large, brown eyes of an adoring spaniel whenever he gazes upon Kate Sullivan.
<br />
<br />She is the attorney who stands between him and New England Wire & Cable, a second-generation family firm that has fallen on hard times but has no debt and a lot of cash. Larry wants to raid the company, break it up, strip the assets, and sell the profitable divisions. The company's president, an old-fashioned stalwart named Jorgy and played by Gregory Peck, wants to continue making wire and cable.
<br />
<br />The situation is complicated because Miss Sullivan (Penelope Ann Miller) is the daughter of Jorgy's assistant and companion (played by Piper Laurie). Kate is a foot taller than Larry the Liquidator, is blond, is sleek, is chic, and who knows how to push all of Larry's buttons. From the moment she walks into his office, determined to defeat him and save the company, he knows he is in love. He also knows he wants to win.
<br />
<br />Larry is a smart man. That's one of his appeals. He is also immensely likable, except when he is trying to strip-mine the family firm. Kate finds him intriguing on first sight, but she wants to defeat him in the struggle for the company, and so Norman Jewison's "Other People's Money" turns into a wrestling match between lust and greed. Since these are two of the strongest motivations known to humankind, the movie is very funny and at the same time tremendously interesting.
<br />
<br />We see something of Larry's life - the expensive corner office in the Manhattan tower, the blocklong limousine, the town house, the butler. We see that it is empty of everything except a great deal of money. We see some thing of Kate's life - the high-powered law firm, the chic fashions, the handsome but empty guys who take her to the opera. We see that it is empty except for defending other people's money. They need each other and they know it, and they spar with this unspoken knowledge in a series of wonderful scenes, including a lunch in a Japanese restaurant and a telephone conversation during which he serenades her on his violin.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the takeover bid climaxes in a shareholder's meeting inside the factory, at which both Jorgy and Larry make speeches. Gregory Peck's words and delivery here reminded me of the key scenes in a lot of the Frank Capra classics, where the little guy stood up and defended old-fashioned American values, and got a standing ovation, and the movie was over. In "Other People's Money," after Peck sits down, DeVito stands up, and defends greed. It is amazing how good an argument he makes.
<br />
<br />The problem is, if he wins the company, will he lose the girl? Maybe the best single moment in the movie comes when he is sure he will never, ever, get to first base with Kate. He falls flat on his face onto the bedspread, stunned with grief and loss, and his butler tries to cheer him. Nothing will work. No material pleasure can possibly cure his agony. "How about a piece of that carrot cake you like?" the butler asks. The timing of DeVito's response to this question wins a roar of laughter.
<br />
<br />I didn't like the very last scene of "Other People's Money." It felt tacked on, manufactured, concocted out of a Hollywood studio's knee-jerk need to provide a smileyface ending that was not in the spirit of the film. "Other People's Money" is a four-star movie that loses its way in the last, crucial scene, and for that it loses half a star, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy every moment right up until the happy ending, which is the unhappiest moment in the movie.
