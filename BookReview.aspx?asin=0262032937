                <span id="Label1">Aimed at any serious programmer or computer science student,  the new second edition of <I>Introduction to Algorithms</I> builds on  the tradition of the original with a truly magisterial guide to the  world of algorithms. Clearly presented, mathematically rigorous, and  yet approachable even for the math-averse, this title sets a high  standard for a textbook and reference to the best algorithms for  solving a wide range of computing problems.<p>With sample problems and  mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm,  this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach  doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job of explaining each  algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help  readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some math background  to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.)  Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented  in any computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical  approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and  common data structures, from basic linked lists to trees (including  binary trees, red-black, and B-trees), this title really shines, with  clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you just  glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit  from this text in other ways.<p>The book moves forward with more  advanced algorithms that implement strategies for solving more  complicated problems (including dynamic programming techniques, greedy  algorithms, and amortized analysis). Algorithms for graphing problems  (used in such real-world business problems as optimizing flight  schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the  authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along  with sample solutions.<p>This text closes with a grab bag of useful  algorithms including matrix operations and linear programming,  evaluating polynomials, and the well-known Fast Fourier Transformation  (FFT) (useful in signal processing and engineering). Final sections on  "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known traveling salesman problem,  show off that while not all problems have a demonstrably final and best  answer, algorithms that generate acceptable approximate solutions can  still be used to generate useful, real-world answers.<p>Throughout this  text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with current  examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome Project),  business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of  related historical material, often discussing original research in each  area of algorithms. On the whole, they argue successfully that  algorithms are a "technology" just like hardware and software that can  be used to write better software that does more, with better  performance. Along with classic books on algorithms (like Donald  Knuth's three-volume set, <I>The Art of Computer  Programming</I>), this title sets a new standard for compiling the  best research in algorithms. For any experienced developer, regardless  of their chosen language, this text deserves a close look for extending  the range and performance of real-world software. <I>--Richard  Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview of algorithms (including algorithms as  a technology); designing and analyzing algorithms; asymptotic notation;  recurrences and recursion; probabilistic analysis and randomized  algorithms; heapsort algorithms; priority queues; quicksort algorithms;  linear time sorting (including radix and bucket sort); medians and  order statistics (including minimum and maximum); introduction to data  structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees); hash  tables (including hash functions); binary search trees; red-black  trees; augmenting data structures for custom applications; dynamic  programming explained (including assembly-line scheduling, matrix-chain  multiplication, and optimal binary search trees); greedy algorithms  (including Huffman codes and task-scheduling problems); amortized  analysis (the accounting and potential methods); advanced data  structures (including B-trees, binomial and Fibonacci heaps,  representing disjoint sets in data structures); graph algorithms  (representing graphs, minimum spanning trees, single-source shortest  paths, all-pairs shortest paths, and maximum flow algorithms); sorting  networks; matrix operations; linear programming (standard and slack  forms); polynomials and the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); number  theoretic algorithms (including greatest common divisor, modular  arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem, RSA public-key encryption,  primality testing, integer factorization); string matching;  computational geometry (including finding the convex hull);  NP-completeness (including sample real-world NP-complete problems and  their insolvability); approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems  (including the traveling salesman problem); reference sections for  summations and other mathematical notation, sets, relations, functions,  graphs and trees, as well as counting and probability backgrounder  (plus geometric and binomial distributions).</span>

                    <span>I am an EE PhD student in Princeton, with basic CS background. I bought this book about a week ago, and I just finished reading more than half of it. I am impressed by the organisation and dedication of the authors to write something understandable to a wide audience, without sacrificing in depth analysis. If you need a good and complete introductory book,  that summarizes also the latest research in the field, I would recommend this one. 
<br />
<br />Drawbacks...Minor (+ I am a weird guy) and hardly mentionable, but I have the feeling that some proofs may have been presented more rigorously. I would also like to see more examples or SOLUTIONS to some of the problems. </span>

                    <span>A good introductory text but that's about it. Any CS major worth his salt should chew his way through this level material pretty quickly, and there's the only rub... at points this could be a little bit more concise because it actually can aid understanding in an exact field. Sometimes less is more. The spared pages could be used to cover more material or to raise the bar a little.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a very good introductory book to the various topics of algorithms.  It contains a great introduction on Big-Oh analysis, standard techniques of programming (such as greedy, DP and so on) and even dabbles in the world of NP-completeness and approximation algorithms.  A lot of other very interesting topics are surveyed, such as the FFT, linear algebra, the simplex method, computational geometry, etc.  All-in-all, if you are looking for a somewhat mature introduction to these topics, the book seems to give a fair representation of each.<p>However, there are a few drawbacks.  The book should have more information on further studies if the reader wants to pursue a specific topic.  The book should also have included Cook's theorem for the reduction of an NDTM to SAT in polynomial time.  Finally, in a book on advanced algorithms that covers so many topics, parallel algorithms should make a small appearance beyond sorting networks.</span>

                    <span>Having never gone to university (I sadly went to a small community college and am, for the most part, self-taught), I didn't know exactly what to expect from this book. From other reviewers, I gathered that this was "the book" on algorithms. I pretty much got the feeling that if I truly wanted a firm grasp on some of the programming algorithms in use out there, this was the book to buy. Boy, was I wrong...
<br />
<br />As stated by CJB in his (or her) review (sorry, can't tell your gender by initials ;)), this book seems to be geared towards computer scientists, not so much programmers (and I agree - there IS a huge difference). If you don't have a fairly formal background in math, a fair amount of this book may be a bit over your head (trust me, I know from my sub-university-level math knowledge). Also, if you're not used to (or don't like) reading dry university-style text, then this book probably won't be for you.
<br />
<br />However...
<br />
<br />If you enjoy challenging yourself (I do), and don't mind spending time on Google looking up things that you don't understand at first, this book may (somewhat) be what you're looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this book (that other people seemed to dislike) is the pseudocode. If you're a programmer (who knows what they're doing, i.e. not learning the language), seeing an algorithm in pseudocode, no matter what the style is, should be all that you need (and, generally, what you're looking for in a book). The syntax of the implementation is the easy part. I found that by stripping out most of the mathematical junk (the analysis - hey, I only really need to know which one's faster given the current circumstances), I was able to gain a lot from this book.
<br />
<br />But again... If you choose to purchase this book (definitely not a waste of money, as some reviewers would have you believe), be prepared for some difficult reading - especially if you're like me and haven't done the whole university thing.
