                <span id="Label1">You don't have to be a New England Patriots fan to enjoy this 3-hour DVD from NFL Films, but it sure helps. The highlight is found in the extras--every play from Super Bowl XXXVIII (the best ever, dare we say?), in which the Patriots prevailed 32-29 over the Carolina Panthers. Using the TV feed for visuals with the radio feed with Dick Stockton, you can view every play in just over an hour with a great deal of the excitement still intact. On-screen graphics and a few replays keep you in the action, and only purists will resist the chance to relive the exciting game in this condensed format. Other extras include in-depth game analysis, highlights from "media day," and post-game interviews (some right on the field). Unlike previous highlight packages, there are no performances from the pre-game or notorious halftime show. The main hour-long program recaps the Patriots 17-win season with NFL Films' winning mix of excellent photography, invigorating music, tightly edited player interviews, and the poetic mastery of narrator Harry Kalas. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>NFL Films did an outstanding job in assembling and editing the footage for this, especially considering the fact that the Super Bowl was played on February 1 and this DVD was released on February 24. Highlights from every regular season game were included, my favorite being the Snowball Bowl played against the Miami Dolphins on December 7. A heavy snow had fallen that day and, whenever the Patriots scored, the fans would throw snowballs in the air. It looked like white fireworks were going off in Gillette Stadium! The Ice Bowl against the Tennessee Titans, which was played on January 10, didn't start until 8 PM. The temperature and wind chill went way below zero, as the Patriots froze the Titans in their tracks and stopped them from advancing in the playoffs. The Kick The Colts Bowl, played on January 18, saw the unbeatable Indianapolis Colts get their clock cleaned, as Mr. Manning found out that Gillette Stadium was not Peyton's place!<P>In Super Bowl XXXVIII, the Carolina Panthers played with great intensity and would not give up, battling back time and time again. It's very fitting that the Patriots' victory came down to Adam Vinateri's last minute field goal, just as it did in Super Bowl XXXVI. Once again, the highlights from that game included in this DVD were outstanding. What really impressed me were the bonus features, especially the World Broadcast. Every play of the Super Bowl was shown, minus the commercials or any other pauses between plays. The half time show was not shown at all, putting the spotlight on the football game itself, where it rightly belonged. In my opinion, Super Bowl XXXVIII was the best Super Bowl of all time, and this is the best DVD presentation of a Super Bowl I have ever seen.</span>

                    <span>SUPER BOWL XXXVIII was unforgetable (especially if you were a Patriots fan) and ranked as one of the TOP 5 SUPER BOWLS.<P>Now the NFL Productions, Warner Brothers Entertainment Inc. and distributed by Warner Home Video Inc. has meticulously assembled over 180 minutes of the Super Bowl Sunday experience for our Home Theatre DVD enjoyment! This is an outstanding effort with no short cuts and plenty of emotional / adrenaline pumping excitement! This Standard Format HDTV DVD is a real joy to watch!!!!!<P>The Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots (2nd Super Bowl Victory in the last 3 years) played a formidable adversary in the Carolina Panthers and through a nail biting 60 minutes squeaked an Adam Vinatari field goal victory in the last 8 seconds of the game. (same scenario in XXXVI)<P>Summary of DVD: (1) A 63 minute recap/highlights of the Patriots 2003 regular/playoff/super bowl victory. This amazing season yeilded a 17-2 record and a 15 game winning streak (only bested by a 17-0 Miami Dolphin run). (2) A 23 minute "EA Sports NFL Matchup" recap show. (3) A 69 minute "World Broadcast" featuring ALL the excitement of the entire Bowl game. (4) "Media Day" candid player/coaches interviews. (5) "Post Game Sounds" of the press conferences and (6) "Quick Hits" A grab bag of Super Bowl Sunday's sights & sounds.<P>This was an incredible season for the "New England Patriots" and their true team dedication has become the bench mark of CHAMPIONS.

                    <span>First, go pats!<P>As for this DVD, it has 2 major flaws, and these flaws are generally ignored by other reviews (and some even get it flat-out wrong). Both deal with the "World Broadcast."<P>1. While the DVD itself and some reviewers have said that this gives you "ALL the excitement" of the world broadcast, that's definitely not true. Now, I liked the summary of the season, NFL Films-style, but I really wanted this DVD so I could watch the whole game again, since the first time around was a bit stressful (as I'm sure it was for all pats fans). So it KILLED me when I discovered that it is, in fact, NOT THE ENTIRE BROADCAST! It's an abridged version, shortened by cutting down the time between snaps. A four and out takes about 10 seconds, as you seen the panthers line up, run 3 up the gut, and then punt - done by clipping everything after the play until the next snap, with an occasional replay. IT SUCKS! It kills the drama, it's a very clinical, "clean" replay of the game w/o all the excitement. I'm shocked they did this and I'm surprised it wasn't noted more often by other people.<P>2. Another big flaw was the presentation of the game itself. I watched the game on HDTV, and it was gorgeous in widescreen, crystal clear viewing. However, this DVD only has it in standard format and it's definitely not HD. Pretty weak, given that the game was filmed in high def not to provide that widescreen version on the DVD.<P>So, get this if all you really want is the summary of the season and dramatic music for the playoffs. As for the actual broadcast, big thumbs down.</span>

                    <span>Well, it all feels perfect looking back, doesn't it? The DVD of the 2003 Pats season is such a pleasure to watch. NFL films does it again, bringing us a DVD with flawless summary of each game, the entire Superbowl to watch again and again, player interviews, international press coverage, and many more extras. All of this is done with an electric spirit that matches the dream of a season perfectly. I get chills watching those snowy playoff game summaries. Check those out in particular, football at it's very best. As a DVD it's very easy to navigate and it looks great, but in the end it's all about football, pure and simple. Which is perfect, watching it reminds you of what pro sports should be all about. For every Patriots fan this DVD comes highly recommended--no matter what the future brings you can always have this perfect reminder of 2003 and how purely exciting the games were, how great the team was, and how inspiring it was to be CHAMPIONS, yet again...buy it as an antidote to the "Cowboy Up" Red Sox 2003 DVD!</span>

                    <span>If for no other reason, you can watch the entire Super Bowl, minus all the standing around. With the huddles, commercials, and the usually infamously poor halftime show cut, you can watch the Super Bowl in 70 minutes. "What does that mean?" you are probably wondering. I wondered too. Was it too broken up, was the audio not in sync, would there be any commentary in between plays? No, no, yes. <P>There seems to be seperate audio feeds for the crowd and the announcers. So while they cut and pasted the commentary very well, they were able to tinker with the background audio even better, usually never noticing that you are cutting ahead in the game. Very impressive.<P>The only thing that they did that would be a bit strange would be the Pats or Panthers insignia popping up in the screen to transition between certain plays. It isn't common, but you'll be a confused when it first happens. <P>As for the commentary itself, they did have replays of the plays that deserved them. They also occasionally had a little extra commentary after the play.<P>All in all, it is extremely impressive. <P>Some of the games themselves for the regular season didn't have much in highlights. They barely reviewed the Week One blowout at all. There were also a few stats they'd neglect to mention such as when the Patriots played the Browns, the Browns got into the offensive territory once during the whole game! Other than that, the DVD game highlights are standard.<P>Then they had alot more extras regarding the Super Bowl than the first Pats DVD. So that was a big plus. <P>All in all, this DVD is as good as they get, short of having complete games on a single disc, which isn't possible yet. If you are a Patriots fan it is a must. If you are a football fan, you've got to get it so you can have access to the greatest Super Bowl ever.</span>
