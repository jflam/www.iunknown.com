                    <span>If she had a genuine interest in translating the Tao Te Ching one would think that Ursula LeGuin would have learned Chinese and studied the Tao Te Ching in depth.  She has done neither, and the "translation" shows this, making some very horrible distortions of the original text that are indeed well written, but have nothing to do with Taoism.</span>

                    <span>There are many 'translations' of Lao Tsu's words.  Which is the best?  Perhaps it is not measured by the literal accuracy of the translation, or the poetic artestry of the word, but by it's ability to help the reader gain the perspective that Lao Tsu envisioned as the Tao.  A translation that works for one, may not yield the same result for another.<p>Le Guin's rendition of Lao Tzu's 'Tao te Ching' was, for me, a good addition to my understanding.  I have many copies.  I almost always compare one with another when I sit down to think.  Some 'translations' are better than others for different passages, or moods.  With more than 15 years of experience in Asian cultures, primarily Japanese, and many years of contemplating Lao Tzu's writings, I recognize that some translations rely more heavily on a broader asian perspective than others.  What seems natural or obvious to one steeped in asian culture may be contradictory or even 'silly' to a westerner  This doesn't mean the message is wrong, but that the wording is not suited for that reader.  One interpretation alone was insufficient to help me comprehend the simple nature of the Tao.<p>Once I began to see my world from within the understanding of the Tao, rather than see the Tao from the outside through others' words, I found a new enjoyment in seeing how others perceive the Tao.  This is why I enjoyed Ursula K. Le Guin's approach immensely.   Clearly, Ms. Le Guin feels the awe and wonder of the simple way, as I am beginning to enjoy it.<p>Hers is not as literal or as historically steeped as some, and not as contemporary as others (Stephen Mitchell).  Not a hard-hitting philosophical analysis (Wing-Tsit Chan), nor an obscure or remote work [Asian feeling] (Gai-Fu Fen/Jane English).  Her words invited me to enjoy the comprehension of the simplicity of it all.<p>Her approach was natural, simple, straightforward.  In her fresh wording, I saw an elegence in the principles, a form of beauty.  Her words reminded me of how I felt when I began to understand.<p>Thank you, Ms. Le Guin, for your contribution to my enjoyment of the Tao.</span>

                    <span>Ursula K. Le Guin is considered one of the all-time great science fiction authors, partly because of a profound thematic content in her stories (never explained but always there in the background if you look for it).  The very best of her science fiction is grounded in Taoism, for instance, "The Left Hand of Darkness."<p>Le Guin's Tao Te Ching catches hold of the profound through the poetic and easy to visualize.  She is also very faithful to the intent of the original Chinese, especially when she expresses the universal in terms that are colloquial, for instance in her use of  "oh, yes"  for emphasis -- which means, "don't we all know," or "wouldn't you know, how wonderful."  The expression is left out as insignificant in most translations, as though it were a mere punctuation or particle, but it's there in the Chinese, not something the translator added on her own, but something she was insightful to see.  Her comments, very simply stated in the notes, are also right on.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent work, particularly for Westerners. It gives<br>a peek into the unpretentious ways of the early Chinese thinkers.<br>It begins with a discussion of the uncomplicated life of<br>Confucious. His version of Tao was that it was the way of the<br>ancients. He stressed filiel piety and practiced what he<br>preached. His lasting discovery was a testament to the moral<br>nature of man/people. He provides a simple explanation of<br>the famous yin/yang theories. Yin stands for darkness, cold, negativeness, weakness etc. Yang stands for light, heat,<br>strength and positiveness. The first rule of mysticism is to<br>disregard your own personality.<p>"The secret was for the insight<br>Of eyes unclouded by longing;<br>Those who are bound by desire<br>See only the outward container".<p>Put another way, they don't see or appreciate the inside of<br>the container. The work seeks to have man one with nature.<br>This concept is the most elusive.  The work is a treasure-chest<br>of advice from famous Chinese philosophers. It is highly<br>recommended for students of China and Eastern thought.<p>The author is critical of too much power and the pursuit of<br>material things and their accoutrements.<p>"To take all you want<br>Is never as good<br>As to stop when you should.<br>Scheme and be sharp<br>And you'll not keep it long.<br>One never can guard<br>His home when it's full<br>Of jade and fine gold:<br>Wealth,power and pride<br>Bequeath their own doom.<br>When fame and success<br>Come to you, then retire.<br>This is the ordained Way."<p>Need I say more!</span>
