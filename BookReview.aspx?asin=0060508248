                <span id="Label1"><I>Perfect I'm Not</I> is, indeed, not a perfect book, but as in baseball, literary imperfection can make for a thrilling ride. Part Horatio Alger, part libertine, Wells peppers the narrative of his rise from poverty in Ocean Beach, California to baseball fame and fortune with numerous prurient tales from behind the locker room door. He is frank about the use of steroids among his fellow players and he's not afraid to burn major bridges (one must assume they were already on fire) in his ferocious attacks on such baseball luminaries as veteran general manager Pat Gillick. And the story behind his woozy perfect game is legend. All this is entertaining stuff and worth the price of admission. </p>  <p>  The book, however, falls too often into a pattern of explication and justification for Wells&#146;s "entertaining" run-ins with the law, baseball management, players, and even his own family. We learn that young Dave Wells once punched his sister and broke her jaw, but, he explains, this was because his sister had scraped his sunburned back with her fingernails. This childhood story is then repeated--in a grown up form--several times. In many cases, it does seem that he is justified in claiming innocence--or at least in claiming he got an eye for an eye. But repetition of these explications--which even include bad pitching performances caused, we learn, by nascent physical problems (elbow, shoulder, bone chips, gout, back)--take away his agency in his own story. The hero is always a victim. In the end, then, the book is as flawed as its author, offering entertaining insight--some perhaps unintentional--into the man and his game. </p> <I>--Patrick O&#146;Kelley</I> </span>

                    <span>At times he comes off as a long, lost best friend and at others he is a self-inflated, self-absorbed ass.  He is a colorful character providing illuminating stories from the earliest days of playing rookie ball and Venezualan winter ball with beer guzzling, tail chasing future MLB players including Pat Borders, Cecil Fielder, Rob Duecy, and Todd Stottlemyre to the later days as a member of the Yankees.  Wells is a good pitcher with a booming personality who pitched for some great teams and of course will always be remembered for his May 17, 1998 perfect game.  His career numbers do not support his own assessed value (4.04 ERA, 1 year with at least 20 wins) but his book will stay on the top shelf of my collection of baseball books.
<br />
<br />I found myself laughing out loud over and over again.  Steroid and cortisone stories aside, Wells adds candid insight into the managerial and GM activities from every team he played for (up to the end of the 2002 season).  Inside observations are made on notable managers (Cito Gaston, Sparky Ansderson, Davy Johnson, Joe Torre, and Jim Fregosi) and GMs ("stand" Pat Gillick, Gord Ash, Jim Bowden, Ken Williams, and Brian Cashman).  Wells also includes colorful stories of two of the most notoriously hated and loved baseball owners of the last 50 eyars -- Marge Schott and George Steinbrenner. 
<br />
<br />It was odd to read the momentum praise and glory of the '98 Yankees who won 114 games without any mention of the record-tying 116 wins by the '01 Seattle Mariners .  By failing to mention this incredible milestone, he appeared to be protecting the legacy of the 114 win NY team.  He should have mentioned the 116 win Seattle team and emphasized the fact that the NY team went on to finish like champions by winning the world series.  Wells also slights some players by limiting praise to his favorite teamates.  For example, the contribution of Alfonso Soriano and Roger Clemens in NY is clearly understated.  Huge character, raging hair band air guitar junkie, and pure attitude live in the pages of this book, making it a worthy read for any baseball fan.</span>

                    <span>Great baseball (auto)biography.  Fun to read and not just about the game but about life around the game.  There are moments when you cannot help but laugh out loud.  Read this book.  It explains why Boomer is Boomer.

                    <span>I was interested in David Wells' life.  This book satisfied that.  To my astonishment, it is incredibly well-written, funny and insightful.  The stories and revellations are great.  Best baseball player's book I've read in years.  Superior on all accounts to the recent David Cone book.</span>

                    <span>I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK BY DAVID WELLS. SOMETIMES CRUDE, FUNNY, SAD, HONEST, AND GROSS. HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS DESCRIBING IN DETAIL HIS LIFE AND CAREER. HIS LANGUAGE LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED AT TIMES, BUT OVERALL THIS IS A VERY ENTERTAINING BOOK. HIS INSIGHT AND OPINIONS ARE VERY CANDID AND CONTROVERSIAL. I THINK HE NEEDS TO BE IN REHAB FOR ALCOHOL AND FOOT IN MOUTH ADDICTION. BUT STILL VERY WORTH READING. HE IS NOT A BAD GUY BUT JUST HUMAN AND VERY OUT SPOKEN. TURN IT DOWN A BIT BOOMER.</span>

                    <span>I never liked David Wells, mostly because I only knew him as a Yankee player. That alone is generally enough to get me not to like someone. :) I wanted to check this out solely because of the "hype" surrounding the book. And after having read the book, I have to wonder if the negative press surrounding the book and some of it's "expositions" weren't self inflicted. Read the book. It's a wonderfully entertaining read. He talks about all the problems he had in his life early on, from his time in the minors, to the boredom in the bullpen (although his story about getting women in the stands to flash them is awesome) to his battles with team management, and lots on the Yankees. I also got a charge out of his comments on former Reds owner Marge Schott, and her dog.<p>I have to admit that this book goes on my recommend list. It was a funny read, and for a baseball fan like myself, gives me some insight into the mind of a baseball player. I really enjoyed it. The link here is for the hardback edition of the book. There is a paperback version scheduled for release, but it's not currently slated until Mar 1, 2004. The hardback is available now.<p>Oh, BTW, if you're someone who isn't into the liberal use of foul language, you might want to stay away from the book. It's not like every third word is f this or f that, but there is definitely more than a smattering of f-bombs and the like in the book.</span>
