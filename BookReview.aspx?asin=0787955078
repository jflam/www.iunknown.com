                    <span>Death is one of the most traumatic experience in our lives.  Even the deaths of strangers affects us in unusual, sometimes unpredictable ways.  The death of those close to us, family and friends, can leave us with questions, emotions and emptiness hard to comprehend.  Yet, there are ways to deal with these; religion has rituals, families have traditions, cultures have cycles, allowances and expectations, yet we still need more.<p>This book by Sarah York puts an order to the chaos.  Written primarily for those in caring professions (pastors and priests, health-care workers, etc.) or even for those who have expectation for the approaching death of friends or family members, the book can be rewarding to any reader, as death is one of the facts of life we will all face in a myriad of ways.<p>York infuses her discussions with her personal experiences as well as professional experiences.  She talks about the various ways in which religion looks to care for the departed as well as those left behind, in terms of memorials, committals, and other services.  She also looks at the emotional and relationship aspects, both when family and friends are close-knit as well as when there are distances and estrangements.  <p>Through stories of people, York teaches and guides by example.  She shows the specifics of how to help in the case of a suidice, the death of an infant, a death due to illness, and more.  She helps to show how to carve out a space for the family and friends, the wider community, and for the presence of God in the midst of sometimes bewilderingly tragic situations.<p>The final chapter looks at the 'seasons of grief' -- some religions, such as Judaism, have prescribed patterns or rituals to follow for up to a year after the death; in fact, the death of a person stays with us for the rest of our lives, and the more significant the relationship, the more significant that season can be, and more long-lasting in daily life and functioning.  While the specific rituals of Judaism cannot appropriately be used out of context of the community and hold the same meaning, the pattern of activity and the pastoral/psychological way in which they function can be easily adapted.<p>York offers three sections of resources, which make this book practical and useful.  Prayers, readings, blessings, service forms, even the idea for a 'no-memorial wanted' practice serves to stimulate ideas for the creative and meaningful way in which observe and remember.  <p>York's final story in the epilogue is very touching, an almost concrete way of showing how we carry forward those who have passed away in our own lives.  <p>This is a stunning book, thoughtful and sensitive, useful and prayerful.  My life has been enriched simply through the reading of this text; it will be even more enriched when the times come that they guide my practices and my experiences.</span>

                    <span>Sarah does an amazing job of giving guidelines and suggestions for creating truely meaningful memorials and funerals.<p>The fact that she is a Unitarian Universalist minister makes the materials in this book appropriate for use by a wide range of religions.  <p>The book is especially helpful to those of us who have no formal clergy training but need to create funerals / memorials.</span>

                    <span>Having been someone who has done group memorials for individuals of a separate organization with people who have passed on from AIDS, this book give me new insight.  I am looking to put together another ceremony in September.  Comparing the past events with Rev. York's book, I find that the past events contained many of the elements that she suggests.  However, she gives some wonderful insights and ideas that I have not thought of before.  I am only about 1/3 of the way through the book I am about ready to change the original structure of the memorial service.  All that I can really say is:  "Sarah, thank you for your wonderful writing and imput.<p>Ricky Gilbert</span>

                    <span>"Remembering Well" is a book about certain subjects -- death and dying, funerals, bereavement and the grieving process - that don't exactly make you want to rush out and read about them.  Yet Sarah York, a Unitarian Universalist minister with a tremendous amount of experience, knowledge, and -- even more importantly -- wisdom regarding death, dying, grieving, and "remembering well," has succeeded in writing a book that is at once practical, powerful, poignant, moving, even inspiring.  <p>At its heart, "Remembering Well" is not so much about death and dying as it is about life, living, love, and memory.  Perhaps its most important lesson is the necessity of allowing time and "sacred space" for those who have experienced a loss to be able to "give voice to their sorrow" and to "remember well" the person who has died.   In Sarah York's view, and I couldn't agree more, suppressing strong feelings, or glossing over them, is not a good idea for anyone.  In fact, it's very unhealthy and really just asking for trouble down the road.  Unfortunately, I have personally been to funerals where almost every one of Sarah York's rules has been violated, where the service was utterly impersonal, or where the religious official running the service took the opportunity to try and impose their religious perspective on the audience, leaving many people (myself included) unsatisfied and even angry.  <p>The bottom line here is that although it is not a simple matter to "remember well," it certainly can be done.  If you want to find out how, Sarah York's book is a great place to start.  I strongly recommend it to everyone!</span>

                    <span>It's one of those things we think we'll never have to worry about . . . shaping the rituals of grieving for those we love.  And then, life happens.  Sometimes the traditional liturgies are just what we need.  And other times, whether through physical or psychological distance or spiritual alienation, there we are.  Alone.  With limited resources.  Here's where having York's book at hand can make all the difference.  She writes from both practical experience and compassionate wisdom -- I believe this book is important both for those of us who will someday be grieving (as who among us will not) and those of us who have unresolved issues of grief in our hearts.  Don't miss this one!</span>
