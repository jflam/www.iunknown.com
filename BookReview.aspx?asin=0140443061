                    <span>Wendy Donniger (formerly O'Flaherty) has garnered quite a bit of controversy. The very heart of the controversy, however, lies a simple fact: Donniger is not a Hindu. One must take her writing in this context, whatever your religion may be. Her views and opinions are those of a woman who grew up in a (psuedo-)Judeo-Christian society, who pursued quite a large chunk of her formative academic years directly following a period of extreme social conformity (thus prompting an explosion of pseudo-Freudian, sexual fascination in the academic community - much of which is manifest in her work), and who does not neccesarily believe in any of the pillars of the Vedic religion. 
<br />
<br />With this in mind, it is easy to see why her work has created such dischord in the academic and religious community. Her work is interesting, at the very least. She does seem to have a sexual fixation in much of her work, and she approaches the religious sciptures outside the spiritual context out of which they were born. She analyzes scripture in much the same way literature students analyze Herman Melville or Shakespeare. Usually they bring up interesting patterns in the work, but whether one agrees with their argument depends on how cerebral you believe the author capable of being. But, again, she is not a Hindu - one must not read her work expecting it to be the work of a devotee.
<br />
<br />Here, we have her renditions of Hindu mythology, and frankly I am not at all sure who she expected her audience to be. I find her retellings of little literary merit. They are told in the garrulous mode of an academic, so most casual readers will be put off. The accuracy of her translation is often put to question, so I doubt she would have expected this work to be taken as a professorial exposition. And lastly, as she is not a Hindu, Hindu's themselves will be hard-pressed to find the beaut in these stories if the author herself cannot take them seriously. 
<br />
<br />For the casual reader, wanting to look into Hindu mythology, I suggest William Buck's excellent retelling of the Ramayana. For devotee, the work of Eknath Easwaran (in his excellent versions of the Gita and the Upanishads - both of which come off beautiful on the literary level, and philosophically sound), Christopher Isherwood (in perhaps my favorite rendering of the Gita), and of course, Mahatma Gandhi will yield greater reward. For the academic, I encourage you to look into the Hindu religion through the eyes of a Hindu. Perhaps, analyzing what fascinates the Indian subcontinent and the world over with this ancient group of traditions would reveal amazing things. </span>

                    <span>As a Sanskrit professor for over 30 years (Emory University, Atlanta, GA and Hindu University of America, Orlando, FL), I find this book both an insult to India and scholarlship in general. This Semite charlatan (babbler, praterer) poses as an "expert" in Hinduism, yet knows no Sanskrit and confuses Jewish words with those of Indo-European origin. In Europe such a charlatan would be laughed out of the university. Purchase her stuff if you wish to waste your $$$ on a charlatan. That is the opinion of one who has been in South Asian studies for over 40 years. </span>

                    <span>I read this book for Professor Doniger's class at the University of Chicago. I can't say that I absolutely loved it, but on the whole it was an excellent introduction to Hinduism with a widespread selection of relevant myths. <p>I'm really writing this review to debunk the other reviews on this site. Chances are the reviewers who charged the author of innaccurate translating or having a  Judeo-Christian agenda either (1) don't realize the extent of Prof. Doniger's expertise or (2) are just idiot Hindus with their own narrow views of their religion. Unless these reviewers are scholars themselves, I doubt they know enough about Hinduism to make these charges. Don't listen to them.</span>
