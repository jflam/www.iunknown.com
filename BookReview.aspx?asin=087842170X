                    <span>This was the text for part of our Field Camp. I was fortunate enough to have the Dr. Fritz as my personal guide to Yellowstone National Park. I still use the book as a reference in my personal studies of U.S. Geology. It is must for anyone traveling to Yellowstone with even the most remote interest in Geology.</span>

                    <span>The title sums it all up. The book is indeed useful, you can find all sorts of neat features by using it, but it really is a bit simplified. Perhaps it's just me, but it was GREAT for my kids (8 and 11) who are both, well, they read. Anything. As long as they can catch it.</span>

                    <span>I'm a nerd. I was left with nothing to read in the cold nights. I was also having trouble sleeping. I thought this book would help.<P>Yes it put me to sleep because reading about rock and millenia of dirt moving is tiresome. <P>But what I absorbed made me look at yellowstone in a new way. The book was quite clear-and I could see and easily understand how Americas greatest monument to beauty was madeof millions of years.<P>It's like seeing the Louvre after taking an art class. The paint on canvass comes alive with history and meaning. <P>So too if you read this.</span>
