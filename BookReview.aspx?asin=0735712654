                    <span>Network Intrusion Detection is rare among technical books - it's comprehensive, accurate, interesting, and intelligent; it's got none of the "filler" chapters which seem to be prevalent in the genre. It's well worth the relatively small investment of time and money required to read and understand it.<P>The author has "been there, done that" which gives him a perspective unavailable to professional technical authors who write about Java one month, CORBA the next, will be assigned a firewall book next.<P>This book will be useful to people responsible for intrusion detection, people who manage them, and to people who need to understand attack techniques and the forensic tools needed to detect and document them. Highly recommended; it's in the same class as Cheswick & Bellovin's classic _Firewalls and Internet Security_.</span>

                    <span>This book's coverage on intrusion detection is out of my expectation. It covers not only technical information on various attacks, but it also contains valuable materials on management issues. Topics on Mitnick Attack, Filters and Signatures, Future Directions, DOS, Business Case for Intrusion Detection are particular interesting and useful. Overall, this book is very well written and it will be useful to all of you who are network security practitioner or consultant.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the better technical books I've read. It is easy to understand and goes into depth explaining the theory on which intrusion signatures are created. If you know basic TCP/IP but really want to know its inner-workings, get this book. I bought it less than 24 hrs ago and I'm already 100 pgs through it. This book takes a subject that could potentially be very dry and breathes a gust of fresh air into it. Recommended!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>A fine book, that can only scratch the surface of intrusion detection. While it admittedly selects older exploits as case studies, they are well chosen (paradigmatic even!), and should encourage security specialists to start developing a real familiarity with attack fingerprints and NID signatures. Its biggest strength is to provoke ways of thinking about network traffic analysis and common pitfalls. Don't forget that the scope of this book is not intended to cover the wider IT security gamut - it really is focused on the NID mindset.<P>Caveat: As someone used to imposing security policy and maintaining the corporate IT security culture, I am somewhat new to the NID/forensics game. But this book has encouraged me to learn more about the precise workings of TCP/IP protocols more than any other impetus to date. In a year's time I might look for more comprehensive references and clinical howto's, but for now Northcutt has provided a great insight into analysis techniques, attack mindsets and bit-level quirks.<P>Some other reviews have lamented Northcutt's writing style. Yes, he repeats some concepts and scatters his thoughts, but I personally felt they were worth repeating and scattering. The book is probably more suited to those who can follow accounts that include gut feelings and intellectual diversion, than someone who prefers to follow a scripted, blow-by-blow transcript. Both have their legitimate place.</span>
