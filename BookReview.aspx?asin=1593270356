                    <span>This book teaches you everything you need to know in order to maintain and adequately use the Linux OS.
<br />
<br />However the book is only about medium build so it only able to touch on all the information and does not go into any deep excavation of knowledge.  For example, the book explains how to compile a custom kernel, but it will not tell you about each of the options you check when making the custom kernel.
<br />
<br />The book is still great nonetheless because it makes you aware of all the different parts of Linux.  Before you can know everything about Linux you have to be aware of every part.  Whether or not you want to go find an even deeper understanding of each little section is your own perogative.  How Linux Work's gives you a strong start though.
<br />
<br />The irony to this book however is that all the information in it is also avaiable free online.  If you read the documentation and  readme's for each of the things mentioned in this book you would get the same affect for free.  This is an excellent tangible version though, I don't regret buying it at all because it saved me time from having to go to 2 dozen websites, 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>This book was not was I was expecting at all. This book lists great topics that it covers. However, it just bearly touches the surface of these topics and has been written in a way that assumes you already have basic or in some cases more than basic knowledge of the areas. Prime example of this is when the author gives you commands to try. He shows you the command to try but does not break down its components. so will have entered a lenghty command to execute as an example but you are not told why you have entered all the different components of that command. So it creates more questions than anything. This book has done an exellent job from the stand point of introducing you to these areas. I now have ideas of which topics I want to explore more and the author cites further readings on a lot of them. But be very aware they DO MENTION this book is geared toward superusers and or administrators. this is exactly what I found.. I do not regret my purchase, I just was expecting something more informal from the new user standpoint. The title may be a little misleading in that to benifit from how linux works more than I did, it assumes you have a prior knowledge of how linux works. LOL interesting, no? </span>

                    <span>I didn't know about this book until it showed up on my doorstep courtesy of the great folks at the O'Reilly LUG program. But I was interested in it from the moment I opened the box.
<br />
<br />It's a basic guide to general Linux. It's new, fun and the author does a nice job of covering the basics. He doesn't dwell on any one distro, but covers all sorts of commands, issues, and questions that a lot of people who are switching to linux might have. He goes over basics of Networking, Printing, and touches upon more advanced options in linux. I was especially pleased with the referencing he did, if you want to know more about a subject he recommends a book to check out! Very nice.
<br />
<br />I sat down on a Saturday afternoon, and by Sunday night I had read my way through it. Even as an experienced Linux user I was interested and picked up a few tidbits from this book that I didn't know about. Although it's aimed at the new user, it was fun and interesting for me to read.
<br />
<br />I'd definately recommend this book to people wanting to get into the Linux world.</span>

                    <span>After several books and online help for linux I have finally put the pieces together. This boook aids you in really seeing how linux is put together. If you are a Windows admin or superuser you will really appreciate the way the author puts it together. This helped me fill in the blanks and made me excited to really get deep into linux. </span>

                    <span>This is the second Linux book you should buy. 
<br />
<br />First you need something a bit simpler to get the of off the ground (or off the CD perhaps). Perhaps the 'Linux For Non-Geeks' which even includes a distribution of the latest Fedora (RedHat) core. 
<br />
<br />But by the time you are getting ready to actually make the system do something, then you need this book. The sub-title is 'What every Superuser should know.' Maybe you're not going to be a super user, but you can bet that when you're behind schedule, trying to get that application working, you're going to be missing some little bit of knowledge that would solve the problem. 
<br />
<br />Changes are that the little knowledge you need is here, easy to find (supurb index), and clearly explained.</span>
