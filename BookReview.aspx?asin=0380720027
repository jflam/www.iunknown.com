                    <span>Anyone looking to load your arsenal with talking points about the virtues democracy and capitalism, or looking to unearth the secret, zealous neo-con conspiracy behind President Bush's foreign policy should NOT read this book.  However,  if you want to encounter a challenging thesis on the nature of man, and the way that he orders his social life, this should be right up your alley. 
<br />
<br />The book begins in taking on our 20th century (or at least pre-89) pessimistic belief that man does not progress.  He might be capable of build new toys, but his social existence is static, that is to say, violent. This outlook, of course, is the product of the 20th century tragdies that proceeded 19th century exuberance.  Fukuyama argues that now is the time to reevaluate our pessimism.  He then argues that the invention of the scientific method has set in motion a series of events, and changed our way of thought in such a way that we can never go back.  Thus, History was born.  He then argues that inevitable improvments in science, in turn, improve technology.  The state will then seek to utilize that technology to its benefit on the battlefield.  Those technologies will soon spill over to the nation's entire economic system where it stimulates economic growth.  Thus, this economic mechanism eventually drives society to industrialization.
<br />
<br />But industrialization only gets man rich, not democratic.  Man has a built-in need for recognition, an irrational need to prove himself, his "glory", to humanity.  In what we know as the "state of nature", man did this violently, or else he was enslaved.  This arrangment of masters and slave, or kings and serfs, was secure until economic progress fundementally and irreversable changed our societal make up.   Man is not satisfied with merely become rich, he wants have dignity, or rather, he wants to be equal.  While other economic systems can provide certain levels prosperity (his comments on communism might surpise some), unless man is provided a place to compete and be "recognized" as man, money isn't enough.  A liberal democracy is the end point of that demand and best provides for that outlet in man.  Thus, the economic mechanism of capitalism grafts onto mans desire for "recognition" and, voila, we have Democratic Capitalism.  
<br />
<br />Beyond this linear arguement, there are many other interesting discussions on how our new view of history affects foriegn policy and how man may settle into this final stage.  And while liberal democracy achieves a philosophical coherence that cannot be surpassed, there are causes for concern. Fukuyama's discussion of these are sobering.  There is an inherent tension between mans desire for recognition (that is, to be distinguished) and society's emphasis on equality.  Fukuyama presents the "last man" as exhausted, not triumphant.  
<br />
<br />One would think that a book where Hegel, Plato, and Nietzche are the stars of the show might be a bit dry.  Not at all.  I found the book both informative and enjoyable.  Fukuyama's prose and organization are tight, readable, and sometimes witty.     
<br />
<br />Those who argue that this book is a work of "American triumphalism" in the wake of the fall of 1989 either has not read the book, or willfully misrepresents it.  The same goes for those who sneeringly dismiss it after 9/11.  He bends over backwards to emphasize that historical events will not end.  He even shows how a liberal democracy might even slip back into some previous form of government.  Howevever, what is central to this book, is that our system won't evolve philosophically.  A different government will always be one from the past (Islamic facism is no philosophical progression, but rather a throwback to earlier thought that we evove from because of its blaring conradiction). Further, the triumphalist charge is particularly weird being that this is a Hegelian argument liberal democracy was inevitable for mankind.  America was the result, not the cause of History.  Sorry, but Reagan is never even mentioned.  
<br />
<br />Essentially this book forces you to ask yourself, if liberal democracy isn't for everyone, or isn't the best, what would a perferable political order look like?  I have yet to hear someone argue for an altogether new system (Fukuyama points out that he hasn't either), no matter the length of one's list of liberal democracies' shortcomings. The End of History gives an answer for why this is the case.</span>

                    <span>Professor Fukuyama's work brings clarity and breadth of vision to our historical crossroads, even in a post-11 September world.  I had long been familiar with the thesis of "The End of History and the Last Man" -- that in liberal democracy and free-markets, history's progression towards finding the most enlightened structure for organizing society had ended -- and since I was largely in agreement with its premise, had for years declined to read the tome.  To my surprise, Fukuyama's work was far more expansive in scope and ambitious than I had presumed:  it was not the neo-conservative template that I had been lead to believe.  Instead, I encountered a cogent synthesis of the Dialectic's search for Universal History that was as thought provoking as it was entertaining (you know your reading a "winner" when one trades sleep for time).
<br />
<br />Many have argued that the books conclusion weakens after 11 September.  I disagree:  Mr. Fukuyama does not ever say that liberal democracy would succeed in the short-term, but offers the inevitability of its ascendancy over the long-term; thus, Islamic militancy (and its attendant rejection of Western values) need not be seen as anything but yet another collectivist (or theocratic) competitor to liberal democracy -- one ultimately doomed to failure.  Moreover, that Mr. Fukuyama stresses the views of Hagel's Last Man -- man seeking self-recognition peacefully-over Hobb's-the man who resigns himself to materialistic coexistence -- suggests a role for the Islamist in the dialectical process: one that may one day lead to genuine democracy in the Middle East. 
<br />
<br />I highly recommend spending the time to formulate your own opinions.</span>

                    <span>This is arguably the worst book I have ever read, and hopefully, the end of Fukuyama's writing s and the last of him, a moronic neocon whose worldview of market capitalism. regime change and plutocratic democracy has proven to be just so much hot air after the botched Iraqi invasion.
<br />
<br />Btw, which one of the cowardly neocons has volunteered their sons and daughters for combat in Iraq? None!
<br />
<br />As eminent historian Paul Schroeder has commented, the second Iraqi invasion is the first time in history a superpower has done the bidding of its client state (Israel) and goes to war not for is own interest, nor that of its alliance partners, but for the security of its imperialistic protectorate under the guise of a new world order (sounds like Germany and Japan in WW2).</span>

                    <span>As many other pointed out, so many people misunderstand this book after 9-11. For Islamic fundamentalism cannot threat our society as an alternative ideology, I do not think Fukuyama's main point was overthrown because of the terrorist attacks. 
<br />
<br />Yet my problem lies elsewhere. I admit that Fukuyama shows a great skill in his lucidness to describe the Universal History, and his thesis carries an overwhelming atmosphere of plausibility. I do agree that history "seems" to be directional at least so far. But seeming plausible doesn't guarantee that his logic is sound, nor it can conceal its intellectual sloppiness. Where is the "evidence" that human history is driven by the human consciousness? IMHO, the whole thesis rests on a nebulous foundation, Hegel's idealism, which rests on his metaphysics, i.e., Hegelian Geist, dialectics and holism. 
<br />
<br />It is mystery to me that Fukuyama uses these gaseous metaphysical concept as his axiom from which he deduce all the conclusions. Before Fukuyama, it was generally considered that Hegelian view of history was shattered by the logical positivism and analytic philosophy spearheaded by Bertrand Russell and Vienna Circle during the early 20th century. To counter this point, Fukuyama boasts in p349 "Superficial misreading of Hegel in the empiricists or positivist tradition are legion." But he never offers his reasoning why he thought it's superficial. To me, Hegelian view cannot stand his metaphysics.  Russell's attack on the enterprise of Hegelian idealism was much more rock solid than Fukuyama's gaseous propositions.

                    <span>The major event the fall of the Soviet Union which prompted this work was a true historical turning point. Fukuyama took the world by storm by seeing it as sign of an inevitable triumph of liberal democracy. For a time it appeared to some that he might be right. But as he was now fifteen years later see a world torn apart by radical Islamic terrorism, a world in which tribal loyalties increasingly surface as most important, a world in which the possibilities of terror and destruction multiply exponentially with the perfection of Technology Fukuyama's thesis seems a Utopian kind of ivory - tower dream. Fukuyama is a tremendously learned, intelligent and skillful master of his argument- but the argument itself and the fundamental thesis has gone the way of so many other ' inevitability theories' We could conceivably all go down in a second of doom brought on by any of a number of different human and non- humanly generated events. Liberal democracy may well be the best kind of government Mankind has ever known but it certainly does not seem bound to conquer necessarily the masses of mankind, even as now when certain very large portions of mankind, China, for instance are moving ahead by leaps and bounds economically. 
<br />This is a tremendously thought- provoking work, and highly recommended. It would have been nice if its major thesis had come true. </span>
