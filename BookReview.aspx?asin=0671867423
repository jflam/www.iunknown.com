                <span id="Label1">A former professor of Greek at Yale University, Wills painstakingly deconstructs Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and discovers heavy influence from the early Greeks (Pericles) and the 19th century Transcendentalists (Edward Everett). The author also probes Lincoln's decision to rely more on the Declaration of Independence than the U.S. Constitution, a decision Wills says represented a "revolution in thought." He speaks effusively of the 272-word address: "All modern political prose descends from [it]. The Address does what all great art accomplishes. [I]t tease[s] us out of thought." Wills' book won the 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism.  </span>

                    <span>Garry Wills has done it again. 
<br /> 
<br /> His analytical skills are so incisive and commonsensical that you wonder how anyone could interpret the world differently. "Gettysburg" reveals his talents anew. From his exposition of the 19th century urban cemeteries movement, to Americans' fascination with all things Greek to his analysis of Lincoln's personal and public views of slavery, Wills satisfied my hunger for information while leaving me panting for more. Wills demolishes a number of persistent myths about Gettysburg. No, Lincoln did not write his address at the last minute on the back of an envelope; he had vast respect for the spoken word and there is ample evidence that he prepared his address thoroughly long before the Gettysburg dedication. Wills's description of the grisly, wretched work of burying and reburying battlefield casualties is a necessary counterbalance to the tales of soldierly courage and strategy that are the sum of other histories. Even the appendices are fascinating. Wills includes the text of the 2-hour oration of Edward Everett, the dedication's main speaker, whose work has often been diminished in relation to Lincoln's 3-minute speech. Reading Everett's long but excellent speech followed by Lincoln's short "remarks" has the effect of putting you at the scene.
<br /> 
<br /> Most importantly, Wills explains how Lincoln's address subtly but unalterably reinterpreted our country's founding documents. After Gettysburg, the idea that "all men are created equal" became a cornerstone of the American Dream, sowing seeds that sprung up in the many civil rights movements of the 20th and 21st centuries.

                    <span>Garry Wills has written a marvelous and meanigful book that adds luster and new life to a speech that most of us heard and did not fully appreciate in school.  He suggests that the few words marked a transition in American thought that not many recognized at the time.  Taking the ideas back to their intellectual and emotional bases, he emphasises in part just how different the world view was when the speech was given.  Language and ideas have chnaged so profoundly that we may not understand that we do not understand. Wonderful!</span>

                    <span>The Battle of Gettysburg, a pivotal event in the Civil War, raged from July 1 to July 3, 1863.  It was the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere and ended the Confederacy's second invasion of the North.  Following the battle, the community of Gettysburg was thick with dead and wounded men.  The Governor of Pennsylvania authorized the purchase of a cemetry for the reburial of the Union dead.  The cemetry was dedicated in a ceremony on November 19, 1863.  Edward Everett, a disinguished orator of the day, delivered a speech lasting over two hours.  President Abraham Lincoln also accepted an invitation to deliver short remarks.  His remarks of 272 became known as the Gettysburg Address.  They constitute a seminal statement, and restatement of the American vision.<p>Gary Wills's study "Lincoln at Gettysburg" deserves the accolades it has received if for no other reason than it gave many readers the opportunity to read and think about the Gettysburg Address.  This is a speech that is dulled and lost in childhood.  It needs to be approached and rethought as an adult to get an understanding of the depth of Lincoln's message.<p>Wills sees the Gettysburg Address as recasting and remaking the American democratic experience.  The speech expressly brings the hearer and reader back to the Declaration of Independence with its self-evident truth that "All men are created equal."  This truth, Lincoln turns into a "proposition" on which our country was founded. (The Constitution, adopted thirteen years after the Declaration, countenances slavery and includes no language about human equality.)  In his spare prose, Lincoln says little directly about the nature of "equality".  Wills discusses the address and masterfully places it in the context of Lincoln's earlier speeches to help the reader understand the development of Lincoln's ideas on slavery, the antithesis of human equality.<p>The Gettysburg Address also sounded the theme of the United States as a single undivided nation rather than a union or confederation of States.  Wills shows how this theme too derives from the Declaration, when the people of the colonies rose up in unity to declare their Independence from Britain.  Wills also reminds the reader of the sources of the idea of Nationhood in American history. He alludes to the Federalism of Chief Justice John Marshall and Justice Joseph Story. In particular, Wills discusses the Webster-Hayne debates. Lincoln greatly admired Webster as well as his fellow Whig, Henry Clay.  Webster uttered the famous line "Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable," which resonates through the Gettysburg Address.<p>Wills tries to show the influence on Lincoln's thought on the transcendentalism of Emerson and of Theodore Parker.  I thought this one of the more challenging sections of the book. While the Declaration was born in the skepticism of British empiricism and of Deism, transcendentalism emphasized the ideal.  The Declaration and the Address, and the American mission, Lincoln transformed into ideal to be struggled for and realized by the living to commemorate the sacrifice of those who gave their lives to attain it.<p>The book also includes an excellent treatment of rhetoric and speech, tracing Lincoln's address back to Thucidides and Georgias and ending with the observation that it marked the beginning of modern American prose.<p>This book will encourage the reader to rethink and to understand the great nature of the American political experiment.</span>

                    <span>This is a well-written book, with moments of eloquence.  In the end, though, it is uneven and unsatisfying--and mistitled.  The centerpiece is, indeed, the Gettysburg Address, but Wills spends most of his time exploring the cultural background to the speech (e.g. the Greek revival, nineteenth-century cemeteries, Transcendentalism) and discussing Lincoln's other speeches.  All this is fine, and often interesting, but the book might more appropriately have been titled, "Lincoln:  The Man Whose Words Remade America."<p>When he treats the cultural aspects of the period and the speech, Wills it at his best.  His discussion of Greek rhetoric is truly fascinating.  During the early 1800s, the United States experienced a Greek revival, in which intellectual thought moved from the Roman-republic fixation of the Founders to the ancient Greek democratic tradition.  Edward Everett, a gigantic figure of the time and the main speaker at Gettysburg, led this transformation, part of which injected elements of Greek rhetoric into the culture.  This showed up most prominently in the form of Greek funeral orations (such as the famous one of Pericles), a style that Lincoln adopted in his address.  Also interesting is Wills' chapter on the culture of death:  how cemeteries became detached from churches and moved into rural areas, how they were viewed as places of reflection and education, how even children were encouraged to participate in this culture.<p>However, when Wills moves beyond this generally straightforward telling of history into argument, the book grows considerably weaker.  Arguing against James McPherson is a dangerous thing to do, and Wills does it twice, declaring that McPherson is wrong to suggest that Lincoln came to view the South, in some manner, as a foreign power and that his position evolved to embrace unconditional surrender and total war.  Not that McPherson is infallible (indeed, I'm not entirely convinced on the former point), but Wills' arguments are entirely unconvincing.  Moreover, Wills apparently has some ideological axes to grind against the conservative movement he left some years ago.  Twice does Wills mention the twentieth century.  Both times he attacks "states' rights" or "original intent" conservatives.  Criticism is heaped upon Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan, and Edwin Meese, and special animus is reserved for Willmoore Kendall.  None of these individuals is beyond criticism, but doing so in this book seems out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.<p>Wills' thesis that Lincoln effected a revolution in American political thought is a sound though not at all original one.  To my mind, this book's merit lies in the first half of the book, where Wills delves into the culture of the early 1800s and places the Gettysburg Address within that milieu.  The rest of the book, however, proves valuable only as a starting point for controversy, which is not entirely bad.</span>
