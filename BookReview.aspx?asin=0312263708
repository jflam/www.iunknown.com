                    <span>Once again, Master Storyteller Tom Snyder, author of Route 66 Traveler's Guide and Roadside Companion, has written a book that reads like a family history, yet contains enough specifics on California Coastal lodging, food, people and landscapes to get you there and back with terrific memories and coins to spare! In his usual folksy style, Snyder takes us up Pacific Coast Highway, where the golden coast of California is kissed by the sea. This book reads like a warm cup of chocolate yet features insightful vignettes about where to go, what to see, and how to see it all in style. PCH Traveler's Guide is much more than just a travel book. Snyder, who is sensitive to California's natural beauty and fragile ecology, tells readers where to shoot the best photographs, find the best tasting food, meet the most interesting people, and bed down in the sweetest places. Having lived in California for over 30 years, I was astonished to read of places I'd never seen, and the stories behind them. Inspired by PCH Traveler's Guide, my family is planning a road trip this summer to re-experience the coast's beauty and history . READ THIS BOOK if you are coming to California, or simply want to re-discover magic in your own backyard.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book and immediately returned it because I felt it was so inadequate. It leaves out all the basic information you actually need from a guidebook, like phone numbers, hours, and prices of just about everything - astonishing but true. E.g., you can't find out from the book where to call to reserve a tour for the Hearst castle, or how much it would cost. The writing's nice, but so what? It's completely useless as a travel guide.</span>

                    <span>Tom Snyder's Pacific Coast Highway Traveler's Guide is a must read for any one who loves the Historic Hwy 101.<P>Charles Kuralt said "Thanks to the new Interstate Transportation system it is now possible to drive from one end of the country to the other without seeing a thing" <P>Snyder's book takes you on a journey from the Mexican border to the Canadian border on the road that opened the west, before driving became the endless endouring of multiple ribbons of concrete. Snyder's trip and his insights on US 101 is a must have for anyone traveling US 101. His book touches on 100's of small quaint cities and sights along the 101 with recommendations for lodging and restaurants. Many of the places he called out are not necessarily the most prominent or "tourist trap" type places but rather unique places that capture the essence of the road. <P>There is a great little section in the beginning of the book which talks about how Hwy 101 came into being as well as the confusion and differences in the multiple names the road has. It sure cleared up things for me! Snyder also details and recommends many little trips from 2 to 3 days as well as the whole route. There are great tips on the weather and where to begin your trip depending on the weather and your interest.<P>Also present in the book is a little testament to the surf and woddie culture as well as an acknowledgment of their lifestyle and stewardrdship of our oceans.<P>Over all, this book is a tremendous asset for those who love to really drive. Well done and highly recommended</span>

                    <span>This must read guide is bound to enlighten even the most savvy West coast cruiser. Historic Roads and Highways are becoming lures to the young and old alike. The heritage experiences give the traveler a sense of place and the comfort of the known. The author has made you want to see and feel the locations along the route. The guide is very useful for discovering the Coastal Mother Road of California, Oregon and Washington. Thanks for a well-done timely guide to the West Coast.</span>
