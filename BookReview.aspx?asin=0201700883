                <span id="Label1">If you just stumbled into design, maybe via a hobby that grew into a  career, and you want to improve your work without having to enroll in a degree  program, this book can bridge some of the gaps in your acumen. Not really a  primer on basic facts, <I>Design Workshop</I> is more like a guide to style.<p>  The first chapter quizzes readers on mostly technical, basic details of design  (like dpi), all of which can be found in Williams's previous publications (for  example, <I>The Non-Designer's  Design Book</I>). Readers will be dismayed, possibly annoyed, that the quiz  answers are not provided. Even if not knowing the answers means that you need  remedial help, it feels like a bit of a tease.<p>  The next chapters show how to use stock images, or your own images, to increase  the visual impact of your piece (basically through an increase in contrast). The  best part of this section, and the book as a whole, is the "before-and-after"  approach in the examples; they're like a series of makeovers. The captions  effectively describe what was changed in the image, and how it improved the  design.<p>  The book applies a similar set of makeovers to various types of design projects:  logos, forms, newsletters, tables of contents, etc. In the final section, seven  designers, including coauthor Tollett, break down the process that they went  through on a job of their own.<p>  Self-taught graphic designers probably would make the best audience for this  book, but designers who are of their own "school of thought" might find fault  with some of the tenets that are put forth. Graphic design by nature is a  subjective enterprise--at the mercy of "styles." What you get in this book is  more of a "desktop-publisher style" (many of the drawings are clip art, for  example). There's a lack of sophistication in the design of the book, as well as  in the illustrations of posters, letterheads, advertisements, and other  applications that are used as examples. On the other hand, this same open, naive  look gives the book an inviting appeal, and makes it perhaps a bit less daunting  than style guides, such as Robert Bringhurst's  <I>The Elements of Typographic  Style</I>, that are intended for die-hard professionals. <I>--Angelynn  Grant</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><p> Style advice for design projects, including:<p> <ul> <li>Logos <li>Business cards and letterhead <li>Invoices and forms <li>Advertising <li>Billboards <li>Web sites <li>Tables of contents and indices <li>Newsletters and brochures <li>Flyers </ul></span>

                    <span>I found this book very informative and interesting. It had a lot of useful information, and the info was presented in a very "reader-friendly" format. There were a lot of examples in the book used to prove a point, instead of a `just take it for granted' procedure. The book was simple and straightforward but not boring. The book was written `to' the audience, with words like `you' and `your' instead of `one' or `some designers'. It really made the book have a personal impact.<p>On the other hand, the book wasn't `all encompassing', like it seemed to be. Many references to previous books by the author showed that this was a book for most people. I would have added more to the book instead of constantly referring to previous books, if I was the author. Also, in the book, questions are asked to the reader, but there aren't answers printed anywhere in the book, which can be confusing.<p>Personally, I would rate this book as an 8 on a scale of 1-10. It was a great book to read and it taught me a lot. It could have had more `guts', but it was very well written. I would definitely suggest this book to others, if they were interested in design. It was well worth my time and a good book to `keep on file!'<p>By M.L.Conklin</span>

                    <span>I had to buy this book for a design class in college and now that I am out of college, I still use it for ideas on projects and inspiration. Robin writes in a very easy to understand language and gives you lots and lots of pictures to illustrate what she is saying... the WHOLE book is full of colored photos! I liked this book so much, I decided to purchase Robin Williams Web Design Workshop.</span>

                    <span>I have really enjoyed this book.  Being a designer, I sometimes need ideas to help get me going, and this book provides it in spades.  I really like the way that the author took some ideas from concept, through to completion.  It really provides a great insight into the designer's mind.  I wholeheartly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>This is an easy read, cover to cover. Large colorful image examples and lots of space around text make the read easy and enjoyable. I love color examples especially when the subject is design. This is a great design reference and all around great book.<p>This was a definite idea generator. Working with web design, I find it difficult to find books that focus more on design aspects, and this book touches on many design aspects including web design, brochures, and all kinds of things! The Web design workshop book is more focused on web design, but this is an excellent companion to generate ideas and get great design concepts and ideas to keep in mind for any medium! <p>I love this book and the Web design workshop and can't wait to read more from the authors! I appreciate the layout of the book and the way it was made easy to follow. I hate reading books that are too technical and full of text from top to bottom, and this book was so refreshing because it's just the opposite! The authors also kept in mind that some readers would be experienced designers and some beginners and accommodate us all with style and grace.  Thanks Robin and John!</span>

                    <span>After purchasing Web Design Workshop (and loving it), I desired more books from this wonderful author.  I have my own web design business and was asked to build a newsletter.  The Design Workshop book came in handy.  Every page is worth reading and filled with great color.  She gives clear examples of good print work and how to capture the reader.  The most important quote in the book, "We may talk about creating a design, buy what we really want to do is communicate-communicate an idea, a feeling, or a message."  This is so important in print and web design.  My personal breakthrough from this book was the awareness of the many different image fonts I could use in my design.<p>Robin Williams forces a designer (or reader) to look outside the box and try new design techniques.  A fabulous book!</span>
