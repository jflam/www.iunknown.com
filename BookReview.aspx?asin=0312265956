                <span id="Label1"><div><i>"'Oh my God, is this really happening?!'</i><br><br><i>It was halfway through the 200-meter breaststroke finals at the 1998 World Championships and the rookie was gliding four feet beneath the water's wind-rumpled surface.  Above him, 15,000 spectators were screaming encouragement and millions more were watching on live international television.  All of them could see what the rookie and the seven other finalists could not: the actual race as it unfolded.</i><br><br><i>Underwater, the swimmer stole a peek down the length of the pool.  That quick glance may have very well changed the course of a career, for from then on, nothing would ever be the same for this athlete.  A bucket of adrenaline dumped into his gut and flooded his arms and legs.  He wanted to laugh and shout in joyful surprise.  Is there any greater joy than feeling unbridled power course through the body at the exact instant it is most needed? </i><br><i>The swimmer burst to the surface and began his first stroke with a ferocious arm sweep..."</i><br><br>So begins <i>Gold in the Water</i>, the highly acclaimed and mesmerizing tale about the remarkable two-year journey an elite team of swimmers takes to the 2000 Olympic Games.  <br>Decades ago, northern California's aged Santa Clara Swim Club, the birthplace of modern swimming, was home to nearly every U.S. Olympic swimmer.  Now, after years of irrelevance, a distinctly American renewal is taking place there.  In the water, race a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; and an older mentor, two best friends who have emerged as the world's two best breast strokers.  As they wrestle with their increasingly complex rivalry, around them swim some of the world's most talented athletes.  There is a long-retired starlet who has returned to her sport for unexplained reasons and is engineering one of the most remarkable comebacks in sports history.  There is an enigmatic butterflyer systematically removing emotion from his Olympic journey while engineering a plan to join his famous father in Olympus.  With them is a troubled back stroker, a man with preternatural talent who despises his sport even as he is proclaimed a future Olympic hero.  Overseeing their journey is one of the most explosive and passionate coaches in American sports.  At turns both brilliant and unbearable, swimming's bete noire knows the 2000 Olympics represent a final chance to restore a tarnished reputation and banish long-buried demons.<br>  <br>The spellbinding narrative follows the sport's biggest stars as well as its unheralded darkhorses on their incredible march to the Olympics.  Seamlessly weaving together escalating rivalries, unexpected setbacks, profound sorrows and incredible joys, the book captures like none before it the true passion and grit that the pursuing greatness requires.  Meet the biggest stars of the 2000 Olympics, as well as the ordinary heroes chasing an elusive dream.  Their shared story will permanently change how we see the Olympic athlete.<br><br>Boldly sweeping in its literary power and pace, <i>Gold in the Water</i> has been called "a cross between the New Yorker and Chariots of Fire."  With exquisite precision, first-time author P.H. Mullen creates a fascinating world of suspense and emotion, where the human desire for excellence rules over all and where there are no second chances for glory.  Above all, <i>Gold in the Water</i> is about the triumph of the human spirit. <br></div></span>

                    <span>"Seabiscuit" is not about a horse. It is about the people around the horse and their competitive desires, ambitions, and very interesting lives. In exactly the same way, "Gold in the Water" is not just about the sport of swimming. It is about a handful of compelling people living the Olympic Dream and trying to learn the elusive secrets of being great.<P>Quite simply, I could not put this book down the first time I read it. After a second reading, I believe this is the best true-life sports drama I've ever read. The message is as strong as Lance Armstrong's "It's not about the Bike", and the writing is far better. <P>Personally, I think businesses could benefit from the motivation messages. Young people would do well to emulate the strong character of the books subjects, particularly two swimmers who don't even make the Olympics, Kurt Grote and Dod Wales. I thought the coach, Dick Jochums, is too hard and stubborn in places. But he got me to start working out again, so he can't be all bad. This is definitely a book to put on your list.</span>

                    <span>This book is a compelling and engrossing character study of a group of super-achieving athletes with congruent but sometimes competing aspirations. It has an excellent narrative drive that made it a real page-turner, and perhaps because it pulls no punches in its treatment of its focal characters, the reader is left with a deep appreciation for the complex and usually (but not always) admirable qualties of elite athletes. Swimmers tend to be smart, and this is an intelligent treatment of both swimming and competition in general: this book is to the standard sports expose as collegiate swimmers' GPAs are to the GPAs of (pick your contact sport) players. Although I read this on the recommendation of a friend who is a serious swimmer, I feel it deserves an audience far beyond the competitive swimming world, for which I'm sure it will be required reading.</span>

                    <span>This book was so inspiring to me.I have been a swimmer my whole life, and this book truely show the challenges and the hurttles that swimmer have to face. I think that they are true rolemodels, they had a dream of going to the Olympics and they chased that dream never giving up. They acheived the dream of olympic glory.This book beautifully showed the relasionship between the swimmers and there coach, and how together they achevied there dream.</span>

                    <span>I hate Chicken Soup for the Soul books. I'm not interested in reading a book that makes you feel warm and musy for three seconds and then allows you to live your life the same way thereafter. So normally, I won't read an "inspirational" book. But this book was amazing! First of all, it didn't just talk about who we would expect, like Moses or Krayzelburg. This just went into detail about one swim club, and shared the stories of the top swimmers from there, even though they weren't all gold medalists. Further, you got to see all sides of their story. How they got into swimming, what the press thought of them, how they interacted with each other, how they did at other meets. The whole book is so interesting, and you will laugh and you will cry. Most importantly you will stay up until 4AM all week until you finish it because this is not a book you can easily put down!</span>

                    <span>Outstanding work by Mullen! Like, Larry Bird's book 'Drive' this book is perfect for all athletes not just the target sport. All athletes can appreciate the love, joy and devastation of the Olympic games. <P>The determination and courage of the swimmers combined with Mullen's smooth writing brings to the reader a tremendous experience. After finishing this book, I went out and ran 5 miles. Don't waste money on Harry Potter this year, read about the heroes of the real world.</span>
