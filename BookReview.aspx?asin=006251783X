                <span id="Label1">The past is more than prologue, says bestselling author and Chopra Center for Well Being counselor Debbie Ford. <I>The Secret of the Shadow</I> urges readers to create a fresh meaning about their formative experiences, especially the painful ones, and use them to plan a more purposeful and authentic life. Ford believes that each person is born with unique gifts and a divine purpose, which are lost when we create a "story"--a collection of beliefs--that manufactures a false self and casts a shadow to hide our uniqueness and prevent us from success in work and love. As she explains, "the key is to stop chasing the feel-good moments and make peace with our stories so we can understand, accept and embrace everything in the past that has caused us pain." Once we stop trying to change the painful parts of our story, we will discover the divine plan for our lives.<p>  Writing in the voice of the wounded healer, Ford tells her own story of embracing the wisdom and direction she found in facing family and addiction problems. She skillfully offers examples from participants in her workshops at the Chopra center who have leveraged the lessons of a painful past into a purposeful life. She invites readers to "own their <I>whole</I> story" by asking: What is the secret [about you] that your story conceals? What wisdom can you contribute to the world that you couldn't if the events in your life hadn't happened?" <p>  At times, Ford's approach seems derivative of 12-step programs and ersatz Buddhism. And she mixes metaphors of shadows and light with those of a recipe and ingredients. Readers also know that self-reflection, acceptance of life's mixed blessings, and making lemonade from lemons are not new ideas. Yet Ford's passion and persuasiveness make a fresh case for daring to be yourself, learning from experience, and discovering the divine spark that is beyond our understanding. <I>--Barbara Mackoff</I> </span>

                    <span>I was given this book by my therapist, as she felt that I still needed to work through a lot of issues from my past and that this book may help me bring the experiences forward. I can honestly say that it did.
<br />
<br />Ford tells you stories from her life and also of those that she has worked with. She tells us of people that have tried every type of therapy to improve themselves but because they never work with their whole story they can't find the improvement they are looking for. She offers action steps at the end of every chapter some of which I found very helpful. The usefulness of the action steps depends on how much time you have to devote to them.
<br />
<br />One of the actions is to write down your life story. Although, I agree that this would be a very helpful process it's not one that most of us have the time or patience for! Even though I didn't perform all the actions I still took a lot of way from this book and it opened me up for deeper discussions with my therapist.
<br />
<br />Ford also gives us contemplation at the end of every chapter. I found some of these so thought provoking that I taped them to my bathroom mirror so that I wouldn't forget to contemplate them every day! All in all, a very helpful book!</span>

                    <span>Henry David Thoreau once said that "the mass of men lead lives of quiet desparation," and this book sheds light on the fact that his insightful comment applies to most of our lives. <p>Debbie Ford provides the way out of this desparation with her insightful book. Once we are confronted with and accept the truth that we all have a story, that we are shackled to this story, but that we have a choice to be free, real freedom is to be experienced. <p>How will I know? You will love other people, you'll see that "it ain't all about me," and there won't be a petty bone in your body. You'll be one great big bundle of love! <p>Reading this book was like having a spiritual cataract operation. I was blind (blinded by my story), but now I see (the real me, the me that G-d knew in His mind from before the foundation of the world. <p>Read...experience...then live!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this next book from Debbie.  It solidifies what she talks about in her first book - owning the side of ourselves that we want to forget exists.  Remember, the people around you know all your faults - but what is a fault to one is not a fault to another.  By not owning all of ourselves, we deprive the world and those closest to us the opportunity to see who they really are!  This book was worth the money, and I will read it over and over again.</span>

                    <span>Cmon people - why are we so unforgiving ?<p>of course, there is nothing truly new in ultimate reality<br> and you may have heard many of these truths before in<br> some other form. But that is no excuse to be jaded about it.<p> If you "really" understood the old truths to the deepest<br> level, wouldnt you already be living exactly the way you<br> desire ?  The way you live is the truest test of how well<br> you have understood the previous truths and whether a newer<br> form of the same essential truth can benefit you.<p> Lets get some perspecitve: I thank God that we now have<br> people like Debbie who point out dysfunction whereas <br> 30 years ago, all forms of abusive behaviors were considered<br> "as good as it gets"</span>
