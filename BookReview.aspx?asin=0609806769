                <span id="Label1">Pararescue jumpers, or PJs, are the military's most elite force, a highly trained group of men serving in the Air Force and the National Guard. In battle, they fly behind enemy lines to rescue downed pilots. In peacetime, PJs stay sharp with daring civilian rescues, recovering victims from scorching deserts, treacherous mountaintops, raging seas, and natural disasters. Their almost unimaginable courage first came to the public's attention in Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm, with that book's riveting account of how a helicopter of PJs plunged into the Atlantic during a tragic rescue attempt. Senior Master Sergeant Jack Brehm was the PJ supervisor coordinating their dramatic efforts that night.<br><br>That Others May Live not only sheds new light on that rescue, it also tells the thrilling story of Jack Brehm's devotion to the PJs, a career choice that transformed him from an aimless kid to an on-call hero. Jack's vivid account reveals not only the dangerous rescues and relentless training he and his fellow PJs endure, but the emotional struggles as well: losing friends, waiting anxiously to be called into action, and trying to keep their families together despite the enormous life-and-death pressures of the job. This book is a compelling and deeply personal story of one man's "ordinary" heroism that is, in reality, extraordinary.</span>

                    <span>It is rare that one reads a true account that has moments of gripping excitement and touching personal moments, that provides a clear picture of the little-known world of the PJ's, and does it all while reading like a thriller. Their adventures while in the act of saving lives are as exciting as any adventure/thriller's hero's exploits...and in the PJ world, people can be seriously injured or killed. I read THAT OTHERS MAY LIVE after reading THE PERFECT STORM, the incredible account of how a helicopter of PJ's plunged into the sea during a tragic rescue attempt. The author of THAT OTHERS MAY LIVE was the PJ supervisor coordinating the rescue attempt. This book provides the background and the human side of the drama to answer the many questions that arise after reading or seeing the movie, THE PERFECT STORM. It's difficult to understand how anyone can maintain the discipline, athletic abilities, and commitment that are needed to remain a PJ for 20 years but Jack Brehm's life story proves it can be done - and those whose lives he touched are the better for it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>On the whole, I thought this was an excellent view into the lives and mindset of PJs, as well as their families--and let's face it, family is important. Stress destroys relationships, and there's enough stress in this job for a dozen ordinary people.<BR>Some of the more gut-wrenching moments include descriptions of rescues where the weather won't allow an air pickup, so a PJ jumps into the sea with the hope of being able to keep himself and the victims alive until the weather breaks. Not a job for cowards.<BR>Some parts are a tad slow, but then, this is one of those jobs that consists of months of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. It's an essential element, and I didn't find it to detract from the read.<BR>My only complaint is that it seemed rushed into production and some technical errors slipped in. An F-15 rarely seats two people, never side by side, and doesn't have an "escape pod." That sounds somewhat like an F-111, and if the rescue was off the coast of Britain in the 1980s, a likely actuality. Obviously, Jack Brehm didn't make that mistake in print; it was probably an editor shuffling things around. Likewise, some of the parachuting technicals mentioned don't match my jump experience.<BR>But then, this isn't a textbook for students, it's a view into the mind and lives of the men who risk death to save others, amidst the families, organizations and rivalry and the occasional mockery of wannabes. Well worth the read.<BR>As to "The Perfect Storm" reference, there has to be some way to relate the content to a casual reader who would otherwise think of "Pajamas" when hearing "PJ."<BR>It's "Pararescue Jumper," and they and the pilots and the Coasties are all on the same team.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a fantastic story, I simply couldn't put it down. The tales of adventure are truly compelling, and I particularly enjoyed the way the author contrasted stories of Jack Brehm "Family Man" with Jack Brehm "Action Man". These guys are true heroes, but they're also people - they have families, feelings, and petty squabbles just like everybody else.<P>I know some people were uninterested in the family stories, but I found them very interesting, and at times dramatic. Frankly, if the entire book were nothing but this guy's war stories, it'd be hard to believe he was a real person. <P>I'd recommend it wholeheartedly.</span>
