                    <span>Cultivating Stillness is a text from the Taoist canon.  Its Chinese name is the T'ai Shang Ch'in-ching Ching.  Cultivating stillness is a short text of twenty-four segments.  An exoteric interpretation will produce a reading of Taoism that focuses on the ideas of wu-wei, simplicity, and peaceful and harmonious living.  An esoeric interpretation will reveal hidden instructions on internal alchemy and meditation, nd will offer advice on a lifestyle that is conducive to the cultivation of health and longevity.
<br />
<br />Taoist methods of health, longevity, and immortality were often presented in the esoteric terminology of alchemy, which was intended both to reveal and to hide.  To those initiated in the practice, the symbolism revealed a world of inner experience.  To the uninitiated, the terminology would appear confusing if not meaningness.
<br />
<br />This book does use the language of alchemy which will be more suitable for those who are actually practicing Taoist Inner Alchemy (being familiar with I Ching will also help), but it also contains commentaries on the benefits of cultivating stillness, practicing the experience of "nothingness", and points out the obstacles on the path which need to be dealt with.
<br />
<br />The contents of the book point the way to raising one's conscousness, merging with the spirit / Tao.
<br />
<br />"The teachings presented in Cultivating Stillness
<br />Are suitable for men and women, young and old alike.
<br />When the golden metal and the jade ston merge as one substance,
<br />Ch'ien and k'un will acend to the highest realm of heaven.
<br />Hurry and find the center of true stillness,
<br />Tame your nind and recover your original nature,
<br />Distance yourself from the east and return to the west,
<br />Gather the herbs and complete the alchemical transformation of the pill,
<br />Let your body shed its mortal shell and ascend to the realm of heaven.
<br />The book Cultivating Stillness and its associated illustrations
<br />Are a raft that carries us across the sea of suffering,
<br />The text helps to see through the illusion of lif and eath,
<br />The commentary is a shaft of light through the dark well of ignorance." </span>

                    <span>This book is based on an ancient Taoist text written by Lao Tzu. It is about changing oneself ... creating and maintaining internal harmony, despite external circumstances. Due to its esoteric nature, i.e., internal alchemy ... the author, a Chinese American, was guided by a Taoist master when learning from the original text. With this book, the author becomes our very own "master", as she guides us in understanding the path to "cultivating stillness." <p>One gets a good description of the Chinese philosophy and underpinnings of the text via a wonderful explanation of the symbols ... we learn about the I Ching, the three treasures, the stove and the cauldron, microcosmic circulation, and cleansing all of which occur within the twelve terrestrial branches. We learn of the symbolism of "the Golden Raven, "the Jade Rabbit","the Golden Palace", "the North Sea", "the Winding River", and "the Southern Mountain." Using breath as the catalyst, the student will eventually experience the regeneration of personal energy into vital energy ...  The state of "wang chi", the intermediate state between "wu chi" and "tai chi" is discussed. We learn, "wu chi" is the state of the Void, or Tao. We learn, "tai chi", is the state of differentiating yin and yang, when yin encompasses yang, and yang encompasses yin. On many levels this is a complex book. However, if the reader wants to learn Chinese philosophy, the accompanying symbolism, as well as how this knowledge can transform the human spirit this book is definitely the place to start.<p>This is a poetry book, a book of free verse, filled with statements by Lao Tzu which precede each chapter. On another level, it is a depth psychology book for the reader who applies some of the techniques in learning about themselves. On yet a separate level, it is a history book about how the Chinese philosophers, primarily Lao Tzu, viewed mankind and the universe ... a place of energy and form, in an eternal dance ... and lastly, it is an artistic book, filled with wonderful explanations about Chinese ideagrams. Although it is a highly complex read, therefore not for everyone, it is a thoroughly enjoyable book for those who are patience and interested in experiencing a unique culture and understanding its viewpoint.

                    <span>Eva Wong has done a great service in translating this mystic tome and that effort, and the excellent commentary, is deserving of 4 stars. But a word to the not so wise, this is not for the beginner. One reviewer noted that it took reading many other books before they could begin to understand this one and that may indeed be the case for all of us, because at first sight, I've got nothing. Its completely symbolic and even the commentaries generalize important aspects of the Taoist Path. It is not an instruction guide...at all. As another reviewer put it, it is a book to meditate upon. <p>The introduction hints at much of the Taoist meditation techniques including circulating qi and the stages of enlightenment but the book does not elaborate and the reader may find, like i did, their taste buds had been whetted for a meal that never came.<p>A most interesting work for anyone seeking the Tao but it is not a detailed guide, it is scripture to wrap your mind around.</span>

                    <span>Eva Wong has done a great service to all who practice Qigong and cannot read the original material in its native tongue.  This manual was originally given to neophytes who were starting to walk the path and it is still just as fresh and important as it was when first written.<p>The book uses the format of starting each section with an illustration of the original page.  These illustrations are very interesting and informative (such as the use of the original form of the taiqi symbol) in their own right.  Then there is the primary verse followed by the commentary.  No suprises here, format-wise, to anyone who has seen western books on Zen sutras and koans.<p>Wong's commentary displays deep insight into the lessons and there is much to be learned here.  I read the book at least once a year and never fail to learn/notice something new.  I suspect anyone who practices will come to a similar conclusion.<p>Excellent!</span>

                    <span>I got this book a year ago, and read it very intensely.  It was completely abstract to me and I had a difficult time understanding the meaning of the text.  Then I reread the introduction and that helped me understand some of the meaning behind the symbolism.   <br><br>After applying the principles to my life, I saw the influence of harmonizing with the Dao (Tao) as it manifested to me. <br><br>All these experiences were wonderful and uplifting, but it was not until I had been reading other texts and had almost completely forgotten about the book that I had the revelation of internal alchemy and what the book was actually talking about.   <br><br> This book speaks on so many different levels: it is a serious read.  If you are interested in spiritual elevation, internal cultivation, and enlightenment of the mind then this book shows a path that can be followed, but it is only through inner discipline that a transformation is acheived.   <br><br>Be humble and wise: life is one big road with a lot of signs...<br>Make up your mind to face reality all the time.</span>
