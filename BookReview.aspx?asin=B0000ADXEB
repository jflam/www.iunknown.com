                <span id="Label1">Originally broadcast in 1984, <I>The Living Planet</I> followed five years after David Attenborough's first wildlife blockbuster series, <I>Life on Earth</I>. This was an equally ambitious 12-part documentary that spanned the globe with portraits of each of the major geographical regions that offer a home to life. Attenborough demonstrates how even in the most hostile of environments, from the volcanic "Furnaces of the Earth" to "The Frozen World" of mountains and tundra, the Arctic and Antarctic, live maintains a foothold. He takes us to "The Northern Forests," the "Jungle," "Seas of Grass," and "The Baking Deserts" and, ever the genial host, details how, in all its endless diversity, life is ingeniously suited to its surroundings. <p>  Through breathtaking imagery we meet our fellow inhabitants, from penguins to polar bears, lions to scorpions, oaks to eagles, and journey on to "The Open Ocean" and the "New Worlds," which mankind itself is rapidly fashioning through ever more radical technological change. The series ends with an impassioned environmental plea that rings even more urgent now than in 1984. <I>--Gary S. Dalkin</I></span>

                    <span>If made with today's technology this series would rank as the best nature series ever produced. Despite its age-related flaws (Video Quality, Soundtrack, Chopping Block), this DVD series still rates the full 5 stars. It features a younger, spryer David Attenborough exploring a planet teeming with life. Attenborough is the ultimate ecology teacher - he guides the viewer through the various biomes of the earth, picking out a variety of amazing phenomena to show us, and he lets us soak in the beauty of each realm. Rather than focusing on birds or mammals, we learn about the whole spectrum of the natural world, from fish to fungi, insects to people. The information is always interesting, and presented in modest amounts - it never becomes a bore. <P>Buy this if you enjoyed these DVDs: <BR>Life of Mammals<BR>Blue Planet<BR>Africa: The Serengeti<BR>Alaska: Spirit of the Wild</span>

                    <span>The program is EXCELLENT, and I've watched it many times on VHS. Unfortunately, the region 1 DVD has been edited and I was very disapointed to find that most of the sections had been shortened. From what I understand, the region 2 DVD is not edited. So if I had it to do over, I would buy the region 2 DVD from amazon.co.uk instead.</span>

                    <span>I took college class that required to watch video, Living Planet. My very very disapointment with it. It says cc (closed captioning) which stands for deaf viewers. I watched those DVD and guess what? Those DVD(s) do not display any closed captioning. I am deaf. It angers me very much. I feel like being betrayed by its said feature on the box.</span>

                    <span>The Living Planet Series by David Attenborough is a milestone, a benchmark in the production of nature education. What he has done is a quantum leap beyond anything else in the "nature show" category. The depth, breadth and brilliance of this series is unparralled. Unfortunately, TimeWarner got their grubby hands on it. They decided that to reorder and edit the shows so that they fit with the graphics they have chosen for the packaging. I'm not kidding! It is like they put a mustache on the Mona Lisa. Boo Hiss TimeWarner.</span>
