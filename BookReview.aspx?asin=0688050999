                    <span>Here's everything that happened during the first ten seasons of NBC's late night comedy-variety show Saturday Night Live. There are ten faces of previous cast members on the cover. They are the 7 original members Dan Aykroyd,John Belushi,Chevy Chase,Jane Curtin,Garrett Morris,Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner. The other three are Bill Murray,who came shortly after Chase's departure,Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy,who were both cast members from 1980 to 1984. The book even tells about the cast members' post-SNL experiences and credits. During the first 10 years,SNL had three producers:Lorne Michaels(1975-1980 and 1985 to present),Jean Doumanian(1980-81) and Dick Ebersol(1981-1985). Michaels left with the remainder of the original SNL cast with Murray in tow as well,in 1980 and returned five years later. Doumanian was fired after the disasterous 1980-81 season and was succeeded by Ebersol. Ebersol met actress Susan Saint-James when she guest hosted once in 1981. They were later married and still are today. We won't forget other previous cast members such as Gilbert Gottfried,Robin Duke,Tim Kazurinsky,Brian Doyle Murray(Bill's brother),Billy Crystal who almost became an original member,Martin Short,Joan Cusack,Julia Louis-Dreyfus,Harry Shearer and James Belushi(John's brother).

                    <span>The first and best book on SNL is a very detailed and close up look at the show.<P>Lots of details on the management from Michaels through to Doumanian to Ebersol are presented. The book covers their relations with NBC in detail, and on through the development and strategy of the show, production changes. At lot of space is dedicated to the creative side and to the cast of outstanding players including the most popular players being (alphabetically) Aykroyd, Belushi, Chase, Curtin, Franken and Davis, Morris, Murphy, Murray, O'Donoghue, Radner, and all the others. The "others" includes amny people that went on to have fabulous careers themselves such as Marty Short and Billy Crystal to name just two. The book follows many of the characters careers on the show giving a brief summary of how they were hired, how they fit into the cast, the dynamics, their contributions, what they did outside the show while being a cast member, and when and why they left, and what happened to them afterwards. It is all quite a comprehensive effort.<P>There are many humorous stories on how the players interacted and how the shows came together to produce specific plots and memorable scenes. Also the book gives some attention to the musical guests and the guest hosts. Of course the primary writers are followed along with the players and their roles leading up to each show - all in a wild pressure cooker environment of drugs and crazy hours, re-writes and set changes - that drove the NBC brass crazy.<P>A great book with lots of information and three sets of photos covering the evolution of the cast. A book that is hard to put down once you start to read.<P>Five stars - the 10 year story in 500 pages of compelling reading.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>You never see much of the behind the scenes going ons of SNL. It would probably make a great documentary "A week in the life of SNL" Until that video comes out (if ever) this is probably the next best thing. I havent finished it yet and already there is a wealth of things I learned. ...Come out with another edition guys! We want more.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book, in terms of its breadth and the behind-the-scenes perspective it gives to the Saturday Night Live episodes we have all seen on TV. The writers certainly did their homework, and yet the scores of names, dates, and places mentioned never bog down the flow of this story. It is fascinating to read about the clashes between these stars who were both comic geniuses and petulant egomaniacs, and frankly, it is surprising that any episodes were able to air at all. Despite what you think about Saturday Night Live, you cannot deny the show's existence as a television institution, and reading this book makes you appreciate its innovation then, and longevity now, all the more.</span>

                    <span>If you are ever interested in Saturday Night Live, this is the book for you. Chronicling the years between 1974-1985, this gives an interesting insight on the lives and careers of Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Eddie Murphy and others. A must read for all SNL fans.</span>
