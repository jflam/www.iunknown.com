                    <span>Ken Venturi as the voice of golf on CBS is one of the most popular sportscasters of his day. Now retired, he finally has a chance to say things that he couldn't say on the air or anywhere else. In this book he talks about his life as a golfer, his life as a sportscaster, and his life as a man. 
<br />
<br />He has not had a life that was all roses. Medical problems from carpal tunnel ended his professional golfing career after only 10 years of play. Other illnesses plagued he and his wife from back surgery to multiple bouts with cancer. He has not only survived these, but through it all has kept his sense of humor and overall happiness with the world. 
<br />
<br />As an accomplished communicator, Mr. Venturi has the ability to tell stories about golf, about himself that make very good reading.</span>

                    <span>Not only read Ken Venturi's book, but read the many different reviews here.  To those who accuse Ken Venturi of sour grapes and whining about his close Masters losses, I say that every golf tournament has two stories to tell.  Everyone loves a winner obviously, but the guy who tasted victory and had it snatched from his hands also has an interesting story to tell. If Greg Norman or Tom Weiscopf ever write their autobiography, or Sam Snead could tell his story of the '39 US Open, it too would strike some as just sour grapes.  Doesn't make their stories any less valid.  As for stories of gamesmanship, rule bending, and maybe even (borderline) cheating, why do so many golf fans show a willingness to believe it about some major champions (like Seve Ballesteros, Vijah Singh, Gary Player) but find it implausable when discussing someone like Arnold Palmer?  Are they still so childlike in their awe of their golf hero that even firsthand reports are automatically dismissed?  Reminds me of what Tommy Bolt always said about news stories of his club throwing.  He said that Arnie threw as many clubs as he did, but the stories never stuck.  Anyway, a good book, Ken.  And I too miss your voice on TV, particularly at the Masters.</span>

                    <span>Come back --- underdog --- fighter --- champion --- commentator.  These are words about Venturi, who it seems most of his life was always dualing with himself against others to show them what he was made of: toughness and talent that could and would succeed in winning.<p>He suffered through much: hand injuries, marriage trauma, etc.  But the biggest hurdles were those letdowns, those meltdowns which occur in sports when one is so close to seizing the brass ring, only to have it slip out of grasp.  As Venturi would describe, someone else always played phenonemenal to do just that.  He would be a previous generation's Greg Norman.<p>Anyone who was so close and fondly associated with the likes of Nelson, Sarazen and Hogan, now this is a special person.  Or for Vince Lombardi to admire the look in an competitor's eyes, this is a special golfer.  One who endured severe heat and win his country's national golf championship in the doing, this is a special golfer.  <p>This carried over in his broadcasting.  Concise, poignant, to the point.  Let the golf describe most of the action.  I like millions admired and respected his great gifts for commenting, but never really knew about the stammering.  Maybe the greatest hurdle of all.  What courage he showed and can encourage all who have such to do the same.  A man of principle.  <p>Somehow as good as this read was with all the fascinating stories and incidents, I thought it was slightly "I oriented" too much.  Thus, four not five.</span>

                    <span>Venturi is a bit of a prima donna - you can't be on TV for 35 years without a touch of that - but at the same time he has lived a very interesting life in golf, and come across some very interesting people. I forgive him his brushes against Palmer and Player: I have no doubt that those people, while projecting saintly public images, are extremely fierce competitors willing to work everything possible in their favor, and I thank this book for having the nerve to reveal that side to me. In a similar but more positive way, I came away with a much more well-rounded sense of people like Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson.<p>Venturi's attitude about his own play and level is interesting: while he blames injury and circumstances for many losses and for not having achieved full potential, I think he minimizes the way many greats have overcome similar problems.<p>The main thing, though, is that I read this book because I sorely miss his voice - and attitude - on TV. He's been replaced by a generation of blabbermouths who, unlike Venturi, are unable to push their own considerable egos aside to comment on the sport itself. Johnny Miller is by far the worst offender, but they're all reasonably guilty. And if I see Peter Kostis "analyze" another errant swing I think I'll puke. I miss you, Mr. Venturi.</span>

                    <span>The whining drunk shows his true colors.  Should have been off the air at least 10 years before they finally showed him the door.  What a low-life ... if you're broke, it's your fault.  And, if you lost the Masters vs. Arnie, it's because you didn't play well enough to win.</span>
