                    <span>like mr. kerman, i shall fashion my comment into 2 parts, the negative and positive. 
<br />
<br />NEGATIVES:
<br />
<br />I dunno about you people who gave this book a big 5 star "yipee", it just ain't the same for me. I'm a Comsci grad and i've been using flash since version 5. Yeah, i've mastered the basic animation tools like tweening and some basic AS along the way. but it makes me cry whenever i read the book and think that i spent $27 for something that i've already learned. Yes, the book tackles programming basics and the like w/c is very good for the novice flash user who didn't take up a 4 year computer science course w/c is being accustomed to the "foundations" of programming. but it all boils down to LEARNING ACTIONSCRIPT. yeah the book teaches AS but you only get to touch AS after reading 18 chapters of foundation AS. sure there are code snippets for the user to try out...only to find out how the heck are they supposed to implement the code?! an example would be the debugging chapter w/c started to infuriate my learning curve and tested my very looooong patience. the code required me to associate the dynamic string to a variable. how the heck am i supposed to associate the string to var when kerman didn't even show me what a var looks like and where i can find it!!!! HE ONLY TELLS IT 3 CHAPTERS AFTER! if i didn't scour the book for much needed answers to the book, i would've burned the book to motion tweening oblivion. 
<br />which draws me to points when buying a book:
<br />
<br />- always search for negative reviews before buying a book. negative reviews contain 100% more truth than those 5 star reviews.
<br />
<br />- if you're new to some application, find a book w/c suits your learning style, unfortunately for me...i needed more diagrams rather than lengthy text for me to understand what kerman was talkin' bouts.
<br />
<br />- always look for a book w/c poses samples and exercises at the end of the chapter. heck, i just wanted to learn the AS syntax, but kerman decides to teach theories on AS and not the actual exercise.
<br />
<br />- never buy a book w/c CONSTANTLY REFERS TO OTHER CHAPTERS. trust me, if you need to learn it, it should be taught NOW.
<br />
<br />- this book is not for people who wanna read long chapters and try snippets of unclear code to understand what the author's talkin' bout then go back to readin' sum more boring chapters.
<br />
<br />in closing, i am giving this book 1 star to alert potential buyers of this book that o'reilly books are the best. even though i haven't read one.
<br />
<br />POSITIVE:
<br />
<br />there are some cool sample w/c you won't understand, although its still cool though, like the instant replay thingy.</span>

                    <span>No stars. The text is too verbose, poorly organized and very confusing and downright cryptic. This is more on 'theory of programming' than hands-on work. The examples are non-existant, and the workshops hardly justify the price tag for this book. <p>The author constantly refers to unintroduced topics and assumes reader knowledge for topics that are not even addressed till later  in the book. For example, we have to get to chapter 10 before we actually set text in a text variable. This is advanced? <p>The method of explaining is very confusing, very boring and very vague. I am up to chapter 12 now and I still cannot make head or tail of where the text is headed. <p>Save you money. Don't buy this book. <br>I will return it...</span>

                    <span>This has been a really good buy for me as a novice on flash actionscript programming. Phillip is writing in such a way that it was easy for me to understand, and follow the book.<p>It's a must have for beginners I think.</span>

                    <span>This book provided a practical example of how to use ActionScript to load and parce an XML file. The author's companion website provided working .fla and .xml files (easy to download and modify). For me this XML example code made the book worth the money.</span>

                    <span>This book is really one of the greatest I have read, and I'm not talking about action script only, but generally about all books about programming/design I have ever read.  <br>But make no mistake, this is not a book for those who want some chunks of code ready to copy and paste. (even though it has some of those) This is a book for those who want to learn every aspect of action script programming and also general basis of programming and logic, and since those are not light concepts... well of course the book isn't a piece of cake.  <br>There's a huge part of the book that  could be considered very theoretical (450 pages before you get to the real practical part) and it could bore you if you are not really up to it, so I think it could be a mistake to use it as a textbook for college classes it is better suited for the enthusiast who really wants to learn by himself and from the root, it requires patience, time and dedication to go through every aspect of a programming language and this book intends to do so, hence, if you are not a real geek don't even try.  <br>Personally I read it as if it was a good sci fi novel, it thrilled me.  <br>The only downside there is to it is that it's noticeable (in the examples and the guy's web site) that Mr kerman isn't really an aesthetical genius so it falls a little short when it comes to concatenate all that programming with graphical elements, but since that isn't really the focus of the book it's not such a bad thing.  <br>I'm really looking forward to seeing the update/new release for action script 2.0</span>
