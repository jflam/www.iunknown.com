                    <span>if you're a looking for a book that will help you greatly in your office work and you already deal with excel on a daily basis, you don't need this book.  i deal with excel everyday, using its advanced routines like the stats functions, the maths, and the database/pivottables... this book just basically sums up everything you can discover on your own by simply using excel or by scrutinizing existing templates/excel files from other advanced users.  give it a pass if you think you've mastered excel somehow.  (i must have read the description wrongly - because it promised "wonders"...)  perhaps the other books would work better.</span>

                    <span>I read the reviews on this site, and went to buy this book. After bringing it home, I found that it was not what I expected at all. The contents were for much more specialized applications, and didn't appear to apply to the average Excel user. I've used Excel for several years, and haven't had much of a need for many of these specialized tips. I found a few things here and there that may have been helpful, but not enough to justify buying the book.<p>(What really surprised me is that when I brought it back to the store, the fellow at the counter gave me a funny look, and asked why I was returning it. When I replied that it just wasn't what I expected, he said that I was the third person to return that same book in the last month!)</span>

                    <span>I bought this book directly from the author for $19.95 the suggested retail price not the ridiculous $193 plus asked for by others to include amazon.<p>The book is excellent and worth the money.  While you may not use it all there is enough in there you will find something to save you loads of frustration and hours of tedious work.<p>Buy it from the authors web site.</span>

                    <span>I was worried that this book would either be (a) over my head or would (b) give me tips that I wouldn't use.  What I found was a book with Excel tips that you don't learn in even advanced Excel training, but that are simple to use and can take A LOT of time off your day-to-day Excel tasks!  The author gives simple, easy, relevant examples to how to use the tools and tells you the potential pitfalls of using each tool and how to get around them.  He addresses such things as Consolidating and Subtotaling with ideas for making your reports more readable.<p>Highly recommend for anyone using Excel in an office environment.  There will be at LEAST 5 tips in this book that will make it well worth your $$.</span>
