                    <span>It seems like the world has turned upside down.  No wonder business rebels are succeeding like never before - they break with the conventional wisdom and create a whole new paradigm.  THE REBEL RULES does a good job explaining who these people are, like Southwest Airlines' Herb Kelleher and Charles Schwab, but more importantly, it helps get inside the head of an entrepreneur.  Most business books are written by consultants, so this book is a breath of fresh air as it gives specific tools and strategies that you can immediately use in your company.  My only criticism is that the book tries to cover a little too much ground...I would have preferred to see more in-depth discussions in the area of "how to create buzz" or "creating corporate culture" as those seem to be the areas where Mr. Conley excels the most.  I highly recommend this book for anyone trying to understand where the world of business is going.</span>

                    <span>This book was a great inspiration for an entrepreneur embarking on her own business.  Chip goes from big picture analysis of the rebel's place in the business world to specific business practices for the rebel entrepreneur.  <p>The Rebel Rules helps you to explore yourself and your own role in business as well as those of your employees.  By using real life examples from his own hospitality company and those of other well-known "rebels", Chip demonstrates how passion, vision, agility, and instinct can carry you far.  It's not just self-help babble... he actually uses concrete examples and excercises to use for yourself and for growth and development in your company.<p>This is a book that I will read and re-read... it's business practices and inspiration are timeless and can be refered to over and over again.</span>
