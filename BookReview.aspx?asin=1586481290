                <span id="Label1"><I>The Industry Standard</I> sought to chronicle the world of Internet business, but instead became one of its spectacular failures--and its collapse turned out to be a funnier story than you'd expect. <P>It was not that long ago that <I>The Industry Standard</I> was an international publishing phenomenon. Founded in 1998 with the grandiose goal of being "the <I>BusinessWeek</I> of the Internet economy," it soared to unprecedented heights during the dot-com boom, with far-flung bureaus, a thriving conference business, and a seemingly endless supply of cash. In 2000 alone, <I>The Standard</I> published more than 7,000 ad pages, generating revenues of over $200 million--more than any other magazine in the history of America. Little did anyone imagine that the following August the entire organization would file for bankruptcy. <P><I>Starving to Death on $200 Million a Year</I> is James Ledbetter's mock-heroic chronicle of the magazine that lived large and died young: the wild dreams, the sudden success, the wanton excesses, the fatal hemorrhage. From his vantage point as one of <I>The Standard</I>'s top editors, he saw up close how it succumbed to the same gold-rush fever as the Internet businesses it was supposed to be chronicling, realizing too late that he had been infected as well. <P>As America continues to reckon with its post-nineties hangover, Ledbetter offers a sardonic look at a thriving business that died on the verge of taking on the world.</span>

                    <span>So read this book and loved it.  I was a avid reader of Grok and Industry Standard.  I was only in highschool and college at the time.  I really wanted to understand how could such a great magazine die such a quick death.  This book explained a lot of it, but not all of the story.  It is a quick read, I finished it very quickly.  The problem with this book is: if you were not a fan of the magazine he was involved with, their is no point in reading it...because it does not necessarily give you insight that is relevant outside of that magazine. </span>

                    <span>Ledbetter was the editor for the European edition of the Industry Standard, so while not an outsider, he spent his time in NYC or London, far away from the San Fran offices,this is not exactly an inside view either. <p>The result reads like an in depth business journal article (which figures, based on the authors background) by someone with really good connections. There are some interesting stories, some tidbits about what went on in the "fat year" (but not enough) and some amusing insights. <p>The book falls flat because Ledbetter fails to really explain what went on from the inside. He barely scratches the surface, constantly back tracking, covering himself (no surprise based on the seeming constant threats of libel suits during his tenure) and generally trying to play both sides. He wants to dig up the dirt, but he also wants to continue working in the publishing business. The result is like the version of events an adult would tell a child, the story is the same, the details just get glossed over. <p>Not the dot.com expose we have been waiting for.</span>

                    <span>Nowadays, saying a book read more like fiction than non-fiction is a common thing to say about a book,  but I have to say the way Ledbetter captures your attention and keeps you flipping pages is astonishing me because I don't read that many non-fiction books.  I breezed thorough the first half in what seemed like only a few minutes, and the ending left me wanting to know more about "The Standard" as he refers to it in the book.<p>It's not uncommon for me to read a good mystery or thriller in 1 or 2 sittings, but I've never had any desire to keep reading a non-fiction book(even a good non-fiction book) for an extended period of time, and in a funny way the epilogue did seem more like the end of a mystery, filling us in on what's happened to the characters since the Standard folded.  I read the book (cover to cover) in a couple of hours.  I've never read anything by James Ledbetter before, but I've got to figure he's a pretty good reporter, because he managed to capture my attention, and hold it till he was done with me, and in the end I wanted a lot more.   Or course, it's possible I simply had nothing better to do. <p>It's not a 5 star book.  It's not going to change my life, and I won't pass this around to all my friends saying "You must read this book!"  But as someone who had never heard of the Industry Standard till I opened the book, I came away from it saying, "I want to know more..."<p>Also, from my point of view, the book was not about the magazine. It was about Ledbetter's journey through the magazine, often shifting from the magazine's rise and fall to humorous stories about his run ins with PR agents, details about stories they published, and tales of a party or event, that he may or may not have attended.<p>If you do have a chance to pick up this book, you might enjoy the result, not because of the lessons learned, but because the story is just too good to be fiction.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The tale of the rise and fall of The Industry Standard is an entertaining read, especially if you know somebody affected by the dotcom bubble burst, if you were laid off yourself, or especially if you were an employee of the company in question. I just happen to fit all three categories.<p>The Standard was of course an editorial operation, and this book focuses on the experiences of the editorial staff of which the author was a member. Since I was a part of the technical infrastructure team, I wasn't privy to many of the intricate details. Ledbetter's insights into the editorial staff's point-of-view are interesting and amusing; the basic happenings are all there (extravagant offsite meetings, reckless overspending, internal power struggles, and so on), but with some added first-person (or second-person) details.<p>I was hesitant to buy (and read) this book at first. Would I want to relive the days of The Standard? Would there be anything in there I didn't already know? Would it be interesting? For the most part, sure. It's not entirely a rehash of the life and death of one company; there are sprinklings of humorous (and Dilbert-ish) anecdotes that should be appealing to anybody who has dealt with the pressures of startups and shutdowns.</span>

                    <span>While mildly amusing, there was little in the way of meat in this book. The author was located at either the New York or London office for almost the entire life of the magazine and only met with senior management on a few occasions.<p>For him to have written a book about the Industry Standard is like me writing a book about [a store] because I shop here.<p>If you can pick it up used, it might be worth a quick read but you will find yourself skipping pages because the details have little to do with the company and more to do with James explaining his job while there.</span>
