                    <span>Two sentences into the introduction I began to cry. Since then I've laughed, smiled, cried some more... and now I'm making a list of the friends who desperately need to read this book. Truly a blessing for any  woman!</span>

                    <span>Before reading Soul Satisfaction, I had no idea that hearing only male language for God in church had affected my self-image. As Geitz states in her introduction, images of God and self are very closely connected and a  change in one can bring about a change in the other.<p>This is really  true!!! After meditating on the many feminine images of God in the Bible  (which by the way I'd never even heard before) I have experienced a more  positive sense of self than I ever thought possible. This book has been  more helpful to me than therapy.<p>Meditating on the strong, courageous  women in the Bible in Soul Satisfaction has also been very empowering for  me.<p>My advice is this, "Put this book in your cart now!"</span>

                    <span>Soul Satisfaction comforts, challanges, and compels me to tell others  about it.  I never knew the Bible could be so affirming of who I am as a  woman.  Where has this book been all my life?? The brief meditations  are  heartwarming and gut-wrenching, but also instructive for women today. You will  want one for yourself, and one for each of your friends</span>

                    <span>After reading Elizabeth Geitz's book I was so engaged I sent copies to my mother, sister, and best friend in Arkansas. Not generally one to read religion related books but I found this book to be very open and honest and refreshing</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>These brief, thoughtful meditations are a great way to draw strength from Biblical women and think about your own spirituality as a woman.  Most of them have a simple question to apply to your own life. The format of the  book is nice too.</span>
