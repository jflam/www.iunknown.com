                <span id="Label1">Tiller Publishing is pleased to announce that, as a result of popular demand, it has reissued Seaworthiness: The Forgotten Factor, by C.A.  Marchaj, a classic of modern yacht design analysis.  <P>Newly updated and revised, Seaworthiness is a highly readable critical analysis of how the search for racing yacht performance has led to the development of sailing yachts with potentially dangerous seakeeping characteristics.  Based upon the highest degree of practical and academic research, it demonstrates how modern yacht design often sacrifices safety for speed and for other considerations, and it maintains that dramatic changes in design philosophy are needed to prevent further loss of life at sea.  This is a major work which will help change the thinking on popular design trends for both racing and cruising yachts.</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute must for anyone who loves boats more than they have good sense. If you are a cruiser or a racer or a bar stool sealawyer who has any experience at sea, reading this book will lead you step by step from prejudice and intuition into solid insights into the behavior and performance of the different hull shapes in the real world of "at sea" in difficult situations. There is no substitute for "the experience" except the experience to recognise and avoid the experience and this book is every bit as important in picking a boat for your use or applying good seamanship to a boat that is on the edge of it's design envelope. The book contains the fundimental information that should be in any serious sailor's kit. It reads easily and the insights emphasise the seaworthiness vs speed delemma in yacht design.</span>

                    <span>This is just one of the many Mr. Marchaj has written on boat design theory. Yacht must look good and be safe ( read seaworthy). In some instances it must also perform. Performance has no value if it can't handle the challange of the seas. "Seaworthiness, the forgotten factor" disects yacht safety down to most intricate detail. Simply, if you haven't read this book, you don't know it all. An absolute 5 star publication, written with great authority, by one of the most respected in the field. Check out Marchaj's other work as well, he never disappoints.</span>

                    <span>"Seaworthiness" is a daunting but important classic.<P>Tony Marchaj, an avid sailor and independent aerodynamics consultant, theorizes that the "increased casualities amongst contemporary yachts" is due to modern sailing yacht design, which, he feels, often sacrifices safety speed.<P>In this book, the author attempts to objectively consider "the design features" which contribute to a sailing yacht truly being seaworthy.<P>Though the equations are kept to a minimum, they are still there, and--to my poor mind, at least--they are forminable. But Marchaj does a fine job of not only helping you to intuitively grasp the nature of whatever he's speaking about, he uses numerous of graphs.<P>Also, he offers lots of literary quotes and allusions. This certainly helps those of us who have a more literary bent, but who also revel in the beauty of boats and the sea.<P>Some of the book's chapters include "Seaworthiness and Safety at Sea," "The Effect of Rating Rules on Yacht Design," "Rolling Induced by Waves," and the very helpful "Survival Tactics" (which includes a section on "Strategy of Sailing in Storm Conditions").</span>
