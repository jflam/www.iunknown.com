                    <span>I was a little frustrated with myself in trying to pick up .NET development.  After all, I could code VB6 w/o effort, but I was struggling to find a book that would be more than a beginner's guide but that would help get me locked into solid .NET development using Winforms.  Chris Sells', Windows Forms Programming in Visual Basic .NET, was the book I was looking for.  From learning the basics of the new .NET Winforms, Controls, and IDE to more advanced concepts new to VB programmers such as inheritance, multithreading, and useful tips and hints, this book covers a great deal.  I especially enjoyed the straightforward style of writing used in this book that avoided unnecessary commentary, rants, or other footnotes that many authors feel the need to add but that don't help much with learning the concepts at hand.  This is a great book and I would highly recommend it both for the beginner and the experienced looking for a great presentation that will help in your quest to learn Smart Client development using VS.NET.</span>

                    <span>I must say, Chris Sells is the most enjoyable CS author i have ever read.  This book was actually recommended by Carl Franklin of franklins.net and i must say that i haven't been happier.  Chris communicates on levels that some of us rarley go.  Chris starts off with here is console app, and then scales all the way up into windows apps, custom painting, printing, threading, etc.  Chris you are one gifted author, and when .NET 2.0 comes out, i'll be the first to order your book.</span>

                    <span>Should be considered *THE* reference for any Windows Forms developer for .NET. This book covers everything from intro material to details of threading and security, and covers it all well. Keep it nearby when developing.</span>

                    <span>Building UI's can be a real pain, but it's a great feeling when you know you built a great UI.  This book can get you there in a hurry.  This is one of those books thats so fun to read you actually forget you are learning some really great techniques.
<br />
<br />If you are an advnaced developer, I think there are some great ideas in here and they certainly explain a lot of the how's and why's that you may have missed.  If you are a newbie, this book will save you tons of time and effort stumbling around.
<br />
<br />Content wise it's superb.  Every chapter was compelling and interesting.
<br />
<br />Editorially - great, I have yet to find any typos or grammar problems, and the code all works.
<br />
<br />I also really like the layout of the book. The examples are great, everything is clear and easy to understand; they just did a really good job on this.</span>
