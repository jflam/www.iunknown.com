                    <span>This book is great for planning, with a lot of details that would prevent a first-time kitchen remodeler from making a lot of mistakes. The authors give details such as standard counter heights that other books skip. The photos are terrific. It doesn't offer much for people who've been through several remodels or planning new kitchens in a custom home. They also omit to mention the tedium of microwaved food for six months, sliding completion dates and escalating costs (muliply time by three and money by two to get a real figure, and I'm not joking), and the reality of washing dishes in the bathtub. Reminder memo to self: you must prevent food scraps from ever reaching the tub drain- there is no garbage disposal.</span>

                    <span>This book is a good primer on kitchen design and remodeling.  It is one of the few willing to mention some real world issues such as "what's behind those walls" and "making sure doors don't get in the way of each other or traffic patterns" and of course "budgets".  It doesn't presume the reader has a huge kitchen or budget to work with. It offers ideas that could help anyone planning a kitchen remodel.  Its chock full of real world tips.  I only wish they could have expanded on some issues that were simply mentioned: such as examples of using non-kitchen cabinet furniture in a kitchen design, and perhaps given xerox-able example lists of what to try to include in a given kitchen area as a starting point for readers to work with.</span>

                    <span>I bought Kitchens that Work at the same time I bought Great Kitchens, At Home with America's Top Chefs. I love Kitchens That Work, and am disappointed in the one about America's top chefs. If you are wondering what Mario Andretti's garage looks like, it is nothing like you would imagine. Probably more like a GM assembly plant. Top chefs think in terms of production, not beauty. One of the kitchens has bare cinderblock, unfinished on the wall. Very utilitarian with little warmth. Others are better than that, but I did not find anything inspiring in there. <br>  Kitchens that work on the other hand, has every level of kitchen pictured. Some high end kitchens to dream of, as well as some a little more practical. The important thing as they mention is an intelligent design, that incorporates what you need, rather than the latest trend. <br>  When I read some of the reviews on Kitchens that Work, I thought it would be lacking something, NOT! It has every consideration covered. Planning, layout, design, considerations when dealing with contractors, things to look out for when opening up walls, like hidden pipes for example, and the list goes on and on. <br>  All I can say, "Soup to Nuts, This is the Book to Get" You could spend a year pondering all of the considerations they give you. Well done, definitely five stars.</span>

                    <span>Before I purchased this book, I read the other reviews and I am so glad I did!  I have purchased loads of books, magazines...anything "kitchen" and found this to be the most informative.  Everything that isn't covered in the others IS covered in this.  This is the only book you need, if you just want to look at ideas, or if you really want to KNOW what you need actually need to know.  All I can say is...you need this book if you want to be informed about a new kitchen!!!!!</span>

                    <span>We are working on our 2nd kitchen remodel and found this book just too basic which means it might be right as a basic book for a first timer.  Just a few kitchens were used to illustrate principles and I would have liked to see a larger portfolio represented.  "Great Kitchens, At Home with America's Top Chefs" had the ideas that I was looking for.</span>
