                <span id="Label1">Communication coach Tony Jeary estimates that we make one hundred presentations every day. He tells readers, "Whether you are talking to a soccer coach or potential client, the way you present your thoughts and ideas to people have a profound effect on the shape of your life." Jeary paves the road to friendly persuasion with theory and practice in <I>Life is a Series of Presentations</I>.  <p>  Drawing upon established research in the psychology of influence and neuro-linguistic programming, he guides readers to define their "presentation universe" by using a "3 Dimension" (what-why-how) outline. Although Jeary introduces eight general practices of successful presenters, he shines in describing the practical nuances of presentations including how to: do homework to understand an audience, cut tensions that interfere with rapport, give an audience breathing space, handle hecklers, wrestle stage fright to the ground, and build a presentation arsenal of anecdotes. <p>  A call to self-awareness adds depth to his strategies. For example, one insightful chapter lists eight inhibitors (such as perfectionism, desire to please, aloofness, and good student syndrome) that sabotage presentations. Another section focuses on the anatomy of how to say "thank-you"--and what it communicates about a speaker&#146;s self regard. At times, the chapters suffer from too many theories backing up Jeary&#146;s smart suggestions. But this is an insightful book on how to change someone&#146;s mind. <I>--Barbara Mackoff</I></span>

                    <span>The book jacket bills author Tony Jeary as "coach to America's top CEOs." It doesn't identify them, but the author clearly has a certain bold presentational style, and stressing his identity as a expert coach could be both a strategic and an educational tactic. The book's content is evergreen, a mixture of hortatory slogans and amusing anecdotes, all designed to make you a better presenter - whether your audience is one listener or an auditorium full of people. The author's advice is, for the most part, solid, detailed, practical and conservative. Don't be too put off by a few dated examples (Bill Clinton and Gary Condit) and if you're pressed for time just read the handy lists of "very important points" that close each chapter. We assure you that you can't waste time reading this book. It's that useful. </span>

                    <span>I heard Tony Jeary speak in person in Eatontown NJ on 3/25/04 and bought his book at the seminar. The insights into making presentations to groups of any size that he provides in this book are incredible and very relevant to anyone who wishes to communicate more effectively. Through the school of hard knocks, he has truly mastered the art and science of making quality presentations.  <p>This book reveals his common sense secrets. If you are serious about planning meetings and presentations that get real results (not snores or rolling eyeballs), this is the book for you. I am planning a new presentation using his 3D outline and find it extremely helpful and useful. His writing style is both engaging and informative. An absolute must read.</span>

                    <span>As Tony Jeary points out in this point we can make a profound impact on others, or not, based on the way we present ourselves to them.  The book is enlightening in that it really does increase your awareness of dozens of opportunities we face each day to present our ideas, opinions, and thoughts.<p>The book is based on his research and provides very practical (not just theoritical) ways to better communicate a message and make sure this message reaches people with the desired effect.  Of particular value has been the ideas and techniques he writes about for dealing with the anxiety many feel prior to making a presentation.</span>
