                <span id="Label1">Hollywood Remains to Be Seen is a fascinating, gossipy guide to the fourteen most significant Hollywood-era cemeteries and the final resting places of the movie stars who are buried in them.  Arranged as an easy-to-follow tours of the properties, the fourteen chapters-one for each cemetery-include histories of the cemeteries, directions for finding them, and a detailed listing of exactly where more than three hundred stars, and a detailed listing of exactly where more than three hundred stars are buried.  <P>Strange as it may seem, cemeteries are becoming one of the most popular destinations for tourists to Hollywood and for film fans who want to pay their respects to the rich and famous and passed-on.  Every year, millions of people from all over the world visit the graves of the legendary film stars buried in Hollywood, and the interest in these places grows from year to year.  <P>Hollywood Remains to Be Seen highlights the legend and lore of celebrity graves, from Rudolph Valentino's mysterious &#34;Lady In Black&#34; to the regular delivery  of one red rose to Marilyn Monroe's grave, to the strange journeys made by the body of John Barry more immediately after his death in 1942- and again thirty-eight years later.  Also included are information and images of Hollywood's most lavish and majestic graves, from the huge mausoleum of Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., complete with Roman pillars and giant reflecting pool; to Liberace's flamboyant tomb, with a musical score set on white marble; to the spectacular domed monument of Al Jolson, featuring a life-sized statue of the entertainer atop a 120-foot cascadin waterfall.  <P>Heavily illustrated with nearly one hundred photographs, Hollywood Remains to Be Seen includes photographs of the celebrities as well as photographs of the cemeteries, mausoleums, and graves, maps of the burial grounds and gravesites, and a final section fitly titled &#34;Exit Lines&#34; made up of celebrities' last words.</span>

                    <span>Besides being very well-written and witty, this book is one of the best-researched "graving guides" I have seen on the market. I believe this is because Masek lives in the area, and is a regular visitor to these sites. Many other books have been written by people who either don't know the subject matter personally, or who have relied heavily on other, usually erroenous, sources. These mistakes are repeated over and over in guide after guide, but not in this one. Masek has clearly done all the leg work himself, and it shows.<P>Besides giving directions, the book also contains some very witty anecdotes about the people and the places they are buried. Although a bit large to sneak into the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn, this book really needs to be at your side for any excursion out there into the increasingly-popular world of celebrity grave-hunting.</span>

                    <span>I concur with the two previous reader reviews. This is an extremely well written book that is virtually impossible to put down. It provides the novice as well as the professional celebrity grave hunter with juicy little tidbits regarding their favorite dead celebs. It also provides accurate information regarding grave locations and precise directions as to how to find each one. Oddly enough, no other book on this subject has managed to do that.<BR>The author also includes background information about each burial ground. I found that not only interesting, but in one specific case actually humorous. <BR>I didn't want the book to end. I definitely will buy subsequent books by this author. In fact, I ended up buying three copies of this book as xmas gifts and the recipients enjoyed this book as much as I did.</span>

                    <span>If you are interested in exploring and visiting celebrity graves, this is a great resource. The information provided for each celebrity will give even the youngest graver in your group an idea of who the celebrity was. <BR>This would also be an excellent guide for those of you who are not residents to the area. Visitors to Los Angeles will find this book to be helpful because it breaks down each cemetery into managable sections for touring. <BR>Buy this book!</span>

                    <span>Just in time for Halloween comes Mr. Masek's exhaustive tome on celebrity resting places. His crisp style brought ME back to life, and it's clear to see that the topic holds more than a passing interest to him. I learned much more than I expected in plowing through the near-500 pages, and I can only hope to see the author on TV soon. I don't know what he plans to do for an encore, but I'll be buying it!</span>
