                    <span>Use Amazon.com's "look inside this book" feature to view the back cover of Backcountry Bear Basics, and you'll see that Steve French, Director of Research for the Yellowstone Grizzly Foundation, says Backcountry Bear Basics is "the number one book I'd recommend to anyone going into bear country." Alaska Department of Fish & Game biologist Larry Aumiller, manager of the McNeil River State Sanctuary for Brown Bears, writes that Backcountry Bear Basics is "entertaining and accurate."
<br />
<br />I'm not aware of any other bear safety book, including Ph.D. biologist Stephen Herrero's Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance, that features endorsements from genuine bear experts.
<br />
<br />"Living in Harmony With Bears," a publication by the Alaska Office of the National Audubon Society, includes a Suggested Reading list that mentions both Backcountry Bear Basics and Herrero's Bear Attacks. (http://www.audubon/org/chapter/ak/ak/m2item3.html) Biologist Derek Stonorov wrote Living in Harmony With Bears. John Schoen, Senior Scientist for Alaska Audubon, is listed as a contributor. Living In Harmony With Bears says Herrero's Bear Attacks is "a classic by the world's foremost expert on bear-human interactions," but Backcountry Bear Basics is "the number one recommendation for anyone going into the field with bears."
<br />
<br />I found Backcountry Bear Basics to be accurate, practical, and fun to read.</span>

                    <span>Dave Smith is an excellent writer!  His style of writing is educational, yet entertaining.  He is down to earth, yet takes his research quite seriously.  He does an excellent job of discussing issues that a number of guides stress or disagree with, such as noise making, bear cans, menstration and camping, and bear spray.  His discussion on biology and evolution of the grizzly and black bear is for the individual who wants to gain an understanding of bears, yet does not want to know the technical facts that only a specialist would want to know.  
<br />
<br />An excellent read for those who are interested in learning about bears, their behavior, and how to minimize and avoid attacks.  Short, sweet, and entertaining!</span>

                    <span>I reckon I won't be encountering any bears in my neck of the city anytime soon, but I thought I give this book a read anyway.  Well-written, concise and informatives, this book seems to give you all that you need to know.  It debunks certain myths such as bears being attracted to menustrating females and the usefulness of climbing a tree (if you can make it there) to avoid an irrate bear.  So if you are heading out into bear country and are not an experienced hiker, reading this book would be a good idea.</span>

                    <span>Under the heading "Feminine Hygiene and Bears," Glacier National Park's current website claims, "although evidence is inconclusive, sexual actitivity or a woman's menstrual period may attract bears." Women who are concerned about warnings like this should read Backcountry Bear Basics. Instead of repeating or embellishing Glacier Park's menstrual warning (as far too many writers have done over the years), Smith reviewed the evidence and found it wanting. He devotes eleven meticulously documented pages of Backcountry Bear Basics to the menstrual myth. After a graduate student did a study on polar bears and menstrual odors in 1980, the superintendent of Glacier wrote a memo that said the results of the study "were inconclusive and the applicability of the thesis to Glacier's grizzly and black bears is questionable." So why does Glacier continue to post menstrual warnings? Smith says park officials are "in a quandry. Because of 'liability implications,' NPS officials felt they had to warn park visitors that it might be dangerous for menstruating women to travel in bear country. At the same time, the NPS had to tell employees that it was safe for menstruating women to work in bear country. It was clear there would be lawsuits for sexual discrimination if the NPS refused to hire women for jobs in bear country." Whether the topic is menstruation, food storage, or pepper spray, Dave Smith really did his homework. You get practical advice in this book that you won't find anywhere else.</span>

                    <span>This daring book challenges conventional wisdom about bears, it's well-documented, it provides safety tips you won't find anywhere else, and it's written with style. Reading Bear Basics is like sitting around the campfire and chatting about bears with a witty outdoorsman who has years of first hand experience with bears, and an encyclopedic knowledge of bear literature.<p>You casually mention that bears eat anything and everything; John Muir wrote that to bears, everything is food except granite. "John Muir was wrong," says author Dave Smith. "When it comes to natural foods, bears are rather finicky. Out of 1,000 types of plants in a given area, they might only consume 100-250, and each of those will be eaten during a particular season." To reduce the risk of encounting a bear, Smith suggests contacting land management agencies before you take a hike: "Resource management experts can often predict when and where to expect bear because the bruins are so keyed in on seasonal food sources."<p>X-C skiers generally don't give much thought to bears during the winter, but Smith says, "When I worked as a winterkeeper in Yellowstone, I often saw my first grizzly tracks in March. During the unusually mild winter of 1995-96, winterkeeper Steve Fuller saw grizzly tracks in February. No matter where you're going, you should be aware of bear hibernation patterns.<p>You ask if bears have good vison or poor vision, and Smith replies, "A 1937 report from Europe noted that brown bears in a zoo could see people at 120 yards, and recognize their handler at 60 yards." He then relates an anecdote by a bear researcher in Colorado who was spotted by a black bear from a distance of 800 yards. He closes by noting that Yellowstone Grizzly Foundation research director Steve French has an "excellent rule of thumb regarding the vison of bears: if you can see a bear, you should assume the bear can see you."<p>Backcountry Bear Basics is filled with useful information like this. Now if I see a grizzly 150 yards away, I'll assume the bear can see me and I won't move around unless the bear is preoccupied. Although many books discuss bear vision and other topics that are covered in Bear Basics, Smith consistently gives the most thoughtful, pratical information on each subject. In addition, he debunks a lot of myths about bears. This is the ultimate book on bears and bear safety.</span>
