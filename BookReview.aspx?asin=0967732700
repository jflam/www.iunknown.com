                    <span>I recently received this book to help me get an idea for planning my possible next summer trip to Denali.  This Book i great.  The first 38 pages have to deal with a lot of helpful information on shuttle buses in the park along with ways to get to the park if you fly into ancorage or fairbanks.  They also deal with photography and places to spot wildlife.  These pages also have a lot of helpful information that you could use to help plan your trip.  The rest of the book deals with 35 dayhikes and 10 backpacking journeys in the park.  I have only skimmed through some of the hikes and they are very helpful in giving you ideas of where to go in this huge trailless wilderness.  All and all this book is going to save me a ton of time by in phonecalls to the park to get info and it will save time once you are in the park to figure out with the rangers of where to hike.  In my opinion if you are planning on going to Denali to hike i would strongly reccomend this book in fact i feel it is a must have book.<br>Now i have the proper materials to go to Denali i hope my dreams become reality next summer.</span>

                    <span>This is the book the Park Service doesn't want you to read.  It has all the secret trails in Denali National Park complete with detailed maps.  I really enjoyed the geological facts and history to better help you understand why Denali is so unique and so beautiful.  The author also has a nice website.
