                    <span>Gail Kislevitz has put together a stellar collection of first marathon stories. I've read other "running stories" books, but "First Marathons" blows them all away. Some stories are moving, others are laugh-out-loud funny, but they're all inspiring in their own unique way. I haven't run a marathon (yet), but every runner can identify with the thoughts and emotions these runners convey in their first marathons attempts. If you run, or have any interest in the sport of running, please read this book. You'll be so glad you did!</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating running a marathon, or even a 10k. If you are out of shape and want to get back into shape, running is a great way to do it. It's not rocket science, just put one foot in front of the other (for miles on end). As someone who fell off the health wagon and is now getting back on, this book is a great motivator. The stories will make you laugh, cry, and you won't be able to put the book down. Read it - you will put on a pair of running shoes after reading it.</span>

                    <span>Interesting book for the first time reader. Not something that you will pick up and read over and over. As you get through several stories they actually get a little monotonous but it is still an interesting read. If you don't have to spend the money and can get it at the library, I would recommend that first.<BR>Also, the dates of some of these runners stories are quite aged. Much of the book is like a history lesson where marathon running has come from over the past 70 years. Again interesting, but didn't do much for me.</span>

                    <span>I can only read one story every few days or else I start entertaining thoughts of running a marathon! Read one story at night before bed and you're sure to get up and run in the morning. It reminds you of all the good things about running- clearing your head, planning your day, getting away. It temps you with the pride and success you feel when you've accomplished something great- a marathon a hill or a problem in life.</span>

                    <span>The different stories show how common people took up running. There is wide range of marathon finishers and therefore it is easy to find somebody in the book you can relate too. <BR>What this book does best is inspire those who contemplate running a marathon. I took up running a few months ago, slowly building up my mileage. The incredible stories in the book show me that indeed it is possible to run 26.2 miles, or even more for ultramarathons. At one point it becomes a matter of mind over matter. Beyong running, this book is about the incredible abilities that lie within each one of us if we give ourselves the right training and believe we can achieve what we've decided to do.</span>
