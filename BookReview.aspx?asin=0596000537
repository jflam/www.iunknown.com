                <span id="Label1">XML is an elegant and straightforward way to define data-centric documents to feed almost any kind of data processing or rendering system. The linchpin of many XML solutions, however, is XSLT. This standard provides a way to transform your XML documents into other XML formats, HTML, and almost any other format you wish. <I>XSLT</I> is an excellent tutorial on this critical technology, a must-have text for developers getting serious with XML.<p>  This book is targeted at busy developers who want to learn standards-compliant skills with XSLT and learn them fast. The author uses the Apache Xalan XSLT engine for demonstration, but the material in the book is equally applicable to the XSLT engine in Microsoft's MSMXL parser, Saxon, and many other equivalent XSLT processors. <p>  The material is presented logically from the transformation of a simple "Hello World!" XML file to an HTML document onto XPath locations, branching, linking, combining XML documents, and extension functions. After laying the groundwork for what XSLT can do, the author presents a fairly sophisticated case study--an online tutorial generator that generates HTML files, PDF files, and Zip files. <p>  Aside from being a subject tutorial, <I>XSLT</I> is also an excellent reference that comes in handy for daily coding. The appendices cover XSLT, XPath, a function reference, and a frequently asked questions section. These reference sections include complete examples that make each concept quite clear. XSLT provides the horsepower behind XML, and this book provides the perfect vehicle to master transformation techniques. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Basic style sheet structure, XPath data model, branching and control elements, links and cross-references, sorting and grouping, combining XML documents, XSLT extension functions, case study, XSLT reference, XPath reference, function reference, XSLT guide (FAQ).</span>

                    <span>This is in my opinion is a good book on XSLT. It teaches the basics and then some advanced stuff as well. I especially liked the XSLT reference (the latter half of<BR>the book) with examples of how to use the XSLT features, functions etc.<P>I picked it up because i'm preparing for the IBM xml exam and this is listed as a reference in the IBM web site.<P>The only complaint i have is that the book lists the entire code and they run for pages! :-(. I find it to be very distracting.<P>It was better to just show a few code snippets to highlight a partcular point and the reader c'd anyway use the code listing available in downloadable format in the oreilly web site.<P>Hope the author will cover more meaty stuff in the 2nd edition probably and avoid such big code listings.<P>I read the freely downloadable chapters of "XSLT quickly" by Bob Ducharme and found it to be excellent.<BR>Unfortunately that book is'nt available here in India!<P>I would recommend that book over this one for people looking for a good introduction to XSLT. It's so crisp! and has been written for people who have been programming before.<P>Also check out XSLT and XPATh on edge..by Jeni tennison. wow i liked it. It assumes knowledge of XSLT though (ateast the basics) and deals with various practical usage of XSLT. <P>I have read 3 chapters as of now and found it to be very well written and useful.<P>If you are a java programmer looking to XSLT, i would recommend the following:<P>XSLT Quickly<BR>XSLT and XPath on the edge <BR>Java and XSLT</span>

                    <span>Although Tidwell emphasizes a real-world approach to tackling XSLT and includes plenty of practical examples in the book, he doesn't skimp when it comes to delivering the types of conceptual explanations (sections like "How a Stylesheet is processed" in Chpt 2 and "The XPath View of an XML Document" in Chpt. 3) that help readers understand what's going on "under the hood". Including a separate chapter covering the basics of XPath early in the book also makes for much easier reading, since we aren't left scrounging for scraps of information scattered throughout the text when XPath-related questions arise. If not for the fact that some authors have actually taken the opposite approach (introducing XPath concepts as they arise in the context of a discussion of XSLT), this would have <BR>seemed like a no-brainer.<P>No review of this book would be complete without mentioning the value added by the appendices. Once you've digested all of the material in the body of the text, you'll likely continue to keep Tidwell's book close at hand because of Appendices A and C. Appendix A, the XSLT Reference, features a comprehensive dictionary-style reference for every element in XSLT 1.0 - including an XML source document, an example stylesheet that makes use of the element, and the result of the transformation for each. Appendix C, the XSLT and XPath Function Reference, follows a similar format.</span>

                    <span>As a cookbook, it doesn't tell you nearly enough about the nitty-gritty of the functions it documents. On the other hand, it's too disorganized to be a good introduction -- it doesn't lead the reader through the need-concept-implementation loop. The first couple chapters were OK, but I found that every time I tried something using the book, there was an essential piece of information missing. The XSLT reference section was actually less informative than the online XSLT site documentation(!), and the chapters seemed to restate the same information in a different order. I was reduced to trial and error in order to find out how functions actually behaved. Who needs to spend $40 on a book just to wind up browsing the online API doc and experimenting?</span>

                    <span>This book suffers from the big honking example problem. The authors clearly understand the subject but choose to not show each idea in a small code snippet (one that is usable) but wait until the end of the chapter (or book) and show everything. It would have been more useful to show each xml and xslt template snippet for each topic (such as how to use named templates with the call-template bit) or even how to do a for-each loop. In the end, searching for the language construct in the big honking example became to frustrating and complex, I have switched to a different book.</span>
