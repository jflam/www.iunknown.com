                    <span>We used our copy of this book to plan our main drives around both parks. Except for a very few instances the scenes were exactly as described and exactly where they were supposed to be. The wildlife viewing recommendations for the most part were spot on. We recommend this a an invaluable resource for those planning to drive most of the roads and entrances to both parks. We lent our well beaten copy to other couples since our return and both couples raved about how useful this book was to their planning and daily events.</span>

                    <span>...just returned from driving trip to yellowstone/tetons/jackson hole....having bought 5 different guide books from Amazon.com to insure a trip that covered everything and missed nothing... I feel it is important to let potential driving travelers to yellowstone know how valuable this book is.  Of all the books I purchased, this is the only book I used as we traveled the park by car. I used it daily as we went from one location to the next.  I kept saying to myself as we toured the park using this book, that I wanted to thank the author and let the public know how valuable this book was.  In fact. I saw this book for sale in the national park visitor centers.  Get yours before you arrive to ensure a knowlegeable trip.  Thanks, susan,</span>

                    <span>Butler's way of writing reminds me of my grandmother and our trip to Yellowstone. While reading her travel guide, I revisited the cold-sweat panic of sitting in the front seat of a car driven by my grandmother.</span>

                    <span>Extremely Detailed, to detailed for me.  It had a lot of reading and did not get down to the point on where, what and when.  If your looking for lots of detail and history of everything about the park this book is for you.  If your like me and time is limited you may want to look for a different book.  But if you got all the time in the world or you want to know it all this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>This is the best "guide" book I have ever bought.  We saw so much thanks to the wonderful mile by mile tours and hikes.  It is a must for the Grand Teton's and Yellowstone.  I usually review books from the library, but this was well worth purchasing!</span>
