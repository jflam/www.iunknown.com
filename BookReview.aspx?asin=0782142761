                    <span>The exams on the accompanying CD are crap.
<br />The engine is buggy (sometime you cannot see the whole text) and answers are wrong. E.g.
<br />Q: "Which access modifier will allow access only within the class and package?" 
<br />A: "friendly"
<br />
<br />Maybe friendly, but definitely wrong.

<br />I used this book as my primary study guide for the Programmer Exam and it definitely helped me passing with high score. 
<br />
<br />This book is just right for this exam and covers all the objectives very well. I would certainly recommend anybody who is planning to prepare for the exam to read this book. Even experienced Java Developers can gain much of the knowledge of Java Language Fundamentals by reading this book. 
<br />
<br />However, based on my experience with the exam questions, I believe, this book is somewhat light on topics like Garbage Collection and Collections. If you aim to pass with high scores, you need to put more stress on these two topics and hence need to supplement this book with additional resources/tutorials freely available on the Internet. Otherwise, this is just right for the exam.

                    <span>Obviously no one made a CURSORY proof-reading of this edition, or they would have seen dozens of double-quotes in the examples appear as some odd character I have never seen before. Once I figured it out I could decode what was meant, but it was a distracting nuisance. Obviously no one made a DETAILED proof-reading of this edition, or they would have seen us taught the size in bits of a double as 16 instead of 64. Obviously no one made a PROGRAMMING proof-reading of this edition, or they would have seen 65 listed as the byte-code of a lower-case 'a' in one of the exam samples, which made me choose "none of the above". Because of the errors which I DID see, I had little confidence in anything else that seemed questionable.
<br /> 
<br /> The chapter on Collections (which was probably added in this edition as it is new in 1.4 I believe) was not detailed enough, and didn't satisfactorily answer the chapter's own review questions.
<br /> 
<br /> The sample exams were not anything like the real one, which I failed. I kissed that $150 goodbye.</span>

                    <span>This book will get the job done if you're using it to pass the SCJP exam. However, it is not at all helpful when it comes to the SCJD assignment. The book gets way too advanced when it comes to the SCJD part. It glosses over topics like distributed event notification, and creating a thread pooling mechanism. These things are not necessary for the exam at all and the book's explanations are way too generalized to help you understand them anyway. I found the book's style to be too formal and much less readable than the book by Kathy Sierra. If you're just taking the SCJP test, this book will work for you. But, if you're going for the SCJD, I recommend "The Sun Certified Java Developer Exam With J2SE 1.4." This latter book goes into way more detail and is much more helpful for SCJD.</span>
