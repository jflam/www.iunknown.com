                    <span>In this book, a thirteen-year-old girl named Kate must team up with a mischievous boy named Jody and an indian girl, Laioni, in order to save two worlds, past and present, and to save Kate's Aunt Melanie from loggers. Meanwhile, Kate also has to get out of the past and into the present time. Boy is she in trouble!<br> I like how in the book the author is able to make a lot of special creatures, but still give them human-like flaws and charecteristics. I also like the overall plot and how Kate deals with all of the decisions she has to make. This book would be a great one to have!</span>

                    <span>T.A. Barron expanded his fantasy writing career after the critically acclaimed "Heartlight," with the follow-up novel "The Ancient One." His intense love of nature is melded together with modern concerns, time travel, legends and myths, and a cast of quirky supporting characters. <p>Kate is spending time with her Great-Aunt Melanie in the dying Oregon logging town of Blade. The people there are angry and afraid for their about-to-be-ditched jobs, and are threatening something Melanie is struggling to protect. Recently a giant volcanic crater was found to harbor a strange, "lost" land where the Halami Indians once dwelled. It's a mysterious, dangerous and beautiful place: There's a lake with a strange living island, a cursed spring that mesmerizes anyone who sees it -- and giant redwood trees that could keep the loggers employed for a year or two more.<p>When some of the loggers try to cut down the redwoods, Kate and Melanie set out to stop them. But when Kate takes Melanie's walking stick, she finds herself and logger's grandson Jody transported five hundred years into the past. After getting the help of a Halami girl, Kate struggles to find a way back to her own time. But to master the staff that took her back in time, she will have to battle the evil Gashra, an evil volcanic creature that threatens to destroy them all.<p>Showing concern for the natural world is nothing new in fantasy; it dates back to the Ents of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. And it's pretty clear that Barron loves nature. At times "Ancient One" borders on preaching, but always manages to veer back; even the loggers aren't evil, just desperate and misguided. His story's simplicity and lack of twists would be a downside in most books, but it fails to slow down the pace or lose reader interest.  His enthusiasm is what keeps "Ancient One" moving forward and interesting, along with his unusual fantasy creations. <p>His lush descriptions of Oregon wildlife (both past and present) are loaded with detail, giving a you-are-there feel to it. Barron's writing is detailed all the time, and he's at his peak when he describes the natural surroundings. A comic vibe is added with the owl-like Tinnanis, especially their delicacy-addicted king (who is promised ten thousand peppermint drops by Kate). The scene where Kate confronts Gashra is rather too short, but is quite vivid nevertheless.<p>Kate is stronger in this outing than in "Heartlight." Here she is more in control, more sure of herself, and less dependent on others; she's a heroine that boys and girls alike can relate to. Laioni is a bit flatter, but a good sidekick. Jody and Kandeldandel are both outstanding, a hardened logger boy and a flittery Tinnani.<p>Nature-lovers unite under "The Ancient One." T.A. Barron's love of nature elevates what might have been an ordinary fantasy tale into a beautiful, beautiful thing. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Not much of a fantasy reader, but, I remember reading this book back when it's first printing came out.  I was in 6th grade, that was...10+ years ago!?!?!  I LOVED this book, and read it twice, cover to cover, before passing it on to my friends.  I'm happy to see it back!  I look foreward to reading it over again, and then sharing with others!  Highly reccomended as abstract teaching for any environmental curriculun involving the teachings of logging practices .vs. Old Growth Forests.  Better for younger audiences, but and adult who hasn't lost their youth or spirit for adventure would enjoy as well!</span>

                    <span>A fairly simple story with all your basic plot needs.  I feel that certain elements of the book (such as how Kate and her Aunt Melonie feel about nature) were overdone.  The sense of all things in life 'connected' with each other was repeated several times, without too much syntax variation.  The "big bad villian meanie" was described almost as well as I just did.<p>And I didn't really like the way it ended, but I won't give it away.  It just seemed somewhat anticlimatic.<p>Anyway, there's nothing seriously /wrong/ with this book, it just didn't appeal to me.</span>
