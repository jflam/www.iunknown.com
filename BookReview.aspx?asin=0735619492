                    <span>I've just read many of these review and can side with only a few of them. People who read this book to learn C# will be disapointed. Also people who read this book for a manifesto on XP/agile will be upset. But, if you read this book, looking for insight into a programmer's mind and how to develop good code and recover from unexpected (often self inflicted) problems, then this book is for you. I know C# pretty well, and I had the pleasure of reading David West's book before Ron's, but I must say that I think Ron did an excellent job. Proving his point -- that simple design, test driven development, and plenty of refactoring without expensive and time consuming up-front planning will work and work well. I learned alot. The only reason I gave it a 4, as opposed to a 5 -- and I would have loved to give it a 4.5, was because I thought there were a couple of chapters that could have been thorough, plus the author would sometimes go off and do some things and then clue you in by and oblique reference or say, "I was testing this yesterday yada yada". I would have liked to know up front what was done since the rest of the book was like a project diary. In all fairness, I suspect Ron left it out because it didn't add much value, but I want the whole picture when I'm involved in something. He could have provided a small sidebar that essentially said..."while you were out" and explained anything that had to do with the project that wasn't in the text. This would have been helpful. I would also have liked to see actual work times documented. In other words, how much time did it take to get story one done complete with Programmer Tests and Customer Tests, etc. It would be great if he chose to be more granular than that -- like how much time coding, testing, and planning, but that might be too much of a burden.<BR> I'd highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>It's a pleasure to watch a master at work. It's human nature to enjoy identifying with experts, whether you're picking up tips or just validating your own experiences. If you're a golfer, you probably love to watch golf on TV. If you (as I do) build furniture in your spare time, you'd love Fine Woodworking magazine. And if you are (as I am) a developer using the Extreme Programming methodology, you'll love this book.<P>In "Extreme Programming Adventures in C#", XP guru Ron Jeffries lets you pull up a chair next to him as he takes a small programming project from concept to delivery. Along the way, Ron learns the C# language, pair programs with several partners, makes mistakes, hurts his arm, and writes clean, well-factored code. In short, he acts like a real programmer with a real life that you'll be able to identify with easily. You'll see Test-Driven Design in practice, and watch as a complete customer-test tool is developed as an organic part of the project.<P>The most amazing thing about this book is that Ron checks his ego at the door. He doesn't try to hide his mistakes, but instead celebrates them as learning opportunities. The review at the end of each chapter examines what went wrong and what went right. This book validated many of my own experiences in using the XP methodology. If you're interested in how XP and TDD work in the real world, buy it now.</span>

                    <span>I want to start out by first saying that the topic is wonderful. <P>Since I'm not currently working I thought I would actually put the code in and really learn these new techniques. To my dismay, the code is riddled with problems. So don't expect the code to work. <P>I've made it to chapter 7 and I'm extremely frustrated. I end up having to flip through the book to find other references to a method to see if it might help solve the compilation problems. This would all be fine, but the author has stated that he expected readers to put the code in as we went. That's why he didn't provide the final files. <P>Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:<P>1. page 31: image It's showing a menu. No menu has been created.<P>2. page 44: XMLKeyDownHandler method. Refers to textbox. It should be txtbox. (occurs 4 times)<P>3. page 45: First line of code. It's wrong. It is right in Chapter 5 but it doesn't work here.<P>4. page 46: same as #2.<P>5. page 63: Code won't compile. InsertControlPText is crashing. I decide just to comment it out.<P>6. page 63: Code won't compile. Problem in NewSelectionStart. I decided to move on because I see it's getting reworked later.<P>7. page 67: current code sample.<BR> a. InsertControlPText has appeared but with no code.<BR> b. LineContainingCursor has changes that were never talked about.<BR> c. Appearance of Enter() method (find out why in Ch. 6)<BR> d. Appearance of TestText method (what is it?)<BR> e. Appearance of TestLineContainingCursorDirectly method<P>8. At the end of chapter 5 I still have two NUnit tests that are failing and I'm not exactly sure if they should be failing or not.<P>What I am very surpised about is that Microsoft would publish a book with so many mistakes in it. I'm also surprised they would allow references and links to restaurants (see page 76).<P>The theory is wonderful. I will finish the book but I'm going to stop trying to type in the code. It's just taking to long to work through the bugs in the book.</span>

                    <span>Ron Jeffries often provides the line "I'm giving the best advice I have. <BR>You get to decide if it's true for you." as a signature for his many newsgroup posts.<P>And the same is true for this book. Ron is giving you the very best advice he can based<BR>on his experience as a both a programmer and advocate of XP.<P>I would describe this book as "quietly looking over Ron's shoulder" and is about as close<BR>to getting inside Ron's head as you're probably going to get without actually working along<BR>side him.<P>I did not find this to be a specific "learn C#" book and I suspect that if that is what you <BR>are wanting that you may be disappointed. If your are new to C# you may need a C# reference <BR>book or two close at hand. I did find it to be a good book illustrating "how to learn C#", <BR>or in fact how to approach learning any new language.<P>I actually work in Java and so applied the principles to a Java application instead.<P>Another thing I liked about this book is that Ron makes mistakes! And he left them in print!<BR>And although he may come to regret that later :-) it is of tremendous value to the reader. <BR>All too often programming books show code going from A to B to C and the reader is left to <BR>guess what lead the author to take the direction that they did. With this book you get to <BR>closely follow Ron's thought processes and see the results. You sometimes see the results <BR>refactored, and sometimes refactored again. But you are never at a loss to wonder "why he <BR>did that" or "how did we just get to here from there".<P>One of the key techniques used in XP is Test Driven Design and of the examples used in books<BR>so far I have found it somewhat difficult to get a feel for how the practitioner applied their<BR>"design sense". In most cases this is because the book is focussing on the technique alone.<P>What I really got out of this book was how Ron uses his sense of design coupled with the <BR>techniques of XP (as they applied to this development situation). A great read!</span>

                    <span>If you want to learn C#, don't buy this book. If you want to become a better programmer, this book can probably be of considerable help to you. This book is about Extreme Programming. The only way it can be really shown how XP works is of course in practice. In my opinion Ron Jeffries has succeeded in coming very close to letting the reader be an observer of a real XP project. You get a good feeling for how things should be done, what to avoid, etc. We know some of those things already, of course, because there's no black magic involved, but Jeffreys at the very least makes us more conscious of them. After having read this book, I've become convinced that all those people who are shouting on top of their lungs that XP is just a fancy name for something very shallow, are probably wrong and that they should at least give it a serious try before condemning it.</span>
