                <span id="Label1">"Zen enriches no one," Thomas Merton provocatively writes in his opening statement to <I>Zen and the Birds of Appetite</I>--one of the last books to be published before his death in 1968. "There is no body to be found. The birds may come and circle for a while... but they soon go elsewhere. When they are gone, the 'nothing,' the 'no-body' that was there, suddenly appears. That is Zen. It was there all the time but the scavengers missed it, because it was not their kind of prey." This gets at the humor, paradox, and joy that one feels in Merton's discoveries of Zen during the last years of his life, a joy very much present in this collection of essays. Exploring the relationship between Christianity and Zen, especially through his dialogue with the great Zen teacher D.T. Suzuki (included as part 2 of this volume), the book makes an excellent introduction to a comparative study of these two traditions, as well as giving the reader a strong taste of the mature Merton. Never does one feel him losing his own faith in these pages; rather one feels that faith getting deeply clarified and affirmed. Just as the body of "Zen" cannot be found by the scavengers, so too, Merton suggests, with the eternal truth of Christ. "It was there all the time but the scavengers missed it...." <I>--Doug Thorpe</I></span>

                    <span> There is something refreshing about this little book. The title will seem a bit misleading - if expecting to find an account of Zen per se - minus the Christian based reflections of the author. However, Merton is known well enough - and these essays show him at his best. The dialogue between D.T. Suzuki and Thomas Merton is fruitful. Christianity and Buddhism have often been presented as antithetical, working from bases too different - to afford dialogue. These essays challenge that perception, without falling into vague generalisations. 
<br />
<br />  If anything, recent years have seen a 'hardening of the orthodoxies' - a retreat into numbingly conservative attitudes. Happily, the essays in this book evoke a more open-ended perspective. There is something arrogant and unspiritual about the wish to deny the value of dialogue between spiritual traditions. Where the 'birds of appetite' wheel and prey, the truth has fallen from sight - be it Christian 'innocence' or the 'fundamental face' of Zen. 
<br />
<br /> We can't deny the merits of a Christian who endeavoured, with a whole heart, to take stock of what goes on in the other World religions. Similarly, we can't look badly upon a Buddhist, who was large-hearted enough to share the workings of the Christian mind and spirit. Merton's encounter with Buddhism exerted a seminal influence upon his whole life-thought. Suzuki's encounter with Christianity - chiefly, through Eckhart, exerted a similar influence (the Eckhartian equation 0=infinity -found its way into Suzuki's hand-written notes appended to the Mastsugaoka Zen Bunka ed of the Rinzai Roku). Let's hope that this new century of ours witnesses more dialogues in this vein.

                    <span>Okay I love Thomas Merton, but this is one of his slower moving works. It's good; but as a below reviewer pointed out, it's certainly not for everyone. Thomas Merton had a tremendously open mind toward eastern traditions, and in Kentucky there is actually a Thomas Merton Zen center to this day. But as for a book on Zen goes, this was probably designed more for Christians than Buddhists. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was. Probably the most worthwhile and memorable section of this book was the dialogue between Merton and D.T. Suzuki, the Japanese Zen scholar at that time. Now I never liked Suzuki's style too much for my part, being a Zen practitioner I have always found his approach simply too scholarly for my blood. His Zen was that for the academic community, which is not really good or bad. It's one of the reasons Zen Buddhism has flourished here in the United States in the years since. Here Merton shines through. It's ironic, I find he defends his view on Christianity with much more veracity than Daisetz was probably hoping to convey for his part. The two tried to make it a pretty congruent, or harmonious event, but needless to say there were misconceptions on both sides of the aisle. <p>Anyway, in terms of Merton's literature concerning Eastern thought - I am much more drawn to his, "The Way of Chuang Tzu." Much more fluent and vibrant. Zen and the Birds of Appetite, on the other hand, sets out to do some remarkable things; but I think it might actually put you to sleep. I could be wrong. After all, this is solely coming from the Zen side of the book review. There may be a plethora of Christians who truly identify with what Merton was conveying here. And similarly, there might even be a good number of Zen practitioners who feel they can relate to it as well. You know, I'm just one small voice here. I wouldn't pay too much attention to me. Because it is, nevertheless, one of those books worth having sitting up somewhere on your bookshelf. I am simply giving one take. So, I hope this review was somehow helpful for you all. I hope you enjoy the book and take something out of it.</span>

                    <span>The most important part of this book is the debate between Merton and Suzuki. Merton falls short of establishing his theories in respect to the Desert Father's similarity to Zen Masters, Suzuki brilliantly counterpoints and illustrates the differences.<p>Merton shows incredible integrity in publishing a debate he clearly loses.</span>

                    <span>Merton felt that his journals contained his best writing.  I'll offer a different opinion; I think his essays and book reviews contain much of his best writing.  "Zen and the Birds of Appetite" is a collection of essays on what's common to Zen and Christianity, and the book includes a book review and Merton's prefaces to two books by other authors.<p>He seems to write these prefaces not simply because he was asked to.  He writes them, I think, because the books really inspire him.  (Most of us write these reviews on Amazon.com for the same reason!)  His prefaces present his thinking along with the author's thinking in a way that improves the overall publication.  Comparing his thinking with another author's thinking seems to make Merton's writing even more succinct and sharply-reasoned than usual.  And in "Zen" he's comparing his faith with another faith, so his sensitivity, appreciation, and sharp mind are even more in evidence than usual.<p>These essays don't amount to a textbook on Zen or Zen Buddhism, any more than a collection of short stories adds up to a novel.  But together the essays address an overall question: what is it about Christianity that resembles Zen?  In the process of approaching the question, Merton gives us some gems.  His discussion of paradise, innocence, and knowledge is the best I've read.  You may learn more about Christianity than about Zen in this volume.  <p>His essays make up the first part of the book.  The second part of the book is a "dialogue" between Merton and Diasetz T. Suzuki, a Zen scholar quite accessable to the Western mindset.  These dialogue seems to devolve somewhat into a "point-counterpoint" duel, but that's fun and a lot of well-framed truth comes out.</span>

                    <span>Merton quotes D.T. Suzuki: "Zen always aims at grasping the central fact of life, which can never be brought to the dissecting table of the intellect";  and  "Zen must be seized with bare hands, with no gloves on."  No wonder Merton's  reverence for Zen, for these are his own ideas of Christian monasticism.  With his illuminating mind in full stride, and his interventions keen as crystal, if he went no deeper than to make an apparent synthesis, it would be enough.  But Merton strives for farther fields, finds and feeds them, and not surprisingly leaves them flourishing.  He leaps wholly into a personal embodiment of Zen and its spiritual complexities, and ends restoring his own monastic experience.  The essay 'Zen in Japanese Art' pays loving homage to the classic spirit of Daisetz Suzuki's seminal 'Zen and Japanese Culture', but lives and breathes on its own.  In its simple three and a half pages, Merton weaves the aesthetic ideas of Zen philosopher Kitaro Nishida, makes the case that Zen and Zen art are the exact opposite of Sartre's 'pessimistic nihilism,' and in a single amazing paragraph toward the end, beautifully finds in the formal "tea ceremony" a respect and harmony consistent with the simplicity of twelfth-century Cistercian architecture at Fontenay or Le Thoronet.  But no idle intellectual excursions invade here; again and again Merton draws everything back to the Christ sought in the apophatic tradition with a faithfulness that exhudes an almost excruciating surfeit of spiritual understanding.  Finding St Gregory's "No one gets so much of God as the man who is thoroughly dead"  'lying next' to Bunan Zenji's "While alive, be dead, thoroughly dead-- All is good then, whatever you may do", Merton turns a light on centuries of Christian ascetic experience with one true, bold stroke.  Birds of Appetite is strewn with page after page not of ideas only, but wisdom.  He responds to D.T. Suzuki's exquisite essay 'Innocence and Knowledge' (included in the book) with 'The Recovery of Paradise', arguing that the Desert Fathers sought the emptiness and innocence of Adam and Eve in Eden, invoking along the way John of the Cross, and making one of Dostoevsky's "saints," the Staretz Zosima, serve as antagonist throughout the essay.  Merton notes "there is a dimension where the bottom drops out of the world of factuality and of the ordinary," an observation no doubt honed in the solitude of the hermitage, up the mountain above Gethsemane Abbey.  He adds, "it might be good to open our eyes and see."  I'm recommending a huge little book, meticulously published by New Directions with its customary attentiveness to shadow and light, inside and out.  See for yourself.</span>
