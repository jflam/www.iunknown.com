                    <span>I was a bit skittish about buying this book based on some of the negative reviews. Having played around with the software but still having alot of questions, I wanted to judge for myself so I picked it up at the bookstore. If you can make it through the first section, which is basically fluff, there is some excellent content in the later parts of the book, particularily in the sections on Office use with SharePoint and SQL maintenance of the databases, which is not covered much at all in the other SharePoint books out today. My guess is that many of the other reviewers may have stopped reading after the first few chapters, and I can't really blame them. I would agree that it is better to skip them and going straight to the good stuff.</span>

                    <span>I do SharePoint administration and development and own the other five SharePoint 2003 books currently on the market. This book is useless from any perspective except perhaps as a doorstop. It just repeats the same content chapter after chapter about the features of SharePoint while offering no insight as to installing, configuring or developing. You would get more insight about SharePoint reading a product brochure or just cruising Microsoft's web site. Avoid this book!</span>

                    <span>This book is a long winded explanation of the features of SharePoint 2003.  It provides redundent how tos with little explanation of how to do anything that is not vanilla out of the box.  I suggest simply becoming familar with the Administrative Guide that Microsoft produced.  You'll be you degree closer to the source and 33 dollars richer in the pocket. </span>

                    <span>I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help.</span>

                    <span>(actual review is 2.5 stars).  Even though this book has a lot of pages, the content is pretty shallow and it suffers from an apparent desire to address to many different types of reader, from the developer to the administrator, to the technology decision maker.  The result is that the book is weak in two key areas: development and administration.  For readers who want reasonable depth in those areas, I suggest finding another source. For readers who want a broad brush, the book is a fine work.</span>
