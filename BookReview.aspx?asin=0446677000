                <span id="Label1">" What's the key to a successful company: the market for its product or the people who run it? Could you pass the elevator test-the ability to explain your company's business on a single ride between floors? Before you follow the herd, how can you make sure it's not heading for a cliff? Do you know the five things a CEO should never say to his or her board of directors? You'll find the answers to these questions-and so much more-in this first-of-its-kind, insider's look at the powerful, lucrative new world of venture capital. The woman who was an early champion of Microsoft and America Online, Ruthann Quindlen, unveils the names and faces, the deals and the dollars, and the vital role of venture capital in creating companies, jobs, and wealth for the 21st century.  <P>Where do you fit in? CONFESSIONS OF A VENTURE CAPITALIST helps you bypass the most common errors made by start-up entrepreneurs. And it provides everyone, businesspersons and casual readers alike, with an intimate, front-row understanding of how the venture capital economy and Silicon Valley are radically changing the world we all inhabit. <P>Here, behind the closed-door meetings, you'll watch the decision makers at work. You'll see what the big investors look for: how not only numbers and projections count, but passion and commitment. You'll learn from Ruthann Quindlen's real-life examples-both her rookie mistakes and her hard-won successes. If you're a woman, you'll get valuable advice on escaping the pink ghetto. All the while, Quindlen shows how high technology is creating mind-boggling new venues...and tells you where to look for them, how to get in early, how to stake out the prime territory, and how to keep on expanding.  <P>Once you recognize the opportunity and adjust accordingly, your own forays into venture capital can pay off handsomely. All you need is the right guide..."</span>

                    <span>As a General Partner at Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), Ruthann Quindlen has seen her share of entrepreneurial ventures succeed - or fall by the wayside.  In this book, she describes the world of venture capital as it relates to both the investor and entrepreneur.  Most striking are the number of topics discussed in barely over 200 pages of writing.  At 36 chapters, this book covers each subject briefly, yet thoroughly, using examples from the "real-world", rather than droll academic jargon.  Its rapid-fire structure reads easily and is useful as a quick-reference tool.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the subject-matter strongly reflects the ideology of Silicon Valley throughout the dot-com bubble - shoot first, ask questions later (profitability can wait).  Quindlen accurately identifies the Internet stock-market bubble as a fragile and possibly short-lived phenomenon.  At the edge of her writing, however, lies the familiar overly optimistic attitude that drove capital investment into startups with no hope of achieving a sustainable business.  Her examples are refreshing, yet nearly all focused on internet technologies that are hardly representative of all entrepreneurs.  Many of the lessons are still applicable and important to any fledgling company seeking venture capital investment, but others should be revisited in light of changing attitudes toward the "internet paradigm".  
<br />
<br />The book is structured well, covering 11 primary subject areas including market identification, business model creation, start-up valuation, and decision making.  Each subject area contains a handful of example-laden chapters, guaranteed to help the budding entrepreneur avoid the common mistakes of countless startups.  And if providing helpful information for investment-seeking entrepreneurs is the primary goal, examining the life and occupation of a venture capitalist is the essential secondary component.  Quindlen discusses her best and worst decisions as an investor, and provides a chapter dedicated to the role of women in the heavily male-dominated venture capital community.  
<br />
<br />Overall, the content is broad, and many examples are somewhat "touchy-feely".  Alone, Confessions of a Venture Capitalist is not useful as a standalone guide for the industry, but this is not its intent.  As a primer text, this book is ideal - budding entrepreneurs and seasoned veterans alike will find the examples both useful and enjoyable.  Alongside it, however, should sit an arsenal of reference guides focusing on business plan development, financing, and valuation.

                    <span>If you have had even a minor exposure to startups (worked in one, or a friend has worked in one, and told you several stories), this book will seem like "Obvious, duh!". There are a few interesting points, but very little in the form of enlightening/revealing anecdotes.<p>The book is funny to read after the Internet-bubble has burst. Ruthann is busy trying to say how venture capitalists are most valuable for a company's success, and how the Internet is going to transform everything and how the "new economy" companies need to be valued, etc. <p>You are allowed to spend only half an hour on this book. :-)</span>

                    <span>Well, another reveiwer here wrote exactly what I felt reading this book. But this book is so bad I wanted to write a review myself. First of all, the stuff mentioned here is hadly any confessions, they are confused jargon written by a confused person wanting to make some money by cashing on the buzz created by the tech boom and VC world. Second, the book shows us nothing about the high-stakes world of start-up financing, you wont understand how VCs value companies or how they try and build companies. IVP is an old firm and a respected one, reading that the author is from that firm you might get carried away into believing that she knows a lot about the VC world. Nothing! a much better choice to spend your hard earned money would be "Done Deals" or "E-Boys". those books give a better account of the VC worlds.<p>You can read this book in 30 minutes and you end up learning nothing. Neither from the perspective of the VC (investor) or from the perspective of an entrepreneur. There is one hilarious chapter in the book where the author has to enquire about one of her portfolio companies progress. the only intelligent question she could come up with is "is there any momemtum is sales?" thats all. nothing more, so you dont get to understand what VC look in entrepreneurs, you dont get to understnad how VCs add value to startups, you dont get to understand how companies are valued, you dont get to understand how VC do their exits, basically, you just dont get to understand anything that the books claims to impart you. Nothing, dont spend a cent on this book.</span>

                    <span>Its surprising that the author of this book is a venture capitalist. The information in the book is very bland. Even as a primer I would hesitate to recommend it. A much better book would be e-Boys. The author seems to get lost in her personal bewilderment as to why women do not pursue top executive jobs in the corporate world. Her notion of pursuing market share regardless of profitability is misleading.<br>The only time this books sparks some interest is when she talks about microsoft.Apparently, before becoming a venture capitalist the author was a software analyst and had a number of candid interactions with Bill Gates. The author has very interesting insights in the software business. However, in the venture capitalist world she fails to shade any light with this book.<br>If you really want the true cofessions of a venture capitalist get e-Boys.</span>

                    <span>Quindlen provides good summary information about how to work with traditional venture capitalists and about what to expect from them.  It's a light, short read.  The internet bubble anecdotes are historically interesting, but not terribly useful.</span>
