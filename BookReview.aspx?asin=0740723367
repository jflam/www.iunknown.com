                <span id="Label1">It's an age-old question that has stumped the great minds of history; What is the meaning in life?  In his hilarious and uplifting style, best-selling author Bradley Trevor Greive (BTG) finally provides the answer:  Figure out what you love and do it.  Illustrated with playful photographs of animals, BTG's insightful prose again hits his target straight on.  He muses about why we're here and our greater purpose in the grand scheme of things.  His informal style provides a refreshing counterpoint to what has always been one of life's big debates.  For example, when it comes to discovering your passion, BTG writes, "First, no one else will tell you about it - it's just like walking around all day with a sign on your back that says KICK ME."  The Meaning Of Life is a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose - and wants to laugh along the way.</span>

                    <span>This book is for anyone and everyone. The author sets the readers expectations in the intro, that this book does NOT provide answers - it is a book about questions. When I picked this book up at [local store], I found myself so overjoyed I read the entire book in the store. With useful wisdom applying to all areas of life, the book does not stress an answer or religeon or method, though it agrees with the loving happiness you will find stressed in any society or religion. Nothing metaphysical - this book is simple and may have a different meaning for each reader. <BR>The most brilliant author since Aesop.</span>

                    <span>I read this book while I was searching for answers to an unfulfilling legal career and it helped to motivate me to leave a firm that I hated and open my own practice with 2 friends. You can read this book in fifteen minutes, but the ideas will stay with you. Generally, each page contains a sentence or two dealing with a progression of thought about the meaning of life and finding your calling. Each page also contains a humorous animal photograph that illustrates the point of the text on that page. In a way, a book about philosophy that is short and to the point like this one can be more useful than a lengthy, more developed presentation.</span>

                    <span>(...) Who has the nuts to give a book a title like 'The Meaning of Life' and then fill the contents with 'cute' anecdotes and fuzzy animals. Listen guy, you're a moron. You and the John Edwards' of this world need to be castrated for pushing these lies on the weakminded of the world. For all of you that rated this book 5 stars, try applying it to someone outside your insignificant universe of experience. You think a happy squirrel asking a torture victim if he's pursuing what he really loves is going to make him reach some kind of epiphany? What about all the starving children who die before they reach 10? I submit you read up on the full range of human experience next time deusche.</span>

                    <span>I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it. I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away. He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way. The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures. It did have one thought that I really liked: "Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge. If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?"</span>
