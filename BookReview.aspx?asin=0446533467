                <span id="Label1">The first true account ever published by a victim of an "honor crime," this shocking, moving, and harrowing tale has already become an international sensation.  <P>Souad was a 17-year-old girl living in a small village in Jordan when she had the misfortune of falling in love--an emotion that would lead to an unspeakable act of violence and a lifetime of exile from her homeland. With a childhood marked by hard labor and physical abuse at the hands of her father, who is humiliated by the birth of many daughters and only one son, Souad is desperate to leave home. Enticed into a relationship with a handsome neighbor, her short-lived romance leaves her pregnant. Forbidden to marry until her older sisters find husbands and having brought shame to her family, Souad faces the only acceptable punishment: death. How her family plots to kill her, her harrowing struggle to survive burns over 90% of her body after her brother-in-law douses her with gasoline and sets her on fire, her dramatic escape from Jordan, and her resolve to build a new life for herself is a tale of heartbreaking drama and remarkable courage.</span>

                    <span>I could not put this book down once I started to read it. It captured my attention from the first page. It gives you such an insight on this woman's life and the different culture and ways that these men treat their women.<BR>It shows how strong the human spirit can be and how you can overcome adversity.<BR>You sometimes live in your own little world and don't realize what goes on in other countries. It sure does open up your eyes and your heart. A must read!!</span>

                    <span>This book is not only an interesting story, it serves as an educational novel teaching people about middle-east countries and how women are treated. I think everyone should read this book at least once.</span>

                    <span>I read this in one sitting. It was extraordinary. I can't believe after reading this book a reviewer could complain the author did not provide cross-referencing and documentation. She didn't even know her birthday when she escaped. She is still in hiding, fearing for her life, and would not be at liberty to send a request for documents. She wrote a personal (not historical) account, from personal memory, and it was compelling.</span>

                    <span>Souad is a stream of horror describing the mistreatment of women in a Muslim community. Although it is highly probably that many of the events actually transpired, the story suffers from a number of faults: no specific documentation or cross referencing; little background to the actual location or sect; repetitious accounts of the frequent beatings and mistreatment; and a sub par prose that diminishes the impact. It is an important subject but is done a disservice by the compilation of vagaries and sketchiness. For a more credible account, I recommend the work of Irshad Manji.</span>

                    <span>The hardship of being a female child to a male controled family and male oriented lifestyle in the West Bank. Then her subsequent death because she was in love, made love, and then shunned by the lover. Burned alive due to the male honor status. Then a rebirth into a new world, where she learned to live, love, marry, have children. But with the terrible memories of her non-existant childhood and the scars she still has haunts her to this day. But my impression is that she is strong and is a survivor.</span>
