                <span id="Label1">An anthology of 100 lively, informative articles on all aspects of adopting from China.   <P>The voices in Passage are fresh, direct, and informed. Read original research by Kay Johnson and her Chinese colleagues--the world's top authorities on adoption and abandonment in China. Get advice from renowned physicians Dana Johnson, Jerri Ann Jenista, and others who specialize in international adoption. Enjoy personal accounts from adoptive parents about the joys of adopting and the challenges and triumphs of parenthood.  <P>The writers--adoptive parents and adoption and medical professionals from across the United States, Canada and Britain--discuss the process up close and personally, from the emotionally charged period of waiting to adopt, through the adoption journey, settling in as a new or enlarged family, specific issues of health and development in young children adopted from China, the special rewards and challenges of adopting children over the age of one and of single parenting, perspectives on adoption from China from inside and outside the adoption community, the loaded issues of culture, language, identity, and race, accounts of going back to China after adopting, and, finally, a look down the road of adoptive family life at issues that don't come up in families formed the "usual" way.  <P>A Passage to the Heart: Writings from Families with Children from China is the collaborative effort of more than two dozen chapters of FCC and similar adoptive-family support groups in three countries. Each purchase benefits both the Amity Foundation (fccny.org/oaa.asp) and the Foundation for Chinese Orphanages (thefco.org), which have been working to improve conditions in Chinese orphanages since the mid 1990s.</span>

                    <span>I bought Passage to the Heart at our annual meeting of the New England chapter of Families With Children From China (FCC) and I have been reading it cover to cover. It is wonderful and I even sent a copy to our pediatrician to help her understand possible issues with our planned second adoption. Of course, I have to read it during private time because tears come streaming down my face every time I pick it up. Strangers would wonder what was the matter with me if I read it in public! Thank you for compiling this book. It is a wonderful service to the FCC community and it will become a reference book for all of us.Perhaps when my daughter is older, she will read it and better understand her journey to make us into a forever family. Fondly, and gratefully, L. Welch.</span>

                    <span>In A Passage to the Heart, Amy Klatzkin has compiled the best writing to date about adopting children from China. It includes articles concerning all aspects of adoption, from planning for an adoption trip to dealing psychologically with your new cross-cultural family. This is an ideal gift for those considering adoption from China, for grandparents of adopted Chinese kids (who may not realize all the issues involved!) and for friends and relatives of adoptive families, and anyone else who is touched or might be touched by an adoption from China.<P>In addition, this book does not "sugarcoat" the adoption experience but deals with both the joys and sorrows that are part of adoption. Klatzkin is a brilliant editor who has grouped the articles and a few poems in appropriate subject sections so that you can read what is of most interest to you at the moment.<P>This book belongs in the reference library of every family that has adopted from China and for their friends and associates. Don't miss it.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must-have for people adopting from China. My husband and I are in the long waiting portion of the process. The chapters about waiting have been so helpful. There is so much useful information in this book from waiting to packing to the challenges of raising a child adopted from China. I feel so much more informed about what is in store for us.</span>

                    <span>In the book, A Passage to the Heart, you will find an invaluable series of articles on international adoption that tug at your heart and at times bring you to tears while the next article will provide priceless professional information and technical advice. <P>Amy Klatzkin has done a tremendous job putting together this invaluable book that provides information on the complexities of international adoption. These 100 articles provided us with a compact knowledge of adoption with feeling. While the articles are a few pages at most, once you start you cannot put the book down especially for an adoptive parent from China.<P>The book assisted us through our adoption by providing key family members (grandparents) with in depth knowledge that we could not provide just by talking about it. With two countries involved, the process of adoption can seem daunting. This book puts to rest a lot of worries and provides you with the specific words and language to talk with the various agencies and experts you will encounter in the international adoption. From paperwork (the paperchase) through post-adoption issues in raising a child this anthology is a must read for any adoptive or prospective adoptive parent or professional.<P>This book is required reading for professionals in any part of the adoption process from the medical and pediatric folks to any government's agency employees. This book will give you an insight to what people go through in adopting a child, a testament to the perserverance of people to put themselves before two governments. <P>Guys, this book empowers the knowledge side of motherhood and fatherhood in international adoption. The information, the process, the people and the experts herein will put you and your wife on the same plane of understanding calming feelings while preparing you for things to come.<P>We found this book so useful we gave gift copies to our parents and friends who wanted to know more about what we were doing.</span>
