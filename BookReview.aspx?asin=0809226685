                <span id="Label1">There is no one way to throw a baseball; for this simple reason the pitcher has one of the most intriguing positions in baseball. Short or tall, gawky or athletic, lefty or righty, hard thrower or crafty nibbler, anyone who can find a way to get batters out can be a good pitcher.  <I>The Louisville Slugger Complete Book of Pitching</I> analyzes the methods of stars such as Nolan Ryan, Greg Maddux, and Tom Seaver. In addition, this book reveals what all prospective pitchers--regardless of style or stuff--need to do in order to be successful.   Among the topics covered are:  <UL> <LI>Building proper mechanics, from stride and delivery to release point and follow-through <LI>Throwing fastballs with varying velocity and movement around the plate <LI>Moving hitters in and out and forward and back in the box with an effective change-up <LI>Responding to key game situations and defensive responsibilities <LI>Building strength and flexibility in the arm as well as the legs and torso through customized conditioning plans <LI>Scouting opposition before game day, analyzing field conditions, and being your own coach on the mound when your stuff isn't working <LI>Developing the mental game necessary to control emotions and deal with adversity </UL>  <I>The Louisville Slugger Complete Book of Pitching</I> is more than just instruction. Its unique treatment includes historical sidebars and anecdotes from players that will delight baseball fans, making it the ultimate reference for pitchers, pitching coaces, and others who enjoy the thrill and magic of fooling the hitter.   Doug Myers is the author of <I>Essential Cubs</I> and the forthcoming <I>Louisville Slugger Presents Batting Around</i>.  Mark Gola is a sportswriter who also works as the assistant coach for the Rider University baseball team.</span>

                    <span>This book is great! I bought the book yesterday and already see immediate results in my pitching fundamentals and mechanics. Any age level can use this book, from little league to the pros (but I would assume the pros would aready know all the facts in this book). This book is broken down into chapters, dealing early with the mechanics to correctly pitch, and then later on, learning about the mental part of pitching. It goes over how to pitch fastballs, curveballs and sliders, and change-ups. THE LOUISVILLE SLUGGER COMPLETE BOOK OF PITCHNG is a great buy if you're a beginner just learning the game or a veteran trying to master the art of pitching!</span>

                    <span>In many ways this book is a like a summary of many of the ideas that you can read about elsewhere. The section stressing the importance of the change-up is a classic and is worth the price of the whole book. Illustrations are superb throughout and the book is full of priceless quotations from well known pitchers and coaches.<P>However I would not say 'forget about Tom House' because House still provide the more thorough run down on pitching mechanics, and the section on pitching mechanics is the only relative weakness that this otherwise excellent book has. It is however true that this book is a better place to start than House, whose "The Pitching Edge" remains high powered advanced reading for the serious pro.<P>You cannot go far wrong by reading this book. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best I've read on the subject of pitching. Forget about Tom House--this book includes everything you need to know to become more successful on the mound: pitching mechanics, how to throw particular pitches, the mental aspects of pitching, conditioning, and more in language that is accessible for any reader. Authors Myers and Gola are thorough in their presentation of pitching as both art and science. I highly recommend the book for pitchers, parents and coaches at any level from little league to professional.</span>
