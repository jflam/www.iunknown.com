                    <span>All Deliberate Speed bears witness to the truth about our two party education system.  This book should be on the required reading list for all students in both high school and college. It is a must read for law students who take, or contemplate taking constitutional law courses or anyone who truly wants to understand the impact of Brown v. Board of Education.<br> <br>All Deliberate Speed speaks the truth. In some chapters the author gives you hope and in other chapters, the author allows the reader to ponder the future. Reading and understanding this book should help eliminate un-substantiated bias against integration. However, there is no question that the author points out the damage racial segregation, housed and surrounded by inequality, does to our society.<p>For example, in chapter six, Ogletree clearly exposes the reader to the fact that our government denied African-Americans full citizenship rights through legislation, judicial decisions as well as Jim Crow customs and behaviors.<p>Was the denial of full citizenship rights (education, accommodations, housing, voting) for African-Americans a grant of  "affirmative action" for the white majority? Does the phrase "all deliberate speed" give or take away from the impact or the seriousness of the Brown decisions? Ogletree addresses these question and others in his 'adept' analysis of the decisions in Brown v. Board I and in Brown v. Board II. <p>Ogletree masterfully points out that a proper education includes, but is not limited to ethnic diversity, safe buildings, good teacher pay, desks, books, parental involvement, technology, etc. A proper education for all supports ones ability to successfully integrate oneself into our society and is germane to our survival as a nation. All Deliberate Speed is an excellent, excellent book. Easy to read, easy to understand, provocative, educational and truthful. Separate but equal is inherently un-equal.</span>

                    <span>As a first gerneration recipient of the benefits of Brown v Board of Education, it was enlightning to get a up-close view of the behind the scene goings-on of the attempts to stall and erode the promise of "Brown".  This is a must read for the public..... to be aware of the diabolical machinations that go on in the back rooms of power to attempt to deny the basic and fundamental right to a good education.  <p>Professor Ogletree illustrates that the promise of  "Brown" remains unfulfilled and that we cannot stop fighting the resistance to that promise.</span>
