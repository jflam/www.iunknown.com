                <span id="Label1">You've seen the promises in the advertising, Microsoft's free Movie Maker 2 will make it simple to capture, edit and share your home movies. We agree, but how do you know where to start, or where you're going? The answer is Movie Maker 2: Zero to Hero, which will take you from filming (with easy tips to improve the quality) though editing and adding effects, to premiering your masterpiece to your friends and family. You'll learn how to produce professional looking films, with effects and transitions like those you see on TV, and how to show them off. Send them by e-mail, post them to Web sites, copy them to a CD, or even make your own DVD! Zero to Hero is more than a catchy slogan and an opportunity for puns and graphical representations of tights, capes, and phone booths. It's a style of learning designed by friends of ED to reach beyond dry technical explanations and dusty old authors who don't know how it is for real users and wouldn't know good design if it slapped them round the face with a wet fish. With a Zero to Hero book you can choose how you learn. You can choose to learn everything you need to know about Windows Movie Maker 2 by working through the first section of the book from start to finish. Alternatively you can dive straight in to the inspirational 'Hero' chapters and refer back as and when you need. Then later, when you're a hero yourself, the book is easily used as a reference tool. And when you're done you'll be ready to wear your underwear on the outside, metaphorically speaking of course. And if you get stuck, our support heroes are just an e-mail away. With all books from friends of ED - our support is fast, friendly and free. All friends of ED authors help with the support on their books, and will either directly e-mail people with answers, or send their response to an editor to pass on. Information and Inspiration. Speed and Support. We'll not only unlock the toolset for you, we'll feed your imagination, and that's a promise. So, what are you waiting for?</span>

                    <span>I knew nothing about editting video when I got this book - I had a PC and a video camera, but no idea even how to plug them together. Like it says on the cover, "From scratch - fast". If you don't need to learn from scratch, then you'll have to skip bits of the book - but the hero projects are worth their weight in gold to any Movie Maker user.<P>I was surprised by the other review on this page complaining about the book "covering all the bases", so to speak - it's very clear that the book teaches you everything "from scratch" - that's what it's meant to do!</span>

                    <span>I cannot honestly recommend this text to you. It is just a mess crammed full of material that is poorly organized.<P> We don't need to learn Movie Maker from scratch. It's a task-oriented program! Don't spend time telling me what the File menu is, tell me how to add a transition between two frames quickly!<P> I just don't think the approach in this book is useful for the true Movie Maker user. I'd look into a more general-purpose digital video book that focuses on Movie Maker 2 as the primary software to get the job done easily (such as Perry's Digital Video in a Snap (ISBN: 0672325691)).<P> Unlike a program such as Excel than an investor or financial planner will want to master in great detail, the Movie Maker user needs to know how to do select things at any one time depending on the job they have to do.</span>

                    <span>The other reviews make refference to how full of info this book is - and they're right it is full to bursting! So much so, in fact that sometimes you just pray for there to be a bit more white space on the pages. For an old feller like me a few more pages would have been easier on the eyes.<P>The book is very very good content-wise though, just wish it was a little lesss packed!</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for a few months now. I was sceptical initally because I hadn't seen any other books about MM2, and hadn't heard of the authors or the seiries, but it really is fantastic- straight to the point and fun too!<P>Each section is divided up into small chunks that answer all the questions you've got about how to make and edit films with your pc. Best of all it doesn't assume anything at all - it's all in there - you simply skip the bits you like.<P>The bit I really liked though was the section at the end, where you are walked through a selection of types of movie that you might make - although getting them to look as good will take some practice.<P>I've seen some other MM books now and I think that this one is by far the best - forget the ones on Movie Maker 1 (they just have Movie Maker -no 2- in the tile) as the programs are just too different, and the Microsoft book is a litle too wordy and makes you follow exercises step-by-step - not quite what you want when you're making your own movies!</span>

Well, he and his co-authors cover all the bases in this title, they really give every aspect of MovieMaker throurgh coverage - from import to export!<BR>Get this book and you can make pro movies on the cheap too!</span>
