                <span id="Label1">In the course of thirteen days in January 1999, four commercial clam boats sank in horrifying succession while working the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, taking the lives of ten men. Husbands, fathers, loners, and drug users, each man was lured to the nation's most dangerous trade by the lucrative wages offered to those who dared to reap the harvest of the ocean. In this compelling maritime tale of risk and danger, acclaimed journalist Douglas Campbell compassionately portrays the destinies of the men who lost their lives to the Atlantic and the lure of profits from clamming. From the tough and sometimes troubled young men on deck to their families on shore, and the courageous people who tried to rescue them, this narrative memorializes a way of life, and exposes the hazards of this dangerous trade.</span>

                    <span>In a two-week period in 1999, four commercial clamming boats sank off the Atlantic Coast costing ten lives. The author, a journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer, recounts the known facts of the sinkings, the lives of those who drowned and those who survived, and the interrelated circumstances. Many of the elements of the tragedies are familiar: heavy weather, Coast Guard helicopters, survival suits, men vanishing into the night. Campbell intelligently weaves in the real economic and commercial pressures on fishermen with details of the lives of hard-working men. These clammers have no illusions about their dangerous trade. They know they risk death, but most could not earn nearly the same wages elsewhere. The efforts of regulatory agencies to protect workers, preserve breeding stocks, and stabilize the markets come under scrutiny as well. An excellent choice for those interested in commercial fishing or sea stories.</span>

                    <span>Campbell's latest addition to the "disaster at sea" genre, while a good read, isn't quite as gripping as works by his contemporaries such as Spike Walker ("Working on the Edge", "Nights of Ice," and "Coming Back Alive") or Sebastian Junger. Nevertheless, he does a masterful job of recreating the stories of four separate clam boat disasters in the early part of 1999. He also does an excellent job of describing the work of clam boats, as well as the problems encountered by those working in the profession. Campbell sheds a great deal of light on the problem with unseaworthy boats that are so common in the northeast fishing industry. In sum, this is a good addition to the library of anyone who loves stories of disaster at sea, but don't expect the intensity found in more popular works.</span>

                    <span>"The Sea's Bitter Harvest" chronicles the sinking of four commercial clam fishing boats in the North Atlantic during an amazingly short two week period in January 1999. Ten fishermen lost their lives in that brief period, easily the worst month for Atlantic fisherman in the modern age. The book is clearly intended to appeal to those who enjoyed Sebastian Junger's "The Perfect Storm" (and even mentions Junger's book several times). That said, author Douglas A. Campbell lacks Junger's storytelling touch, though he is a obviously a very good reporter.<P>Like "Storm", this book details the lives of the oridinary men (no women here) who risk their lives in what is perhaps the most dangerous profession in America. Clam fishing is portrayed as exhausting and unglamorous profession that appeals to the the blue collar types who do it for the large paychecks and the relatively unrestrained lifestyle. Campbell also unflinchingly details the problems in the industry, from the considerable level or drug use to the obstinate nature of fisherman when it comes to the safety regulations designed to prevent disasters. He also goes into considerable detail about the personal lives of the men who died and survived on each of the four boats. The fact that there were really four seperate incidents does prevent his book from having the same concise narrative as "Storm."<P>Overall, this book is yet another fine entry in the recent glut about the perils of commercial fishing that have appeared in the wake of "The Perfect Storm." It should appeal to anyone with an interest in the subject matter.</span>
