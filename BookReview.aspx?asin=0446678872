                    <span>I enjoyed this book.  It kept my attention and I felt that it was realisitic.  Bowen didn't make Theophilus and the other clergy men "perfect", she acknowledged how preachers are just people and they run into life's troubles, just like the rest of us; although some of them need not call themselves "men of God."  I even liked Essie's character, she was not the quiet typical hat wearing first lady that some people envision, she knew how to stand her ground.</span>

                    <span>When reading the book, at first, I thought the story would center on Rev. Simmons, Essie and Glodean his former love. But truly this book was a pleasure to read because it told the story of " Church folks" and how we allow our pastors to get away with "murder" until the final day when we must remember what being a true servant for the Lord is about. Any one reading this book, won't be able to put it down. It is a good read. It is heart pounding good stuff. </span>

                    <span>Chile!  This book is too funny. (hint) Pastor's false teeth falling out during service (I laughed so hard while reading it on the bus the lady next to me just got and sat somewhere else-She must have thought I was crazy!) I LOVED IT!*!*!  I like the way she tells this story.  This book comes at a time in my life when I struggled with the dilemma of dealing with crooked christians.   It reminded me that I am not losing my mind, but that the wheat and tare will be growning together until harvest time.  The characters are so tangible.  The storyline was excellent!  I am now reading her next book "Second Sunday".   My only critizism is this, the slang used in the book doesn't seem to fit the era or maybe its me.  Maybe she should do some research and find out what slang terms were used during the 60' & 70's.  Other than that she has my vote!</span>

                    <span>I was pleased with this book.  Although she describes the people in great detail, it actually gave me a mental picture of the people she was talking about.  That mental picture brought the characters to life for me.  Also, I found it hilarious in the way that she described the preachers, old and young, and the reactions of the people to them.  Personally, I think it would make a good movie.</span>

                    <span>This book was a good read but I agree that there were too many descriptions.  It wasn't what I expected.  I enjoyed "Sunday Brunch" and V.C. Murray books much better.</span>
