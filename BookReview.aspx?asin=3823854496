                    <span>This is a version that is the same book in hardback but LARGER that means the photos are too. The dimensions are 9 1/4" x 10 3/4" hardcover. This is printed on the inside of the dust jacket front that folds in. Amazon says it is a bit larger by mistake.<P>The other version IN PRINT though is only 6" x 7"<P>The previous hard back version is a lot bigger (taller and wider).<P>by Klaus-Jürgen Sembach. Schirmer/mosel, Munich, 2000<BR>ISBN 3823821210<P>Published in NY.<P>It has the same 86 Duotones and 14 color illustrations, but is a previous larger size. Does it make a difference?<P>YES. It makes the duotones 8x10 or larger in some cases.<BR>This is a must for your collection. For those who care there are only 3 or 4 old aged photos in the back. So ther rest are Audrey at the height of beauty and glamour.<P>be sure to ask used sellers the ISBN and dimensions before buying.<BR>This book is a must. The images are stunning, even if you aren't a huge fan, but are into glamour portraits. I am very picky, and love this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an excellent chronological collection of beautiful photos of Audrey, rightly focused on her years as a star in the fifties and sixties, and balances the material very well: there are publicity shots, movie stills, private and candid shots, and a healthy mix of the familiar and the little-seen. The book is handsome and well-designed, and of the subject herself no more needs to be said. Probably the best visual book on Audrey so far, by a slight margin over "Audrey Style", which is more informative.</span>

                    <span>This book features both black and white and color photos of the legendary Audrey. The photos capture her impeccable beauty and charm. There is a four page biography included, as well as a two page filmography. I think any Audrey Hepburn fan must have this book. I don't think you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this book for its superb photos. Adieu means "farewell" and true, she may be gone, but Audrey will remain with us forever.</span>

Especially, the B&Ws are presented in a sepia tint which adds to its originality. They are just superb.
