                <span id="Label1"><div>The white-knuckle pace of a bicycle race drives this novel about a young American's opportunity to compete in the Tour de France. Complex relationships with teammates, personal and professional obstacles, and a terrible disaster cause the young cyclist to redefine his limits. An insider's perspective on the world of professional bicycle racing reveals that the required tactics and skills create a culture in which pain is the ultimate currency and endurance is the most powerful force. The intense pressure the competitors experience offers an instructive look at personal formation beyond the sports world.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I will be going to France this summer to watch the tour so when I found a book about the tour I just had to read it. "The Race" is a fictional story about Ben Barnes, a bike racer from the US, who gets the opportunity to ride as a domestique for a European team. As Ben in going through various stages in the tour his mind wanders and recalls parts of his cycling past from races to getting his first bike and his first crash. It's really great story telling. I couldn't put it down. After a long bike ride I managed to stay up until nearly midnight to finish the book.</span>

                    <span>Really excellent! If you like bicycle racing (or don't understand bicycle racing and Lance Armstrong's efforts for a sixth Tour de France win have you interested) I think you'll find this book as money well spent. You may lose some sleep, not get the lawn mowed or the car washed...but you will be glad you took the time to read this insightful story about a young man who makes it all the way from a small town in Utah to the Tour de France. The chapters describing the pain, effort and resolve neccessary to win a mountian stage in the Tour are worth the price of admission. <P>If you liked The Yellow Jersey by Hurne you'll enjoy this one as well.</span>

                    <span>There are so many layers to the story. It's rich in detail and complex in nature. This is the second Dave Shields novel I have read, and now know for certain that he is a very talented gifted man. Please read this book.</span>

                    <span>It took me a little over 2 1/2 hours to read Dave's latest book, The Race"-mind you that is a true testament to how good the book is because I usually finish a book in a couple of weeks. This book reads like black velvet, it is so wonderfully written, and has many exciting, edge of your seat moments.<BR>If you are an avid cyclist, or just interested in a fine novel, this one if for you!</span>

                    <span>You don't have to be a cyclist to appreciate the thrills and suspense in Dave Shields's novel The<BR>Race. From the opening paragraphs, you'll find yourself caught up in the excitement of Ben<BR>Barnes's experiences, from wobbly boy on his first bicycle to contender in the Tour de France.<BR>More than a heart-stopping introduction to the world of competitive cycling, The Race is also a<BR>coming-of-age story about a truly deserving hero. You'll cheer to see that nice guys don't have to<BR>finish last.</span>
