                    <span>I'm this certification freak whom you would like to dismiss with an airy wave of hand. I fully acknowledge that certifications don't prove a thing about the holder's abilities to react to real-life situations. But my predicament is that without them I never get the motivation to read a subject in full.
<br />
<br />When i started getting conversant with EJBs (Essentially stateless session beans), i obviously tried my hand at the EJB specifications. Somehow, I found it to be high-browed and way too serious (I do acknowledge that it is supposed to be that way only). And I wasn't going any distance. 
<br />
<br />I hadn't even given my SCJP when I picked this book by Sierra and Bates. In fact, i picked this book only towards getting to know the EJB architecture in detail. And learn I did. Chapters were light and I was flipping through the pages at a frenetic speed. Using various modes and means, important points were getting drummed in. The mocks given at the end of every chapter seriously helped though the final mock exam given at the very end can catch one off-guard.
<br />
<br />Having said that, I wouldn't have done so well in the exam but for going through the specifications. There is no substitute for it. Taking the mocks at ejbcertificate.com and jdiscuss.com also helped me to a great extent.</span>

                    <span>An excellent learning book for aspiring EJB developers.  Excellent teaching methodology!  I notice there are some topics where the context got lost and I had to read back again to fill in the blanks, which is fair enough to get someone thinking. :)</span>

                    <span>One of the best books for the SCBCD certification. The books assumes you know nothing about ejb. Again well written by Kathy and bates.</span>

                    <span>This books has quite a number of pages, which is too much for the 'matter' it covers, the reason being most of the pages contain just graphics to illustrate some of the concepts. This really helped absorbing the concepts quickly instead of reading lines and lines of text. However, this book does not cover everything on EJB. Are you a beginner? Do you want to learn just what is required to pass SCBCD? Do you need strong EJB foundation? Then this is the book. 
<br />
<br />If you are a serious EJB programmer and need to tackle more real-life problems and understand everything EJBs can do, this book is probably not for you. Richard Monson-Haefel and Ed Roman's books cover more ground on the subject.
<br />
<br />All in all, this book has served its purpose well. Why 4 stars? Because not only this book is heavy but also the book's errata.
<br />
<br />Highly recommended for SCBCD aspirants.</span>
