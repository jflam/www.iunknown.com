                    <span>I liked this book because it presented problems not yet thught of in the average reader's mind. This bookis also intertwined with the other books so you didn't have to meet the whole cast of characters. It took little characters from the other books and made them bigger in one way or another.In every book new information is presented, this book holds alot. Not considering learning about Fincayra itself this book is only second to the fifth book. <br>I think the best part of this book was when he meets himself, it was a comical meeting. Full of questions and anwsers. The meeting of young and old made me feel and think of pity, sorrow, laughter and wonder on what is to come in the future.<br>I think the most vivid part of this book was when older Merlin grows a tree right in his own house. In the middle of his own living  room! Reading the tree grow is as if you are right in the room when it happens. As if the tree is planted in the book and you are riding it yourself. Not only do you feel that you were there but that you belng there.</span>

                    <span>In the long  winter in a enchanted forest a child was born Merlin enchanted life. This book  was a skill fully written book by Rosemary Sutcliff. A novel that will catch the readers eye. Set in England and partly in Norway, far away from the world we know to a unreal universe beyond imagination.<p>This book set in a fantasy/ medieval setting. The main character in this book is the all powerful Merlin, described as a towering, wise and tattered man. Merlin created by the evil, dark, shadowed, witch, and queen of evil Mab to bring the people back to the old ways. Queen Mab's plan backfired and merlin will do anything to get the queen back for killing his aunt Antasia. At just a hand wizard merlin is ready to fight. But is Merlin ready for the challenges he is about to face? Read the book and find out.<p>This phenomenal book I would recommend it to any young reader looking for a good book. If i were to rate this book on a scale from 1 to 10 it would be a 10. Any young reader would love this book.<br> <p>This book review was written by Philip Davis</span>

                    <span>The Mirror of Merlin is a great book. It is fourth in the series but you don't have to read the first three unless you want lots of information to understand it better. If you don't read the first three books, it will take you a little while to catch on, but once you understand it, you will understand what you previously read. I chose this book because I like stories with Merlin and Arthur and every one that I have seen or read was different in one way or another.<p>      This book is about Merlin and Hallia on their adventure to stop the Marsh Ghouls from destroying things and to find out why they are destroying things. Their adventure started out as helping a frightened ballymag back to his homelands, the Haunted Marsh. However, what started as helping a poor defenseless ballymag return home, turned into an adventure to save the Marsh.<p>      This book has great description and is full of surprises. I especially liked how the author described Gwynnia the dragon: `...a young dragon. Her purple and scarlet scales aglow, sat beside us. She was tucking her leathery wings, still quivering from flight, against her back." Something that surprises me is how Merlin always finds a way to do things, no matter what they are.<p>      So if you want to read a book that's full of surprises, read The Mirror of Merlin.</span>
