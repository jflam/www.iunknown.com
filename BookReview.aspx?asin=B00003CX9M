Her true love is Zhivago who also loves his wife. Lara is the one who inspires poetry. The story is narrated by Zhivago's half brother Yevgraf, who has made his career in the Soviet Army. At the beginning of the film he is about to meet a young woman he believes may be the long lost daughter of Lara and Zhivago.</span>

                    <span>For anyone who loves the epic and loves the love story, this is THE film to see. The sweep of this film is incomparable, far better and more emotional than ANY epic film in the last 30 years. This film (along with BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA) demonstrates the power of the medium. <P>Lean creates the dramatic spectacle like no one else. The cast is top notch, particularly Rod Steiger as Komorovsky. The camerawork is peerless, maybe only Orson Welles' dizzying work surpasses Lean's eye for the "motion-picture-as-painting." Maurice Jarre's score is seductive, captivating and above all unforgettable. John Box's production design is rich and opulent without being gaudy. And there is an excellent cameo by cinema's enfant terrible - Klaus Kinski. Oh, and watch for the baby-exchange on the train, during the production that woman was actually sucked under the train's wheels!<P>As filmmakers sadly look expectantly toward the digital medium, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO lets us know that what once breath-taking was will soon be lost forever. If there was ever a film that championed 70mm cinema, this is it. Now, we wait for LAWRENCE OF ARABIA for a DVD release.</span>

                    <span>Director David Lean's "Doctor Zhivago", released in 1965, was a remarkable drama which should have won an Oscar for Best Picture. It's certainly worthy of the Oscar title. The film stars Omar Shariff in the eponymous role of Doctor Yuri Andreyvitch Zhivago, Geraldine Chaplin as his wife Tonya, Julie Christie as his mistress and true love Lara, Rod Steiger as the villainous Victor Komarovsky and Alec Guiness as an officer. Based on the novel by Boris Pasternak - the novel, by the way, was banned in Communist Russia- it's true to the novel and is visually beautiful and tragic to behold. It is a film that honors love even in the dark times of the Communist take-over in 1918 Russia. The film was shot in some locations in Spain and Europe. The music is by Maurice Jarre, a French composer of remarkable talent. His "Lara's Theme", the love theme of the movie, is poignant and lilting. The use of the Russian instrument, balalaika and other instrumental music is very dramatic as well as moving. On DVD, this film is truly a treat. Commentary, behind the scenes and subtitles are the bonus features. <P>The film opens shortly before the Revolution in which we meet Zhivago, an orphaned doctor who writes romantic poetry. Zhivago's relationship with his wife Tonya is not passionate. He was married out of the conventional orthodox Russian tradition and they are more like brother and sister than husband and wife. Komarovsky, a decadent and corrupt aristocrat, becomes possessive and controlling of Lara, whose socially ambitious mother pushes her into this sordid relationship. Lara's spirit is crushed when Komoravosky rapes her and attempts to shoot him during a party (this is the first time Zhivago sees Lara). Eventually, the war comes along and Zhivago is sent to support the army as a surgeon. Here he meets up with Lara again as she is serving as a nurse. Lara and Zhivago become lovers after the war, coincidentally when Zhivago's wife Tonya is pregnant with her second child. <P>When the truth of the affair is discovered, Tonya abandons Zhivago, heartbroken. Zhivago and Lara have a daughter, Tonya (in honor of Zhivago's wife, for it seems that Zhivago loved both Tonya and Lara, even if he burned hotter for Lara). Zhivago's daughter Tonya learns of her parents through conversation with Alec Guiness' character who has found the poems written by Zhivago to Lara. A film of polar opposite visuals - the daffodils and wintry castle look innocent and Impressionist-style is a direct contrast to the ugly darkness of the inhumanity of war, in this case the Bolshevik regime. This film is a must have for fans of great drama. Look also for the remake from the BBC and available on DVD now. A film released in 2003 and shown on PBS KCET starring Hans Matheson as Zhivago, Keira Knightley as Lara and Sam Neill plays a truly wicked Komoravsky.</span>

                    <span>Folks, get the romantic stars out of your eyes. Doctor Zhivago was cheating on his pregnant wife with (...) Lara, who started out in the world by having an affair with a MARRIED MAN! She seems to like the married ones. Commitment phobic? <P>Yes, it had a soaring score and gorgeous landscapes, but the morals of these characters made me sick. For Zhivago to leave his pregnant wife with an old man in the middle of nowhere in a Russian winter was reprehensible. I found it poetic justice when Zhivago's raging hormones led him back to the town where Lara was and he was caught by the army and inducted as military surgeon. He deserved the misery he put upon himself! That's the plot in a nutshell!</span>

                    <span>David Lean, creator of the also epically great Lawrence of Arabia, has taken Boris Pasternak's novel and created a very good film with it. Having not read the book, I cannot comment and will not on whether it matches the book, but I can say the movie itself is very near excellent. This movie is really almost a historical film in disguise, since it highlights the lives of many, but especially Yuri and Lara, the main characters, and their attempts to live during and after the early nineteen hundreds Russian revolution. Like the movie To Live did for China, Dr. Zhivago helps one understand the daily sufferings before and after the revolution. These sufferings, or sufferers, are laced with almost hope as they live and love one another and try to thrive. This movie, although long, should interest almost anyone. It will also touch the mind and remind themselves of other culture's and their historical changes.</span>
