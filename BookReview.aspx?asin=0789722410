                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Linux Socket Programming by Example begins with a very basic introduction to the fundamentals of socket level programming. As the chapters progress, you are introduced to related concepts, such as forming network addresses, Ipv6, the TCP/IP protocol suite and options, writing servers, and creating secure applications. You will also learn about socket fundamentals, domains and addresses, address conversion functions, socket types and protocols, Internet sockets, types and protocols, binding an address to a socket, using Datagram oriented protocols, and much more.</HTML></span>

                    <span>This book delivers on its title. I found some of the code useful immediately straight out of the book. I also have his Linux Programming book. It too is very good. I would have given it five stars; but for lack in two areas: firstly, I would have liked coverage of dynamic restart of client / server apps and logging; secondly, as there isn't a CD provided, a download site is given which reroutes you somewhere else and I couldn't find any code to download. This also occured for my other SAMS book by the same author.</span>

                    <span>This is very readable and usable as a beginner's guide to socket programming. One particular aspect I liked is that the author took the pain to illustrate the socket structure well which many book glossed over. Also, the sample codes are short and illustrate the use of the socket calls well. The book could have been expanded to cover HTTP,SOAP,XML, etc to give it a 5 star. Also think that the publisher could have used better quality print material.</span>

                    <span>The code examples and editing mistakes almost force you to have a secondary book just to validate what the author is doing. 3 stars were given for the completenes and solid explanation of concepts. I should've just picked up the out of print version of Richard Stevens "UNIX Network Programming", classic.</span>

                    <span>Ah, Warren Gay is the man. I was very pleased with his Sams' Linux Programming book and decided to pick up this book hoping it would be just as straight forward and clear as the Sams' book. He delivered again. I've gone through many socket tutorials on the web and always felt like something was lacking. I still had many questions, but this book cleared them up. You can use this knowledge immediately to write your own apps. Though, I wish there was more on ioctl(), but maybe that goes too far beyond basic socket programming. Oh, Warren Gay is a supporter/programmer for GNU/Open Source. That's a big plus!</span>

                    <span>A must-have book! I seldom see a book so well focused on its aims. It is like it screams: "hey guy, use it do not use that!" or "connect works this way, not that way, take a look!". Every example is quite illustrative and, as if it was not enough, the comments are always helpful.<P>Everyone which wants to develop serious TCP/IP programming must get it. And it can also be read by UNIX programmers as well.</span>
