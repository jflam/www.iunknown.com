                    <span>I was so excited for this book to come!  I couldn't wait to read it.  I have to admit that now after reading it, I am a bit disappointed. While it is quick and easy to read some of the information is extremely basic and elementary and I considered about half of the book to be a waste of my time (but hey, what's 25 minutes in the grand scheme of things?).  I did however find some of the tips very helpful and practical.  For instance, the book helped me recognize situations when it's okay to throw things away, something I never do.  Overall, a good read with some helpful ideas.  Just be prepared to skip over the stuff that you already know, and be able to apply the general deatils to your specific needs.</span>

                    <span>I was able to read this book in one night and still had time to make a game plan for tackling the organization project at the office for the next morning.  There were a few ideas that were easy to implement; some so simple I can't believe I never thought of them before.  (The Tickler Files!)  After two work days, I had changed my work process enough to feel better, and thus have some relief.  Not to mention, on day two, my director stopped mid-sentance when she saw the top of my desk and praised me for how clean and organized I was.<p>This book is a great place to start for some easy, immediate results.  However, I need much, much more on PDA's, e-mail, case management, and paperwork flow.  The success I had from the small investment of time here will keep me motivated to move on to books tackling the larger picture.</span>

                    <span>I was totally disorganized and swamped with paper everywhere. This book was one of 3 I bought and was the first one I read. It is easy to read and follow, and it brought order and gave me confidence to start my umpteenth effort to get organized. Absolutely recommend it to anyone who is in need of a kick start to getting organized.</span>

                    <span>This book is well organized.  It offers practical and simple to follow  methods.  If you don't want to spend a lot of time reading, but to take  action getting organized, this is the book to read.</span>

                    <span>I ran into the first edition of Oganizing Your Workspace at a time when I  needed to get my work habits reorganized.  It was full of very simple,  almost obvious suggestions on how to get out of grid lock, and how work in  a focused way.  It takes some "humility" for a "seasoned  executive" to read through a book like this, but for me it paid off  many times over.</span>
