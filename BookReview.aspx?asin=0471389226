                <span id="Label1">Gigantically comprehensive and carefully researched, <I>Security Engineering</I> makes it clear just how difficult it is to protect information systems from corruption, eavesdropping, unauthorized use, and general malice. Better, Ross Anderson offers a lot of thoughts on how information can be made more secure (though probably not absolutely secure, at least not forever) with the help of both technologies and management strategies. His work makes fascinating reading and will no doubt inspire considerable doubt--fear is probably a better choice of words--in anyone with information to gather, protect, or make decisions about.<p>  Be aware: This is absolutely not a book solely about computers, with yet another explanation of Alice and Bob and how they exchange public keys in order to exchange messages in secret. Anderson explores, for example, the ingenious ways in which European truck drivers defeat their vehicles' speed-logging equipment. In another section, he shows how the end of the cold war brought on a decline in defenses against radio-frequency monitoring (radio frequencies can be used to determine, at a distance, what's going on in systems--bank teller machines, say), and how similar technology can be used to reverse-engineer the calculations that go on inside smart cards. In almost 600 pages of riveting detail, Anderson warns us not to be seduced by the latest defensive technologies, never to underestimate human ingenuity, and always use common sense in defending valuables. A terrific read for security professionals and general readers alike. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> How some people go about protecting valuable things (particularly, but not exclusively, information) and how other people go about getting it anyway. Mostly, this takes the form of essays (about, for example, how the U.S. Air Force keeps its nukes out of the wrong hands) and stories (one of which tells of an art thief who defeated the latest technology by hiding in a closet). Sections deal with technologies, policies, psychology, and legal matters.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Anderson is a first rate, major league expert in his field and this comes across in the substantive, technical content of his writing. However his professional dissertation is diminished by the anti American invective of his (supposed) anecdotes. If you are a US citizen that has been indoctrinated to blame America first or just someone that dislikes America - you will find Mr. Anderson's anecdotes to be entertaining, even amusing. If you are not anti American, Mr. Anderson's anecdotes only clutter and distract from the text. This book is a great technical source. If Anderson would keep his political bias to himself, I would not hesitate to give his book a 5 star rating.</span>

                    <span>Five stars for Ross Anderson's Security Engineering are just not enough - you have to read the book to understand what I mean. I won't repeat what other reviewers here on amazon.com have said; instead I'd say that the author is THE security expert. His amazingly broad and in-depth security expertise and good writing style resulted in a book which is not only comprehensive and detailed, but also interesting to read. You can be an expert in one, two, well, three (out of 10) domains of information security, but it seems the author is equally at home when writing about all 10 domains. I wish I was his student!<p>Edgar Danielyan</span>

                    <span>This book changes everything.  "Security Engineering" is the new must-read book for any serious information security professional.  In fact, it may be required reading for anyone concerned with engineering of any sort.  Ross Anderson's ability to blend technology, history, and policy makes "Security Engineering" a landmark work.<br> <br>Engineers learn more from failure than success.  "Security Engineering" brings this practice to life, investigating the design and weaknesses of ATM machines, currency printing, nuclear command and control, radar, and dozens of other topics.  Anderson's insights are accurate and helpful, partly because he's served as consultant for diverse industries.  His descriptions of criminal and intelligence agency exploitation of insecure systems are startling; fake cellular base stations, fly-by-night phone companies, TEMPEST/EMSEC viruses, freezing electronics to preserve RAM -- all are explained in layman's terms.<br> <br>The bibliography offers exceptional opportunities for further research, but the second edition needs a glossary.  I found some of the cryptography chapter too complicated for non-mathematicians.  I also believe the author was misled by whomever told him that "at the time of writing, the US Air Force has so far not detected an intrusion using the systems it has deployed on local networks."  (p. 387) (I know from experience this is false.)  Nevertheless, these are my only criticisms for a 612 page text.<br> <br>"Security Engineering" is a book of principles, lessons, and case studies.  It offers history, tools, and standards to judge engineering endeavors.  This book actually inspired me to learn how brick-and-mortar engineers learn their trade, as their methods and failure analysis may apply to the software world.  "Security Engineering" will remain relevant for years, but I recommend you read it as soon as possible.</span>
