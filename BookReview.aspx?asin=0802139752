                <span id="Label1">In The China Dream, acclaimed business journalist Joe Studwell takes to task the predictions that China will become an economic juggernaut on the world stage in the twenty-first century -- and instead foresees an economic crisis. He argues that since the days of Marco Polo, Western nations have seen the vast population of the Middle Kingdom as a fantastic opportunity for expanding trade, investing time and resources again and again in the hope to develop it, only to see, century after century, its economy crash and their dreams turn to dust. Studwell traces the most recent developments in China from Deng Xiaoping's "liberalization" of its market in the 1980s through the opening of its economy to foreign investment in the 1990s. In his rigorous analysis of the Chinese economy, government, and culture, Studwell also shows the roadblocks to the continuation of the country's unprecedented expansion and why its economy will fail once more -- but this time, harder than ever before, and with potentially catastrophic results. Provocative, flawlessly researched, and endlessly engaging, The China Dream is a book that will have the business and political worlds talking about what's really going on in China -- and what we can do to prepare for the coming crisis.  </span>

                    <span>Joe Studwell, a British freelance journalist who lived in and reported from China from 1991 until 1999, has written one of the best-informed insiders' books about the Chinese economy in the boom years of the 1990s that is on the market. The book is excellently researched, well documented (60 pages of notes accompany 300 pages of text) and profits from a wealth of experience gathered "on the ground."<P>The main thesis of the book is that many big Western companies substitute a blurry, optimistic picture of a vast potential market for a balanced view based on hard data. When it comes to China, wishful thinking replaces critical distance and realistic assessment.<P>One thing that "The China Dream" explains very clearly is the extent to which two economies in China exist parallel to each other. One is the old socialist economy that is protected from change and the market forces. The other is a vibrant, export -oriented economy of manufacturing plants that assemble goods under the management of mostly Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies. The latter is the poster child for China, but the former continues to gobble up the people's savings to churn out the products that the planners want to see. Stripped of the success story of the export-oriented manufacturing companies, China's economy looks like a disaster waiting to happen.<P>Studwell is not a China-basher. He admires the stamina and determination of the small entrepreneurs in China who manage to hold their ground against a rapacious bureaucracy, the lack of credit from state-owned banks and the dumping strategies of pampered state-owned enterprises.<P>Earlier reviewers have criticized "The China Dream" as biased and uninformed (no CEO interviews). Having worked in China for three years, my impression is that Joe Studwell has a very solid grasp of the economic and political realities in the People's Republic of China, and that there is no point in listening to the rosy projections of CEOs and foreign luminaries who were "toured about in government limousines and fed an endless diet of spurious statistics"(255).<P>In a nutshell: This book is absolutely recommended reading for anyone who wishes to work in China or just wants to know what to make of all the praise lavished on a socialist developing country.</span>

                    <span>There's an incredible amount of hype about China's economic market. Its huge population, high-skilled low-wage work force, and relative political stability for a developing country all act as a powerful lure to multinationals eager to set up shop and begin selling to one-quarter of the world's population. Under tough negotiations from Chinese officials, these companies tend to give away the kitchen sink to ensure they get access to the huge market. But what do they get in return?<P>Joe Studwell does a service to the informed public by clearly demonstrating that almost all the businesses who have gone to China have gotten next to nothing for their technology transfers, special fees, and tremendous time and effort they've dedicated to the market. Almost uniformly, they have high-balled their expected sales and profits from the Middle Kingdom and found immense barriers such as unseen regulations and fees, corrupt officials, unenforced laws, local spin-offs to their products, etc., that should have sent them packing. Yet almost all of them push on, undeterred.<P>As Studwell explains, the reason for this is an old phenomenon among Western businessmen he calls "The China Dream." Despite continual setbacks, these hard-headed businessmen are too attracted to the possibility that they have something to sell that even a small percentage of Chinese may want to buy. Those huge potential numbers are too much of an enticement to businesses to easily let go of their foothold in China.<P>But Studwell's book is more than just about the experience of foreign businessmen in China. It also shows that the China market is becoming a trap for the Chinese people themselves. They work hard and save, and the government confiscates and then destroys their money by trapping it in state-owned banks that are insolvent because they lend to state-owned enterprises that are unproductive. <P>"The China Dream" is well-written and informative. Its thesis is provocative, but well supported. Studwell argues there is no rational basis for much of China's economic success and that most of its market is as closed and overregulated as the Soviet Union's. This book should be required reading for every CEO of a multinational who dreams of selling in China.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book outlining the history of china in relation to its economic structure and trade development, covering the previous few centuries up to the present. Unfortunately it is the same old story inherent in any mania , value goes out of the window and the ability to analyse is crowded out by greed. <P>I love the frank account of the CEO's absurd optimism about china in the face of so much contrary evidence. China will one day be the largest economic power in the world and its domestic market will eventually become highly developed, unfortunately this cannot happen in the present repressive climate. <P>I would like to have been furnished with 1 or 2 maps as being a rather ignorant westerner in relation to china's geography, i found placing the different areas a little difficult. However this does not really detract from this being an excellent book and a must read for those who wish to view some contrary opinion about china. This is very welcome instead of the glowing clap trap we are pushed in the west.</span>

                    <span>If you only use the 18th and 19th centuries as guide then of course China never made anybody money. I know of NO CEOs today who studied this period. All they now care about is that they get a foot in the door of this huge booming market before their competitors do, and it's a scramble. Many companies have made 100%, 200% or more return on their investment in a couple of years, which must be news to Studwell basking in the Italian sun.<P>Read David Sheff's China Dawn and Cesar Bacani's The China Investor for a look at the future.</span>

                    <span>This poorly written book suffers from many flaws, not the least of which is the author's lack of access to informed sources. One of the most important things one needs to do when writing a book of this sort is interviewing the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and this author has failed to do this, the most basic homework.<P>For every anecdote one can easily find a hundred anecdotes making the opposite point. If you choose your anecdotes with care, you can prove almost anything. I don't find Studwell's conclusions very convincing. Studwell's choice of historical cases are misleading. When China was prosperous, it was a closed country. By the time Europeans were able to invest, China was in the midst of war and revolution. After the war China was closed again (except to Soviets). The last two decades of reform were also unsuitable for foreign investment, due to structural instability.<P>If Studwell is right, then I have a hard time understanding why:<P>(a) Henry Kissinger called China "the most ascendant" among all contemporary world powers (Europe included) ;<BR>(b) Paul Wolfowitz (Deputy Sec. of Defense) said China will soon achieve superpower status within 50 years (by 2025 at the earliest), adding "and that's pretty fast by historical standards"; <BR>(c) Jack Welch (of GE) predicted China will be "very competitive" and advised managers doing pie charts to "leave half the pie" for the Chinese, who will "threaten your very existence";<BR>(d) Margaret Thatcher described China as "undoubtedly on course to become an economic superpower", and had this to say about the Chinese people: "everywhere they go they show the same spirit of enterprise and self-reliance, and given the right economic framework, nothing is beyond them";<BR>(e) Joseph Stiglitz, (Clinton's chief economics adviser, former chief economist at the World Bank & Nobel Laureate in Economics) is very bullish and optimistic about China's future, contrasting with his gloomy views of Russia; <BR>(f) Arlen Specter (US Senator, Appropriations & Judiciary Committees) called China "the coming colossus";<BR>(g) Joseph Nye and Sameul Huntington (Harvard dons) predicted China's swift rise to be a problem for the US;<BR>(h) JM Roberts and Eric Hobsbawm (British historians) used "superpower" or "potential superpower" to describe China;<BR>(i) Jeffrey Garten (Dean of Yale's School of Management) called China "the second most important country in the world";<BR>(j) Gregory Chow (distinguished Princeton econometrist) calculated China's economy (gross GDP in purchasing power parity) to be bigger than that of the US by 2025 - even allowing for flawed statistics.<P>Studwell also chose to ignore the very successful British firms operating in Hong Kong. The drug dealers who brought opium to China got fabulously rich - most were British, while a handful, like Warren Delano (FDR's grandfather), were Americans. Their wealth equalled that of the Vanderbilts. And their legacy persists to this day: the HSBC - the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - is now the world's third most important bank.<P>Let people be swayed by the naysayers and sensationalists: it's HARDER to make money when everybody is rushing in to invest.</span>
