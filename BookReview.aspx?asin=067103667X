                    </div>
                    <span>"Confederacy of Silence" is the first full-length book by Richard Rubin, a former newspaper writer who experienced his coming of age as a fish out of water: A 21-year-old "New York Yankee Jew," as one of his friends called him, straight from an Ivy League college (Penn) to the Mississippi Delta - for no reason other than he could write (but not type), had no other viable job prospects and had a longstanding fascination with the 1955 Emmett Till murder case. Hired as sports editor at the Greenwood Commonwealth, Rubin "discovers" - as does the rest of Mississippi, including its two SEC colleges - the brilliant talent of Bulldogs quarterback Handy Campbell. After winning the North state championship, Campbell was signed by Mississippi State, beginning a circuitous route over six years - never playing a down of football - which led to him and an accomplice being charged with murder.
<br />
<br />There are two parts to this book: Rubin's recollections of his one-year term at the newspaper and then his return to the Delta six years later to cover the Campbell trial. The first half is more interesting, describing his reactions to the racial environment he encounters in the Delta - which he notes is as different from the rest of Mississippi as Mississippi is to the rest of the nation. As one who has lived, quite pleasantly, in the Hospitality State, I can attest to that truth. There exists a dichotomy in Rubin's reactions between genuine affection for the people who befriend him and the revulsion he feels for their racial attitudes. This is not an uncommon experience for white Americans who disdain prejudice, and it is not exclusive to the South. Although Rubin's naivety is touching, it is also annoying. Obviously, his life in New York City and Philly was cloistered, or else what explains his apparent ignorance of the pervasive poverty in those communities? Even six years later, he doesn't appear to have gained much wisdom, only cynicism. The most significant flaw in this book is also its strength: Rubin's lack of life experience. This is what differentiates it from the masterful work of Willie Morris in "The Courting of Marcus Dupree," which includes many similar observations (and which I heartily recommend). 
<br />
<br />The second section is written in the present, on Campbell's fate. He conducts several interviews, some of them quite revealing. Rubin has a keen eye for detail, although - judging from a journalistic perspective - he's not a sharp interviewer and fails to adequately prepare. He admits the former, repeatedly ruing the questions he failed to ask - and then not even recognizing all of those, the reader will notice - mainly out of timidity. When he learns that Campbell has been arrested, he charges back to Mississippi - having arranged a meeting with Campbell through his lawyer - and conducts it without having even read the case file. While this allows Rubin the luxury of incredulity that a quiet, self-conscious young man like Campbell could be charged with murder, his steadfast desire to maintain his innocence colors Rubin's perspective. He has not, as it turns out, come of age. He has a sense of irony, but it is not nearly as poignant as a more seasoned observer would reflect.
<br />
<br />Rubin writes well and vividly, though, and this makes the book a page-turner - at least through the first half. The interviews of the second part bog down the narrative, although Rubin thankfully abbreviates them to their essence.
<br />
<br />Much of the criticism directed toward Rubin has been politically tinged. Southerners, not least of all Mississippians, consider any unfavorable views by "outsiders" harshly. Yet, the cultural perspective Rubin brings to this work is its most redeeming feature: That he would be surprised that racism was alive and well in 1989 (or 1995), that Jews had thrived in the Delta since before the Civil War and that football would be so important that it would embrace and then discard young people at will. His digressions provide mordant revelations, even if they don't always appear to register in his wider perspective. In that, this pales in comparison to another book which mixes sports, history and sociology: H.G. "Buzz" Bissinger's "Friday Night Lights." (A side note: If you have not read the book, see the movie first. The film is outstanding on its own merits, well acted and directed, but a familiarity with the subject diminishes its appreciation due to the slight - although not essential - tinkering with the context.) Both books hold up a mirror to a society, and in neither does the object appear as the one reflected wishes or believes. Bissinger's view is less genial than Rubin's, but, then again, the former wrote from greater experience. "Confederacy of Silence" would have been more compelling had Rubin not squandered the six years in between his initiation into reporting - which he admittedly may lack the heart to sustain as a profession, although he has sufficient talent - and developed as a journalist to provide a broader viewpoint and more skillful analysis of both people and events.

                    <span>This would have been a enjoyable 438 page book. I said "would have been".
<br />The author has a writing style reminiscent of Mississipian Willie Morris. That's a definite plus.
<br />
<br />Here's the problem and its a common one.
<br />I grew up in the South and I live here now. During my life I've lived or visited many areas of the USA and I've learned something.
<br />People, who are not from the South, for some reason have to constantly point out to us Southerners all of our faults especially our racism and how we are the reason for all of the failures of other races.
<br />I always believed this. Then as I got older I began to live in other areas of the country and I was appalled at the racism and hate especially in the Northeast.
<br />
<br />I feel people in the South get along better with each other than any other part of the country. Go to Jackson, Birmingham, or New Orleans and you'll see for yourself.
<br />
<br />This author must be very insecure with himself because on every page he points out to us Southerners how ignorant, stupid, selfish, racist, and hateful we are.
<br />Of course, every person the author met(in his newspaper reporter job) went out of their way to trust this man and befriend him nevertheless he insists on stabbing them in the back at every chance he gets.
<br />
<br />This is a talented writer but you really get annoyed when every incident and every anecdote has a a bottom line our stupidity and racism.
<br />
<br />The women he dates are nice to him but he finds fault with that.
<br />The Jewish people he meets are happy but he finds fault with that.
<br />All of his fellow newspaper workers have personal problems, all of course, except him. If New York is so great, I say, why didn't New York offer him a job?
<br />
<br />I guess insecure people, basically unhappy people, have to write this way, so if you want to read a book about Mississippi that in all 438 pages finds something wrong with the people and the state, than this is the book for you.
<br />
<br />I've travelled most of the Southern states and their economy is booming but when I travel to the Northeast it looks dying to me.
<br />Maybe its just jealously.

                    <span>This was a quick read.  Rubin has an energetic writing style, which is easy to follow. He keeps the action moving so it is a page turner.  His early  portrayal of Greenwood, Mississippi was entertaining.  I especially enjoyed his discription of his encounters with "Southern Womanhood." His narration of Handy Campbell's trial was well done.  This is a worthwhile book if you can live with Rubin's editorial comments. This book is as much of the coming of age of Rubin as it is about the putative death spiral of Greenwood.  Rubin writes as if Mississippi has cornered the market on racism and apathy, which it has not.   </span>

                    <span>A mangled and missed opportunity.  Richard Rubin is as dishonest in his recollections and story-telling, in order to publish a book, as he was on the telephone during his initial job interview with Greenwood's newspaper's owner and editor.
<br />
<br />His bias clearly impaired his vision of reality.  How can one believe anything other than all the characters were viewed with the same "filtered" glasses Mr. Rubin used to view Handy Campbell and his family.
<br />
<br />He is right about one thing, his literary career may surely mirror that of the 17-old high school football player.
<br />
<br />His story as it relates to NCAA athletic rules is inaccurate.  A quick review of NCAA transfer and redshirt rules would have corrected a few errors in the book and allowed Mr. Rubin to challenge some of the passages with a more critical eye.
<br />
<br />As for athletics, Mr. Rubin would have you believe the following:  a quarterback who has played just one year of organized football through high school, quit his first college team in less than two weeks, immediately transfers to another school where he is drunk on weekends, doesn't go to class as required, continually breaks team rules and twice injures his rotator cuff and the conclusion is his collegiate career was not successful because of racism from one offensive line coach.  How many great athletes do we know with fatal flaws of character ... of course, this truth would not coincide with the pre-planned premise of the book......

                    <span>I agree whole heartedly with an earlier review, that Rubin gets in his own way with too many judgments, and too many conclusory statements not backed by anything more than his hunch.<p>Story would have been much better had he laid it out and let us conclude things(just as his Greenwood editor suggested he do).  One of the better chapters involved his visit to the country store where Till's killer worked.  While Rubin injected some opinion, we the reader were able to envision the scene ourselves and feel the discomfort.  <p>But other areas were trealchy.<p>There was racism in Mississippi in the 80's? Stunning.<br>There was athlete exploitation at SEC level schools? Stunning.  Volumes have been written on that subject such that it made Rubin's comments seem amateurish.<p>And too many quick conclusions that the obvious answer to any problem had to be racism.  Just because Handy outplayed Jordan in a high school game does not mean Jordan would not be a better college player.  It was not automatic, that just because the Greenwood people all felt Handy should play, that the fact he did not was based on his race.  I know in the late 90's Romario Miller, a black student-athlete was Ole Miss' QB.<p>We have all seen superior high school athletes, and I would venture to say we have all seen high school football games.  Great job painting the Mississippi atmosphere, but childish almost in describing field action.  Compare to Friday Night Lights and this one falls flat.<p>Nice story on the track team.<p>Some good, but the judgments, the way too quick to blame so much on race (even though a lot of it was), the way to quick to assume the judges and lawyers were idiots, distracted from story.<br>Trial way too long.  Technique of run on sentences got distracting after awhile.<p>The above are criticisms.  There was good.  The overall idea nd book were good, but it was difficult to keep a good flow with the distractions of Rubin making conclusion after conclusion about many things, without the facts even as he presented them supporting the same.</span>
