                <span id="Label1"> Authors James D. Gwartney, Richard L. Stroup, Russell S. Sobel, and David Macpherson, believe that a course on principles of economics should focus on the power and relevance of the economic way of thinking.  It is this belief and corresponding writing approach that has made Economics: Private and Public Choice one of South Western most solid and enduring texts.  Throughout this text, the authors integrate applications and real-world data in an effort to make the basic concepts of economics come alive for the reader. </span>

                    <span>As others have written, this text is reasonably well-written and organized. However, it has a clear bias, presenting and defending a right-wing agenda. For example:<P>*Taxes, unions, environmental protection, transfer payments are bad.<BR>*School vouchers, social security reform to presonal retirement accounts, medical savings accounts are good ideas.<P>Of course I oversimplify (slightly), but whatever side of these and other issues one might fall, it's pretty clear that the other side is given short shrift.<P>A minor beef I had with this text is that too many of its examples cater to the college student.</span>

                    <span>This book will make you love economics. It covers both microeconomics and macroeconomics. It also explains how monetary policy and fiscal policy affects the economy. Some of the reasonings are counter intuitive however the authors provide very good examples to illustrate their point. I gained a very good understanding of aggregate demand and supply and how they get affected because of fiscal and monetary policy, employment, economic growth, taxes, trade tariffs, exports, imports, and other factors.</span>

Perfect for AP (this text is adopted at Pine Crest School in Florida as their AP Economics Text)<P>it worth the 100 bucks you payed.</span>

                    <span>If you are interested in economics, you should add this book to your personal library.<P>This book is very well written (almost lively). It covers macro, micro and international economics in a very interesting way. A very good introductory economics book that will also refresh even the advanced readers.</span>

                    <span>This is absolutely a good book not only for beginners, but for advanced readers as well. The book does a good job giving a general idea of the economic forces introducing the reader to a variety of subjects with detailed explanations. Some of the ideas are repetitive through the book, however. I found the applications at the end of the book very helpfull - something other books dont have.</span>
