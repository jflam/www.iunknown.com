                    <span>Six Sigma devotees may dispute the need to add anything to Six Sigma, but a shot of lean thinking provides a production boost. Author Michael L. George contends that Six Sigma reduces product quality variation but does nothing to improve delivery time. That may not be strictly true, and certainly is not beyond cavil. Nonetheless, the author's analysis and presentation of the Lean Six Sigma approach is lucid and straightforward. He explains Six Sigma itself much more clearly than some other writers on the subject. Even Six Sigma devotees will find nothing to object to in his treatment, and he provides some compelling examples of the success of the Lean Six Sigma approach. We recommend this book primarily to leaders and managers of firms that rely on factories and other production units. However, the author supplies practical information that may also be relevant to service providers and to every company that cares about customer service, efficient production and the bottom line.</span>

                    <span>Well I can say the book is ok. However, I do feel like this book is more about them trying to sell their services to me than to teach or explain Lean Six Sigma... If I wanted to buy consulting or training services I would rather not have it shoved down my throat in a book. .</span>

                    <span>Don't let a luke-warm review of this book distract you from the value of Six Sigma, which I'll presume that you are at least interested in.  I'll try and save you some time.<p>CEO<br>If you are a CEO, and have not yet been adequately introduced to Six Sigma, I recommend first purchasing "The Power of Six Sigma" (ISBN 0793144345, also available in audio CD).  Once complete, consider purchasing this book ("Lean Six Sigma").  Read at least the first three chapters, which focus on contributions to the bottom line.  If hooked, continue. <p>"The Power of Six Sigma" gives an overview, and the first section of Michael George's book illustrates why this is important to you.<p>Grunt<br>If your are "in the trenches," follow the above steps, but focus on chapters 10 and 15 of "Lean Six Sigma."  Between you and I, the most compelling parts of Michael George's book was the second covering the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) process (chap. 10), also available many places on the web, and the very last chapter, where the author talks about how Six Sigma applies in the product development world (chap. 15, which I found fascinating).<p>Don't get me wrong.  I am a big fan of the Six Sigma methodology, but was often times quite frustrated by this book.  When I wanted more detail on tools within the Six Sigma framework I found myself completing the Yellow Belt course through Moresteam.com.  This book simply does not cover the tools within the DMAIC framework in a level of detail I consider adequate.<p>Many times I found myself laughing because I am not in fact the CEO of this company.  She has already committed to Six Sigma, and we therefore have little choice.  After getting into the meat of the methodology, even after early involvement in TQM and other efforts, I am quite impressed with this latest evolution.</span>
