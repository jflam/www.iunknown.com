                <span id="Label1"><P><I>XML for ASP.NET Developers</I> first gives a solid foundation in the basics of MSXML including XML Syntax, XML Schemas, Xpath, Xlink, Xpointer, and other concepts necessary to leverage the power of XML. After the building blocks of XML are thoroughly covered, Dan guides readers through manipulating XML documents using the Document Object Model (DOM) and XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) both on the client and the server.  Detailed examples combined with easy to follow tutorials will have readers transforming XML documents into professional looking applications quickly and easily. Providing a single source for information on a variety of XML related technologies makes XML for ASP.NET Developers a necessary edition to any developer's library and sets it apart from any book available today.</P></span>

                    <span>While I've understood the basics of XML for some time, I've just not had a need until recently to dig into the nuts and bolts of working with it on the .NET platform. As an ASP.NET developer specifically, and with that need to know now on the table, I went on the hunt for books to help, and Mr. Wahlin's offering was an obvious choice.<P>First off, Mr. Wahlin is a terrific writer. The clear, friendly, and conversational tone of the book resonated for me, although I did find some of the verbosity and repetition a bit excessive in some spots. <P>The book begins with a good review of XML concepts, more than enough for a newbie, but easy to sift through for the more seasoned reader in need of a knowledge refresher. It continues through all the necessary concepts, including the XML classes in .NET, transformations, and of course, ADO.NET, the database core of the .NET platform. (On ADO.NET, it includes a general introduction, but of course focuses on it in an XML context.)<P>I have to say that one of the best outcomes of reading the book and experimenting with what I learned along the way is that many of the ADO.NET concepts that still seemed abstract to my not-quite-up-to-OOP brain suddenly fell into place and made much more sense to me when tied to the structures and concepts of XML. <P>No book is perfect, and I could have used some more detailed coverage in some areas. But overall, it's a great walk through the world of XML for the seasoned ASP.NET developer in need the grand tour. It sure was a help to me...</span>

                    <span>I bought the book a month ago and stayed idle in my library until I started using SQL2000 Web Notifications and needed some extra help on the principles. <P>And that was it. I can only tell you that it kept me reading it for three consequtive days, enough time to keep myself going, understand may parts, realise many possibilities/options and even optimise some code. This is not a book to solve a particular problem but it is a book to get you all excited about XML/XSLT/XLink/XPath and realise how this have been integrated to many of Microsoft Applications... (Notifications is one, CS2002 another).<P>I regret that I havent had that book before hand. It would have saved me many more hours of searching.<P>The only minus is that it makes you so excited that you end up spending another couple $$$ on other books to get into more details so I just shopped... <BR>1 of: XPath and XPointer <BR>1 of: Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming <BR>1 of: XSLT and XPath On The Edge, Unlimited Edition <BR>1 of: XSLT Programmer's Reference 2nd Edition <P>couple this with Professinal C# (2nd Edition) or even Beginning C# and you can do most things imaginable with c# and XML.<P>Thank you Dan.</span>

                    <span>Dan Wahlin is one of the top experts on XML, and this book is absolutely fantastic. Almost every question that I have ever had about working with XML and .NET has been answered... except that I don't use C#. So, I always need a translator. <P>If you use C#, this is the perfect book. If you don't, learn to translate from it, cuz this is the best book around.</span>
