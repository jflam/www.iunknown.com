                <span id="Label1">A quick and reliable way to build proven databases for core business functions<br>   Industry experts raved about The Data Model Resource Book when it was first published in March 1997 because it provided a simple, cost-effective way to design databases for core business functions. Len Silverston has now revised and updated the hugely successful First Edition, while adding a companion volume to take care of more specific requirements of different businesses. Each volume is accompanied by a CD-ROM, which is sold separately. Each CD-ROM provides powerful design templates discussed in the books in a ready-to-use electronic format, allowing companies and individuals to develop the databases they need at a fraction of the cost and a third of the time it would take to build them from scratch.<br>   Updating the data models from the First Edition CD-ROM, this resource allows database developers to quickly load a core set of data models and customize them to support a wide range of business functions.</span>

                    <span>I use this book all the time at work. It's a great reference. I call it my dirty little secret. It's my cheatsheet for creating good data models. I did purchase the data models on the CD that comes with this book, and one model from volume two of this series, but I rarely use them. I find that I prefer to use the books to create the high level data model and then work out the details for myself. But this book is a real timesaver.</span>

                    <span>You might be tempted (as I was, at first) to just dip into this book and use it as a source of patterns for producing data models. And if you do that, then you will find some very useful patterns as well as saving a lot of time. But that would be a shame, because by starting at the beginning and reading the whole book, I found that as well as a very comprehensive, rigourous and coherent set of models, I also got an understanding of the underlying structures and approach. And this approach has proved to be extremely useful when dealing with any new data structures. Someone described this as 'the second data modelling book you should buy', and I agree with that.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking to save time and money developing and implementing databases, look no further than this book.  The Data Model Resource Book by Len Silverston is an excellent roadmap for various data models and has served as a valuable reference for me in numerous projects.  I will continue to take advantage of this resource in the future.
<br />
<br />These data models are both practical and efficient and work in a real-world environment.  Len has over 20 years of experience and knowledge that is passed along in this book.  I highly recommend The Data Model Resource Book to anyone.

                    <span>I'm the data architect of an enterprise data warehouse for a large travel and hospitality company.  I bought Volume 1 about the same time I discovered my company was purchasing an industry-specific universal model from one of our data warehouse vendors to jump start our efforts.  The book has been an excellent reference to have alongside these models.  In some cases it verifies the purchased model and in others Len has given me an even better way to model a particular concept.  <p>The many discussions on WHY you would model an entity one way versus another are particularly valuable.  I'm not always sure how to adapt a particular part of the model to our business even after reading the discussions (mainly because I don't know enough about that part of our business yet), but the points raised in the book make me aware of things I need to discuss with the business (or look for in source systems) as I approach that area of the model.<p>The section on creating a physical model was also helpful in my decision to keep the physical model close to the logical (option #3).  I'm looking forward to picking up further physical design tips at Len's session at the upcoming TDWI conference.<p>So read the other reviews and buy the book already.  It's practical and so very helpful in getting you going in the right direction!</span>

                    <span>I personally have had great success in many large firms (Investment banking, health insurance) implementing Universal Data models based off the Data Model Resource Book. The book was a very concise useful source for the implementation of both logical, and subsequently physical data models. Some people may criticize so called generalities, but "generalities" are a subjective concept. I have personally have seen much more generic type models that where nowhere near as useful as the models in the Data model resource book. <p>The bottom line is that these models work in the real world as a jump-start for data projects. If you don't want to get caught in the mire of data modeling, buy this book.</span>
