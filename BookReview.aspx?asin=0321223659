                    <span>I bought this book thinking it would teach me a great deal about Director.  I had previous experience, but I wanted to further my learning.  Training From the Source has always came out with great books and I thought that this would be great for learning Director more in depth. This is also the required text book for a class I am taking.  And everyone is having a frustrating time with it, even the instructor.  
<br />
<br />The chapter on the 3-D game is ok, but it's the database lesson that has proved to be a major frustration.  It says at the beginning of the lesson that it takes two hours to complete.  It took me more like twelve.  I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work.  After double checking the code, I knew I didn't make any mistakes.  So I checked the lesson file that came on the disk.  It turned out that some of the sprites on the stage on the score were placed on the wrong channels.  Fortunately, I had previous experience with Lingo, and was able to fix the problem.  This book is not ideal for people new to Director. The graphing lesson and movie in a window lesson has proved to be equally frustrating.  
<br />
<br />In conclusion, if you are new to Director and want to build a basis for learning it, or even a novice who wants to build on their skills, then don't buy this book.  Like the previous reviewer said, It is a waste of time and money. </span>

                    <span>I bought this book for a college course thinking it would help introduce me to Director MX 2004.  While it does serve some purpose, you would be better off spending your hard-earned money on any of the other ones out there.  I am only two chapters into it and already I have encountered six errors, three debilitating ones that have caused a week's loss in productivity among the entire class, until our next class meeting when our professor could explain what the hell went wrong.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book mainly for 3D Memory, but realized the entire book has helped me to become a better programmer in both 3D and Lingo!  My company requested a simple interactive game to include within our leave-behind portfolio demo, so I used 3D memory as the solution. Everyone was thrilled with the outcome, including myself... the tutorial was easy to follow and worked like a charm! Thanks Dave!</span>

                    <span>I got this book for the calendar tutorial and found it quite excellent. It was very thorough and explained the Lingo code well. Now, I'm going to do the 2D space shooter tutorial as it looks like a lot of fun. I recommend this book to anyone wanting a good beginner to intermediate level book on Director.</span>
