                    <span>Although sendmail is installed in more Internet mail servers than any other Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) it has come under scrutiny for being a large awkward program by today's standards.  More and more new MTA servers are moving to a modular program like qmail that has a multitude of smaller programs for each function instead of one huge program that does everything.  This allows for greater speed and flexibility.  John R. Levine's new book "qmail: Managing Unix-Based Mail Systems" examines the qmail program in depth from installation to configuration to troubleshooting.  While qmail is fairly straightforward and you can achieve great results on both small and very large systems, it is a very different way of thinking if you are moving from sendmail and are already familiar with it.  The author recognizes this difficulty of changing the way you think and spends a good portion of the beginning of the book detailing qmail and how it works so you understand the "qmail frame of mind".  I've never setup a sendmail server and so I did not have the obstacle to overcome but I have setup and configured the postfix MTA which is also a modular type program.  With that background the book was a breeze to follow along and I was even able to download a copy and configure it correctly for my system.  The coverage was excellent and the installation and configuration information provided all the information I needed to get it up and running.  If you are thinking of building a qmail MTA you will find "qmail: Managing Unix-Based Mail Systems" absolutely indispensable and the only reference you need to get it done right the first time.</span>

                    <span>For years, any system administrator running Linux who was worth his paycheck knew that Qmail was the defacto standard for running a mail server (heck, even Yahoo uses it!).  Sendmail has always been ripe with security holes and headaches -- something Qmail has went to great lengths to correct.  However, the problem has always been there was no easy reference guide to Qmail.  You had to be either a Linux-geek, or know someone who was, to get it installed and working correctly!<p>Now, thanks to O'Reilly, even us non-geeks can get our Qmail systems up and running in no time.  This book covers everything you need to know in an easy-to-follow format.  From installation, to making the switch from sendmail, even how to tune and setup third-party components with Qmail to help control spam, scan for viruses and run your own mailing list server.<p>One of the great things about this book is it, for the most part, is not dependent on any particular flavor of Linux.  The author does a good job of making it generic enough that you can follow along no matter what distribution you use.  <p>Granted, you will need to know a bit about Linux to use read and fully understand this book.  It is geared towards system admistrators and not the end-user of a Qmail system.  However, you don't need to be a Linux Guru to understand it -- it has just enough detail to satisfy without overwhelming.<p>Overall, this is the handbook for Qmail that has been long overdue -- a one-stop technical manual that puts the final touch on Qmail.</span>
