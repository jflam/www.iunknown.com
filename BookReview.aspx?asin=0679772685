                <span id="Label1">This groundbreaking international bestseller lays to rest many myths about the Holocaust: that Germans were ignorant of the mass destruction of Jews, that the killers were all SS men, and that those who slaughtered Jews did so reluctantly. <b>Hitler's Willing Executioners</b> provides conclusive evidence that the extermination of European Jewry engaged the energies and enthusiasm of tens of thousands of ordinary Germans. Goldhagen reconstructs the climate of "eliminationist anti-Semitism" that made Hitler's pursuit of his genocidal goals possible and the radical persecution of the Jews during the 1930s popular. Drawing on a wealth of unused archival materials, principally the testimony of the killers themselves, Goldhagen takes us into the killing fields where Germans voluntarily hunted Jews like animals, tortured them wantonly, and then posed cheerfully for snapshots with their victims. From mobile killing units, to the camps, to the death marches, Goldhagen shows how ordinary Germans, nurtured in a society where Jews were seen as unalterable evil and dangerous, willingly followed their beliefs to their logical conclusion.<br><p><br>"<b>Hitler's Willing Executioner's</b> is an original, indeed brilliant contribution to the...literature on the Holocaust."--New York Review of Books<br><br><br>"The most important book ever published about the Holocaust...Eloquently written, meticulously documented, impassioned...A model of moral and scholarly integrity."--Philadelphia Inquirer</span>

                    <span>I'd like to affer a few more comments about this book.<BR>1. Several reviewers below have complained that the book is ponderously, repetitiously written. I was struck by this, too, but I can explain it. It's because it was Goldhagen's PhD thesis. That's how theses are written. To convince the examining committee you deserve a PhD, you pound out the points of each chapter repetitively. Then you stand up at your public thesis defense and do the same thing. He should have pruned for publication.<BR>2. Opinions about the culpability of the German people in the Holocaust run the gamut from "a small elite carried everything out in secret" to "they all hated Jews and participated willingly". Clearly, Goldhagen comes down towards the latter end of this continuum, and this has generated a lot of resistance here and in Germany. However, in the rejection of this strong interpretation, and in the reasonable desire not to blame the sons for the sins of the fathers, I think there is too much of tendency to go to the other extreme. Let's face it: the Nazi's plans were grandiose. They planned to mobilize history's strongest army, conquer the world, kill all Jews and most slavs, and colonize the entire east out beyond Moscow (an excellent source: "Wenn Hitler den Kreig gewonnen haette", by Ralph Giordano). This kind of plan cannot be carried out in secret by a small elite. It requires the participation of all segments of society, from workers to academics to financiers. And the Nazis got this participation, at least for the "public" part of their plans, namely world war and conquest. To imagine that the rest of their program was kept secret from, and did not have support from, a population that stood idle during public persecution of German Jews is not realistic. <BR>There's a worse problem. There seems to be a great desire to concentrate all the guilt for the Holocaust into a small group of fanatical Nazis, and this is just historically unfair. This is certainly the gist of German excuses made just after the war, and it has not really gone away as an excuse. Remember, for example, Ronald Reagan's speech at Bitburg, where he more more less absolved the entire SS. You can also perceive this in the German press, which, in its renewed interest in the Holocaust, tends to use the pronoun "they" a lot more frequently than "we" (or, more fairly, "our parents"). Hitler's ascension to power in 1933 is routinely referred to in German sources as his "siezure of power" (Machtergreifung) when it is well known that he became chancellor through democratic processes, to the cheers of nearly all. Goldhagen's book has its exaggerations and flaws, and clearly one book cannot make the definitive judgement on this historical issue. But it makes an important statement against a widely-accepted and unfair view of history.</span>

                    <span>Goldhaven is an historian with an agenda despite protestations of the opposite. The first two chapters are illuminating as they cover the narrative and political rationales for holocaust thinking. But he relies heavily on this event as a "German thing . . . " rather than a human thing. He fails to account for "other" archetypes as a human response to social and cultural conditions or the Jungian idea of transmission of the "shadow" archetype to another. Thus, Goldhaven stumbles as he indicts the "German" character as flawed and lets humanity off the hook. Indeed, he glazes over the Allies ignoring reports of the concentration camps when deciding on troop deployment.The book title promises that "ordinary" people will be the focus of the book. He goes to great lengths to prove that the police squads were not mouth foaming SS Troops or Hitler goons. Luckly Goldhaven avoids the myth of Hitleresque hypnotism as propogated first by Shirer in "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich". But the proof is self-serving. History is only useful when accuracy leads to truth. While Goldhaven is accurate, he avoids the truth of "humanity" in favor of indicting "Germanity". Thus, he folds into Jewish angst the style of which is described by Friedman in "From Beruit to Jerusalem."  Goldhaven's tome is a dream unfullfilled; like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep.</span>

                    <span>I read many of the reviews of the Goldhagen book and I am amazed at how evident people's prejudices and political views are in their opinion of it. One must be dispassionate when criticizing a book, especially when it concerns a topic of intense emotion. Most of the accusations aimed at the book are emotionally charged and have no basis in fact. The reviewers obviously have an axe to grind and are using that axe to chop Goldhagen off at the knees.<P>Many people cite Goldhagen's view as incomplete because he only focuses on the Jewish plight. He goes to extremes (repetition is annoying throughout the book) to say that he chose to restrict himself to that topic. Why isn't that assertion enough? Does it detract from his conclusions because he doesn't write about gypsies,gays, arrested clerics, Pol Pot, American Indians, or other atrocities? Each incident of genocide is specific to its place and time and deserves its own book. Goldhagen makes it clear that he did not write a generalized book. His focus was clear, even though his proof of it was diffused and overwritten. <P>I'm not an apologist for Goldhaden. I found the book to be written in a leaden manner with so many repetitious parts that I started to skim through it until I found a different topic. The book reads like a college term paper that needed to be a certain length, so the author padded out the writing to reach the assigned number of words. His use of language was utterly pedantic and stilted. It seemed as if the book was not edited very well. <P>The book was well researched. Goldhagen spent a year in Germany reading the original transcripts of the Nuremberg trials. Some Amazon reviewers faulted his research. That is ridiculous. Other reviewers dismiss the book because it focuses only on Jewish suffering. The Hitler regime, whether legally elected or not, had a specific agenda in killing Jews as its second most important policy behind the conquest of territory for<BR>"Lebensraum." Murdering handicapped people was the trial run for <BR>cleansing the German people of deficiencies that clearly focused on eliminating Jews as the main problem facing the German nation.<BR>The persecution of political prisoners, homosexuals, gypsies, and Slavs was a byproduct of Hitlerism, not a major subject as shown in his anti-semitic rantings spoken and published from 1921 onward.<P>Too many people focused on irrelevant points such as Ukraninans and others helping the Nazis. These countries have their long history of anti-semitism, but none had the extermination of one group of people as a political policy followed through with such fervor and achievement. There were other reviews that seemed to deny the Holocaust happened or play a number game refuting the six million or comparing other holocaust death counts. The less said about them the better.<P>For a diligently researched account of German anti-semitism read Klaus P. Fischer's "The History of an Obsession: German Judeophobia and the Holocaust." Education is the key to understanding.</span>

                    <span>Goldhagen committed the cardinal sin in academia: he made money. This, to me, seems to be the primary rationale for the heavy-handed dismissal encountered so often when the subject of "Hitler's Willing Executioners" comes up. <P>What Goldhagen does is present the fact that many people would rather avoid--that ordinary German condoned, supported and actively participated in the mass slaughter of European Jews. He unflinchingly presents a picture of pre-war Germany and the long line of anti-Semitic behavior present in Europe, especially Germany. There is no escaping blame under Goldhagen's view--any German who did not actively resist were as guilty as those who participated, and that, in essence, is what made the Shoah the tragedy on the grand scale that it was.<P>Goldhagen's scathing view of Germany as well as his conviction often comes across as negative, especially to those who are more willing to forgive and forget, to consign the actions of the Nazis to a different time and place. However, what Goldhagen makes evident is the truism so often repeated in Holocaust Studies: All evil requires to flourish is that good men do nothing. So it was in Hitler's Germany, and so it is in "Hitler's Willing Executioners".</span>

                    <span>I suspect that the many detractors of this book have not really read it, at least not all of it, based on their misinformed and ad hominem attacks on the author. <P>Goldhagen's premise (thesis) is pretty logical and straightforward: the palpable and continuous history of Anti-Semitism generally in Europe and in Germany particular, created the conditions for the Holocaust. Germans generally had no regard for the Jews, a distorted "cognitive model" Goldhagen calls it, bolstered by centuries of Anti-Semitic apoplexy. It's difficult to swallow, perhaps, for modern readers, that human beings could detest other human beings, or at the least, have such little regard for their annhilation, but Goldhagen provides evidence, reams of it, all of it footnoted, and unlike Finkelstein, his chief critic, Goldhagen actually knows German and has pored through hitherto neglected documentation to bolster his premise. (It is an argument, remember folks, and you can always feel free to disagree with him after you've "read" the book...)<P>He shows that ordinary Germans, despite what many scholars of the Holocaust have said, were not just people simply following orders, or who provided little or no hindrance to the killing of the Jews because they were "afraid" of the Nazis, but that they in fact actively resented and contributed willingly to their murders. How? Goldhagen gives a litany of examples -- focusing on the police battallions -- of how average and "ordinary" Germans assisted in the kinds of crimes that we liken to killers like Henry Lee Lucas. But unlike that psychopath, these were Germans (cops) who had families and children and who played sports and even went to the theater. How could they do such things? Some of the police battallions Goldhagen mentions even had the option not to perform killings, but they chose to do so, including the murdering of women and children. Why? They had been programmed to despise Jews; from the Reichstag to the church, Anti-Semitism was brayed at them constantly by German officials.<P>Goldhagen does in fact mention other genocides, other mass murders, but shows how this particular genocide was a specific and programmatic one reducible to one simple fact: the hatred of Jews. Yes, he says perhaps not every German hated them, that some even acted on their own to help them, but this evidence is drastically overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary; for every Schindler there were millions of compliant killers.<P>The book isn't perfect; it's too long, by at least a hundred pages, and as other reviewers have already commented, extremely repetitive, but Goldhagen obviously felt he really needed to hammer his points home.<P>I will next read Christopher Browning's book on the same subject (and police battallion) and see how he reaches a different conclusion, but for anybody who really wants to know why and how the Holocaust could have happened, Goldhagen is a must read.</span>
