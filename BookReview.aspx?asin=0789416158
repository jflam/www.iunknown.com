                    <span>I give this a 5-star for the fact that it's clear and understanding and will be very helpful for someone starting out or interested in motorcycles. Wether your young or older and have no background on mechanics, this book will teach you the basics, and you wont have to kill yourself trying to figure out how to do something, because this book makes it easy. Its how a  book should be. 
<br />Its for beginners of course, not for people who already know this stuff and still post bad reviews because they think there should be more, duh! what do you expect! 
<br />The author did a fine Job, my hats off to ya....</span>

                    <span>As a neophyte to mechanics, this gave me an introduction to motorcycles.  Not one to just loosen bolts and see what is underneath, this proved to be a helpful and descriptive book with illustration.  Anyone who has used and enjoyed the DK Publishing Travel Guides will appreciate the structure.
<br />
<br />Note:  There is only general information about how or why things work.

                    <span>This is a very basic maintenance book. Like someone told here, a compilation of several user's manuals. Very well illustrated, nice pics, good advices, but falls short in going into the deep issues of bike maintenance. Buy it only if you're quite new to motorcycling.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book. Contains very bright beautiful pictures, but nothing more than that for ordinary people like me. I am sure you will love this book if you are accustomed to mechanics or an engineer. If not, don buy it!!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>It is not that this book is really bad in anyway, but it is very basic and only skims the surface.  A nice little introduction, but if someone is really going to do maintenance on their cycle, they need a book specific to that bike.</span>
