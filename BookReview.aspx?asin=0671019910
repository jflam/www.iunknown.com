                <span id="Label1"><p> Adventurist Jim Wickwire, an eyewitness to glory and terror above 20,000 feet, has braved bitter cold, blinding storms, and avalanches to become what the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> calls "one of America's most extraordinary and accomplished high-altitude mountaineers." Although his incredible exploits have inspired a feature on <I>60 Minutes</I> and a full-length film, he hasn't told his remarkable story in his own words -- until now. <p> Among the world's most fearless climbers, Jim Wickwire has traveled the globe in search of fresh challenges. He was one of the first two Americans to reach the summit of K2, the world's second highest peak, the toughest and most dangerous to climb. But with the triumphs came tragedies that haunt him still. During several difficult climbs, he was forced to look on helplessly as four of his climbing companions lost their lives. A successful Seattle attorney, Wickwire climbed his first mountain in 1960. Deeply compelled by the thrill of risk, he pushed himself to the limits of physical and mental endurance for thirty-five years, before facing a turning point that threatened his faith in himself and his hope in the future. How he reassessed his priorities and rededicated his life -- to his family and his community -- completes a unique and moving portrait of one man's courage and commitment. <I>Addicted To Danger</I> is a tale of adventure in its truest sense.</span>

                    <span>All in all, this book just didn't do it for me. Wickwire's musings on life, death, religion, marriage, family, and all that stuff seem so sophomoric and flimsy--not to mention hackneyed--that I had trouble not flinging the thing across the room at various points. Not to be cruel, but the writer's views on the afterlife (for example) make Shirley MacLaine look like Gandhi. I'm genuinely happy that the writer has become a more self-realized husband and father and all that, but, frankly, I read a mountaineer's memoirs for the mountaineering, not for explicit commentary on personal stuff. <P>On the other hand, I did enjoy Wickwire's climbing narratives, at least a little. Wickwire will always be associated with K2--and probably vice versa; it is good to have his account of this important ascent in the first person. I wish the whole book had been about K2. While the title of the book is atrocious, it is the book's narratives of dangerous situations that keep the reader going (just as it seems to be, in part, the danger of climbing that keeps the mountaineer going). This book will certainly do for a rainy day or a long plane ride (or even a long, nasty bivouac), but it is nowhere near mountaineering lit. at its best. Look to Jon Krakauer or Joe Simpson for that</span>

                    <span>Addicted to Danger:A memory about affirming life in the face of death. Author:Jim Wickwire & Dorothy Bullitt Jim Wickwire dedicated his life to climbing in spite of a wife and children, along with being an attorney. Loving nature and the thrill of climbing, he always made an effort to reach the summit of every mountain. Wickwire is a man of courage. He climbed his first mountain in 1960 and never stopped until his age took him over. He traveled the entire world to attempt different and more thrilling expeditions and the dangerous encounters of each mountain he attempted. He suffered through bitter cold, blinding storms, many avalanches, and all of the friend that have died on these expeditions. In 1978 Wickwire was th first American mountain climber to reach the 28,250 foot summit of K2, which is the second highest peak in the world.<P>Addicted to Danger is for those who enjoy thrilling tales. This book is great to read. If you would like more information please feel free to email my above address.</span>

                    <span>This book, for the most part, was amazing. What Jim Wickwire has been and lived through amazes and inspires me. I myself am a climber but have certainly not done what this crazy, brilliant, and daring man has done. The only down side to this book (which is why I gave it only four stars) is the ending. Don't get me wrong I still strongly suggest you read this, it's an awesome story, every bit; until the end. At the very end it slows down and it did not strike me as interesting, but believe me, the rest of this true tale makes up for it.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the few books that I couldn't get enough of. I was under the impression that the movie K2 was a true story. When I learned only bits and pieces of it were true and major scenes were of complete fiction I had to read Jim's book to find out the truth. As it explains the expeditions to K2 it also covers many of his other expeditions, which included Marty Hoey, the Whittaker twins, Roskelley, Lou Reichardt and several more. <BR>When he covers each expedition he is brutally honest. He will point out both the best and the worst of each person. Unlike Krakauer and Anatolie who easily shred others while keeping themselves on a pedestal, Jim ... has no fear in making public his own personal faults and what should be secrets in this book for the world to see. He shares in great details his triumphs and his failures along with his strengths, guilt and weaknesses as a person. I have never read a book that was so honest and interesting at the same time. I learned the most about the names of heard of for so long just from this one book. I wish that he would write more.</span>
