                    <span>This is the only book I used to prepare for the OCP 1Z0-007 exam.  The Oracle published exam objectives were covered and the sample test questions on CD were good.  Other than one or two SQL syntax surprises, I had no problems with the exam.  This book may not be adequate if you are unfamiliar with databases, SQL, and programming as there is not alot of instructional material here.  Good luck.</span>

                    <span>This book is an update from the release 8i. Looks like the author did not take the time to properly update material, the functions chapter have missing lots of the new functions in 9i, same goes for MERGE and INSERT INTO (SELECT FROM ...) statements.<br>I was surprised some of the new 9i stuff was not even mentioned in the book.<p>Some of the examples are well explained, but there are some errors, you better test them and not take them as granted.<p>You can use this book with Sybex Introduction to Oracle 9i, both will be enough to pass exam.</span>

                    <span>Jason Couchman must be laughing his head off on his own private island.  Slap together a book full of mistakes (scripts that don't work, INCORRECT information, inane opinions,) and get it reviewed by his kindergarten kids.  Get a buddy at Oracle to whack "Officially Authorized Oracle Press" on it.... then watch the dollars flow in.<p>He didn't even both updating reference to ora81 directories.<p>Shame on you Jason.  I thought Nigerian e-mail scams were bad, but this book is just a cruel rip-off of people wanting to get somewhere in life.<p>Shame on you Oracle for giving it your blessing. <p>I may pass the exam but books such as this will not help me become a competent Oracle DBA.</span>

                    <span>I've been doing hardcore plsql development in an HR system environment for about 5 years now, and have just decided to get certified. My oracle sql experience is advanced.<p>Trust me when I say this book is garbage. How it made it off the editors desk is beyond me.<p>Here are some of the flaws that simply make my blood boil:<br>FLAW#1:<br>The review questions are completely ridculous and often do not make sense. Heres a sample question: <br>"Q: This phrase represents a multi-table query where the WHERE clause is poorly defined.<br>A: Cartesian Product"<br>How ridiculous is that??? A poorly defined WHERE clause could mean anything! A cartesian product is the result of the absence of a join resulting in all rows from both tables being joined together which is actually supported in ANSI in 9i see:CROSS JOIN, and furthermore 9i introduces ANSI-SQL1999 joins, which are written in the FROM clause!! There are dozens of vague or incorrect q&a in this book.<p>FLAW#2:<br>Table and row locks are covered in a single 10 line paragraph. Enough said? <p>FLAW#3:<br>SET TRANSACTION is a powerful statement, but he gives absolutely no example of usage. He goes as far as to give you the syntax. WEAK!<p>FLAW#4:<br>Subqueries have long been defined as "SCALAR" "NESTED" "CORRELATED" and FROM Clause subqueries are called "IN-LINE VIEWS". He doesn't define subqueries this way, and his definitions are very odd and vague, you'll especially like the review questions for which theres more than one answer, but he prefers one answer better than the other, but doesn't state why. Keyword: Multi-Column subquery.<p>FLAW#5:<br>Where did all the functions go??? Oracle has a multitude of linear regression functions, NLS, timestamp, interval, etc etc functions that are not covered here. He doesn't even mention the new datatypes such as timestamp and INTERVAL types! <p>To SUM() it all up, this book is a wretched piece of trash. Oracle apparently released it without editing it whatsoever. If this is your only study material god save your soul.<p>Do yourself a favor and pick up the SYBEX book for this exam. Good luck!</span>

                    <span>This book is a good starting point.  I used this book along with the Oracle documentation and passed the exam with 93%(53/57) on my first attempt.  The important thing is that do not rely upon just this book to pass the exam.  Like others wrote this book does not cover some of the new features like any, all etc and has many errors.<br>Make use of the Oracle's "Oracle9i SQL Reference" free documentation in addition to this book. After going through the first 10 questions of the Practice Exam 1 in this book I decided to stop.  I knew it is not worth my 2 hours. .... You can be hundred percent sure to pass the exam if you buy STS and prepare using it.  But I felt I could have passed the exam even without buying STS.  Gook luck.</span>
