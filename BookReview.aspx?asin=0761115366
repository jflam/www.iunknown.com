                    <span>No horse-lover's book shelf should be without this fantastic little book! It's jam-packed with hilarious drawings and statements that anyone that knows what it's like to care for a horse can relate to! Such a fantastic gift for anyone that likes horses, I read it nearly daily! Everything is so true!</span>

                    <span>Bonnie Timmons does indeed tell what it means to love a horse through her absolutely wonderful, whimsical illustrations and subtle warm and witty text. There's so much detail in the drawings that you simply have to look very very closely. I just loved reading the tiny text and have reread the book numerous times--naturally I had to make it my number one gift item this year for my family and all my friends. Even those who don't have horses. Bath Time, Grooming, the illustrations for designer bits, and the tiny "built-in ejector seat" saddle all make me glad I can read this book from my favorite chair! Hold Your Horses is a wonderful book and Bonnie Timmons obviously loves her horses..."no matter what"!</span>

                    <span>Hold Your Horses reads like all the conversations I've had with friends over the horse years - and those have just begun again, now that I haver retired and we have a farm and 30 horses in training. I loved this book and plan to buy at least a couple dozen for gifts for horsey friends. I know that they will all love it. Just wish I had discovered this BEFORE Christmas!</span>

                    <span>I just started riding this year and my instructor gave me this book for Christmas. The drawings and stories are so funny and completely true. So many of them relate back to lessons I have had such as mounting or the unscheduled dismount. I read it cover to cover in one sitting. This book would be a great idea for any horsey person.</span>
