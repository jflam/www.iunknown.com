This book isn't full of theory and platitudes - it has concrete steps to grow a healthy company.<P>So you've survived the start-up phase and now you find yourself in the position of "leader". Ever wonder if you're cut out for it? Ever wonder if you know what you're supposed to do? Page 220 has the answer.<P>The book has an interesting format. Lessons are built around stories from real entrepreneurs and leaders. Most chapters have surveys that can be used to gauge your organization's health and your progress as a leader.

                    <span>We are now working our way out of a recession brought on in part by new economy companies who strayed as far as possible away from the fundamentals needed to create a profitable business. This is perfect timing for a book that should serve as the bible for anyone who wants to build a truly great organization that will stand the test of time...and of profitability. A simple and quick read, this book covers the stuff that entrepreneurs ignore at their own peril, such as the vital importance of culture, the value of making planning more than just an exercise in numbers, and how focusing on your infrastructure can make it easier to get the real work done. Catlin and Matthews have done entrepreneurs everywhere a huge service with this book.</span>
