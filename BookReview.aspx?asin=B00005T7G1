                <span id="Label1">No one expected great things for the 2001 New England Patriots, and their upstart reputation persisted until the final seconds of Super Bowl XXXVI, when a winning field goal at long last established them as football's best. This rousing NFL Films production follows their entire season, beginning with a horrendous 1-3 record and the loss of quarterback Drew Bledsoe before they kept finding ways to win in a season that couldn't help but be emotional. Playing when America was attacked and went to war held a special meaning for the Patriots, who at one game paid tribute to teammate Joe Andruzzi's three brothers who work as New York City firefighters. The Patriots' postseason victories, including a memorable overtime upset in a snowstorm against the fearsome Raiders, are dramatically depicted. And 17 minutes of highlights from the Super Bowl game against the heavily favored St. Louis Rams are presented with all the devotion that only NFL Films can bring. <I>--Robert J. McNamara</I> </span>

                    <span>The NFL shows & tells us beautifully in only 65 minutes the amazing year of the New England PATRIOTS! From pre-season to Super Bowl XXXVI the NFL captures the essence of "TEAM" work & the desire to overcome the impossible, "TOGETHER!!"<P>This Official NFL Enhanced DVD Edition explodes off the Screen (especially on HDTV)!!! NOTE: this is presented in FULL SCREEN / Aspect ratio 1.33:1, w/Dolby Digital Stereo. The picture quality (outstanding detail & color), game highlights (Slow motion & multiple angle replays) & editing (quick and electrifying)are fantastic!!! This DVD & the Patriots year plays like a HOLLYWOOD staged film. <P>Outstanding job NFL for capturing the best high-lights of the best plays on film. The editing is perfect, keeping us on the edge of our seats the entire time.<P>Obviuosly a "PATRIOT FAN" DVD but avid football enthusists will be taken by the ability of a "TEAM" becoming a unified unbeatable force. The perfect Cinderella story. Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>If you are familiar with NFL films, you will be pleased with a whole season leading up to the Superbowl of all the highlights and ups and downs of the season. The special features show two songs done live at the Superbowl by U2 with a tribute to the victims of 9-11, and another short documentary of a Tribute to America, where it shows the players uniting together to remember and honor the lost lives of the 9-11 tragedy as well as uniting as one country. I would even like to say, you will get the best snapshot on still frames of the referee blunder that kept Oakland from winning the game at Foxboro in the snow. The footage is very picturesque as the snow causes havoc and perserverance from the players. Interesting enough, they film also has a short feature on the 1976 PAtriots. Another seasoned highlight of the past where the opposite circumstance happened. A bad call from the referee keeps the Patriots from going on in the playoffs during 76, and who do you think got lucky from that bad call? Thats right --- Oakland! Well balanced features and tributes, makes this DVD a good buy for football fans.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a football fan, but I remember watching the super bowl halftime because I knew u2 was performing and I just love this band. But I never expected it to be so emotional with about 3000 names of people that perished in 9/11. I cried, I couldn't help it. It was so powerful especially with u2 playing "when the streets have no name" while the huge panel of names was scrolling on the stage. I bought this DVD not because of the super bowl. I may not remember who was playing that game, or who won, but I'll never forget that moment that U2 played in memory of all those that perished in 9/11.</span>

                    <span>Okay, so I'm not COMPLETELY neutral...there were enough Michigan alums on the Patriots (especially Tom "Heart Attack" Brady) so that I was hoping they'd pull out the win. And in the most exciting Super Bowl ever played, they did.<P>This is a terrific season highlights collection from a really improbable championship run. NFL Films has always been the greatest ambassador the game has; as they have consistently managed to present the game in a way that somehow makes it seem more relevant than it truly is; the film techniques, the epic music accompanying the slow-motion sequences, the on-field microphones...really, there is no other sport that can come remotely close to American football for being as "made for film" as it is.<P>The 2001 season for the New England Patriots seemed even more epic than most...from starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe getting hurt early in the year to the interruption of play due to 9-11 (tastefully covered in a bonus feature unto itself) and Patriots guard and New York City native Joe Andruzzi's relief after finding out that his brothers in the FDNY made it out of the World Trade Center before it went down to the regular season meeting with the St. Louis Rams indicating that just MAYBE the Rams could be had to the emergence of Tom Brady as the star and eventual starting quarterback to the "tucking" of former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson and the Oakland Raiders in the last-ever game played at Foxboro Stadium to Brady's injury in the AFC Championship in Picksburgh with Drew Bledsoe stepping in to steer the team to New Orleans for the Super Bowl...and then of course the Super Bowl itself.<P>I honestly can't think of one NFL season within recent memory that has had that much excitement (once you take Michael Vick's highlights out, at any rate)...this was an incredible journey, accessorized with some choice bonus features including U2's halftime set, the 9-11 tribute, and some old skool Patriots highlights from the 1970's that are sure to bring back some memories (as well as the question as to why a team calling itself "Patriots" was doing wearing red tops instead of the Colonial blue). All-in-all, a superb production from NFL Films of a season that was truly a stand-out in all aspects of the word.<P>I will deduct a star from this rating because the Super Bowl game itself was not shown either in its entirety or in the full-length NFL Films production of that game from start-to-finish; games like that just don't come along every year; a second disc could have been included dedicated entirely to that one game (Glasgow Celtic Football Club did something similar to this regarding their 2003 UEFA Cup run; a 2nd disc was included showing their quarterfinal match at Anfield with Liverpool in its entirety...a nice touch, so we know it can be done).</span>

                    <span>U2 is the only reason this game is cool. The halftime, baby. U2 opens with Bono trying to get through the crowd to the big heart in "Beautiful Day". The crowd never stops cheering through the whole song. At the end Bono sings "MLK" and the names of 9/11 victims scroll upwards on a huge sheet. The Edge comes in perfect with his trademark guitar and that 6 courd tune in the "Where The Streets Have No Name" opening. Bono grabs his Bible and starts pacing around like a madman, praying. Finally he's like "America, AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!" The performance is emotional, for Bono. The backdrop falls to earth perfectly after some 3,000 names go up. Bono turns the mood from dark, fearful to hopeful, bright. At the end is a picture America will always love Bono for; right during the last " it's all we can do" Bono shows the inside of his jacket. It's an American flag, not a real one, that would be murdering the flag...<P>it was a beautiful day</span>
