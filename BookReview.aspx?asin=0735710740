                <span id="Label1">Wow, this is a fun book. If you spend a lot of time on Web design and suffer occasional burnout, <I>Fresh Styles</I> is the inspiration booster shot you need to get you back to the keyboard to whip up something new. Perhaps you'd like to try "gothic organic" or "pixelated punk"? Author Curt Cloninger, who's written for the Web developer forum <I>Alistapart.com</I>, defines 10 "underground" Web styles using case studies of several Web sites, and discovers what makes them not just cutting edge but marketable, too. These site designs not only mimic print design, but embrace the medium of the Web with all its flaws (browser incompatibilities, sluggish download times, varying viewer operating systems, and screen resolutions). <p>   <blockquote>All 10 of the design styles discussed in this book sprang from a dissatisfaction with the status quo, a love of the Web as a medium, and a passion for evocative, communicative design.</blockquote><p>   With such fun chapters as "1950s Hello Kitty Style" and "Paper Bag Style," hundreds of screenshots, and techniques for achieving these looks, <I>Fresh Styles</I> isn't just an inspiring kick in the pants but a cookbook/resource as well. Not everything here conforms to usability wisdom; for example, pages may not bookmark because they're in designer-defined pop-up windows or the entire site is one big Flash file. But the author encourages readers to go beyond the universally practical: "Go ahead and fiddle while Rome burns."<p>   There are ideas here you may never have thought of using. The 8-bit gifs in the "SuperTiny SimCity Style" are the opposite of most designers' layered Photoshop creations. A link points to the perfect Web tutorial on how to get them right. For the "Lo-Fi Grunge Style," think Raygun, complete with TV scan-line effects and "that smudged, misprinted look." A sidebar shows how to mimic a noisy TV signal by placing scan-line patterns on their own Photoshop layer.<p>   Grooviness is what this book is all about: groovy narrative, groovy illustrations, and a groovy layout by Carlos Segura. It's got a good vibe that makes you think that the future of the Web may not be so bleak after all. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I> </span>

                    <span>I'm a developer. I program. I make the html that makes the pretty pages. I figured that this book would help me come up with some designs (for those oftentimes rare moments that I'm given a design project).  I'd impress the boss and get more design projects. It didn't quite work out that way.<p> This book made me feel like I was in design class. A basic page and its "template" was defined, and then there were more examples that if you squint and shook your head, then you could see it fits that template.  I don't think it's so black and white.  If so, then they aren't that fresh, are they? <p> If someone is stuck for design ideas, I'm not sure this book would necessarily help since it's giving more templates.  We're trying to move away from looking like everyone else, right?  But some ideas for colors did come from this book, so that's good.<p> I enjoyed the idea of boiling down a lot of web designs into a few basic themes, templates, etc. but think that doing so might make it that much harder to break out of the box and be fresh.  Or, if you're like me, once you know the rules, you can break them more easily.<p> I also liked the little bit of a history lesson that came with this design class.  It's quite amazing what some people did with their websites back in the day, and quite amazing how not so far they have come.<p> Perhaps this book would be better for the true designer and not so much for the developer wanting to be a designer.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. I am a student in webdesign and I had no idea what to expect when our teacher asked us to buy this book. when I started flipping through it and read a bit about the gothic organic style, I fell in love instantly.<p>one problem designers often run into (including myelf), is that once we come up with a good style, we tend to use and re-use it a lot. we get too comfortable with it. this book allows you to explore other techniques and break out of your shell.<p>sure, I wouldn't follow it word for word. some things have always annoyed me, such as cross browser/platform capabilities, window sizes, loading time, functionality and so on. this book doesn't think much of it. but this doesn't mean we can't use elements of the styles described and reflect the general essence of it in our own works.<p>I challenge you to at least try each style. just make a layout and navigation scheme, with no content. just to get a feel of the style. don't think about browsers, window sizes and whatnot. then place these layouts in your portfolio and see what your potential employers think of it.<p>it is quite challenging, but the result is amazingly refreshing. this book is a must-have for every webdesigner to break out of their rut.</span>

                    <span>You CAN judge a book by its cover artwork. Yes, the cover art is supposed to make one think of Seattle grunge, but undoubtedly it also will remind you of what that refrigerator must smell like. Nice pictures, nice layout, nice presentation, but pretty much useless if you want realistic ideas that you can use, let alone implement, in the corporate world (and BTW, the corporate world does extend to rockers like the Stones). If you really want to take a look at the book, go down to your nearest Big Box bricks-n-mortar storefront and thumb through it there.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for the same reason many did, inspiration and to get out of the design rut I felt myself in.  I was tired of going onto the web design newsgroups and hearing about tables versus css and non-validating pages and usability and browser  compatibility.  <p>It was nice to see someone advocating something that might not have been coded "by the book."  That thumbed its nose at "fuddy duddy" web design.  But this book careened a little too far off the path for my taste.  <p>I was taken aback that anyone could suggest, as this book did, that the designer was being "playful" by hiding navigation elements.  This is just bad web design, no matter whether you are designing a web page for a cutting edge alternative rock band or for a law firm.  <p>The section on Sim City smashes any theories of usability all to hell.  I was literally raked over the coals in a web design newsgroup for committing the unpardonable Sin of specifying pixel sizes.  I'd love to see those same people review the sites featured in this book.  Especially any site based on the Sim City design... 8px?  Uh, yeah, RIGHT!  You sure better know who your audience is before you undertake wild site designs like most of the ones featured here.<p>And entropy8 -- or more accurately, its new incarnation, entropy8zuper.org ... I'm invoking the rule my mother taught me long ago:  If you can't say something nice....<p>I'm not sure how much this book would help anyone who designs web pages for a living.  It's a nice coffee table book, but it's not a book that will sit beside any of my other HTML or web design books.  No, they won't have it.  And neither will I.  <p>Now, I'm off to e-Bay to see if I can unload this four-day old unrefrigerated fish.</span>

                    <span>Like most books of this genre, "Fresh Styles" is useful for those in the web design business and less helpful for companies and clients that are ecommerce focused. The designs are incredibly but are heavy on graphics, images, and other elements that are frequently not beneficial to business sites. However, the book does chronicle designs that are really innovative and beautiful to look at. Very artistic and creative styles that will push the world of web design forward which it really needs at this point in time (tiring of the standard 'portal' look that is so popular).</span>
