                <span id="Label1">Nathaniel is a boy magician-in-training, sold to the government by his birth parents at the age of five and sent to live as an apprentice to a master. Powerful magicians rule Britain, and its empire, and Nathaniel is told his is the "ultimate sacrifice" for a "noble destiny." If leaving his parents and erasing his past life isn't tough enough, Nathaniel's master, Arthur Underwood, is a cold, condescending, and cruel middle-ranking magician in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The boy's only saving grace is the master's wife, Martha Underwood, who shows him genuine affection that he rewards with fierce devotion. Nathaniel gets along tolerably well over the years in the Underwood household until the summer before his eleventh birthday. Everything changes when he is publicly humiliated by the ruthless magician Simon Lovelace and betrayed by his cowardly master who does not defend him.<p>   Nathaniel vows revenge. In a Faustian fever, he devours magical texts and hones his magic skills, all the while trying to appear subservient to his master. When he musters the strength to summon the 5,000-year-old djinni Bartimaeus to avenge Lovelace by stealing the powerful Amulet of Samarkand, the boy magician plunges into a situation more dangerous and deadly than anything he could ever imagine. In British author Jonathan Stroud's excellent novel, the first of The Bartimaeus Trilogy, the story switches back and forth from Bartimaeus's first-person point of view to third-person narrative about Nathaniel. Here's the best part: Bartimaeus is absolutely hilarious, with a wit that snaps, crackles, and pops. His dryly sarcastic, irreverent asides spill out into copious footnotes that no one in his or her right mind would skip over. A sophisticated, suspenseful, brilliantly crafted, dead-funny book that will leave readers anxious for more. (Ages 11 to adult) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>The Amulet of Samarkand by Jonathon Stroud is one of the best and well-written books I have ever came by. It ties mystery and murder into fantasy in a dark tantalizing tale that will keep your nose buried in its pages for months. This book contains a young wizard, seeking revenge, a clever and ruthless master, and a djinni, a strange mystical creature living for thousands of years on end. I recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and adventure with just a quirky twist of mystery. A fantastic read.   </span>

<br />Nathaniel is a young boy when he is apprenticed to a magician for his training in the art of magic. He is very good at his chosen job, and is very advanced for his age. His hate for a young magician of considerable power when he embarasses Nat at a large party forces nat to desperate measures. He steals a magical artifact worth an enormouse sum of money from his enemy's house by the means of a Djin, Bartimaeus, that he has summoned from the other world. Bartimaeus is a high level djin who has an attitude worse than a teenager's!! Nathaniel also learns to hate his master for thinking him a stupid boy and for not recognizing his amazing talents. When Nat finds out about a plan that has been hattched by his enimies to overthrow the prime minister of England, where the book is set, he begins to realize what he has caught himself up in, and to realize that he will have to take a lot of responsibility to fix what he has done. Written from that alternating points of veiw of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus this book is very tense and funny, read it to find out more...
<br />
<br />I thought that this book was an amazing piece of literature, and that it deserves praise from all who read it. This book kept me on my toes, and I laughed, went quiet, and shouted out loud as the characters made mistakes, and found out huge secrets. I would recommend this book to fans of Eragon, LOTR, Harry Potter, and SUE. It is not tragic like SUE, but i think that Bartimaeus's point of veiw will appeal to the sense of humor of SUE's fans. This book is good for people aged 10-14, but would also be good for younger or older readers (I hate when I love a book that is meant for people older or younger than me, so this book is good for everyone!)

                    <span>I thought when i picked this up that it was going to be a lot like the Harry Potter series but I was wrong.  It's better!  It's a lot darker though.  I wouldn't recommend the book for under the age of 12 at least.  The plot (without any spoilers) involves a djinn captured by a magician's apprentice and forced to do his will to reek revenge on another magician for humiliating him.  It gives a good lesson on how vengence can do more harm than good, but overall, while the lesson does stand out, the characters are so riviting and the story is so well written it has no sense of preachiness.  Fun read!</span>
