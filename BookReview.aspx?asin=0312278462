                    <span>Yes, here we trip through a group of 1700's pirates cruising the sea, and at first really enjoying the waves, the comradeship, the nature, the heavens, and just about anything else one may enjoy on such a trip..It is a nice hallucinatory, semi sci-fi trip until it...frankly goes from the dreamlike to the grotesque to the ...well, let's just say scatalogical, to keep it simple. No doubt this odd fellow could write, but whether you want to share his truly bizarre daydreams is problematic, to be kind. Sure, he was in the same crowd as Kerouac, but universes apart! Read all of Jack K. before tripping into Burroughs! </span>

                    <span>Why this work (along with others of William S. Burroughs) is called a "novel", beats me. William S. Burroughs has a dazzling and weird imagination, but totally unorganized. He's totally unwilling or unable to narrate a story, weave a plot, bring it to a conclusion. All the story lines lose themselves somewhere between the Caribbean and the Gobi Desert, leaving the reader none the wiser. The Author's obsession for erotic hanging verging on necrophilia didn't help making me appreciate the book.
<br /> Read Lethem, Storm Constantine, Neil Gaiman instead. They write REAL novels, and very good too!

                    <span>While not nearly as engaging as Exterminator! or Naked Lunch, this shows an epic quality to his style and a tie-in centered around some ancient myth of the time before time, (when the world was advanced enough to cause its own demise) and using it as plot points for the strange tales evoked; from guerilla uprisings to life as it once was, to the pandemonium of the future. Fantastic introduction, calling on mythical demons and whatnot. Recollecting the events is, of course, foggy and chopped into so many fragments of absolute brilliance in hindsight; however not quite on top of his game.</span>

                    <span>I tried to read this book when it first came out. I couldn't <br>finish it. There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient "cities of the red night" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy. As the book goes on (as far as I read it, anyway) the main storyline becomes increasingly lost. I ultimately found it both distasteful and so muddled as to not be worth it.</span>
