                    <span>I would tend to agree with the reviewer who gave The Book of Salt a strong 3-star rating. I think in the end I liked it a little bit more than that, so came down on the side of a weak 4-star review.
<br />
<br />The Book of Salt is the first novel-length work of Truong. It has a fascinating concept. We know from history that Stein and Toklas had at different points two chefs from "Indochine". Nothing more is known. Truong picks up that point of unknown and spins it into a novel about love, identity, home and food.
<br />
<br />The most successful thing about the book is its meditation on the relationship between the subject of the story and the teller of a story. Binh is at his most interesting when it is clear that he is as unreliable as Stein at telling his own past. The layers of narration that Truong creates are fascinating and finely drawn. Whatever the flaws that the book might have, I found it delightful to read for this alone.
<br />
<br />The Book of Salt is less successful at investing Binh with enough of a character to really give the book depth. He is more a collection of traits than a person in his own right. It is not just his audience in Paris and his family back home who are projecting their issues and needs onto Binh, in the end it is the author herself. This strange shallowness is made more obvious by all of the well-written but self-indulgent prosody exploring the images of food and love. 
<br />
<br />In all, a fine first novel, and one that makes me want to read the second. The Book of Salt should appeal to readers with a taste for smart historical fiction or foodies with an eye for good description.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a wonderful read, and an escape into the era of and lives of Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice B. Toklas during a few of the years they lived in Paris. It's an interesting outsider-becomes-insider view on the famous couple, plus a bit of a love story to French cooking paired against a startlingly brutal view of the protagonist's life in Vietnam.  
<br />
<br />As some other reviewers have noted, the author's use of langauge could sometimes get a bit too flowery, and I would agree. She did an excellent job of weaving the metaphor of salt through the narrative. 
<br />
<br />This is a great book club book; there's lots to talk about.</span>

                    <span>When I first heard of this book, I thought it had huge potential. I'm a huge fan of exploring/expanding tiny clues in history, and the idea of this seemed intriguing. But what a disappointment! I could not identify with the main character at all -- he never seemed anything more than a cardboard cutout, and since I couldn't identify with him I hardly cared about what happened. So he's making a "big choice" in the first chapter, so what? This alone is supposed to keep me reading? 
<br />
<br />What did keep me reading was hope that things would improve. But they didn't. While the prose occasionally had some nice flashes, it was mainly overwrought and turgid, sometimes almost laughably so; a good editor, telling the author to lighten her hand a bit, would have made a big difference. I'm a big fan of lush, sensuous writing, but there wasn't much of that here that really worked.
<br />
<br />I also was hoping for much more interaction with the "Mesdames" -- or, failing that, more "showing" of them and their lives, and less "telling." Probably the almost total absence of conversation was meant to reflect the narrator's lack of English ability, but instead this made the book quite flat. Even in the sections where Binh talks with fellow Vietnamese, however, there is little conversation and mainly only him telling what happened. The result is more flatness. I'm not sure how this could be gotten around, but even in a story told by a first person narrator, interaction and conversation can be an important way of lightening things up. 
<br />
<br />And "insights into cooking," as advertised by a cover blurb? Not much, unless, as another reviewer said, the stilted references to salt are insight. 
<br />
<br />I hope for better from the author in her next work. This one, however, leaves me puzzled as to why it picked up such glowing reviews.
<br />

                    <span>What B. Capossere posted in another review is dead on.  The idea of the book is great but the writing is overly done.  The author seems to never have a noun strong enough to stand on its own.
