                    <span>CAUTION! The maps in this book are terrible! You can almost read them in some areas but many spots are too dark gray to be legible.<BR>The maps look like a bad black and white photo copy of a good color coded National Geographic map. The book's maps loose information because of the colored background in the original map.<BR>We went on a trail walk (to fairy falls in Yellowstone) using only this book. We walked for about 1 hour then came to a junction in the trail which we couldn't figure out. As we were looking at the book another family came along and showed us they had the same book. We both were lost!<BR>After a while using another map they had we came to the conclusion that were were about 5 miles from were we wanted to be. So we laughed and started heading back to the car.<BR>On our way back we ran into another family using this same book heading for the same place. Obviously it was not just one's person's interpretation of the book.<BR>I'm disappointed that we wasted about 2 1/2 hours but more importantly, it could have been dangerous had any of these families continued on their path using this book!</span>

                    <span>This book was small enough to fit in a day-pack, but contained a lot of useful hiking information. It ranked the hikes on difficulty as well as letting you know how gratifying they were. It was nice to know what to expect along the way, and what to look forward to.</span>

                    <span>This is the perfect book if you are new to Yellowstone and looking for a guide on what hikes to take the family on. Accurate reviews of the hikes with good directions and maps.<P>A must have.<P>I personally have over 125 days in the park and I found the book very helpfull in planning family hikes.</span>
