                    <span>Craid Utley has created a unique book that is squarely targeted at existing Visual Basic 6 programmers.  This book focuses on bridging the gap between VB6 and VB .NET, and covers the major changes with examples. <p>Unfortunately, most of those examples are not of the explanative how-to variety.  <p>This book won?t teach you how to program in VB .NET, or even how to be a better VB programmer.  It is a guide covering what?s new in VB .NET.  <p>On the plus side, it does give one of the best (in layman?s terms) definition of .NET I have seen yet.</span>

                    <span>Granted I consider myself an experienced VB Programmer from VB6.  I picked up a copy of this book and Visual Studio.net and was developing ADO.net enabled stuff easy.  Multithreading is also done exceptionally well in this book.  Web Services is something I will have to try next as well, and that chapter looks good as well.<p>In short this book is not for those who are starting out, but rather those who are veterans in the industry who know the VB syntax and want to try all the best that Visual Basic.net has to offer.</span>

                    <span>This book is compact and to the point. If you are a VB6 developer who wants to go .NET, this is the best place to start. The books includes no bs, just content. The Author clearly knows what we VB6 developers need, a smooth transition between DNA and .NET, and provides it in a relatively small 300+ page book. This book is more valuable than any wrox book on the topic. Wrox is a great publisher, but sams stoled their food this time. WARNING: This book wouldn't be classified as an "advance" book, but a instead, one that makes it easier to work with all the new technology. This is were all current VB Developers should start.</span>

                    <span>This is a tribute to how books of this sort ought to be written.  The title might better read 'A VB programmer's guide', however, because it bridges the gap between 'traditional' VB and VB.NET. Clear, consise, and comprehensive,  the author is obviously experienced in his craft. Professional programmers especially will appreciate this crisply-written volume.</span>
