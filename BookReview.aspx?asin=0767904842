                    <span>I'm happy to say that I was recently engaged.  With that I've been considering the idea that I'm now going to be sharing every piece of my life w/ someone else.  And honestly, the idea that there will be 2 heads knocking together, especially financially, instead of self-dependency was a scary idea.
<br />So I went shopping around the store and opted to buy this book by David Bach because of some of the passages I read while waiting around.  And I'm happy I did.
<br />First, Mr. Bach is (from I've read) a successful financial planner w/ an earnest heart towards truly giving competent advice.  And it's apparent as you read the book that he just wants you to make the right decisions in life for you and yours.
<br />Some of the biggest take-aways for me were the values he espoused in order to ensure that you're living according to the ideals you and your spouse share; and the importance of teaching your child the benefits of saving at an early age.
<br />Sure, there are plugs w/in the book, but nothing so annoying that it detracted from the overall reading.  Great buy, give it a shot.  I'm not married yet, but I feel my fiancee and I already have a headstart not everyone's lucky to have.

                    <span>I am not a financial expert & I don't claim to be, but after watching David Bach on Oprah I was intrigued. I bought his book & read it cover to cover, at least 3 times. I made my husband read it. This book really helped me realize that we were not living according to our values. Since we started folowing the suggestions in David's book & living according to our values we have finally gotten out of debt completly, are putting money away into our retirement & within a year will be buying our first house. All of this before we turn 30! I am so glad I watched Oprah's show and saw David Bach. Reading his book even encouraged me to take more of an interest in investing and learn the difference between all those IRA's etc. This is a great book!</span>

                    <span>My husband and I have read and recommend all David Bach's books. They helped us achieve our goal of getting rid of our debt (not including our mortgage) within one year.  He has a practical system that is simple to put to use.  We have always struggled with our finances and have no skills in this area, but following his plan helped us organize ourselves and utilize the things he taught. We have hope now where there wasn't any and see possiblities where there was once only frustration.

                    <span>_____This book is great to have if you are a novice to the world of personal finance.  The text is geared toward married couples, but that doesn't mean a single person cannot read it and learn a lot from it (i.e. the advice generally applies to either singles or couples, with some extra information for couples).<p>_____The information contained is truly minimal when you compare it to many other books on the shelves.  But for a novice I think that is good - Bach himself stresses that the information is meant to present to the reader the aspects of personal finance, while providing links to sources for more detailed information.<p>_____While I agree that pretty much all of the information contained can be found for free on the internet, the value of this book is in the fact that it contains brief synopses of that information, all gathered into one place, with the added bonus of providing a purpose for all the different aspects of personal finance.  Not just "what" and "where," but also "how" and "why."</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book to use when planning your family's finances.  Obviously, given the power of compounding, to which the author repeatedly refers, the earlier in your life you start planning for your financial future, the better off you will be.  I recommend the book to anyone with the understanding that it follows a conservative, fairly conventional path toward financial security.<p>If you are a finance whiz, you will find parts of the book too conservative and too plain.  If you try to magnify your investment returns by trading options, for example, or you invest in real estate, or any other kind of investment other than 'plain vanilla stocks and bonds' you will find the book limiting.<p>That said, the book provides an excellent organizational structure for any one trying to get a hold on his financial picture.</span>
