                <span id="Label1">Originally published to wide critical acclaim in France, where it elicited comparisons to Art Spiegelman's <b>Maus</b>, <b>Persepolis</b> is Marjane Satrapi's wise, funny, and heartbreaking memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah's regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran's last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. <br><i><br></i><b>Persepolis</b> paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran: of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life and of the enormous toll repressive regimes exact on the individual spirit. Marjane&#8217;s child's-eye-view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, <b>Persepolis</b> is at once a story of growing up and a stunning reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, through laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity.  And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.</span>

                    <span>Persepolis is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi told in graphic novel form. It can most easily be described as a combination of of Maus and The Diary of Anne Frank. However, it is much more than that. It is a book that stands on its own with an account and lessons that are both unique and deeply personal. <P>At its most basic level, Persepolis is a history of Iran. It begins with an introduction which recounts a brief history of Iran from its founding until the Islamic Revolution. The story of the Satrapi family then takes over. It reveals how a relatively progressive family must cope and change every aspect of their lives under an increasingly oppressive regime. This story is told from the eyes of a fiercely independent young girl. She must not only deal with the normal circumstances of growing from a child to an adult, but she also has to grow up dealing with Iran's Islamic Revolution and its war with Iraq. She must learn to deal with the imprisonment and "disappearance" of many people who she knows and knows of. She must also cope with having to hide the person she is since most of her interests and thoughts are illegal in her country.<P>I read a review of this book several months ago and knew I just had to read it. It turned out to be much more than I ever thought it would be. Although it is an "easy read" and in comic book format, the emotions and thoughts of Satrapi and the people around her come through quite poignantly. I recommend this book for the story it tells and the emotions it conveys. I believe it will be enjoyable to people of many ages and backgrounds. I can't wait to read the sequel!</span>

                    <span>The subject matter is brave while the illustrations are unconventional and smart. In PERSEPOLIS, Marjane recounts her childhood of growing up in Tehran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. There is no doubt that Marjane has experienced more during her nine years than many have during their entire life in this country. Being raised by two forward-thinking parents, Marjane is provided a progressive glimpse into the political and cultural events occurring around her in Iran. But she is different than most Iranian children. She rebels against wearing the veil, is a fan of Western pop culture, and speaks out against fundamental doctrines during religion class. It is amazing that she (or her parents) weren't seriously reprimanded for their actions and beliefs. Marjane even attends a demonstration with her parents against the wave of religious fundamentalism engulfing Iran.<P>I truly loved PERSPOLIS because it provided a rare glimpse of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. I learned much about this very different culture while empathizing with her unique family. I feel as if I know them personally. Marjane's illustrations tell a thousand words. They are simple yet innovative and clever. I can't wait to read the next installment in this series and hope it is published soon. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>"Persepolis" marks the third book in the almighty triumvirate of great autobiographical graphic novels that examine injustice. Joining the ranks of "Maus" by Art Spiegelman and "Palestine" by Joe Sacco, "Persepolis" has garnered a remarkable amount of attention. Positive attention, that is. Suddenly it's getting high marks in everything from "Entertainment Weekly" to "VOYA: Voice of Youth Advocates". I wonder to myself whether or not author/artist Marjane Satrapi has been surprised by the mounds of attention. I also wonder how it is that she was able to take her own life story and weave it seamlessly with the history of her own country, Iran. This book is like an illustrated version of "Midnight's Children", but far darker and far more real.<BR><BR>The first image in "Persepolis" is the same image you see on its cover. Marjane sits wearing a veil in 1980 for the first time. As the story continues, Marjane explains her own beginnings as well as the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution". In her own life, Marjane was an only child of middle class intellectual parents. She experienced the usual childhood ups and downs. Sometimes she believed she was God's next chosen prophet. Other times she wanted to demonstrate with her parents in the street against the Shah. Over the course of her childhood Marjane learns more about the limits of class in Iran as well as the secrets behind her family history. She finds that her grandfather was a prince, her uncle a political prisoner for years, and her parents far braver than she ever expected. Marjane deals with the danger of challenging authority under the rule of religious extremists while growing up as a normal girl. By the end, her parents determine that the only thing left to do is to send their only daughter to Vienna and Marjane must face a future without them by her side.<BR><BR>Before I read the book I scanned the illustrations and found them lacking. I thought (originally) that they were too simplistic to effectively convey a deep plot and deeper discussion of the human propensity for violence (and good). After reading the first page I discovered that this assumption, while normally correct, was wrongdy wrong wrong wrong. Yes, it's certainly true that Satrapi's style is simple. At the same time, it's also the ideal companion to the piece. In a book such as this you do not want to draw attention away from the narrative voice with inappropriately overdone illustrations. As for the writing itself, it's engaging to even the most reluctant reader. And what better way to teach people a little Iranian history? Quite frankly, I was baffled by some of the things I discovered here. I consider myself a lightly educated middle class individual. I know a little more world history than joe schmoe down the street, but not much more. Nonetheless, after reading roughly five pages of "Persepolis" I discovered, to my chagrin, that I know jack squat about Iran. Were you aware that Iranians are not, in fact, Arabs? How about the roots of the Cultural Revolution? How much do you know about that? Or the day to day routines of people living in Iran in the 1980s? No?<BR><BR>Today we the American people live in a country where our rulers like to toss about phrases like, "Axis of Evil", and condemn entire countries with a single blow. What "Persepolis" does so (apparently) effortlessly is to put a human face on inhuman suffering. Iranians have been through more horrors than can be recounted in a single book. I think what struck me the hardest about this story was the little things. The stories about girls in school skipping class to flirt with boys. Discussions with other kids about farting from kidney beans. Punk rock and Michael Jackson. All this took the book from being a personal voice of a nation's struggle to the point where your average reader identified deeply with the characters. The final image in this book is heart breaking. I only hope I have the guts to get "Persepolis 2" and read it cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>As an iranian who has lived in similar years as Marjane is talking about, I could totally relate to what she says...This book is so refreshing, deep, and at the same time simple ... I could not put it down, and forced my self to read less so I would not have to wait too long for the second volume to come out... But no, I finished too fast and I'm waiting now... maybe I could start reading the french version...</span>
