                    <span>David W. Mount is a terrible writer.  I can't believe how much of a chore this book is to read.  His sentences, in my opinion, are ambiguous and I find myself backtracking unnecessarily.

                    <span>This book is written for biologist who mistakenly believe that  bioinformatics problems can be can be solved without mathematics, statistics and computer science. The author knowingly avoids these important components of the bioinformatics equation in his presentation and as a result several problems arise. The most noticeable is that the book is almost incomprehensible. David Mount and his editors must realize that verbal descriptions in place of mathematical formalism will not lead to an understanding necessary to solve bioinformatics problems and advance the field. David Mount and authors of similar books will be responsible for raising an entire generation students who can merely repackage preexising software packages and provide ad hoc(theoretically weak)solutions to bioinformatics problems.</span>

                    <span>In short, the author does not have enough writing skill to write this text book.<p>I purchased this book a while ago. At that time, the book was really difficult to read. I thought that it is because I do not have enough knowledge to understand the material. So I stopped reading this book and studied bioinformatics by other means.<p>After gaining enough knowledge in bioinformatics, I re-opened this book, and it is funny to find that I still have the same amount of difficulty in understanding what the author wrote about topics that I have already built good understanding. Reading this book will only deteriorate one's understanding.<p>Several years ago, only just a few books were available on the market, so one needed to purchase this book. These days, there are lots of varieties to choose, and any choice is likely to be better than this book.</span>

                    <span>While this book may, and I stress the word may, contain useful information, it is so badly written that it is incomprehensible.   Dr. Mount seems to believe that ten words are better than one, making "Bioinformatics" very tedious to read.  After awhile I felt like I was reading a Victorian novel.<br>  Despite being wordy, the explanations are too brief and not clear.  If you don't know what he is talking about before hand, you will never understand what he is explaining.  He uses an excess of words, and rarely provides a clear, concise example of what he is referring to (or if he does it is in another chapter in the book).<br>  It also appears that the book was never edited.  For example, when trying to define "ortholog" and "homolog," he writes two opposing definitions for ortholog and none for homolog.  Clearly this is a mistake and Dr. Mount accidentally used the word ortholog twice while meaning to use ortholog once and homolog the other time (pg 56).  While it can be argued that this mistake is unimportant and the reader can look up the definitions, it makes me wonder what else in the book is wrong that I have no way of detecting (until I waste a bunch of time doing something incorrectly).</span>

                    <span>This book will give you very strong foundations in <br>the basics of computation in the bio world. Though<br>this book does not give details of the computation<br>methods, it does give a very clear picture of math-<br>ematics and the science involved. <p>This book has a good coverage of FASTA and <br>BLAST. (Though a little bit short)<p>The programming techniques coverd are bare. Though<br>concepts like searching sequences using dynamic p-<br>rogramming are covered, you are better off reading <br>something like Proteome Research by wilkins et al.<p>I am yet to find a good book that deals only with<br>the technical and programming aspects of bio informatics<br>if you do find some thing interesting lemme know.<p>On the whole this book helped me understand a lot <br>about sequencing, alignment and prediction. The illustrations<br>and pictures provided are good and the text to the point.<p>If you are reading this review pls understand that I am <br>primarily a programmer trying to get into the <br>bio informatics business. I do not have any schooling<br>or degree or even experience in the bio informatics world.<p>Hope this helps<p>Santy</span>
