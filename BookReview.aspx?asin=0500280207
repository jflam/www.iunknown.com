                    <span>I agree with the reviewer from England who stated she was trying to find inspiration for decorating her home and could not find it in this book. This book is 80% text - extremely well written and researched - but only 20% pictures. Those pictures are many times small, black and white, and sketches - not photos at all. The photos that are here, many are truly stunning. But they are of movie sets, ship interiors, large buildings, etc. I was hoping for a book which would have one full color photographed page of floor lamps, another of wall sconces, ceiling lamps, furniture, hardware for cabinets, etc., each on its own page so I could get some inspiration. A section dedicated to photographs of walls and how they were stenciled so I could see many different designs would have been terrific. If I can, I am going to return the book. It was of no use to me. I would suggest ordering a book or two from Dover, which is far less [money] and might have more colors and designs for inspiration.</span>

                    <span>I am still looking for a book that will help me decorate my 1930's home in its original style, and this book isn't it. It does have some good photographs etc from the period of more stately homes, but for the average home it's not much help at all. Disappointing.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book on art deco interiors. The chapters are ordered beginning with the origins of art deco and finishing with the art deco revival of recent times. It contains many pictures (some old ones are in black and white, the rest in colour) and it is nicely conceived, written and designed. Not only home interiors are covered but also all kind of public places, hotels, train stations, churches, trains, ships. In one word: excellent.</span>

                    <span>The author does a fine job of compiling the broad spectrum of Art Deco styles from simple lines to eye popping detail, focusing of course on interiors. Both residential and commercial buildings are included in the book's repertoire. This is really not an attempt at a scholarly historical work although the historical aspects of the style are not ignored. More to the point, this book is a lot of fun to look at and exposes the reader to the richness of the Art Deco pallette.</span>

                    <span>I searched through all of the Art Deco books and decided on this one. I am decorating my home in the Art Deco style of the 1920s and 1930s and have found a source for unlimited decorating ideas. I haven't found another book with so many great pictures. Not many people realize that true art deco is from the 1920s and 1930s and not the 1950s. It's hard to find a book like this one that focuses only on the true art deco form.</span>
