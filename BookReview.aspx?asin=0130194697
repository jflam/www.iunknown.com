                <span id="Label1">Lots of circumstances conspired to make information technology what it  is today. Business decisions (both wise and foolish), scientific discoveries  (both old and recent), marketing campaigns (founded both in truth and  otherwise), and plenty of random chance have played parts in defining the  industrial, social, and cultural phenomena that personal and business computing  have become. <I>The Essential Guide to Computing: The Story of Information  Technology</I> tells the technical, commercial, and social stories behind the  electronic computer and related technologies, such as telecommunications and  software development. Along the way, author E. Garrison Walters reveals a lot of  general knowledge about computers. This book is highly readable. It's  essentially a general-interest nonfiction book, and a good one, at that. <p>  As you read this book, you can't avoid picking up the little technical facts  that have become part of our culture, particularly its younger parts. What's an  embedded operating system? What's object-oriented programming? What is the  open-source movement? Walters teaches you enough about these subjects--and the  ways in which they fit together--to enable you to speak intelligently about them  and perform further research, as your needs require. You'll enjoy this book,  regardless of your level of computer expertise or your area of specialization,  because you're sure to learn something and enjoy the process. <I>--David  Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The state of the art in electronic computing, data  storage, and data communications, in a historical context. The operations of  processors, memory chips, persistent storage devices (e.g., disks), and other  hardware subsystems. Software development--including compression, encryption,  and the challenges and promise of parallel computing--receives attention. Ditto  for network communications infrastructures, protocols, and applications. It's  all explained in detail and with style.</span>

                    <span>There is a great breadth of information presented in a very lucid fashion. The material is easy to understand, and the author adds a great sense of humor. <br>  However, with the rapid advancements in technology, the book is a bit dated.

                    <span>With 6+ years marketing management experience and an MBA, I feel this book was very helpful in understanding the many facets of technology and its evolution through time.  The book is a must read for anyone who needs to build or brush up on a solid but basic understanding of technology.  However, many of the newest trends in technology are only briefly covered.  This is due, I believe, to the fact that many of the pervasive technologies and collaborative applications now being pushed in the marketplace didn't make the editor's draft of the book even though the published date is 2001.</span>

                    <span>THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO COMPUTING is simply an extraordinary achievement. It reflects a breadth of knowledge and clarity of presentation that is remarkable. It makes every effort to distill knowledge about computers and computing in an easy, reader-friendly, memorable way. For computer users everywhere -- in organizations, schools, colleges and universities, and individuals -- this volume gives multiple ways of getting to know more about computing in its fast changing environment. First, you get to know the foundations of how computers and computing works in practical, everyday language. Second, you get a reference book that explains key terms, key workings, and key interconnections among the parts.<p>The most noteworthy aspect of the book is its superb coherence in presenting vast amounts of computing knowledge arranged in for easy understanding. Information and explanations in one chapter are referenced in subsequent ones, never failing to explain connections among them, with a view to present an overall picture of how computers and computing works. <p>Each chapter highlights technical terms related to computing and information technology, provides an overview of specific aspects as for example "An Overview of How Storage Works" (Chapter 2, p.40), and highlights in grey explanations of widely used terms such as "Disks From a User's Perspective" (p. 56). Each chapter also ends with a summary list of questions that focus on self-evaluating one's grasp of the chapter's contents.<p>E. Garrison Walters' book will continue to enrich the understanding of all who enjoy working with computers at work or for pleasure. I wish this book had been available to guide me in computing long before I found it, and, that I had written it ! It is a remarkable achievement!</span>

Admittedly, and while not a computer professional, I bring 6 years of pretty intensive self-directed study of computers to my reading.  Still, for even the rankest beginner, this book is a marvelously clearly written, wide-in-scope and, believe or not, at times very funny, treatment of how computers work.  I recommend it whole heartedly.</span>

                    <span>This book is a stunning tour de force.  It covers the full breadth of computer technology, from the BIOS to Internet security, in surprising depth. The writing is concise and lucid.  The page layout, with highlighted "Tech Talk", side bars, neat tables and crisp graphics, is easy on the eye and persuasive to the mind.  The contents favor microcomputers.  Half of the book is devoted to their hardware and software.  The rest is a thorough study of Networks and the Internet.  A partial listing of chapters indicates the breadth of coverage: "Memory, Storage, and Input/Output", "Silicone Economics", "Microcomputer Operating Systems", "Databases, Applications, and Software Reliability", "Digital vs. Analog: Communications Basics", "Types of Networks", "The Internet and Network Security".  The depth is shown by a list of sections of one chapter: "Programming Terminology", "Structured Programming", "Programming Languages by Level", "Object-Oriented Programming", "Programming Tools".  The technical development, occasionally quite demanding, is interspersed with engaging historical tidbits.  The Glossary is extensive, the Recommended Reading list is commented, the 13-page index appears complete.  An invaluable source of information and insight for all who are involved with computers: professionals, educators, students, and laypersons.</span>
