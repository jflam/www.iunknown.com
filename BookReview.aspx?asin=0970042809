                    <span>i bought this for my riddle-crazy 11-year-old, and it has drawn in her 14- and 18-year-old sisters and me as well.  the level of the riddles is not too hard for an 11-year-old, but not too easy for an adult.  the layout of the book is engaging, and the way the answers are arranged at the end means that when looking up one answer it is hard to accidentally read the answer to the next one.  absolutely perfect.</span>

                    <span>This book is the pinacle of riddle fun!  I popped like a spring chicken when I bought this book because it's so small, but HUGE with entertainment and mind-titilating fun.  Most riddle books are really joke books, but this one is the REAL THING!  There are hours of enjoyment and tons of mind-stumping exercises- Great for the whole family!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I'm a riddle fanatic.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of riddles.  This book kept me busy for hours! The illustrations and the design are great too. This book makes a great gift for people of any age and is great at parties!  It would be great if the authors did a follow-up book.</span>

                    <span>This is a fabulous book to entertain both child and parent. As a psychologist, I recommend this book to families as an activity that parents can do with their children. It is one of those rare activities that engages  all ages and that often children are quicker at than their parents. My  children and I have had great times trying to solve the riddles and we are  still trying to solve some of them This is a great gift to give any child  or family--they can be assured to share many enjoyable hours using it.</span>

                    <span>This book puzzles the minds of 5 to 85 year olds and everyone wants to try solving the problems.  We got several extra copies and gave them to a family with children ranging from 5 to 13, to a 17 year old, and to a  middle school teacher.  They were all immediately fascinated and lost in  the book.  Be sure not to look at the answers - it's much more fun to solve  the problems. Great puzzles to take to work as well!  I highly recommend  the book for good famly time.</span>
