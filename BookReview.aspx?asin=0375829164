                <span id="Label1">Roy Eberhardt is the new kid--again. This time around it's Trace Middle  School in humid Coconut Grove, Florida. But it's still the same old routine:  table by himself at lunch, no real friends, and thick-headed bullies like Dana  Matherson pushing him around. But if it wasn't for Dana Matherson mashing his  face against the school bus window that one day, he might never have seen the  tow-headed running boy. And if he had never seen the running boy, he might never  have met tall, tough, bully-beating Beatrice. And if he had never met Beatrice,  he might never have discovered the burrowing owls living in the lot on the  corner of East Oriole Avenue. And if he had never discovered the owls, he  probably would have missed out on the adventure of a lifetime. Apparently,  bullies do serve a greater purpose in the scope of the universe. Because if it  wasn't for Dana Matherson...<p>  In his first novel for a younger audience, Carl Hiaasen (<I>Basket Case</I>, etc.) plunges  readers right into the middle of an ecological mystery, made up of endangered  miniature owls, the Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House scheduled to be  built over their burrows, and the owls' unlikely allies--three middle school  kids determined to beat the screwed-up adult system. Hiaasen's tongue is firmly  in cheek as he successfully cuts his slapstick sense of humor down to kid-size.  Sure to be a hoot, er, hit with middle school mystery fans. (Ages 10 to 15) <I>--Jennifer Hubert</I></span>

                    <span>Hoot, by the creative Carl Hiaasen is one of my most favorite and well enjoyed books I've ever had the opportunity to dive into. Set in the environmentally sensitive and rich paradise of Florida- Coconut Grove to be precise, this setting is perfect for the book. Roy, a young boy is picked on to no end by the brawny Dana Matherson. Roy has only a select few friends and is the punching bag for Dana whenever he deems right. One day he deemed it right to shove Roy's face against the window of the school bus where he sees a barefooted boy jetting down the street. Roy doesn't just brush it off, like most would, the thought is lingering in his head all day of a boy with charcoal colored feet running amazingly fast- somebody he's never seen. Roy, a tall, quirky girl named Beatrice and her brother- the barefooted mystery boy nicknamed Mullet Fingers (who eventually beats up Dana) band together to stop a new Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House from being constructed after they discover a burrown of adorable endangered owls on the construction site. Mullet Fingers is extremely dedicated to saving this last piece of serenity in a tourist-bustling town "Ever since I was little... I've been watching this place disappear - the piney woods, the scrub, the creeks, the glades. Even the beaches, man - they put up these giant hotels and only goober tourists are allowed. It really sucks." In order to stop the bulldozers the three set pranks on the site's construction supervisor- Curly including putting baby alliagtors in the portapotty and poisonous snakes all over the grounds. Curly hires a group of guard dogs to watch over the premises, but even that too is no match to the effective thinking of Mullet Fingers. After days of constant pranks, stalling of the construction, discontent with management at Mother Paula's the new building is in danger of being cancelled. What was so surprising is the fact that Mother Paula's knew about their existence. Then a string of great events happens and the three get what they want- I would elaborate, but the ending is too good. I recommend Hoot to anybody who wants a good read and a fast one chock full of humor and environmental conscience and stewardship. I wish everyone on Earth was this environmentally conscience and we wouldn't have global warming, endangered species and so on- a masterpiece.

                    <span>* Hoot, Carl Hiassen, Knopf books. *
<br />	Hoot by Carl Hiassen is about a famous pancake company that plans on building a large pancake house in a small Florida town. What this company knows is that there are a lot of pancake lovers and they will get a lot of business in this town. What they don't know or say that they don't know is that there are many helpless families of tiny owls burrowed under the construction site on which they plan on building the pancake house. This book is a book about one boy who loves these owls. He does everything he can to delay the process of building the pancake house. His sister (Beatrice) and his friend (the main character, Roy) help him to fulfill his goal in saving the owls. These characters face many obstacles along the way, but they don't give up and they are very persistent until they get what they want. Roy and Beatrice end up doing more than this boy expects. Hoot by Carl Hiassen full of exciting adventure and hilarious humor.
<br />	The main character in this book is Roy. Roy is an ordinary boy, a kind boy, and he has a clever touch to him. He is not very popular because he is the new boy. He only has one friend who is the class clown. He makes friends with Beatrice and the running boy as the story goes on. The boy who delays the work at the construction site to save the owls has no name. He is sometimes called the running boy because of his incredible speed and he is also called mullet fingers because he can grab a mullet (fish) out of the water with his bare hands. Mullet fingers does not go to school although his mother thinks he dose. She doesn't like him and she tries to send him off to a boarding school far away. He runs away and lives in an abandoned ice cream truck. Beatrice is the running boy's sister. She is very athletic and an amazing soccer player. Even though all of these characters have many differences, they all love the owls, which eventually makes them all friends.
<br />	I strongly recommend the book Hoot to boys and girls. If you like books with action and humor you will most likely like the book Hoot. It is very hard to stop reading this book once you start reading it. When I was reading Hoot I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, it held my attention fast because it was so unpredictable what was going to happen next. There were many exiting surprises in this realistic fiction book.</span>

                    <span>Roy(New kid) moved to florida and has been having some trouble with this bully at school Dana Matherson(Mean kid). When Roy smacks Dana in the nose he runs of the bus and sees another kid running and runs after him.He finds out the kid goes by Mullet Fingers(cause he can catch a mullet). Beatrice(Mullet Fingers stepsister) teams up with Roy to help Mullet Fingers save the endangered owls. So officer Delinko(dumb police officer)and Carl(buliding manger) wont bulid a Mother Paula's Pancake House(restaurant)over the owls home. Will they safe the owls or will there be another dumb pancake place in town. That is for me to know and you to find out when you read this really good book. I liked this book cause it made me laugh alot and everyone would love it. I gave it four stars cause it sometimes got boring talking about owls.</span>

                    <span>Friends are forever.  Everyone says these three little words at some point in their life.  Most of the time people will say these words to their best friend when their kids, but a lot of friends end up not being friends forever.  Different reasons keep people from being friends forever, and one of those reasons is because people move and drift apart.  Roy Eberhardt knows how it feels to move and leave his friends, but he also knows how it feels to make new ones.  
<br />
<br />Roy Eberhardt's family just moved to a small town in Florida from Montana, due to Mr. Eberhardt's job.  Roy doesn't like Florida because it is nothing like Montana.  Roy also has trouble making friends, for some reason everyone wants to pick on him.  That is until he meets Beatrice Leep and her stepbrother, Mullet Fingers.  Mullet Fingers seems like a troublemaker at first, until Roy finds out why he makes all the trouble.  So Roy and Mullet Fingers set out to save something that know one believes can be saved.
<br />
<br />It is through Roy and Mullet Fingers experiences that Roy makes new friends, discovers new interests, and learns to care for less advantaged beings.  Roy's experiences give him a new hope for a better life in Florida.
<br />
<br />Sometimes the best decisions you can make you make without even thinking about making them.  Carl Hiaasen gives us a chance to think about what we could do for others to make their lives easier and to make our lives less boring and more fulfilled.  Hiaasen also shows us how to deal with anything life wants to throw us.
<br />
<br />This is a great book for anyone to read.  This book shows people the good and bad in this world, and it also shows us what we can do to make this world better.  Plus, there is excitement, worry, and surprises in this book that will make you want to read page after page.  HOOT is a great book that is written for anyone of any age to read.
