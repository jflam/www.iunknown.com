                <span id="Label1">Ursula K. Le Guin's extraordinary writing primer is full of charm, wit, and opinion. Le Guin likens writing to "steering a craft," and as one reads through this volume, one has the sense of floating down a river, with the waves of Le Guin's words lapping at one's craft. Le Guin veers sharply from the mainstream of contemporary writing manuals by challenging their very definition of story. While it is common to "conflate story with conflict," Le Guin writes, she finds that limiting. "Story is change," she says. While that change may be the result of conflict, it is just as likely to evolve from "relating, finding, losing, bearing, discovering, [or] parting." Le Guin demonstrates this complexity with well-hewn excerpts from the works of such writers as Jane Austen, Mark Twain, J.R.R. Tolkien, Charlotte Bront&euml;, and especially Virginia Woolf. The many aspects of fine fiction writing Le Guin addresses here include the role of the narrative sentence (its "chief duty [is] to lead to the next sentence--to keep the story going"); avoiding exposition doldrums ("break up the information, grind it fine, and make it into bricks to build the story with"); and the concept of "crowding and leaping." While prose should be "crowded with sensations, meanings, and implications," don't forget that "what you leave out is infinitely more than what you leave in."<p> Accompanying Le Guin's text is a handful of clever writing exercises, each as enticing as its name. Among them are "I am Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez," which requires writing with no punctuation; "Chastity," which challenges one to write without adjectives or adverbs; and "A Terrible Thing to Do," which proposes taking an earlier exercise and cutting it--by half. <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>I am sad to say that I was disappointed by this book. I thought I had found a real gem here. Instead, I find that Ms Le Guin does not steer right here. I think that writing books can be split up into four categories: books about how to overcome block and get inspiration, grammar and usage books, books about the craft of writing, and specialised genre writing books. Ms. Le Guin tries to write a book that covers all of them. Sadly, the book is just to short for what she tries to do and what could have been a great book just fizzles outAdmittedly, several chapters are outstanding, like the ones on narration and point of view, but others fall flat, like tho one on adjectives and adverbs.
<br />Ms Le Guin has written some really good books; Wizard of Earthsea, Left Hand of Darkness, Four Ways to Forgiveness, The Word for World is Forest, etc. She has ended up with a crowd of adoring fans for whom she can do nothing wrong. And frankly, she seems to have started believing in her own myth - she herself believes she can do nothing wrong, and it shows.</span>

                    <span>"Steering the Craft" is a surprisingly good and practical book on creative writing.  I was surprised because books and essays on writing by established authors can be downright patronizing and intentionally vague.  Le Guin, on the other hand, uses lucid language and a gentle tone to explain the essential elements of good prose writing.  The examples she uses are eye-opening, perhaps because I keep seeing the same examples from the same group of contemporary authors in most recent books on writing.  Her exercises are also innovative, especially those intended to help fiction writers recognize the subtle "music" in prose, and how that is different from poetry.  Scattered throughout the book are several opinion pieces where Le Guin discusses various trends in contemporary prose writing.  This is where you decide whether her book is right for you--Le Guin definitely has some strong views: she believes that immediacy of the present tense narrative is an illusion and is equally skeptical about hybrid genre prose.  If you are in agreement with her or can live with those views, then I have no qualms about recommending this little gem.</span>

                    <span>I've been a big fan of Ms. LeGuin's for a very long time.  This book on the craft of story telling has been extremely helpful.  I'm a lawyer and I write stories on behalf of endangered species every day:  now I hope to write them better!  I strongly advise a re-read of Strunk and White (I've found used copies for about 85 cents in San Francisco) in conjunction with her book.  <br>If you're a LeGuin fan, just read it for pure enjoyment.  I think every book reveals something of an author, and everything she reveals is delightful, intricate, and honest.  <br>If you're interested in developing your writing skills, this is a great lesson and excersice book.  But don't expect her to be easy on on you:  she'll hold you to a hight standard!  She will also get you thinking about language as an art, which is a good thing.  <br>Let out your sheets and run downwind with this gem.</span>

                    <span>Very, very few writers these days will share their knowledge of how to <really> become better writers.  Many will write books on how to sell what you've written or how to write novels that will fly off the shelves, but few provide any real, practical information on how to hone the craft of writing.  Let such things not be said about Ursula K. Le Guin.<p>Le Guin says that while the "gift" can't be earned, the craft of writing can.  All artists practice and work at their craft: musicians, painters, sculptors, dancers....even writers.  The craft can be developed and Le Guin shows us how.  <p>You won't find any pie-in-the-sky philosophies about writing in this book, just practical information which, if followed, will make you a better writer.  Le Guin's chapters include:<p>The Sound of Your Writing<br>Sentence Length and Complex Syntax<br>Repetition<br>Adjective and Adverb<br>Point of View and Voice<br>Changing Point of View<br>and much more.<p>Each chapter contains writing exercises specific to the chapter topic.  (Le Guin also suggests many titles for further reading.)  This book will become a gold mine to any writer of fiction or creative non-fiction.  It's the perfect book to use for a writers' group or peer group.  Thank you, Ms. Le Guin, for sharing your gift with us.</span>

                    <span>Long a favorite writer of mine, I was delighted to see Le Guin's offering on story writing. Her love of language comes through in these excercises as it does in her prose and poetry. Not a guide for crafting plot or character, the excercises focus on honing your experience with the words that are the bones of your writing.<p>While a delightful read, the true value of the book comes in working through the excercises either alone or as part of a writer's group. You'll stretch your skills as a writer as you explore the uncharted waters. Ms. Le Guin will strain your creative muscles by leading you into breaking the "rules" you were taught. Whether it is writing a page of narrative with no punctuation, a paragraph with at least three repetitions of the same noun, verb, or adjective, or carefully crafting a sentence at least as long as this one, the excercises get you thinking about why you write the way you do and provide the tools necessary to accomplish what you want with your prose.<p>Full of good advice, good examples, and good descrptions of how a writer does what they do, this book is a boon to every beginning writer and likely of use to even seasoned professionals.</span>
