                <span id="Label1"><div><i>Cancer Ward</i> examines the relationship of a group of people in the cancer ward of a provincial Soviet hospital in 1955, two years after Stalin's death. We see them under normal circumstances, and also reexamined at the eleventh hour of illness. Together they represent a remarkable cross-section of contemporary Russian characters and attitudes. The experiences of the central character, Oleg Kostoglotov, closely reflect the author's own: Solzhenitsyn himself became a patient in a cancer ward in the mid-1950s, on his release from a labor camp, and later recovered. Translated by Nicholas Bethell and David Burg.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Having just finished reading it for the third time, I believe that Cancer Ward is a very fine novel, rich at many levels: in its depiction of Soviet provincial society in 1955, a poor society just emerging from Stalinism; in its portrayal of many separate characters (doctors, nurses, patients, hospital workers) in that society, many of whose lives have been permanently damaged by the terror and the GULAG, but in different ways; and, as I know from personal experience, in its depiction of the isolated world of the cancer patient, from which the rest of society is seen dimly, as though through dirty glass. In spite of all medical progress, the basics of this world have not changed much in 50 years: the core treatments are still surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and the side effects both long and short term can still be brutal.<P>The ending of the book will disappoint those who want a happy ending, or just an ending with all the loose ends tied up. In real life, though, loose ends usually stay loose. My thought is that Solzhenitshyn intended the reader to understand that for the characters and the society who are so damaged by the past there can be no happy endings; the best they can hope for is to continue from day to day, grasping at whatever happiness briefly comes their way.</span>

                    <span>Solzhenitsyn always gives wonderful characters in a dreadful situation, makes you aware of the horrors of Stalinism as they affect the characters, and flat out refuses to give you a satisfying ending. It's as if he is telling us it isn't that kind of a book - you aren't in Disneyland.<P>As in The First Circle, Solzhenitsyn presents us with a group of Russian men living together in tough circumstances. The First Circle concerns political prisoners. Cancer Ward's characters are imprisoned by their tumors. The author himself had experience in both of these worlds, as a political prisoner for ridiculing Stalin, and as a cancer patient.<P>The two main characters here are Kostoglotov (hero) and Rusanov (villain). Kostoglotov reports to the cancer ward as a former political prisoner who had been exiled to Siberia (of course, innocent, and a war hero). The huge scar on his face was given to him by ruffians in the prison camp when he had the courage to stand up to them in defense of their innocent victims.<P>Rusanov is a higher-up in government. He has forced many a married woman to abandon her political prisoner husband and file for divorce, at the threat of losing her livelihood. He sent his best friend to Siberia because the man's family was sharing Rusanov's home, and Rusanov wanted it all for his own family.<P>These are, as you may know if you are at all familiar with this author, typical Solzhenitsyn characters. The heroic good guy, victimized by Stalin's insanity, and the despicable bad guy who thrives under the Stalinist system.<P>Without spoiling the ending for you, but just warning you, the final chapter is the one in which Kostoglotov has his chance to "get the girl" and live happily ever after, but...</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In Cancer Ward, Solzhenitsyn tells the story of a memorable cast of diverse characters, many of them presumably drawn from his own experiences in such a hospital wing. The book focuses largely on two characters, Kostoglotov, the ne-er do well exile, and Rusanov, the party member who works as a mid-level official in Personnel. Some of the most interesting passages concern their verbal disputes in which the rest of the cancer patients take sides. Cancer Ward is not political in the way a book like Animal Farm is, but few could miss the way Rusanov's naivete and loyalty is used to mock him. In spite of this, the book is timeless because it deals with the very personal struggles of individuals, which allows the reader to identify easily with the characters. Cancer Ward is thought-provoking and is definitely worth reading, although one should probably read it by the fire and not on the beach.</span>

                    <span>One thing in particular I like about Solzhenitsyn is that he manages to sympathise with every charactor. I remember in the First Circle when in his description of Stalin he calls him a lonely man...(maybe i misquote). <P>Somethings in previous reviews stood out to me. Firstly that Cancer ward will remain the most relevant of his novels due to the fact that Cancer (and illness) is something that will remain through time. Personally, I grew fonder of the first circle yet how can I possibly judge which is the greater novel. Maybe Solzhenitsyn can give a good opinion on what he thinks but I have no idea of the relevant depths of all his works. I don't think any of his books will lose relevance though.<BR>Another reviewer said whats important is not that we live but how we live. I agree that the most important thing is how and not what. But surely it is important that we are living? That life should be treasured, I liked what he said about good guy and bad guy. Surely noone is free from evil? Maybe he(the reviewer) means whats important is how as opposed to that we make sure we contiue to live. In that case I agree. But if he means that we have to live in a certain way then I'm not sure if I agree with that because how could you forgive one another?<BR>Another thing is that some people have compared Kostoglotov with Solzhenitsyn. Calling Kost an optimistic realist. But Kost defends the persuit for happiness, which I don't think Solzhenitsyn does (Read Gulag chapter the ascent). And I think Shulubin holds a lot of Solzhenitsyn's views. But this is more a question and I would like to hear other peoples' opinions. At first I thought that Kostol was like Solzhenitsyn but now I think less so. To me Nerzhin(in the first circle) seems to be a lot more like him? Infact at times I sense that Solzhenitsyn gets frustrated with Kostol attitude? <BR>One more thing, I think it is worth looking at different translations(not to the above but generally).</span>
