                    <span>If you're interested in reproducing authentic costumes, you won't find a better guide to hats and bonnets than this book. I haven't found anything close to it. Intended for collectors, it is full of photographs showing what women wore on their heads for the 200 year period covered. Today a hat is usually something worn strictly to protect from inclement weather. Until a generation or so ago, no woman felt dressed in public unless she wore some kind of hat. It's a valuable addition to any costume library.<P>Paula</span>

                    <span>This book really filled a void -- I liked the organization, the photo quality and the layout. I would have liked to have seen more examples from the 1930's and 1940's, but that's nitpicking (and personal!). I love that the book feels well made too-sturdy and like it will last.</span>

                    <span>Susan Langley's book is great for people who enjoy reading about and admiring hats. It is informative, organized and beautiful. Except for the first two sections which comprise 3 decades each, 1770-1800 and 1800-1830, the book is organized by decade. Each section has a wonderful introduction which consists of a historical overview, fashion overview and overview of hats which is devoted solely to that time period. Then come the gorgeous fashion plates, vintage photos of hat-wearing ladies and actual hats on period milliner's heads such as the century old,rooted haired and glassed eyed Alice who is on the cover with the pink picture hat. Also included are advertisements and articles which,though in small print, can still be read. Ms Langley often compares the fashion plates with the photos of hats on the milliner's heads and old photos of women wearing the hats. This is a great book.</span>
