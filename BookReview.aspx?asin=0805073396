                <span id="Label1">The largely blue collar citizens of Kansas can be counted upon to be a "red" state in any election, voting solidly Republican and possessing a deep animosity toward the left. This, according to author Thomas Frank, is a pretty self-defeating phenomenon, given that the policies of the Republican Party benefit the wealthy and powerful at the great expense of the average worker. According to Frank, the conservative establishment has tricked Kansans, playing up the emotional touchstones of conservatism and perpetuating a sense of a vast liberal empire out to crush traditional values while barely ever discussing the Republicans' actual economic policies and what they mean to the working class. Thus the pro-life Kansas factory worker who listens to Rush Limbaugh will repeatedly vote for the party that is less likely to protect his safety, less likely to protect his job, and less likely to benefit him economically. To much of America, Kansas is an abstract, "where Dorothy wants to return. Where Superman grew up." But Frank, a native Kansan, separates reality from myth in <I>What's the Matter with Kansas</I> and tells the state's socio-political history from its early days as a hotbed of leftist activism to a state so entrenched in conservatism that the only political division remaining is between the moderate and more-extreme right wings of the same party. Frank, the founding editor of <I>The Baffler</I> and a contributor to <I>Harper's</I> and <I>The Nation</I>, knows the state and its people. He even includes his own history as a young conservative idealist turned disenchanted college Republican, and his first-hand experience, combined with a sharp wit and thorough reasoning, makes his book more credible than the elites of either the left and right who claim to understand Kansas. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>He gives a very convincing explanation of why people have have abandoned aligning their votes with their best economic interests and switched to "values" based voting.  He also shows how misleading are the claims of those who proclaim themselves to be guided by values when in fact they are just in it for the glory and the power.   He does go on and by the end I felt the book could have been much shorter.</span>

                    <span>The book "What's the Matter with Kansas? : How Conservatives Won the Heart of America" by Thomas Frank is very revealing and more educational than any government school.
<br />
<br />The largely blue collar citizens of Kansas can be counted upon to be a "red" state in any election, voting solidly Republican and possessing a deep animosity toward what Frank calls the "left."  Tom Frank is stuck in silly left-right political analysis, as taught in government schools. He is still unaware of the Nolan chart or Diamond chart. 
<br />
<br />According to Frank, the conservative establishment has tricked Kansans, playing up the emotional touchstones of conservatism and perpetuating a sense of a vast "liberal" empire out to crush traditional values.  Franks overlooks the real trick.  Republican-socialists are outsocializing Clinton by double (in social spending alone).   Republicans said that Clinton was a socialist, so what is someone who outspends Clinton by double?  The Republican "red" color is exposing them. Apparently, Frank doesn't think that the USA's police-state is big enough yet.
<br />
<br />Franks uses the word "liberal" unprofessionally to mean "left." His habit forgets the etymology of "liberal" for "liberty" (against government and for laissez-faire capitalism). That bad habit explains why republicans and democrats are the same: socialists. Tom Frank is an example of why government schools are unconstitutional and must end.
<br />
<br />It would be a mistake to say that Frank is "liberal" as that is misleading. Afterall, he is attacking a party (republicans) who outsocialize Clinton by double (in social spending alone). no republican president had ever cut the size and scope of government.  The only way that Frank can be called biased is that he drones on about socialists (Democrats and Republicans) and ignores anyone who wants to cut government (Libertarians). Frank shows why the Republican Party and Democrat Party are lost causes for liberty.
<br />
<br />Frank is the founding editor of The Baffler and a contributor to Harper's and The Nation. 
<br />
<br />Frank, a native Kansan, tells the state's socio-political history from its early days as a hotbed of leftist activism. It is amazing that Franks overlooks so much even though his own history was as a young conservative idealist turned disenchanted college Republican-socialist.  Those old times included a self-proclaimed socialist who wrote the pledge of allegiance (that republican-socialists now "love") in 1892 for government's schools. 
<br />
<br />Frank is not libertarian and he uses the misnomer "public schools" to mean "government schools." No one would trust the government to tell the truth if it published books like Frank's or Harper's. Why would the government tell the truth in government schools?
<br />
<br />Frank book suggests that he doesn't know that the pledge was written by a socialist (Francis Bellamy) in the USA and that the original salute was a straight-arm salute (as shown in web image searches for "original socialist salute").  Frank doesn't know of the news-breaking discovery in the book "The Pledge of Allegiance and the Bellamys" (by the historian Rex Curry) that the straight-arm salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis) came from the USA's pledge of allegiance and military salute, and not from ancient Rome. Frank seems unaware that Bellamy put flags in every school to promote a government takeover of education for widespread nationalization and socialism.
<br />
<br />Frank has another bad habit: overuse of the hackneyed word "Nazi" so much that it might cause one to wonder if he knows what the abbreviation abbreviates. Many people forget that "Nazi" means "National Socialist German Workers' Party," and one reason people forget is because the word "Nazi" is overused by politicians like Frank who rarely or never say the actual name of the horrid party. A good mnemonic device is that the sick socialist swastika represented two overlapping "S" letters for "socialism" under the National Socialist German Workers' Party as exposed in the book "Swastika Secrets.".
<br />
<br />In 1892, Francis Bellamy began the pledge of allegiance with a military salute for the phrase "I pledge allegiance" and then the rest of the pledge was chanted with the arm outstretched toward the flag.   The military salute became the Nazi salute.  The hand was supposed to be turned upward for the main gesture, however it changed in time to the Nazi-style because of casual extension of the initial military salute straight toward the flag. Even when the palm was turned upward, people would see the relationship to the later Nazi salute, and the USA's salute changed to the hand-over-the-heart. 
<br />
<br />It is a wonder why Frank is not laughing at republican-socialists who have been duped into supporting socialism and who are ignorant of the pledge's socialist past.
<br />
<br />Edward and Francis Bellamy were national socialists who idolized the military and wanted to nationalize the entire US economy, including all schools. It was a philosophy that led to the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) where millions were murdered (62 million by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 35 million by the Peoples' Republic of China, 21 million by the National Socialist German Workers' Party) in the worst slaughter in history. That is why the Bellamys are known as American Nazis. All Holocaust Museums could expand four-fold with Wholecaust Museums.
<br />
<br />Bellamy believed that government schools with pledges and flags were needed to brainwash children to embrace nationalism, militarism, and socialism.  Bellamy wanted the government to takeover everything and impose the military's "efficiency," as he said. It is the origin of the modern military-socialist complex.
<br />
<br />Bellamy wanted a flag over every school because he wanted to nationalize and militarize everything, including all schools, and eliminate all of the better alternatives. During Bellamy's time the government was taking over education. Bellamy wanted government schools to ape the military. Government schools were intended to create an "industrial army" (another Bellamy phrase, and the word "army" was not metaphorical) and to help nationalize everything else.
<br />
<br />Because of the Bellamy way of thinking, government-schools spread and they mandated segregation by law and taught racism as official policy and did so even after the National Socialists were defeated, and well beyond.
<br />
<br />Thereafter, the government's segregation legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.
<br />
<br />Because of the Bellamy way of thinking, government-schools spread and they mandated the Nazi-style salute by law, flags in every classroom, and daily robotic chanting of the pledge of allegiance in military formation like Pavlov's lapdogs of the state.
<br />
<br />The bizarre practices served as an example for three decades before they were adopted by the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.
<br />
<br />As under Nazism, children in the USA (including Jehovah's Witnesses and blacks and the Jewish and others) attended government schools where segregation was imposed by law, where racism was taught as official policy, and where they were required by law to perform the Nazi salute and robotically chant a pledge to a flag. If they refused, then they were persecuted and expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives. There were also acts of physical violence.
<br />
<br />The hypnotic "Sieg Heil" salute to a flag symbol mesmerized Americans long before it brainwashed Germans.
<br />
<br />Jehovah's Witnesses were among the first people to publicly fight the government and its pledge ritual in the USA, during the same time that they fought it in Nazi Germany. They eventually achieved total victory over Nazi socialism. They achieved only partial victory over similar socialism in the USA. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that they could not be forced to perform the pledge. Laws still make teachers lead children in robotic chants of the socialist's pledge daily, on cue from the government. Jehovah's Witnesses and other children in government schools must watch the ritual performed by others.
<br />
<br />The pledge gesture was altered and explicit school segregation by government ended. The Government's schools still exist, the federal flag brands government schools, and government's teachers must chant the pledge daily. Students are kept ignorant of the pledge's original salute and history. That is why the pledge still exists.
<br />
<br />The USA also continued its Nazi numbering (social security from 1935) and its robotic pledge, with no stopping.
<br />
<br />Today, the USA numbers babies, and government schools demand the numbers for enrollment, and the numbers track homes, workplaces, incomes, finances, and more, for life. School laws still tout the daily pledge, a bizarre ritual shunned by every other country.
<br />
<br />Frank has discussed plans for "reform" of social security that would invest social security taxes in private businesses. At the height of Nazi power, the USA's government deliberately stepped onto the same path with national numbering imposed in 1935 with the social security system. The federal government was growing massively and attempting to nationalize the economy in many ways. The US Supreme Court struck down much of the new legislation as unconstitutional until the craven FDR pressured the Court into the "switch in time that socialized nine."
<br />
<br />New social security reform ideas are so-called "privatization" plans that would nationalize all businesses, in addition to schools. It would impress the Bellamys. Frank does not have the ethics to discuss the other side of the issue (the proper side): ending government involvement in education, and ending the social security scam, its taxes and its Nazi numbering. If the antidisestablishmentarianism does not end, then the USA's police state will grow.
<br />
<br />Overall, Frank's book was very revealing and educational and worth the time to review. </span>

                    <span>The author is interesting and unique in that he himself admitted to once being a typical "backlash" conservative until he found himself facing reality and then did what most in Kansas would call unthinkable and that is vote Democratic though he voted for Nader in 2000 and Kerry in 2004. I got to say, I've been feeling the same way ever since Nov 2, 2004 when it was the last day I've proudly shot myself in the foot by voting for the same old Republican party that does nothing to live up to its promises on what they claim to do about hot button issues while at the same time doing their utmost best and succeeding at keeping the economy out of the discussion or at least giving false positive spin like what the Labor Dept did which was to invent some false numbers to show that jobs are being created even when it's not so and it's likely that most of those jobs are being created in other countries. Yes, in every presidential election I happily voted for the Republican candidate after being fed up with the Democratic Party for not showing up in our state and giving us voters something to think about and instead inventing silly fears and excuses that we voters will think they're too liberal and that it will result in more conservative turnout even when it should be obvious that it hasn't and will not ever work that way. Even Tom Daschle who supposed to be a strong leader for the Democratic Party as an opposition to the bullying Republican Party couldn't discipline Senate Democrats in all his years as Senate Leader got kicked out by a newcomer, well sort of newcomer as he's been in the House of Representatives before challenging the other senator Tim Johnson who narrowly won in 2002. Surely if Tom Daschle hadn't pandered I would have voted for him and if John Kerry had showed up and been more firm about his take on the issues I and likely more voters in my state of South Dakota and some other red states would have given Kerry the keys to the White House instead of detaining him as just another U.S. Senator out of 100.
<br />
<br />Well, I read this book and now I'm beginning to think "You know what? The Republicans never keep their promises on the social issues once elections are over and they talk little about the economy during the election or present false data and then after the election do the unthinkable on the economy by carrying out orders from special interests and lobbyists in crafting economic legislation that only hurts us average Joes who went through all the trouble to support the Republicans based on false promises of what they plan to do on hot-button issues." Until the Republicans can get their act together and do the right stuff, they can forget my vote from now on. Maybe that's what "W. R. Salber" is so afraid of besides the fact that virtually all of the books he desperately recommends are beginning to lose ground and just don't click. Now that doesn't mean I'll automatically vote Democrat because they too need to clean up their act by putting the economic issues back on the table and truly standing up for the people they claim to stand up for as Thomas Frank implies as a suggested solution to this mess in this book. Look, I don't care about one's position on gay marriage vs traditional marriage or for that matter gun rights vs gun control or abortion vs no choice or pro-god vs atheist. I don't want to hear about it. And yes, it is extremely embarrasing that my state has to be one of the few which allows pharmacists to refuse birth controls pills if they simply feel like it and are usually anti-abortion. My concern is economic safety and Thomas Frank gets my vote for the best book when it comes to understanding the true nature of disaffected and apathetic voters and even blind supporters of conservatives which I used to be.

<br />P.S.: If you want to know the real dangers of a national sales tax that conservatives and libertarians are working to push, then come to my state of South Dakota which is one of the few states to have a state sales tax with no state income tax and you'll see.</span>

                    <span>I am an educated and hard-working man; active in my church and community; a husband, father, home owner and... a Republican.  I often recommend books to my misguided Liberal friends and relatives to help them see the error of their ways.  I thought I should, out of fairness, take a look at something from the Liberal camp just for the intellectual exercise.  
<br />There is nothing here but a lot of whining and screeching from a confused and frightened individual.  Frank begins and ends on the assumption that the Democratic party is the benevolent caretaker of all humanmankind and that one would have to be ignorant and deranged not to support them.  
<br />Humankind deserves better than socialism and that is what the Democrats are peddling.  
<br />I can't believe a Lefty allowed trees to be killed for this drivel.

                    <span>This carefully edited, lucid analysis of the social, philosophical, economic and psychological mechanisms the Right have used so skillfully to convince citizens (who were most abused by the Right) to champion its causes, is only vindicated again. 
<br />
<br />Today, May 15, national news reports state that the Kansas State School Board is proposing to redefine "Science."  Had we a Galileo, Kepler, Freud, Darwin or Feynmann or Crick down there, I might take some interest in the story. As it is, the Kansas story bespeaks the same totalitarian, absolutist mush that has made today's America as grim as it is, and its position in the world community as tenuous.  Let's not even discuss economics.   Don't even e-mail the word; someone may be tapping your computer.
<br />
<br />The one piece Tom Frank might have added to his argument is that class warfare in America has become so brazen and offensive that some of  the working poor may support Republicans because they hope for upward mobility themselves.  A ridiculous concept, I know, but we haave all become a bit ridiculous in the eyes of half the country and much of the world.
<br />
<br />As for the ideological use Republicans have made of Jesus of Nazareth, I'll leave that one for historians and theologians; for while many Republicans have postured and railed against "Liberals" (a term for which few, if any, have provided a concise definition) they have changed little in America's ethical or moral agenda -- except to make it more ambiguous.
<br />
<br />In large part, today's Republicans (who do not technically represent the party of Lincoln) have one primary objective -- as Frank describes so well:
<br />absolute economic primacy based on the continued suppression of those who are less privileged -- and by using a variety of pseudo-spiritual, pseudo-theological and odd socioeconomic methods to maake it happen.
<br />
<br />The "Democrats," having abdicated their mission for years, have lost credibility even among Democrats.  The New Deal is history.  Ducks flying into the sunset.
<br />
<br />And so what Frank exposes in this thoughtful book is the yawning void that threatens to overtake -- by eradicating all true moral and ethical principles -- our trading floors, legislatures, courts, schools, offices, prisons, doctor's offices, psychologist's offices -- everything in fact.
<br />
<br />I no longer consider myself a Democrat. I wouldn't dare My party has failed too often and has succumbed to the same self-serving dance as the Republican party.  Go for Fascism or aa Democratic Republic and then work for it -- one or the other.
<br />
<br />Behind all this unmitigated political junk -- put in motion by (mostly) privileged white men and women in suits --  are the realities of a society on the ecological, moral, economic and behavioral brink -- of failing all progressive history, of all progress. Moral, spiritual, even technological in the long run.
<br />
<br />No global warming, indeed.
<br />
<br />Thomas Frank has written a book that is, in the best sense, a mirror for Republicans and "Democrats."  It should open the eyes of both, and if it does not, someone isn't reading carefully enough.
<br />
<br />Time to wake up and remember that tea party.</span>
