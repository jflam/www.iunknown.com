                <span id="Label1"><i>The Complete FreeBSD</i> is an eminently practical guidebook that explains not only how to get a computer up and running with the FreeBSD operating system, but also how to turn it into a highly functional and secure server that can host large numbers of users and disks, support remote access, and provide web service, mail service, and other key parts of the Internet infrastructure. The book provides in-depth information on installation and updates, back-ups, printers, RAID, various Internet services, firewalls, the graphical X Window system, and much more. Author Greg Lehey is a member of the FreeBSD core team and has been developing, documenting, and advocating for FreeBSD for nearly ten years. Whether you're an experienced Unix&reg; user or just interested in learning more about this free operating system and how you can put it to work for you, this do-it-yourself BSD documentation will provide the information you need.</span>

                    <span>The book is well-written and easy to understand. If you wish to learn the FreeBSD Operating System and start a server, it is well worth the money. You should be up and running in no time. Apart from this, read on.<P>It is very complete, albeit at a minor cost... some topics are given a few sentences and then glossed over. Now, don't get me wrong. This book is to explain FreeBSD, not those little topics generously thrown in. Therefore, it shouldn't hurt the book's review. Just be aware that you will not learn Unix, X Windows or any of the other addons that can be found in Unix through this book. Obviously, it's not the book's purpose. Its purpose is to teach FreeBSD.<P>It would have earned five stars, but Chapter 31, Keeping Up To Date (CVS) is uneven and jumpy. This chapter came as a shock when compared to the rest of the book. I think another reviewer shared a similar complaint about it.<P>On a side note, a reviewer amused me by complimenting the book (giving it five stars) just because of who the author is. I'd rather buy a well-written book by a no-name author than a poorly-written book by a renowned author. It's people like this that trap other people into buying books that aren't helpful. I hope this review helped you. :)</span>

                    <span>This will be your one and only desktop reference for FreeBSD. This is not a newbie book although topics are easy to read and understand. You should have some *nix experience and knowledge to get the most out of this book. It is a thorough coverage of version 5 with older versions covered in the appendix. I would also recommend using this book in tandem with the online FreeBSD Handbook found at freebsd.org. The strength of this book is in it's detailed Table of Contents and Index - a must for a complete reference book.</span>
