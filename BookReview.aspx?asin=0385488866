                <span id="Label1">From <i>Sports Illustrated</i> writer Rick Reilly comes this spoof of all things golf and country club. <i>Missing Links</i> recounts the tale of a coterie of golfing friends who ply their hobby at Ponkoquogue Municipal Golf Links and Deli. An 18-hole garbage dump with hazards that include a concrete river surrounded by a chain-link fence and the pillars of the elevated train that runs through the course, it is reputed to be the worst golf course in America. One day the group inadvertently discovers that all along they've been playing right next door to the Mayflower Club, a true golfing Eden. The rollicking plot includes a bet to see who will be first to sneak in a round at the Mayflower, as well as the narrator's attempts to reach some sort of reasonable understanding with his overbearing father.</span>

                    <span>Reilly writes with a lot of heart.  Good thing because we all need a little heart from time to time.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The golf, the characters, the golf, etc.  
<br />
<br />My favorite line: "I love golf for all the times when it's just the twilight and you and the crunch of your spikes on the fall leaves."  
<br />
<br />Yeah.  That about says it all.</span>

                    <span>I liked the book. I like Reilly's style, even as it borrows generously from Jim Murray and Dan Jenkins...I thought the characters were overly broadly drawn..having waited tables at a posh CC outside Washington for 7 summers, I can tell you I never ran into anyone like everyone he describes... the first several chapters, Reilly tries too hard... I almost put the book down... you don't need to make a joke every paragraph...once he got into the very appealing story, the writing got a little tighter... i think Reilly is pretty good at exploring what makes us tick and as such shouldn't feel the need to try to make us laugh every few seconds... this isn't a golf book... it's a book about relationships with golf as its cover... well, done, Rick... next time, write less self-consciously...</span>

                    <span>Sitting by my wife's bed in the delivery room waiting for our first child to arrive was when I had the pleasure to read this book.  It was a very stressful time but in between her labor pains and exhaustion I escaped into this book and laughed (quietly) again.  Having played the game since I was very young, I appreciated every descriptive detail of both courses and each character within the story.  I have been there and played with each character at one time or another.  I highly recommend this book to all golfers and non-golfers alike; it's that good!!!  Mommy and baby turned out fine. </span>

                    <span>Let me start out by saying that this is the best book I have read since the last Reilly book I picked up (Who's your Caddy?). I'm sure everyone know who Rick Reilly is, he is the ONLY reason to read Sports Illustrated. This novel is no exception to the Reilly Rule (Read anything he writes). I would read the phone-book cover to cover if he wrote it.  Missing Links is the story of a group of "chops" that play on the worst muni in the country (Ponky). When I started reading it I was hooked right away, the characters are original and pretty funny as well. The writing is pure Reilly at his best, witty as well as poignant. I found myself laughing out loud on the NYC subway,which got me a few looks from the other passengers. I figured that the book would be just one big laugh. I was wrong there was actually a part or two that got you all misty! Still the events of the book are so funny don't be surprised if you miss your stop on the train or stay up all night to finish the book. My favorite part was how Two-Down got the Lexus! Pure Genius! Just take my word for it and buy it. You will NOT be sorry.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Good book about the kind of golf most people play- not the exclusive country clubs we see featured in golf magazines, but the run down muni's who could use a few extra groundskeepers, a little more grass on the fairways, and a ball washer or two.  Reilly does a first rate job of describing the world of a bunch of blue collar hackers, with all their foibles and eccentricities.  The plot is well crafted, too, although maybe a little storybook in the end.<p>The one criticism I have of the book is that while he does a good job of including women and ethnic  minorities among the regulars at the muni, he resorts to every cheap stereotype imaginable when it comes to describing a couple of homesexual characters.  While a writer wouldn't dare use cliches about women, african-americans, or the disabled for cheap laughs or as plot devices anymore, apparently Mr. Reilly sees nothing harmful in portraying gays as sexually deviant, deceitful, lisping caricatures.</span>
