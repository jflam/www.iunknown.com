                    <span>Coaching is a peculiarly difficult service to market!  You're marketing yourself, and all sorts of emotions get in the way of direct action -"I musn't boast", "I can't promote myself","Am I good enough", "I don't want to be seen as pushy" are examples I've heard.  Questions of self-worth abound.  Many coaches need major coaching in this area!  In fact, if you don't market your coaching services regularly and aggressively, you'll sooner or later stop coaching! This book meets that need head-on, with sections on Deciding Who You Want To Coach, Creating a Program Your Target Audience Will Pay For, Creating a Marketing Strategy, and Learning How To Sell. In addition, the largest chapter, Creating a Marketing Strategy, lays out all the marketing options, and, coachlike, offers assignments to the reader to get him/her moving. I found the section on Working With The Press particularly interesting, and challenging.  That alone is worth the price of the book. I run a coaching chapter in New York City, and I've invited the author to come and present her book to our membership. If you're a coach, or planning to be one, I highly recommend this book. It is a marketing seminar all by itself.  It gives a very clear, well-organized and concise outline of the steps you can take to make coaching a delight - not only because of what you can contribute to others, but also because you can make a very nice living doing so!</span>

                    <span>I found Deborah's book to be straightforward, precise and probably the most useful of anything I have read for creating and marketing my coaching practice... and all in one resource!   She breaks down each of four steps clearly and concisely for even the most beginner coach.  An excellent and exciting resource for any coach at most any level.</span>

                    <span>This book has accomplished the twin goals of  "taking action":  It's  comprehensive in the variety of ways a coach can advance their practice.  And yet, it breaks down each choice in easily doable steps; taking away the mystique or intimidating notions a new coach may have about what they must do to build their business. <p>Additionally, it's packed from top to bottom with terrific resources for writing, web development, program/seminar development, and much more!  <p>It's one terrific resource for the back pocket of any ambitious coach!</span>
