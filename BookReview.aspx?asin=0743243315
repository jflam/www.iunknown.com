                <span id="Label1">Wildly embraced by critics, readers, and contest judges (who put it on the short-list for the 2003 Man Booker Prize), <I>Brick Lane</I> is indeed a rare find: a book that lives up to its hype. Monica Ali's debut novel chronicles the life of Nazneen, a Bangladeshi girl so sickly at birth that the midwife at first declares her stillborn. At 18 her parents arrange a marriage to Chanu, a Bengali immigrant living in England. Although Chanu--who's twice Nazneen's age--turns out to be a foolish blowhard who "had a face like a frog," Nazneen accepts her fate, which seems to be the main life lesson taught by the women in her family. "If God wanted us to ask questions," her mother tells her, "he would have made us men." Over the next decade-and-a-half Nazneen grows into a strong, confident woman who doesn't defy fate so much as bend it to her will. The great delight to be had in <I>Brick Lane</I> lies with Ali's characters, from Chanu the kindly fool to Mrs. Islam the elderly loan shark to Karim the political rabblerouser, all living in a hothouse of Bengali immigrants. <I>Brick Lane</I> combines the wide scope of a social novel about the struggles of Islamic immigrants in pre- and post-9/11 England with the intimate story of Nazneen, one of the more memorable heroines to come along in a long time. If Dickens or Trollope were loosed upon contemporary London, this is exactly the sort of novel they would cook up. <I>--Claire Dederer</I></span>

                    <span>The reason I gave this book one star is that it is not possible to give none.
<br />
<br />Every time I walked into a bookstore for a couple of months I wanted to buy this book, because it was getting very good reviews and the beginning was promising. But once I actually bought it and started reading it, like many other reviewers, I found the story way too slow and boring. At no point did I feel I was actually getting involved in the characters' lives - I simply couldn't care less. After reading the reviews here I'm now definitely going to give up, even though I always finish my books and I regret having spent 10 Euros on a book I didn't even finish - but it just does not seem worth losing any more time.</span>

                    <span>This book came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, "Brick Lane" tells the story of a Bangladeshi woman named Nanzeen who moves to London in an arranged marriage. After 10+ years of living life fairly uneventfully and raising her 2 young daughters, Nanzeen ultimately becomes involved romantically with another man, Karim, also of Bangladeshi descent. When Nanzeen's husband decides that the family should relocate back to Bangladesh, Nanzeen is forced to make a decision: follow her husband back to Bangladesh, or staying in London with Karim. Or is there a third option?
<br />
<br />Monica Ali takes her time developing the characters, which works well actually. Nevertheless somewhat distracting in my opinion is the side-story involving Nanzeen's sister who has remained in Bangladesh. It takes up quite a bit of the book but ultimately has really nothing to do with the resolution of Nanzeen's life choices. 
<br />
<br />The book's inside cover points out that Ms. Ali herself is from Bangladesh and now lives in London. Obviously she knows what she is writing about, even though the circumstances of her move to London are presumably quite different from the fictional characters in the book. But it does beg the question what Ms. Ali will write about next, I mean, how many times can you approach the Bangladesh-to-London story? Meanwhile, "Brick Lane" is a very engaging book, and as highly recommended it came to me, I can now recommend it on to the next person.</span>

                    <span>For a person like me, who hates not to finish reading a book, I had the hardest of the time finishing Brick Lane. Not badly written for a newcomer, but I there are so many other books that,  I think, describe the story of the immigrants in a better way. </span>

                    <span>The author has a beautiful writing style, and is able to delve into the sensitive issues affecting an Islamic minority subculture during the events of September 11th. She succeeds because it is done through the eyes of Nanzeen, someone who believes in her religion strongly, but not in violence, and silently but diligently observes those within her community.
<br /> 
<br />To me the book is about Nanzeen- and she is engaging.
<br />She is a young village girl propelled into London where she meets her selected husband, does as he says(he is good for he does not beat her-this is her initial diagnosis), speaks only her native tongue, and her husband discourages any outside work or classes to learn the language.
<br />She transforms, through trials of her own, and those of her sister, into a woman with her own income, a lover which plagues her with guilt, two children, and a husband she has come to care for over time.
<br />Some say the book is tedious, or the letters are too long, or boring, but I think it well worth the read. Her writing is really beautiful in itself, and the book gives a really different insight into the events surrounding Sep. 11th, and the repercussions thereafter. </span>

                    <span>For someone who never puts a book down once I have started no matter how little it appeals to me, I did the impossible and gave up reading the rest of Brick Lane when I arrived at 200 pages. The reviews on Monica Ali's book promised so much, but gave so little. A long drawn out book with a few redeeming scenes (when Nazneen's first child was ill in hospital and she and Chanu took turns to keep watch), Brick Lane is tough going. Especially annoying was the gibberish from Nazneen's sister which I assumed was meant to be Bengali expressed in direct transliteration. The characters were neither fascinating nor inspirational nor interesting nor deserving of empathy. Of course if I had plodded on I might have changed my mind, but the point being that it was so un-engaging there was no desire on my part to get to the end of it. </span>
