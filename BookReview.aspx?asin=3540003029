                <span id="Label1">Ontologies have been developed and investigated for some time in artificial intelligence to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. More recently, the notion of ontologies has attracted attention from fields such as databases, intelligent information integration, cooperative information systems, information retrieval, electronic commerce, enterprise application integration, and knowledge management. This broadened interest in ontologies is based on the feature that they provide a machine-processable semantics of information sources that can be communicated among agents as well as between software artifacts and humans. This feature makes ontologies the backbone technology of the next web generation, i.e., the Semantic Web. Ontologies are currently applied in areas such as knowledge management in large company-wide networks and call centers, and in B2C, B2G, and B2B electronic commerce. In a nutshell, ontologies enable effective and efficient access to heterogeneous and distributed information sources. Given the increasing amount of information available online, this kind of support is becoming more important day by day. The author systematically introduces the notion of ontologies to the non-expert reader and demonstrates in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for improved intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge and for enhanced Internet-based electronic commerce. He also describes ontology languages (XML, RDF, and OWL) and ontology tools, and the application of ontologies. In addition to structural improvements, the second edition covers recent developments relating to the Semantic Web, and emerging web-based standard languages. ___________</span>

With that in mind, the price is quite hefty. but there are lots of references, which is a plus. There must be better books or papers out there which introduces ontologies.</span>

                    <span>The Semantic Web and knowledge management converge in this book by Dieter Fensel. Ontologies, a term from philosophy referring to the types and classifications of things that exist, recently has become a term of art in the area of business technology design. This book systematically introduces the idea of ontologies and shows clearly and in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for enhanced Internet-based e-commerce and improved Intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge. The notion of ontologies first gained acceptance outside philosophical circles among those working on the Semantic Web as a means to enable agents to reason about Web content and provide sensible responses to unanticipated situations. Fensel provides a thorough survey of a range of ontology-based knowledge representation techniques in terms of their applicability to Web-based information exchange. While the first part of the book will be accessible to non-experts interest in the use of ontologies in e-commerce and knowledge management, the second part presents a more technical view on emerging Web standards.</span>

                    <span>This book is the starting point for those readers who are willing to know what ontologies are and how they can be used for building ontology-based applications for Knowledge Management, electronic commerce and the semantic web. He has presented the key technology for building such kind of applications and relevant scientific contributions on the ontology field that are considered as important milestones (i.e., Ontobroker and OIL language). <P>Hence, I consider this book as an excellent introduction to those readers that don't know about ontologies and the semantic web. I very enjoyed reading the book and got many new inspirations.</span>

                    <span>Ontologies currently attract the attention of a broad group of communities -and rightly so. After the technies and the research groups, now business managers and those 'just interested in the evolution of the web' want to understand the meaning and the impact of ontologies on the information society. Not an easy audience for a comprehensible story with the right amount of depth, vision ànd real life examples. <P>This is exactly what Dieter Fensel has managed to do.<P>Inevitably, some chapters provide too many technical details for the one and too few for the other. Equally some e-commerce examples might be relevant for some, old news for others. But the reader is well guided through the book and can read the chapters relevant for him without missing the key messages.<P>As one of the first introductions in the conceptual framework and the applications of ontologies, the book is a must for anyone interested in the area.</span>
