                    <span>As a practicing graphic artist, I've read & studied myriad books on typography. Although much of the information presented in "Typographic Workshop" is already familiar, never have I seen it presented in such a clear & pragmatic fashion. Even experienced artists can find a great deal of practical & interesting typographic facts. This is the typography book I wished I could have started out with.<P>Type history is presented in context with the prevailing state of civilization (& barbarism). It brings the historical significance of type alive. In addition, much practical information is presented in comprehensible form. Were I teaching a class in typography, this would be required reading. It's self-teaching, therefore, making this immensely valuable information accesible to all who seek it.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent starting place for any newbie designer/typographer (despite the shortcomings of occasional poor typography as mentioned in other reviews). It's very difficult to find a book that covers the breadth and depth of this one, yet still manages to deal with fundamental issues in a very readable and accessible way. You won't find another book as comprehensive and practical as this one!<P>The beauty of the book lies in its ability to reveal ALL the tools and skills you require, in a no-nonsense style, to create legible and artistic type. Your work won't win awards after reading it, but you will be armed with all the practical concepts you need to work with type in a competent and creative manner. I get the impression from the tone of the text that it's written for a young audience, maybe first-year college students, so the writing can sometimes belabor seemingly straight-forward concepts.<P>The numerous exercises are designed to impart the nuts-and-bolts techniques of how to use type in a practical yet expressive way. Most of the projects are concerned with the mechanics of legibility and information hierarchy, as well as kerning, tracking, leading and ligatures etc. The history sections are also very informative and outline the expansion of writing systems and technologies throughout human social development.<P>After reading this and completing the exercises, the reader could comfortably move onto a more advanced treatises on type like "The Elements of Typographic Style" by Bringhurst or "Type in Use" by White, equipped with a well-grounded foundation to absorb more technical/conceptual information.</span>

                    <span>This is unequivocally the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered in my life. I have no idea how this got published. If you casually flip through the book as a cursory review, you'll find that it LOOKS nice, (On almost every other page there's an enlarged sample of a font - complete with an unnecessary, meticulously hand-drawn portrait of it's creator) But once you begin an attempt to actually read the text, it's migraine time. The writing is so distractingly bad that I'm at the point where after reading this book for a few hours, I find myself having learned nothing because I keep finding awkwardly written sentences and revising them in my head instead of retaining the information they're supposed to convey. <P>As an example, proving why no one should ever spend money on this book, here is an excerpt from the first chapter:<P>"Those who could read were looked to for advice in all types of disputes and emergencies, their knowledge and judgment were unchallenged. Scribes - those who could write - were believed in some cultures to have power over human life, if an Egyptian scribe wrote your name in the Book of the Dead, your time was up in this world! Doubtless, the scribes did little to dissuade this myth. Scribes were trained in Egypt from the time they were about five years old. Today we have abolished this controlled system of learning writing and reading skills. (But a parallel to that practice today can be seen today in the knowledge of computer programming.) In ancient times, hand-copied scrolls were expensive to produce, (not many people were taught to write); any scrolls were cherished, valued and cared for from one generation to the next."</span>

                    <span>This book was required (forced on me ) for a graphic design course that I am taking. Flipping through the pages, it appears to be a great book. Ten times I have attempted to read it, but after ten or fifteen minutes it gave me a headache or I couldn't keep my mind on it. No one else in the class was able to read it either. The material could be very interesting, but the author loves to use extremely small type size with a typeface that is extremely difficult to read (for example, page 259). This book never saw an editor--no competent editor would have allowed it to be printed.</span>
