                <span id="Label1">"Our knowledge of fundamental physics contains not one fruitful idea that does not carry the name of Murray Gell-Mann."--Richard Feynman<br><br>Acclaimed science writer George Johnson brings his formidable reporting skills to the first biography of Nobel Prize-winner Murray Gell-Mann, the brilliant, irascible man who revolutionized modern particle physics with his models of the quark and the Eightfold Way.  <br><br>Born into a Jewish immigrant family on New York's Lower East Side, Gell-Mann's prodigious talent was evident from an early age--he entered Yale at 15, completed his Ph.D. at 21, and was soon identifying the structures of the world's smallest components and illuminating the elegant symmetries of the universe.<br><br>Beautifully balanced in its portrayal of an extraordinary and difficult man, interpreting the concepts of advanced physics with scrupulous clarity and simplicity, <b>Strange Beauty</b> is a tour-de-force of both science writing and biography.<br><br><br><br></span>

                    <span>The author intrigues and grasps the reader by the stories about physics of 21 century. It is physics of a particle and only particles. The author makes it do benevolently to allow human reason to penetrate in salt of a science and to open for itself new. <p>Further it can directly flash in a good pleasant society, with the friends or before the heads on a service. So!<p>It is not population of a science. It is introduction far in a cult of individuality, doing elementary particles huge as our life and a science.<p>The author comes off in this book as the devoted theorist and passionate man, but also and as the real man.<p>The search of this "new" particles it are always jumps on a hippodrome. In synhro-, fazo- and so on -tron, the same circle for run and same human passions. <p>The reader can want to ignore some material of the author and to not read allÂ¸ in succession.<p>However, to tell the truth, it is an excellent and well readable material for any educated man and woman, especially, if they are Americans, moreover and lives in USA.</span>

                    <span>This is an easy 5.  George Johnson took care of the writing and left the physics to Murray.  I have always felt an uneasy awe when hearing of the "next" Gell-Mann concept as I grew up hoping to someday become a scientist.  <p>Johnson's book exposes the raw energy of scientific creation in a man so obsessed with "doing it all".  It reveals personal traits of a driven human spirit.  Based on the prose, Murray must have been something to deal with; but of course, wasn't it well worth it.  I know I haven't; but I feel I have met the physicist that orchestrated the rag-tag "particle zoo" of Opie to perform its siren songs.<p>From the birds that he knew, and thru languages he expressed himself of which math was only one, Gell-Mann would have fit well in the Renaissance.  Johnson also exposes Murray's personal life, its beauty, its tragedy, its strangeness.<p>Though a biography, Johnson's book is also an excellant account of the competition to paint a picture of the physical world.  There is little physics, but the events and descriptions of the breakthrus are a must read for any serious physicist.<p>I hope to hear more from Johnson and more from Murray Gell-Mann.</span>

                    <span>George Johnson beautifully describes the life and work of the Nobel-Prize  physicist Murray Gell-Mann and the revolutionary history of elementary  particle physics. In addition to how the important discoveries of the  Eightfold Way and quarks were made, we learn Gell-Mann's diverse interests  in linguistics, ornithology, archaeology, environmental problems and  complex phenomena. The author writes not only about the physicist's  brilliance and success but also his human frailties such as his experiences  of writer's block and procrastination and his brooding temper, thus making  the biography complete as viewed from every side. This is a good book for  laypersons as well as for physicists.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Despite the fact that I am not scientifically or quantitatively oriented, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a curiosity about the world around him/her or who would like an insight into a very special human  being, Murray Gell-Mann, the subject of this book. (In fact, in order to  derive an even greater appreciation of the subject matter covered here, the  reader would do well to also read Steven Hawking's "A Brief History of  Time" and "Genius: The Life and Times of of Richard  Feynmann" by James Gleik; the latter who was a contemporary of  Gell-Mann's and whose accomplishments in theorectical physics and personal  life mirrowed Gell-Mann's and ran parallel to it.<p>In this well-written  book, the author outlines Gell-Mann's life and the developments in the area  of nuclear particle theory which have taken place since World War II. In  some cases, the reading is heavy going, particularly for the uninitiated in  physics, but eventually you get the idea that these men, foremost of whom  was Gell-Mann, were very special, talented, creative and abstract thinkers,  who could "see" things that most people could never even begin to  dream of.<p>Equally of interest to the reader is the fact that although  these men were geniuses, they inhabited the world with all the frailities,  insecurites, arrogance, hubris et al. that us mere mortals also exhibit.  Gell-Mann was no slouch in this area, as amptly told by Johnson, the  author. The fact that the author was able to ingratiate and befriend the  primary subject matter of this book, is in itself a reflection of the  idiosyncracies that Gell-Mann so often displays in his relationships with  his family, friends and colleagues in the small theorectical physics  fraternity.<p>In the end, the reader has a better appreciation of his own  humanity and the complexity of the world, having been able to observe the  world inhabited by Gell-Mann and hold a mirror up to Gell-Mann's  personality to reflect one's own.</span>
