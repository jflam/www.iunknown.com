                <span id="Label1">From America&#8217;s number one Cuba reporter, PEN award&#8211;winning investigative journalist Ann Louise Bardach, comes the big book on Cuba we&#8217;ve all been waiting for. An incisive and spirited portrait of the twentieth century&#8217;s wiliest political survivor and his fiefdom, <i>Cuba Confidential</i> is the gripping story of the shattered families and warring personalities that lie at the heart of the forty-three-year standoff between Miami and Havana.<br><br>Famous to many Americans for her cover stories and media appearances, Ann Louise Bardach has been covering Cuba for a decade. She&#8217;s talked to the crooks, spooks and politicians who have made history, and to their hired assassins and confidants. Based on exclusive interviews with Fidel Castro, his sister Juanita, his former brother-in-law Rafael D&#237;az-Balart, the family of Eli&#225;n Gonz&#225;lez, the friends and family of the legendary American fugitive Robert Vesco, the intrepid terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, and the inner circles of Jeb Bush and the late exile leader Jorge Mas Canosa, <i>Cuba Confidential</i> exposes the hardball take-no-prisoners tactics of the Cuban exile leadership, and its manipulation and exploitation by ten American presidents.<br><br>Bardach homes in on Fidel Castro and his cronies, taking us closer than we&#8217;ve ever been&#8212;and on the militant exiles who have devoted their lives, with CIA connivance, to trying to eliminate him. From Calle Ocho to Juan Miguel Gonz&#225;lez&#8217;s kitchen table in C&#225;rdenas, from Guant&#225;namo Bay to Union City to Washington, D.C., Ann Louise Bardach serves up an unforgettable portrait of Cuba and its exiles.</span>

                    <span>Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana is a definitive look at the two very different communities of the Cuban exiles in Florida and New Jersey and that of the nation of Cuba. Ann Louise Bardach provides an clear and primarily unbiased look at how the Cuban Revolution of 1959 caused a rift not only between America, which used the island as a sin city playground, and Cuba but between families who choose to support Castro and those who opposed communism. Bardach's book is part history and part sociology. Thoroughly researched and written with style of writing that keeps the reader highly interested chapter after chapter, "Cuba Confidential" hits many topics ranging from politcal corruption and terrorism to family values and race relations. Three of the most interesting and intriguing chapters are those of "Calle Ocho Politics", "An Assassin's Tale in Three Acts" and "The Third Rail". I found them the most interesting because they focused on the political climate of South Florida and the overwhelming influence of the Cuban exile community on the government of the state of Florida. As a history and political science major in college, I read about the strength of the primarily conservative Cuban Americans in South Florida but I never researched how pervasive and corrupt it was and still is. "Cuba Confidential" details the long list of injustices committed by some cuban officals in Florida and the Tammany Hall political machines that they run. Even the federal government through such agencies as the FBI are found to be influenced by the power and cohersion of Cuban politicos. <BR> If you want to learn about the darker side of the "Sunshine State" then read this book. While covering topics that have been done to death like Elian Gonzalez, it still serves up more than most readers outside of Miami ever knew about Cuba and Cuban Americans. It is a must have for both the casual reader and someone looking to start a scholarly research into Cuban Americans and Florida politics.</span>

                    <span>Yes, the Cubans have suffered under Castro. I agree and understand their pain. So? The Cuban American millionaires and terrorists (Bosch for example) in Bardach's book suffered and then triumphed by bringing their ideas, ideology, and conniving ways to the US under the guise of seeking freedom--Freedom to do what? Toss bombs and acid at other exiled Cubans exercising Constitutional rights? Become another demagogue like Jorge Mas Canosa, rip off the Americans, create an ethic Cuban ghetto that excludes other Latinos, spit on concert goers trying to see Cuban musicians, bribe and other wise nefariously influence Florida politics? All this and heaven too. <P>Well, you detractors of the book have called it disgusting and other things but the truth hurts doesn't it? I have spent time in Cuba as a US diplomat (1987-89)in the US Interests Section and know many of the people mentioned by Bardach. Her descriptions are right on the money, e.g. Elizardo Sanchez, a real hero in the Cuban human rights movement. That the Miami right wingers are against the Varela Plan is truth not fiction, and as for checking sources and reliability nothing in Havana or Miami is what it appears to be so what's the use trying to verify what's not on the record? Her book names names, dates, countries, files, memos, etc enough to satsfy me and the general reader. Of course, if you have an Anti-Castro agenda this book will infuriate you, and obviously has by the looks of some of the reviews. All I have to do is put the screwed up, angry, menacing looks we saw on TV in Miami during the Elian debacle and fit those faces to the irate reviewers. And so it goes. Perhaps one should just read Samuel Huntington's latest screed on Hispanics (Foreign Policy Magazine, March 2004) to know the Cubans want to turn South Florida into their own Banana Republic. Lord have mercy, and will the last American leaving Miami please bring the flag. Thanks Ms. Bardach for exposing this ugly under belly on both sides of the drink. Watch out for the bombers.</span>

                    <span>People seem to think journalists are biased when they disagree with them. As an anthropologist who has thoroughly studied these issues from both points of view, I thought this book was quite an eye opener. Annie Bardach does a fantastic job of culling through previously-classified information about Jorge Mas Canosa and exactly how deeply he corrupted the political and judical systems of Miami as well as our own representatives in Congress. How deeply the corruption runs is absolutely shocking, as is the information on Luis Posada Carriles, who she also managed to interivew. This guy is a sociopath and a terrorist, who thinks he's on a god-driven mission to assisinate Fidel Castro (sound familiar?). Fidel doesn't fare much better. <P>This book basically provides an in-depth examination of the actors on the extreme poles of what many people have described as a family feud. We DID need to hear more of this information. The right-wing Cubans in Miami and the hard left ones in Havana who blindly follow the folks profiled here need to open their eyes to just the kind of people they're supporting. There are NO innocents in this equation. That's the point of the book. If that makes people uncomfortable, GOOD!!! I hope this book helps disrupt the competing victim narratives that both sides are so good at producing.</span>

                    <span>Cuba Confidential is an extremely biased book. Anyone with knowledge on the Cuban people will clearly see the bias against the exiled Cubans. This book portrays the Cuban american community as a bunch of extremist crooks who will do anything to get their agenda across. Of course in the Cuban community their are some extremists, but not to the point that the author makes it. This book seems to sympathize much more with Castro and his regime than with the Cubans here in the U.S. trying to live a free life. The book has very few unbiased facts. If you are looking for a completely objective book, this is not the one.</span>

                    <span>Have you noticed how most of the readers who disagree with this book use the basest language permissable to dismiss it? (ie. it's only good for toilet paper, etc). The reason they express themselves this way is because they don't have a bomb or molotov cocktail at hand to toss at the writer or her readers. Just the very fact that they are so intolerant of a different opinion and crass in their comments proves that just about everything Bardach states about the exile community in Miami is very likely true. Of course, there are those who live there who are not as vociferous, but I suspect they are the ones who quiver lest they say (or even think) something that does not agree with the Exile Agenda. Cuba Confidential does not take sides, it simply exposes the unfortunate truth: Little Havana has become a mirror image of Big Havana - except in Little Havana you get to wear more jewelry.</span>
