                    <span>As many have mentioned here, C++ is a big, hairy, powerful language, and it's unrealistic to think that most people can use it effectively after 21 days. C++ combines an unusually complicated, multiple inheritance object model with C's pointer mayhem. _C++ in 21 Days_ is inconsistent. Pointers are given fairly superficial coverage. Objects, on the other hand, are given very solid coverage in this book, and the author writes well. Non-experienced programmers won't get a lot out of the last week of this book (structured error handling, namespaces, templates, the relatively ignored Standard Template Library), and are liable to be rather put off by it. Very experienced programmers will be frustrated that the examples and problems are too simple and the author doesn't point out major pitfalls in applying C++ to complex systems.<P>I came to this book knowing C (mostly) and Java (barely). After this book thoroughly, I tried to work with someone else's C++ code (related to networking, which I know well)...and found that I was entirely lost. I borrowed a stack of C++ books from friends, and found that, having read with a little more depth, working in C++ became much easier.<P>My favorite C++ book, for those who are looking for something written as a tutorial but complete enough to be a reference, is Stanley B. Lippman's 'C++ Primer'. I don't know anyone who knows C++ well who has only 1 book on it, but Lippman's book is as close as I've seen.</span>

                    <span>This book literally saved my life and career. Unlike the rest of my Computer Science peers, I didn't pick up programming as fast as others. During my first C++ course, I struggled immensely using the textbooks (C++ Primer, etc). I picked this book up, and was able to use it to complete all of my assignments and understand it enough to read harder books as well as do well in the class. It saved my life, that's all I can say, and now I am a graduate student in Computer Science, I owe it all to this book.</span>

                    <span>Given that 'teaching' one's self a computer programming language is a daunting task anyway, Jesse Liberty's book takes a clean and understandable approach to the subject, broken down in a way that is convenient and productive.<P>I bought this book with no programming experience (except for BASIC in high school) and have been working my way through the excercises for a while now. Although, the idea of learning this stuff in 21 Days is a fantasy, those who are willing to actually take the time to understand each chapter (it's taken me over a year of part-time study to get past Week 1) it's fantastic. If you persevere, somewhere around the end of Week 1 you will begin to feel the awesome power that is possible with your newfound and fledgling skill.<P>I am excited and encouraged to finish the book (even if it takes me a couple more years) because it is a solid foundation for any would-be programmer, and a low-cost alternative to the University setting. You can be sure that when I'm done with C++, I will look to Jesse Liberty for "Teach Yourself C# in 21 Days". <P>I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>The book covers all the bases well, but the examples given jump in difficulty very quickly when they could have been simplified more, which combined with actual c++ errors makes for a fair bit of confusion.</span>

                    <span>I found this book very easy to understand and very informative. The author's style is pleasant, clear, and interesting. However, I also have a lot of experience programming, so it's hard for me to say if a brand new programmer would also find it simple to understand.<P>What drives me crazy is the errors. I spent about three times as long studying the errors than learning the concepts. Every time I saw something in the code that I didn't understand, I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out if it was a flaw in my understanding or a flaw in the book. What a waste of time. And the errata doesn't even start to cover all the errors.<P>It's a crying shame that such a excellent book is destroyed by silly, careless typos. Can someone explain to me why so many "technical" books suffer from this problem??</span>
