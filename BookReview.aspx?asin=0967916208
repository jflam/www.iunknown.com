                <span id="Label1">The Unfair Advantage is a "workshop-in-a-workbook." It contains practical ideas and exercises for applying NLP (neurolinguistic programming) to sales and marketing. It includes "how-to" ideas for selling face-to-face, telemarketing, direct mail, and other real-world situations. Included are examples of scripts and techniques that have produced proven sales increases in direct sales and in telemarketing. It is a theory-free collection of techniques based on a workshop that has been presented to CEOs and sales professionals in over 500 companies in North America and England.</span>

                    <span>I have read the Unfair Advantage from cover to cover several times. More importantly, I have experienced results, based on the lessons you will learn in this book, that have been amazing. If you want great literature, don't buy the Unfair Advantage, consider War and Peace. If you want great results in your interpersonal skills and feel that a higher closing ratio sounds like something you want to read about, get the Unfair Advantage.<P>This is my first review to Amazon.com. I have read several books that flirt with making NLP a concrete and usable sales tool. This is the first book that I have found worthy enough for me to share an opinion on.</span>

                    <span>It's tough to find selling stuff that works but doesn't sound like some cornball, canned routine out of a used car showroom. That's because talking in a natural-sounding way is rarely effective in high-powered selling.<P>Yet when you start to deal with the big players and big deals, sounding genuine and authentic is the *only* thing that works. All top sales professionals and wheeler-dealers know this.<P>Duane Lakin has come up with the first training and language system I have seen that will improve your effectiveness selling to anyone. I know because I've used his techniques with large-dollar sales and seen my results improve. I've also reviewed all the other sales trainers who use NLP as part of their method. Some are very good, but no one comes close to Duane in terms of a transparent, deceptively simple set of methods you can quickly learn and use.<P>One thing that's great about his book is he also shows you how to apply NLP to telemarketing and writing sales copy. I don't know of anyone else who's done that.<P>A lot of people interested in sales and NLP think something has to be flashy, complex and technically overwhelming to be any good. As someone who makes his living because of the results he gets, I can tell you that just the opposite is true. Fortunately, this book contains what you need to get better results and still come across like a human being. That's rare and extraordinarily valuable.</span>

                    <span>Though the title writes "for sales and marketing", I am sure that it will be helpful for anyone who wants to strengthen his or her communication skills. In short, the author focuses on the concept of VAK [Visual (see/watch), Auditory (hear/sound) and Kinesthetic (feel/touch)], that we should pace and lead our target audience according to his/her own language preference. Of course, it's much more complicated than what the above describes, such as the usage of eye cues, embedding of action commands blah blah blah. Anyway, a must read!</span>

                    <span>An information scientist, Richard Bandler, and a linguistic professor, John Grinder, developed Neurolinguistic programming techniques called NLP in the early 70's. From a study of successful people, they created a way to evaluate and transfer humanity's highest achievements and excellence into a powerful psychology that has practical applications.<P>Let's assume your mind is made up of different parts like the roles each of us enact during the day: a woman can at the same time be a wife, mother, daughter, sister, coworker, secretary, cook and so on. Can you see where I am going? For each of these roles, we allow certain facets of our personality to come forward and suppress the others. For example, a cook does not necessarily have to know where the Xerox machine is. Therefore, in the mind, folks talk to themselves in different voices or attitudes depending on which role or part is conscious. This is normal and healthy.<P>In addition, you have parts with which you are pleased and other parts you would like to enhance. The goal of NLP is to teach you how to improve your internal talk to get all your parts synchronized and working together.<P>NLP has branched into many fields from success mastery in overcoming negative patterns to the practical applications for sales and marketing. Today's customer has massive control with access to more information than can possibly be processed. The message you send to make a distinction for your product or to make you stand out as a special person must be personal, adaptable, appealing and intended for the one rather than the many. As Paul Lakin declares: "The 'Unfair Advantage' is the ability to sell YOU."<P>Being familiar with NLP, I bought a copy to help me with my work in a non-profit fundraising organization. Like others who must deal with folks on the telephone, you must capture the prospect's attention within the first few seconds. You must be able to say something that will put the prospect off guard just long enough for you to begin your case.<P>Remember, that the voice must do everything. You cannot see body signs or a bored look. What to do? Listen to the verbs. The object of Lakin's book is to teach you how to recognize the language preference revealed by the action words (verbs) you tend to choose at any given time. These relate to our five senses: visual (sight), auditory (hearing), kinesthetic (feeling), olfactory (smell), and gustatory (taste). The following examples are from the book:<BR>Visual? "I see your point."<BR>Auditory: "I hear the problem and would like to say something about it."<BR>Kinesthetic: "I don't have a good feel for that yet."<BR>Olfactory: "Something smells here."<BR>Gustatory: "That is sweet."<P>Since Western speakers seldom use the last two categories, the lessons hone in on the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.<P>Without making this too lengthy, if you are in contact with the person you are selling, you can identify their sensory inclination by watching their eyes and the direction they look.<BR>This volume is a priceless treasure and I rate it five stars for the ease in which they have taught me to be a success.</span>
