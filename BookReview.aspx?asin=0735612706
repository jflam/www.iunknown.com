                <span id="Label1">Tuning databases can be fun if built into the predeployment  time allocated to building a system. Tuning ceases to be fun when it's  undertaken on a production system, overseen by an unhappy customer with  crushing time constraints. Unfortunately, the latter scenario tends to  be the more common. <I>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Performance Tuning  Technical Reference</I> provides database administrators and (to a  lesser degree) developers with the information they need to extract  maximum performance from Microsoft SQL Server 2000. This book favors  optimization of SQL Server that can be done via the administrative  interface rather than in application code.<p>Most of database tuning  has to do with sacrificing one aspect of performance (say, disk storage  capacity) for the improvement of another (like the execution speed of a  particular kind of query). The authors of this book--they're a team of  consultants from a Texas company that specializes in database tuning,  as well as from Microsoft--take care to explain the tradeoffs involved  in various tuning decisions. Choose one option, they say, and  performance metric A will improve at the expense of metric B. Having  explained the design considerations for various tuning strategies, they  walk their readers through how to do the tuning they're talking about.  Instructions aren't for the clueless, but they're fully adequate for  SQL Server users who know their way around the interface generally.  <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to make databases served by Microsoft SQL  Server 2000 run as fast and as efficiently as possible by tweaking the  way it runs. Emphasis is placed on read/write operations (including SQL  Server's way of interacting with RAID arrays), performance monitors,  and settings for processor, disk, and RAM usage. There's also a lot of  information on capacity planning and system sizing.</span>

                    <span>The `SQL Server 2000 Performance Tuning' provides the reader with an extensive overview of the functionality that MSS2000 has for performance tuning. This book has been written by the manufacturer of MS2000, and has therefore some specific properties a reader has to taken into account. One of them is that every single tuning-feature is mentioned, although their relative impact (hence importance) on performance is not discussed. Another one is the white-book nature of the information presented; very general advice for the entrylevel DBA. For example: in the chapter `Hi-performance Backup and recovery' (it has only 18 pages) is says: "plan full backups for off hours", " use differential backups", "use multiple data files" etc. 
<br />
<br />This book has the title `Technical Reference' and should be regarded as such. The DBA, working in a company which doesn't consider performance-tuning important enough to dedicate a policy to, who is confronted with a sudden structural diminishing of performance and is to find out where this bottleneck stems from will not benefit from this book. For example, the book dedicates a mere two pages on "interpreting Graphical Execution Plans" and gives only 1 example. For a useful checklist on where to look first when confronted with the so-called `query from hell' one should read other books. But for the novice in tuning, the one who is unfamiliar to concepts like locks,  RAID, system monitor, I/O,page vs rowlevel, differential backups, how to log in on queryanalyzer,  index tuning wizard, etc this book can serve as an introduction. But once past this introduction, this book has served it's purpose.

                    <span>I bought this book on the basis of the glowing recommendations here. As I have a number of servers to tune which execute some extremely complex SQL, and I need to be able to look inside with Perfmon and the profiler, I thought this book would be very useful. I particularly wanted help with sysmon. <br>This book gave me virtually nothing. Its coverage of tuning was shallow, information was repeated unnecessarily, text was copied almost verbatim from BOL, and it provided little or nothing that couldn't be found elsewhere and easily. <br>It tries to cover everything at the cost of giving real value. For example it provides 15 pages on data warehousing of which 12 are a description of data warehousing so cursory that if you don't know the subject you'll only be confused, and 3 pages on actual tuning which basically say that you should find out whether the bottleneck is CPU/disk/memory then add more CPU/disk/memory respectively. <br>Sizing and capacity planning are introduced with seven equations without justification. Okay, but completions C is given as the number of transactions that were completed during the observation period, but on the facing page C = 96 seconds [sic]. Did anyone proof-read this? With these and numerous other oddities (trunc. log on chkpt on SQL2000?) I don't know what I can trust. <br>The mathematics for this section is done and finished in 6 pages.<br>I was particularly looking for a comprehensive description of sysmon counters. Other than a quick rundown of the obvious ones there's a long list in the appendix of others, including such gems as "lock blocks allocated: the total number of allocated lock blocks". The whole point of buying this book was to find out how to use them, or indeed what they mean (Skipped Ghosted Records/Sec - means what?); merely giving me a list of them is redundant. This was the biggest letdown for me - I need this info!<br>There are other important omissions. I have spent literally weeks identifying and working round failures in the query plan optimiser. This serious issue is not properly addressed except for a chapter introducing query hints. A taxonomy of optimiser failures and ways of tackling each type might save others from the headaches I've had. Optimiser hints do not always suffice.<br>The book is rated on the back for user levels IT Implementer and Corporate Developer. That is far too generous.</span>

                    <span>Considering the difficulty of the topic, this book is a fairly easy read. The single best thing about the book is that the advice is actionable.  You can read this book and immediately begin tuning.<p>Coverage is excellent - performance tuning, capacity planning, setting up disk drives, managing cpu, I/O, network, and memory, index tuning, backups, replication, OLTP versus OLAP, etc.<p>For each subject area, the authors explain the applicable concepts and SQL Server tools, and then systematically explain their application using practical examples.<p>Compared to other performance tuning books, it is an 80/20 book.  By this I mean that the authors focus on what is most important and then move on to the next topic.  They don't get carried away demonstrating how much they know about each concept or go into the minutia of the options of each SQL Server tool.<p>I hope they write more books.</span>

                    <span>Performance is a responsible and important job. Although you might be doing mostlt reactive tuning, tuning is still what you need and the more tricks you have , the better chance you have to not be beaten .<br>This book supplies bunch of good stuff to get started.</span>
