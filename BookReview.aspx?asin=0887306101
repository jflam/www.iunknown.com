                    <span>If you are interested in philosophy you read about the great philosophers, if you are interested in coaching sports read about the methods of great coaches, and if you are interested in financial market success, you should read market wizards. The author of this book has done all traders and investors an extremely valuable service by interviewing some of the best speculators of our time. This book is really a collection of wisdom from people who at the time this book was written, had extraordinary results in the financial markets. While the traders interviewed in Market Wizards do not reveal some "holy grail" trading strategy for making millions, there are many speculation related philosophical insights that should certainly point you towards a proper frame of thinking about what it takes to trade succesfuly. Some of the basic insight common to all traders interviewed in this book are: Cut your losses short, let your profits run, The value of patiently waiting for the right trading opportunity, personal discipline, getting your ego out of trading decisions, and many more. This is not the type of book you read only once. To become a successful market speculator, one must have a sound trading philosphy, a valid technique, and most importanlty the discipline to implement it. I believe market wizards, allows you to read about many different individuals who each have a valid trading philosophy, a valid method, and the discipline to execute. While one cannot expect to become a market wizard simply by reading a book about them, I believe one will certainly point themselves in the right direction of achieving the goal of understanding what it will take to succeed in the financial markets by reading this book.</span>

                    <span>Just stop trading. Stop watching the Big Board. Stop looking at the futures. Stop checking your quotes every hour. Turn off E*Trade. Do NOT make one more move until... you read what the MASTERS OF THE GAME DO.<P>Why in the WORLD would you want to keep trading and investing without hearing what the most successful investors in the world do? Here, they share their strategies, they tell you what makes and what breaks them.<P>One rule that PERMEATES almost every Market Wizard in this gem: Plan your Trades and Trade your Plan. Without a trading plan you will fail or be far less successful (but you'll probably fail). When will you enter the trade? When will you exit the trade? What are your stops? ONLY until you know these answers should you make a move in the market.<P>Here is FREE (less the cost of the book) TRAINING AND ADVICE FROM THE WORLD'S BEST TRADERS EVER. PERIOD. Why do we sometimes think we know more than they??? STOP now and read Market Wizards. Then, you may be included in a future edition! (Be sure to thank me if that happens, I don't mind large bills!)</span>

                    <span>Being successful in life is simple. Find someone who is doing, or has what you want, and then model their behaviors. If you strive to be a sucessful trader then read this book.<P>Market Wizards is a compliation of interviews with very successful traders. There are little gems of information throughout the book. Read the book and savor each bit of information.</span>

                    <span>There are 1000's of trading books available. They can be divided into four categories: books about trading written by non traders (most are in this category; don't waste your time or money on them), books about traders written by non traders (most are worthless), books about trading written by traders, and books about traders written by traders. This book is the best book available in the latter category. If you need a book about technical indicators, this isn't it. If you need a book to get a glimpse at the thought processes of successful traders, this is it. Jack has the remarkable ability to ask relevant and productive questions of some of the most successful traders of out time.</span>
