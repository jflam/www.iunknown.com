                    <span>We just got this book and we are already playing these games all of the time!  The design of the book makes each game simple to understand, most of them don't need any special set up or props, and the activities are divided into age groups (2-7, 8-12, 13-15, 16+ and adult) But the book is about much more than fun activities, it is about a whole way of approaching life to find the joy in everyday situation (she includes activities to deal with getting dumped by a teenage boyfriend, on how to make important carrer choices, and on how to avoid the blues, even when they are the result of something very sad).  One game I especially like is for ages 2-7, called "young ones" in the book.  It is called Grouchy Food.  The game is for when your child is grouchy or sad or in some other unplesant mood you say to them "Hmm, you look like you are in a grouchy mood today, I better adjust the lunch menu so you can eat what grouchy people eat.  What do grouchy people eat, anyway?  Worms, probably." Then you make spagehetti (we added food die until it was brown).  The author notes that sad people sometimes need a little blue food coloring in their eggs, "lots of water to drink so they have extra for their tears," and "gental" pudding for dessert. How could any kid stay upset after that?! According to Barbara Sher laughter is an "organic, free, all-natural blues buster" and you and your kids will find plenty to laugh about with this book on hand.</span>
