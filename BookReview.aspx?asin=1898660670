                    <span>There is nothing more frighten then a mast coming down at sea. Just the mere thought of it is enough to have a lot of cruising sailors pouring pockets full of money into the hands of riggers up and down the island chain. However rigging isn't that hard, heck I even know a couple guys who decided overnight to be riggers. They hung up their shingles and we started genuflecting before them as if they were the font of all knowledge. Well before you reach your hand out for that holy water, maybe you should check out this very fine book. It will educate you into the black art of rigging a sailboat. You'll know, without consulting that expert, when to replace that turnbuckle or wire. You'll learn how to tune your rig yourself and, need I say it, you'll probably save enough money to pay for that new laptop you've had your eye on.</span>

                    <span>This is my favorite book on sail trim. It not only explains what to do, but why to do it. It is organized well and has great illustations. It is not just for novices, but has information that more experienced sailors will find useful. For example, it has pages with illustrations showing the comparative (in percentages) sail drafts to use for various winds strengths and conditions.</span>

                    <span>The excellent ilustrations in this book make it stand apart. Easy to understand, a great reference to refer back to. Also includes problems with lists of solutions. For example, too much weather helm has solutions like 1) tighten outhaul 2) reduce mast rake etc.</span>
