                <span id="Label1">Microsoft's DCOM is the key technology for enterprise development for the Windows platform. Written for the working Visual Basic developer or project manager, <I>Programming Distributed Applications with COM and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0</I> introduces the basics of DCOM objects in a clear style. All examples are written in Visual Basic, and the reader learns about new Microsoft BackOffice technologies such as Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) (for transaction processing) and Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) (for message queuing). If your shop uses Microsoft tools, Visual Basic 6 stands ready to write today's scalable distributed applications using DCOM. This well-organized text shows you how DCOM works and what advantages it offers for today's enterprise developer using Visual Basic 6. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>What a great book! The author (a fellow of Don Box at Develop Mentor) explains COM and DCOM as seen from Visual Basic side in the best way I've ever seen. The technical details of the book are right to the point, without too much detail in useless code and not missing a point for what regards developing for COM/DCOM and MTS. This is a book that any VB serious developer needs on his bookshelf, and if you develop using MTS it's a mandatory reading. After having read and understood the DCOM parts (and if you will understand all you've done the 80% of the job of understanding MTS) there are two chapter about MTS that should be taken as an example from Microsoft about how MTS documentation should have been written (and they include also a very good explanation about how debugging under MTS using VB6), a chapter on MSMQ explaining the various way of persisting objects, including the new persisting properties of VB6 and a final chapter about security and planning with MTS.<P>If you develop with MTS using a language different from VB I suggest you to read it in any case, because, if you omit the VB parts, it has a very good explanations about COM and MTS internals that it's useful for any language.<P>Very, very, very recommended, I've read all what is available regarding MTS and this is the BEST book on the subject until now, with a big margin over the second place.</span>

                    <span>I had no idea about COM and this book helped me a lot to get me started. You should be familiar with object-oriented programming no matter C++, JAVA or Visual Basic. It explains how COM works and describes its threading model. This book also contains few chapters on MTS environment showing how life could be easier with MTS instead of writing complex code to deal with issues such as connection management, thread pooling, and transaction monitoring.<P>I don't know why Ted Pattison named this book "Programming Distributed Apps with COM and Microsoft VB 6", of course the author provided few sample code in VB but don't count on that to start developing COM components. Get the "Fitch & Mather" sample code from Microsoft site and study it, that would help be sure of that.<P>Even if you are a COM programmer you will still find a lot of tips to optimize your code. I've read this book many times and each time I find few things that helps me. IT'S A MUST for all COM programmers.<P>I would also recommend:<P>"Creating Lightweight Components with ATL". With these two books and some coding you will master COM and ATL.<P>"Inside COM+ Base Services" should be your next book if you want to continue, it will take you to the next stage of evolution of the COM programming model.<P>Enjoy it</span>

                    <span>I didn't have a very good undersdtanding about internal of COM. This book gave me lot of information regarding COM servers and threading and is a great book i suggest for any VB programmer who wants to know more about how COM works. The presentation of this book is excellent!. Thanks Ted, for your wonderful work. <P>Eventhough i tried to read "inside COM" i found it hard for me because i am not a C++ programmer. I don't suggest "inside com" for a VB programmer.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book was great. I've working with VB for 5 years and developing COM components in VB for 2 years. Did you ever wonder what really goes on when you build COM components in VB? Do you want a clear understanding about how COM really works? If not, this book is not for you.<P>The author explains COM programming in a very clear way. I found the book very easy to read and I rarely feel that way about computer books. I don't think this book is for total VB novices that have never created a COM component in VB. This book does not have many examples either. If you are looking for a strictly "how to" book, this is not for you. But, if Visual Basic is you're bread and butter this book is a must read. A little familiarity with C++ would also be helpful to get the most out of this book.</span>

                    <span>I read this book after trying lots of other VB COM books. This is the one which you need if you want an in-depth but easy to read book on COM and DCOM. For a introductory VB COM book get Microsoft Mastering : Enterprise Development Using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 (ISBN:0735609012 ). Thats also a GREAT book. Stay away from VB COM by Thomas Lewis. It's a mess</span>
