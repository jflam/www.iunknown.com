                <span id="Label1">In the heart of China's Sichuan province, tucked away amid the terraced hills of the Yangtze River valley, lies the remote town of Fuling. Like many other small cities in this vast and ever-evolving country, Fuling is shifting gears and heading down a new path, one of change and vitality, tension and reform, disruption and growth.</p>Its position at the crossroads came into sharp focus when Peter Hessler arrived as a Peace Corps volunteer, marking the first time in more than half a century that the city had an American resident. Hessler taught English and American literature at the local college, but it was his students who taught him about the ways of Fuling -- and about the complex process of understanding that takes place when one is immersed in a radically different society. Poignant, thoughtful, funny, and enormously compelling, <i>River Town</i> is an unforgettable portrait of a city that, much like China itself, is seeking to understand both what it was and what it someday will be.</p></span>

                    <span>In "River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze" , author Peter Hessler composes a compelling story that takes place in the small city of Fuling, a town settled on the Yangtze River within the Sichuan province of China. As a Peace Corps volunteer, Peter works at the local college teaching English and American literature to Chinese students. In his narrative, Peter relates his experiences of living in a dramatically different society of communist China. As the first American to reside in the city in over fifty years, Peter describes his struggles with his limited grasp of the Chinese language and the people's stereotype of a typical "American". With the story's progression, Hessler depicts his ability to adapt to the Chinese dialect and culture, and the people's gradual acceptance of him and his fellow volunteer, Adam Meier. This acceptance illustrates a general understanding that grows between Peter and those he interacts with. Hessler's illustrations of social and cultural differences allow his readers to become acquainted with many of the customs and traditions found within contemporary China. Hessler addresses issues such as reform within the country, weaving together China's history with its present progression. Through his vivid depictions of the people he encounters and the experiences he undergoes, Hessler provides an insightful illustration of the culture found within China. I found this novel to be a wonderful story that reflects the Chinese society.</span>

                    <span>On October, I had a one month trip to China that included Sichuan province. The beautiful scenery, the dusty smell, the people and their strange reaction to foreigners - everything came back to me while I was reading Hessler's book. I read it for two days without putting it down. Reading with enlarging interest the stories and thoughts that Hessler had during his stay in Fuling, laughing so much at events that he had in the college were he was teaching and especially understanding (a bit) more about the unique Chinese character. But above all I was admiring and envying Hessler for the great adventure that he had and wrote of, with such a great talent. I recommend this book to every one that was in China and wants to remember and to every body that wants to go to China and like to know more before his journey.</span>

                    <span>This is a brilliant book. This young man came to China with an open mind and is fundamentally different from much of the young expatriate population here, both in terms of his intellingence and his goals in coming. (Typical personalities: "I'm a Loser Back at Home, but when I come to China I'm a Big Man on Mulberry Street." Another: "I'm Young and Bored and Trying to Convince Myself That There is a Communist Revolution Somewhere.") <P>Some books that have been written have also tried specifically to address the political issues of this vast country. It is more interesting to someone who is not a professional protestor/ academic to see what happens in practice when some of the Romanticized Sacred Cows of Academics are implemented in Real Life (see: Communism, Authoritarianism, Big Government). This is also not taken from the perspective of people that are constantly whining about Human Rights.<P>In my opinion, the author does a good job of not reinterpreting China in terms of some of these Sacred Cows, be they of whoever.<P>The prose is clear, elegant and not overwrought with detail. But the reading is not overly light, either. It's just the things that any person would think about if they came here to teach. Or that any person might want to know if they wanted a perspective of China independent of political slants of any type.</span>

                    <span>Peter Hessler spent two years working as a Peace Corps volunteer while teaching literature in the remote Sichuan province in southern China in the late 1990's. Being one the first Peace Corps volunteers in China and possessing an intense curiosity of his new surroundings has resulted in this superb travel memoir that provides the reader with an intimate glimpse into the hill city of Fuling and the history and politics of larger China. During his stay he eyewitnessed the incredible events of the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong and the building of the Three Gorges Dam.<P>Hessler reaches far beyond the average tourist by making a commitment to learn Mandarin and become acquainted with the locals and their individual stories. At the beginning of his stay he was easily started by the overt treatment of the locals of having seen a foreigner but was soon transcended more into Chinese society as his new knowledge and appreciation deepened. Throughout his narrative Hessler frequently ponders Chinese politics and their affect on his students in relation to the United States and as a result brings up numerous provoking issues and concerns. Highly recommended, especially for those interested in China or Peace Corp volunteers.</span>
