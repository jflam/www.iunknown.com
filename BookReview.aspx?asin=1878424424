                    <span>Kudos to Ruiz for writing another great book that's also a quick read! The lowest rating anyone has given it is a 3 out of 5 stars, which is amazing. It's not your typical relationship book, it's not going to tell you how to settle your argument about who should take out the trash, who's behaving poorly, or a fool proof way to find your soul mate. It will take you down a path of how you develop relationships, starting from the beginning of your emotional life to now. Then it describes to you how to re-examine your current relationships.
<br />
<br />I really enjoyed the stories that typically start most chapters and the creative examples he uses to get his point across. "The Perfect Relationship" has the dog example "The dog is responsible for its half of the relationship with you. One half of the relationship is completely normal - the dog's half, When you come home, it barks at you, it wags it tail, it pants because it's so happy to see you. It does its part very well, and you know it's the perfect dog." He goes on to say because your expectation of the dog is to be a dog and nothing more, it is a perfect relationship. How many relationships do you have where you only expect a person to be who they are and nothing more?
<br />
<br />The chapters are filled with great points about emotional development and "wounds" we acquire through the life process. In the end, he sums it up that finding heaven is about finding truth, forgiveness, and self-love.
<br />
<br />I feel there's other books that cover similar material that have moved me more passionately than "The Mastery of Love" most of those take longer to read and are a little more abstract. I recommend this book to anyone recovering from a breakup, or coming from a "I can't find the love I'm looking for" point of view. For anyone else, it's still a good book :-)
<br />
<br />Four out of Five stars for great messages, good dialogue and length. Minus one star for not blowing me away with some sort of deep feeling or passion.</span>

<br />This is the fourth in the Toltec Wisdom Series - so be prepared for a beautiful read. In it Ruiz writes about peeling away the layers, the voices of those we allowed to be caught up in our belief system and that now interfere with our creative, authentic expression. Ruiz calls these voices the voice of knowledge.  It's our moneymind, our ego, `the voice in our head' that is so often about pain and drama, fear and sorrow.  He talks about how we abandon the true self because we substitute those other voices for ours, and his book is filled with awareness and insights about what we can do about it.
<br />In his wonderfully personal and conversational style Ruiz tells stories of stories.  Life is a matter of storytelling: theirs or ours, it's our choice. My favourite chapter he calls "Writing Our Story with Love".  That says it all.

                    <span>This is an amazing book.  I heard about it from my ex-girlfriend's mom.  Having seen the rave reviews, and appreciating good self-guide books, I bought all 4 of D. Ruiz's books.  
<br />
<br />Mastery of Love is the one I found most useful.  Don Miguel's book is easy to read, large print, <200 pages or so.  Every page is fully utilized with some of the best, deep, applicable information you can get and apply to your daily relationships, to both your partner and everyone else.  
<br />
<br />The book teaches you how to love - yourself, others, how to appriate things in life, how to give, and how to live.  Everyone goes through life and need to soul search one time or another.  This is a great book to help guide those, interested in improving their relationship, with themselves and also others.  A must read.  It has made me aware of many things I did not notice before in terms of key points in a relationship.  You will not be dissappointed and this will be the best book under $15 you will have ever read.</span>

                    <span>Of all the inspirational books I have read, I must say that this is my favorite. I struggle to find the right words to describe this book! When I first read it so many things began to make sense. Causes for so much unhappiness in my life became so much clearer. I could let go of my dissappointment with family, religion and society for letting me down because I finally understood where all this poison came from. There was no longer a need to find someone to blame and with that came an incredible release perhaps some would call forgiveness. Now, everytime I read it my eyes open up even wider and I can tell that I am changing. And I like the person I'm changing into. What a blessing is that!
<br />
<br />My life has not been easy and because of that I've exercised my God given right as a victim to blame others. The only problem with that is, I've lost myself in the process. I have spent years of my life in therapy trying to come to terms with that. While therapy has been vital in my growth, and subsequent inspirational books have contributed to my asking of questions, I credit this book with clarifying things, providing explainations and helping me with were to go from here.
<br />
<br />We each search for truth and when we find it, it resonates with us and we feel its impact in our lives. The Mastery of Love, by Don Miguel Ruiz resonates with me and my life will not be the same again. Thank you Don Miguel!</span>

                    <span>I read "The Four Agreements", "The Four Agreements Companion Book", "The Voice of Knowledge" and this book, "The Mastery of Love".  I read "The Mastery of Love" the first time after "The Four Agreements" but before "The Voice of Knowledge".  So, the first time reading "The Mastery of Love", I could not get as much out as what I wanted to.  However, the second time I read through it (after the reading of "The Voice of Knowledge"), I have such a deep appreciation of what the author's message is.  I was applying many of the techniques I learnt from the author in this one relationship.  I learnt so much about practicing love in and out of this one relationship even though it did not end up living happily ever after with this person.  The book helps me understand why relationship can still end; even I exercised love through full acceptance of who he is.
<br />
<br />1. The projection of the many selves that hurts relationships
<br />We project so many versions of ourselves to others just to win their approvals, consciously and subconsciously.  In my situation, I realize I was presenting who I was, or at least I make a conscious effort to be truthful and honest.  I loved him for who he is with full acceptance (despite the circumstances happening in his life and our huge difference), and with acknowledgement of my own inner fears, ego so I can put my second attention to the track of love, rather than track of fear.  
<br />
<br />The broken part is that he could not acknowledge the subconscious projection he had (he projected himself with the one full of love and care towards others - which is true but one dimensional), and maybe has suppressed many of his deepest fears about relationships.  
<br />
<br />In addition, I realized at the end he also had a false impression of me.  He thought that I need his love in order for me to survive (that one pizza while I can cook all my food - love, in my own "Magical Kitchen"). He thought I could not love myself and be independent.  He thought I need to be taken care of.  At least that is how I perceive through that projection.  
<br />
<br />When there are too many projections in the relationship, you cannot accept who a person is truly.  Without acceptance, then, where is love?
<br />
<br />2. Love is About Acceptance but Not about Drama
<br />This is what I learnt from Don Miguel Ruiz's teaching.  Love is about creating heaven on Earth through acceptance.  You can create that heaven by yourself and you can create that heaven with others.  There is no need to invite drama (which is often inflicted by sense of fear, ego, anger, jealousy which are often hardly acknowledged) which drives the need to control, and the need to be right.  
<br />
<br />I am glad I went through Don Miguel Ruiz's teaching when this relationship started and ended.  It helped me to intensely love in the moment and treated the person the best I know how without the perfectionism paralyzing me.  It was the first time I loved someone with acceptance and acknowledgement of fear.  I was happy when I was in that relationship and I am still grounded falling off from it.  It is too bad relationships ended.  However, I always remember Don Miguel Ruiz's teaching about loving myself without judgment.  With that being said, I also drew boundaries with this person at the end for the sake of not inviting drama into both lives again.  He is wonderful just the way he is.  And I will always remember the romance and the dance.  He was the one who inspired me to see the true beauty of spirit.  Thank you.
<br />   
<br />What I am writing here is hoping to bring you an awareness in a practical sense that maybe you are living in true love, the love that helps you create the dream of heaven and not hell.  However, your partner might not understand your well intention and things might still end.  Why did it end?  Why search for the answers when you realize there are so many projections out there and you might never find the truth?  I hope my review here can inspire you that you can still love yourself the fullest possible, and enjoy your life the best way you can despite any life situation.  Life is still beautiful after all if you have unconditional love about yourself.  It does not matter when it starts or when it ends.  For, all human mind has a "magical kitchen" that is capable to love self and others but some how that was lost during the "domestication" process.
