                    <span>I agree with Saltz, Don't Waste Your Money!.  I usually read these reviews before buying.  This time I didn't and boy do I wish I had.  This "book" is out dated and probably never did have any useful information that is not available of the Google site.  And guess what the arrow on the cover is covering up?  The list price is $1.99.  When did Amazon start charging MORE than the cover price?

                    <span>Worth the money to obtain a sense of competence with this all powerful, by all accounts, search engine.  There is some slight digression and loss of focus on page 10.  Nonetheless, it is nice to be rid of ignorance and its corollary, helplessness, quickly and cheaply.</span>

                    <span>I learned a few new things from this little guide, but nothing terribly new or more powerful or anything (that I couldn't find elsewhere online, for free).  Five bucks is too steep for a twelve-page .pdf that's several years old now (when it was two bucks).</span>

                    <span>I bought this on an impulse -- hey, Amazon is recommending this for me, and it's cheap -- and I didn't do my homework. I didn't read these reviews and I didn't check it out.
<br />
<br />I won't ask for my money back -- I did, after all, order it, and it's cheap. But I was very disappointed. I already knew all except 2 of the "tricks", and those 2 weren't very useful (one returned no info!).
<br />
<br />Unless you're a complete Google newbie, this e-book just isn't worth the time or the money. Sorry!
<br />
<br />PS: Don't assume that Amazon's recommendations are good! (I guess that's obvious...)</span>
