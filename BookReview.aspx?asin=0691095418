                <span id="Label1">Trigonometry has always been the black sheep of mathematics. It has a reputation as a dry and difficult subject, a glorified form of geometry complicated by tedious computation. In this book, Eli Maor draws on his remarkable talents as a guide to the world of numbers to dispel that view. Rejecting the usual arid descriptions of sine, cosine, and their trigonometric relatives, he brings the subject to life in a compelling blend of history, biography, and mathematics. He presents both a survey of the main elements of trigonometry and a unique account of its vital contribution to science and social development. Woven together in a tapestry of entertaining stories, scientific curiosities, and educational insights, the book more than lives up to the title <i>Trigonometric Delights.</i><P>Maor, whose previous books have demystified the concept of infinity and the unusual number "e," begins by examining the "proto-trigonometry" of the Egyptian pyramid builders. He shows how Greek astronomers developed the first true trigonometry. He traces the slow emergence of modern, analytical trigonometry, recounting its colorful origins in Renaissance Europe's quest for more accurate artillery, more precise clocks, and more pleasing musical instruments. Along the way, we see trigonometry at work in, for example, the struggle of the famous mapmaker Gerardus Mercator to represent the curved earth on a flat sheet of paper; we see how M. C. Escher used geometric progressions in his art; and we learn how the toy Spirograph uses epicycles and hypocycles.<P>Maor also sketches the lives of some of the intriguing figures who have shaped four thousand years of trigonometric history. We meet, for instance, the Renaissance scholar Regiomontanus, who is rumored to have been poisoned for insulting a colleague, and Maria Agnesi, an eighteenth-century Italian genius who gave up mathematics to work with the poor--but not before she investigated a special curve that, due to mistranslation, bears the unfortunate name "the witch of Agnesi." The book is richly illustrated, including rare prints from the author's own collection. <i>Trigonometric Delights</i> will change forever our view of a once dreaded subject.</span>

                    <span>This book is really interesting primarily for its information about the history of trigonometry. There's some interesting stuff about the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians and Greeks; and a lot of great stuff about early European mathematics; stopping around Euler's time.<P>I hadn't studied trig in about 8 years, and I thought this would be a good review. Boy, was I wrong! I needed to do the review and then study this book! <P>Anyway, if you're a fairly gifted high school trig student, this book will certainly liven up the subject for you. If you're a college math major, it will be easy reading, and certainly interesting. If you're a teacher, you might find something interesting to entertain your students. Otherwise, unless you really like math or are really good at it, this book will probably be really difficult for you.<P>When I was feeling lazy I kind of breezed through the dense equations and looked for the conclusions, but when I was diligent I could usually make sense of them. You can do as I did and you won't miss much. Really, the highlights of the book are the historical information, not the equations. But if you can appreciate the equations as well, then you'll probably really enjoy the book.<P>Of course this isn't a life-changing or eye-opening book, but I gave it 5 stars just so no one thinks there's anything wrong with it.</span>

                    <span>What do sines, pyramids, music, and Fourier series all have in common? Eli Maor did an excellent job in explaining these dry and seemingly irrelevant terminologies to his readers. From Ahmes the Scribe to Fourier, Maor traced the development of trigonometry by juxtaposing different trig concepts with people and anecdotes. An inspiratoinal book.</span>

                    <span>Trigonometry and geometry are important parts for understand or handle what happend with the thigs in our world. Usually you can use these for study a force like a vector in the space, or you will need verify how are related forces several in parts of a complex structure, or you want to discover by yourself how was verified earth shape and who made it first.<P>Maybe you under siege for an incredible account of information of strange scientifics developments in the past, finally you need understand what is a amazing science, is part of our knowledge. Maybe you think that is too much cold, bored and so useless, but when you read this historical adventure you would say it's incredible, I don't have idea!.<P>With this kind of book that we can understand our complex knowledge legacy and get more value for it, because this is science not magic, it should be a very usefull tool for teachers and students.</span>
