                    <span>The Human comedy was a great book. It showed the strength, hope, faith, and love between the characters. It would sometimes have weird chapters, but those chapters were interesting and the best. The way the characters did things were unique, and gave you that feeling which makes you feel like you can't put the book down, especially the ending. </span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I will admit that I cried at the end of it. No joke. This novel fulfills the definition of comedy. It portrays the human  condition with both joy and sorrow and in a time frame that will be remembered by history. The Human Comedy shows the human side of a war that is chiefly associated with the clash of machinery, weapons and bombs. Saroyan successfully creates characters that we can care about in a realistic drama about life at the home front during WWII. It gives a final note of hope at the end; it finishes with the possibility of a marriage, a key element in the classic idea of comedy. The timeless dichotomy of suffering and joy along with its memorable setting establish this book as a classic.</span>

                    <span>I personally enjoyed this book extremely.  This book was interesting from start to finish and had good views on life.  Having the book go through life about a little boy and the war around him shows you what can happen in reality.  I was extremely pleased with the author naming it The Human Comedy and having a tragedy at the end.  This book had good ideas of life and how one little boy and his family dealt with it in a good way.  That even though life throws saddness, you can come out happy in the end.   </span>

                    <span>On those days when you feel like reading a good book, do not pick up the Human Comedy.  The protagonist, Homer, does not at all seem human, even though he is made out to be a teenager.  The author tries to brink back some of ancient Greece to California, with Homer living in Ithaca.  As far as the plot goes, it develops slowly.  However, once the plot has been developed, it is a lot easier to read.  This novel is a recounting of one boy's family, and how they and their friends are affected by the war.     </span>

                    <span>The Human Comedy is a heart-warming story of a family during World War II.  This book portrays the part of World War II that is often forgotten, its families.  The fourteen year old Homer Macauley is the central character of this story. His brother is at war and his father is dead, so he must be the breadwinner for his mother, brother and sister.  Through his job as a telegraph messenger Homer becomes more connected to the war than he would like - having to deliver death notices of soldiers to their families. Through the development of characters and light side plots, Saroyan shows the simplicities and struggles of the families of World War II.   Saroyan not only shows the way the war affected the families of World War II, but by using simple anecdotes about little boys at play or Homer at school, he shows that life went on during the war.  This book contains simple human truths that are constant throughout history. The reader gets the message that no matter what tragedy happens, life will go on. I found this story to be emotional, humorous, and very touching. The simple lives of the Macauley family represents all family's struggles and joys, during World War II.</span>
