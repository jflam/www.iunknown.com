                    <span>Supporting the contentions of the cultural relativists is a library of anthropological literature written by such luminaries as Robert Redfield, Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Bronislaw Malinowski, all of whose books have made a profound impression on both the academic world and the popular imagination. Among its other effects, cultural relativism's heavy stress on the compatibility of primitive societies with their natural surroundings has helped engender today's hysterical environmentalism, with its demand that we abandon our economy and embrace a way of life more typical of folk communities. All the more reason, then, to welcome Sick Societies, by the noted UCLA anthropologist Robert Edgerton. This book explodes the assumptions of cultural relativism by scrutinizing its underlying scholarship. In particular, and in colorful detail, Edgerton examines a variety of folk cultures that have persisted in maintaining traditional practices which are maladaptive: that is to say, "practices that are inefficient at coping with environmental demands or are harmful to the people's health and well-being." While Edgerton confines himself to establishing the existence, and indeed the prevalence, of maladaptation, his book not only performs the valuable task of demolishing the relativist myth, it also provides a scholarly vehicle through which to reassert the West's cultural superiority. Maladaptive behavior is a feature common to all cultures, but Edgerton points to a number of factors which make it far more pervasive in isolated, primitive societies. <P>Where there is an absence of rigorous intercultural competition, populations tend to stick with traditional solutions to common problems even if they are visibly unhappy with the quality of these solutions. The inherent conservatism of most societies, conspicuous in cults of ancestor worship, not only works to prevent technological innovation but breeds suspicious attitudes toward any form of change. Worse still, because these societies have such a limited scientific understanding, they often make erroneous causal inferences, superstitiously attributing all manner of ills and disasters to witches, devils, or unappeased goddesses. To be sure, maladaptive practices have also flourished, and continue to exist, in the West. Edgerton suggests, for example, that our excessive emphasis on individualism has "brought about such a loss of community that the consequences now threaten our common well-being." But he insistently draws sharp qualitative distinctions among cultures. After all, it is only in the West where painless medical techniques prevail, where women have real political and economic opportunities, and where the specter of warfare no longer haunts everyday life.</span>

                    <span>Jean-Jacques Rousseau would have it that man in his primitive or original condition is good and noble, and that he is flawed by over-sophisticated institutions. "Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains". Dr. Edgerton dips his pen in acid and refutes that notion.<P>The previous reviewers have commented accurately on the case Dr. Edgerton makes against adaptivism and cultural relativism.<P>Dr. Edgerton is a strong corrective against the Margaret Mead's utopian philosophy. He demonstrates madness, fetishism, mutilation, cannibalism, irrational beliefs, and just plain evil in primitive societies.<P>In contrast, western civilization does not look bad.</span>

                    <span>Anthropologists don't get any academic accolades for identifying a behavior or custom as maladaptive; Rather they feel compelled to demonstrate they have shed their own ethnocentrism by going through empirical and interpretive contortions to define virtually all primitive conduct, regardless of how perverse it is, as adaptive. UCLA Professor of Anthropology and Psychology, Robert Edgerton understands this, and courageously takes his colleagues to task in an erudite, readable and gracious manner.<BR> The anthropologically inclined will find his global survey of primitive cultures fascinating. Those not so inclined may find the repetition of the theme somewhat morbid. Nevertheless, Edgerton's case would be less compelling without the multitude of ethnographic evidence he presents. <BR> Although the author doesn't say so, moral relativism leads to cultural relativism, which leads to a bogus multiculturalism, which, in turn, results in a slandering and denigration of Western civilization. Anything that breaks this chain is a much needed contribution, and Edgerton does a masterful job of demolishing the link of cultural relativism. The discipline of Anthropology is much in his debt.</span>

                    <span>It is easy to judge others than are different from us. That's what the author does. And I'm fine with that as long as we take it in a way to balance the erroneous thinking that primitive societies were perfect. But the goal of the author does not seem to be that.<P>I can too make a case that civilized society is not just, rational, kind, tolerant, peaceful, as we use to think. I just have to open today's newspaper and write a book about that.<P>So, the point that this book bring us is that in primitive society there is ALSO injustice, inequalties, etc. I would not go far to say that they are the only cause of poverty, as there is a system behind that. <P>To say that primitive people are all that bad is quite funny as when you read other books or have some prior experience with some more isolated primitive people you can notice the high level of integrity, justice, and even equality (men and wome) that some, not many it is true, primitive societies have. Tribes at Xingu are a good example of that. And yes there is "poverty" there, and many do not care about become wealthy as they considered to be the root of many today's society problens and the reason of a heartless world. This is only one good example to try to balance out Rousseau's and the author's point o view. Extreme views can be dangerous. <P>By the way, the former king of Belgium in a 3 day visit to tribes at Xingu (Brazil) decided to stay 2 months living there with all these "irrational" people. Peharps he was impressed by the poverty, they lack of vision or formal education and decide to be there to "help" them. Or, he and his wife noticed that they had problems too, as all humans have, but that they have an amazing sense of cooperation, respect, freedom, an unique "system" of education, love for their lives and nature, and also a "system" of justice based on some very simple principles that we in our civilized world were unable to match. Primitive cultures are not good or bad. They are both, and have things we can learn from them, and things they can learn from us.<P>Now, to say that cannibalism is irrational is quite funny too. Well, it should be when we do not understand the context, their philosophy, etc. They do that for fun right? Or peharps, the meat should be really good? What? Is it an honor for them to be sacrificed and eaten? A real priviledge? Even when they cook their so called enemies? <P>When someone says that someone from another culture, primitive or not, is irrational be careful as we are all at some level irrational and worse, for some of these irrational things that may be an explanation that many anthropologist are to lazy to find or maybe unware.<P>I am a catholic. Every Sunday at church we "eat" and "drink" the blood (wine) of the living christ. We do not "kill" the Christ physically and eat his meat. The difference is that it is done symbolicly and that makes us "rational". There are different levels of development in all cultures, primitive as far behind in many aspects as their way of living (environment) has been destroied), but to judge them using our technically oriented mind is for me IRRATIONAL. We cannot measure length with weight! So, the author's ideas are extremelly valid to balance out Rosseau's idealism as long as they are more descriptive than judgmental.</span>

                    <span>In the opening and closing chapters, Edgerton makes it clear that he rejects a central tenet of cultural relativism which states that all aspects of a culture are necessarily 'adaptive' and therefore beyond criticism by any other culture's system of beliefs. He then fills the intervening chapters with example after example of practices from every corner of the globe that, if not to the detriment of the health and well-being of many or most members of the culture, are at least without apparent benefit, including: human sacrifice and environmental destruction among native Central and South American tribes, institutionalized gang rape among Papua New Guinean cannibals, sanctioned indolence among Tazmanian men and female genital mutilation in Africa. It would be difficult for a die-hard cultural relativist to explain the 'adaptive' value of say, footbinding, epidemic alcoholism or spousal abuse, which is Edgerton's point exactly. Those who are inclined to reflexively call the author racist should note that even modern American and European cultures, with their widespread belief in astrology and tendency to wildly misestimate certain health and environmental risks, don't escape his focus. <P>Though the main body is short (a little over 200 pages) and easy to read, the text quickly begins to feel like an extended laundry list, which I suppose makes it an excellent reference for shattering the politically correct myth of social and environmental harmony among non-Western cultures. Even the bibliography, which runs 40 pages, though now a little out of date, is a goldmine.</span>
