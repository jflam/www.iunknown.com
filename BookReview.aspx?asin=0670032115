                <span id="Label1">For almost three decades at the end of the fifth century B.C., Athens and Sparta fought a war that changed the Greek world and its civilization forever. A conflict unprecedented in its brutality, the Peloponnesian War brought a collapse in the institutions, beliefs, and customs that were the foundations of society. Today, scholars in fields ranging from international relations and political and military history to political philosophy continue to study the war for its timeless relevance to the history of our own time. <br><br> Now Donald Kagan, classical scholar and historian of international relations, ancient and modern, presents a sweeping new narrative of this epic contest that captures all its drama, action, and tragedy. In describing the rise and fall of a great empire he examines the clash between two disparate societies, the interplay of intelligence and chance in human affairs, the role of great human beings in determining the course of events, and the challenge of leadership and the limits in which it must operate. The result is an engrossing, fresh perspective on a key historical event that will be welcomed by general readers and history buffs alike-and anyone seeking a better understanding of the pivotal events that shaped the world as we know it.</span>

                    <span>Kagan, once again, has written an excellent book. For readers seeking an introduction to the Peloponnesian War, I can imagine no better place to start--except, perhaps, Thucydides, but even then it might be wise to begin with this introduction. Reading only this, the neophyte to ancient Greece would have a solid foundation and, desiring more, could easily turn to Kagan's original four-volume history of the war (although, to profit from that, it is a must to have read Thucydides). Even those familiar with the war and with Kagan's works will find this a wonderful refresher.<BR> <BR>Kagan avoids modern parallels (except for the briefest of references to Neville Chamberlain and World War I) and the historiographical depth of his four-volume history and instead focuses on creating a solid, flowing narrative and analyzing events where necessary. Kagan's framework for analysis centers on Pericles and his moderating influence on Athenian policy. While Pericles was alive, Athens consistently took the middle path, avoiding the extremes of pacifism and aggression. After he died in 429, Athens moved toward more aggressive policies, exemplified by the massacre at Melos. <BR> <BR>Readers will no doubt form their own opinions and draw their own parallels to modern events--whether to the Cold War or the Great War--and that's Kagan's intention, to let the narrative speak for itself. This "tragic event" is eminently worth studying, and Kagan is one of its most eminent modern students. The book does not disappoint.</span>

                    <span>The reader bent on getting through the classic history books always starts with Herodotus, who may often be gullible but is always entertaining. The next on the list is _The History of the Peloponnesian War_ by Thucydides, which is completely different. His classic history of the war between Sparta and Athens has been an object of respect and close study ever since it was written, but is tough reading. Translators agree that Thucydides's style is difficult and subject to varying interpretations, and the different battles and overall strategies of the war can get lost. If you plow through Thucydides, you don't even get to find out how it all turns out; his account ends almost seven years before the war did. If this is daunting, help is at hand. A new volume titled _The Peloponnesian War_ (Viking) has been written by Donald Kagan. He has previously written a four volume history of the war for scholars, but has here distilled the narrative into one (admittedly large) volume. His goal was "... a readable narrative... to be read by the general reader for pleasure and to gain the wisdom that so many have sought in studying this war." He has certainly succeeded. The complexities of the conflict all across the Mediterranean make clear that this was a true "world war," but Kagan has made it as clear for non-specialists as we have any right to expect.<P>Of course one expects detailed descriptions of the basis of the conflict, the nature of battles, and the personalities of the leaders involved, and these expectations are certainly met, throughout all the arenas of the war. Kagan has deliberately not drawn parallels between this, the first well-documented war effort, and all the others that came after it. Nonetheless, the reader will find much that is familiar, with the either comforting or dismaying realization that things do not change much, even over millennia. Here one will read about mutual nonaggression pacts and how they tangle nations into war. The Olympics are shown to be tools of nationalism (or, at this time, city state-ism). Candidates for office put on religiosity and spectacles; one by Alcibiades's opponent Nicias was an opulent parade for the sake of Apollo. Kagan writes that most Athenians "...believed that the gods must favor so pious a man and smile on the city he led." Here also are worries about the military-industrial complex; a contemporary writer said on one occasion that Athenians had rejected a truce because of deceptions by "practiced warmongers who made private profit from public troubles." <P>The maps in this volume deserve special mention. They are numerous and clear, and generally are within the text near where the geography needs description. Kagan finishes with an essay about sources. Thucydides is, of course, cited many times, but Kagan does not entirely accept his much-praised impartiality. Among the other sources are Xenophon, an Athenian general who was a disciple of Socrates. The comedies of Aristophanes are frequently cited, for the light they show on certain warriors and politicians, as well as the time's free-ranging nature of satire and public ridicule. It is a pleasant surprise to find that Kagan has found special value in Plutarch; although he lived five centuries after the war and was a biographer rather than a historian, Kagan thinks that Plutarch's own citations of previous historians show admirable scholarship. Kagan's own history of the war falls squarely in that tradition.</span>

                    <span>Sure you could read all three comprehensive books written by Kagan to get a really in-depth lesson on the Peloponnesian War, but for the casual history buff this is much easier. The book is not short on details though. In 494 pages Kagan does an outstanding job of covering the entire Peloponnesian War from start to finish, giving the reading a thorough understanding of the entire affair. Anyone interested in Greek history ought to read this book, and even then you will have just touched the tip of the iceberg for a country whose history is as vast as any other civilization on Earth.</span>

                    <span>I have long wanted to read Thucydides but decided to read Kagan's work on the subject first in order to familarize myself with the historical terrain. For this purpose, the book is well suited since it both sums up some of the period covered by Thucydides and includes events that occurred after his death (before the end of the war). It also provides enough of the social, philosophical, and literary background to whet one's appetite to read more. Many of the most famous figures from Greek history were alive during or near the time of the war and were influenced by it. Plato, for instance, formed his political views in response to what he viewed as the failings of democracy. Euripides wrote his tragedies during a time when the common people of Athens were suffering tragedy on a daily basis caused by the siege of Athens by Spartan troops and the gradual disintegration of its empire.<P>Although I am sure that Mr. Kagan struggled with what to exclude from this scaled-down version of his longer work on the Peloponnesian War, I sometimes felt that he was rushing through certain sections, as if he were tired of expounding on the details of certain battles or the principals who took part in them. He is at his best when describing the dramatic defeat of Athens in the Sicilian campaign or when following the changing allegiances of Alcibiades or when explicating the political and strategic nuances of the war from all points of view. But, the drama of the story-telling starts to drag right at the moment it should build - the Fall of Athens. The last chapters of the book are anti-climactic in my opinion. Though, perhaps one could argue that that is the way with wars, especially wars of attrition, and both the Athenians and the Spartans had pretty much had enough of the whole thing. It is too bad that reality doesn't always make for good reading: maybe on this score Mr. Kagan and Thucydides both could learn a lesson from Herodotus.</span>

                    <span>I understand this is a sort of summary/abridgment of Kagan's 4-volume work on this subject. But I'm still a little bothered by the fact that in 500 pages of narrative there is not a single source note anywhere.<P>Also, the "Sources" chapter at the end, only 3-and-a-half pages long, contains a bibliographic essay with very few monographs titles, and none in original Greek - not even Thucydides's. Based on my limited impression, Kagan can hardly be called a classical scholar, only a specialist in ancient military history - the sort one might find in one or two professors at West Point (and indeed Kagan has a son who happens to be just that).<P>It doesn't bother me that Kagan has a tendency to draw parallels between current events and ancient ones. He does so elsewhere, and not in this book. (I should add by the way that his knowledge of any kind of history is strictly limited to that of the West, except for the 20th century). What bothers me is that Kagan is touted as a great classicist whose work on the Peloponnesian War is the final word for the time being, a claim absurd enough to make an Oxford undergrad in Lit. Hum. wince.<P>Still, this book reads fast and will do for the general reader.</span>
