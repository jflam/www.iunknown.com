                    <span>Caribbean is a typical Michener book. He is the best when it comes to tell a story of a place, not of a person. Recently there has been some followers of this kind of books, like Edward Rutherfurd, who is a good author, but not like Michener.<P>Caribbean is a very long book, telling almost a millenium of history of one of the most enchanting places on Earth. Michener is able, through sixteen short stories, to narrate what happened on the various islands and main parts of the continent (like northern Colombia and eastern Mexico) since the time of the pre-colombian indians, passing through spanish domination, the attacks of english and french pirates and buccaneers, the abuse of the black people turned into slaves, till comunism in the form of Castro in Cuba. More, he is able to relate all what was happening in the Caribbean related to what was happening in the foremost countries in Europe, and the rising participation of the United States in the international scenario. <P>One thing I think it's really important when an author wishes to blend various real facts with his immagination efforts is to inform his readers what is fact and what is fiction, and in Caribbean Michener has a list of actual facts of each chapter and a bibliography of each subject for readers who want to learn further. This kind of attention to the reader is something we don't see too often, and everyone who likes a well written book should mourn Michener's passing away, as well as be glad he was so prolific and intense while writing.<P>This book is as colorful as the place of its name.<P>Grade 8.8/10</span>

                    <span>I've read JOURNEY, ALASKA, CHEAPEAK, and HAWAII. CARIBBEAN is close to the top of my list. Though this isn't "heavy" reading (like Homer for instance), it isn't exactly "light" either. It is sometimes hard to follow, because so much material from various regions is covered. I often found myself looking back for details I'd forgotten. However, I find the challenge rewarding. I also appreciate Michener's consideration for the reader - he is never vulgar or explicitly sexual. I find that refreshing in today's society. <P>I learned a great deal from this book, including where "barbeque", "bacon", and "grog" got their meanings. I never really enjoyed history, so I've learned much more from Michener than I would have normally. Perhaps if I were an historian or a literary critic I'd knock it down a star or two, but I am blissfully ingnorant of any faults :-) <P>For reference purposes, from the list above I rated CHESAPEAK at 5+ stars and ALASKA at 4.5</span>

                    <span>This book was Michener at his best. Sure, a few chapters were kind of boring but what else do you expect of an 800 page book. My favorite chapter was the scholar, near the endof the book about the hindu from Trinidad, Ranjit Banarjee. He was a student who went to the University of Miami and desperately tried to stay in the country after he got his phd. He eventually got caught up in a fraudulent marriage scam. The chapter Buccanears, about pirates was also good, and so was the stuff about Sir Francis Drake.</span>

                    <span>Ranjit Banarjee has written a book Prospect for the Caribbean which may begin to answer some of the questions I asked in my review of Hubbard's book on St. Kitts. An entire chapter, Chapter 13, entitled The Scholar, is devoted to his life. A Trinidadian bred West Indian of East Indian ancestry, Mr. Banarjee was educated at the West Indian University in Jamaica and in Miami, Florida. My title for this review is an excerpt from a sonnet he wrote about Columbus' discovery when he was 15. The last 6 lines I really love: <P>'It was strange treasure that he found this day,<BR>Columbus of the never-bending mind:<BR>Not gold or silver or the facile kind<BR>Sought by his queen, who lusted for Cathay.<BR>He found new lands of ordinary clay<BR>Two continents of hope for all mankind.'<P>He also wrote a poem about Alexander Hamilton; he, like other peoples of the Caribbean are inspired by Hamilton's story, as an immigrant who succeeds in the States. Banarjee does not succeed in the States, but you will need to read the book to find out why! (The scams that go on in the States and in these beautiful waters)!!!<P>Michener published this work in 1989 three years before the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the new world. I totally loved this book, although as is true of all his books, they are always lengthy, trying works laden with information. I'm always glad when I finish a Michener book, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it. They're always educational, very well researched. My mother's and my favorite Michener is The Source based on Tel Megiddo in Israel. <P>But I love this one too, and I think understanding the events that have transpired here once the Europeans set up shop, is particularly instructive. In the back of my mind I have that quote Vince Hubbard fished out for his book on Nevis, "to ignore the West Indies is to get a lopsided and unhistorical view of the mercantilist empire of the eighteenth century."!!! So many European powers have scoured the Caribbean sea since 1492: the British, the Dutch, the Spanish, the French, the Danes. What makes this book so monumental is that, in Michener fashion, no stone is left unturned and accomplished in a small book given the enormous amount of material that's covered in it. The Panama canal region and other strategic points along central and South America are not left out of the story, even though geographically they seem to merely rim the Caribbean Sea, and neither are lesser important, but culturally significant aspects of present island activities like cricket, voodoo, zombies or Rastafarian's ramblings! <P>I also enjoyed the chapters on the Spanish and French islands, was a little disappointed that Cuba's history mostly covered Castro's later years. I'd really like to know what transpired there in the 100 to 200 years previous to Castro's rule.<P>I was most moved by the tenth chapter entitled The Tortured Land which covers events on Haiti during the French revolution and Napoleonic years, having been disgusted in the previous chapter when a portable guillotine is lovingly brought to Guadeloupe by a devout Jacobin revolutionary. Found myself in awe of the bravery and skill of Generals Toussaint and Vaval. In a later chapter, a descendant of Vaval asked another academic colleague, "have you ever heard about the terrible international debt that France hung around the neck of Haiti at the granting of independence in 1804?.....A Haitian historian told the truth: "We spent most of our energy in the nineteenth century repaying France, and our nation fell so far behind in all social services that it could never catch up." Seems important news to me, since my hero from Nevis, Alexander Hamilton, was killed the year before, and the Louisiana purchase was transacted between Napoleon and Jefferson in 1804. Largely because of the trouble in Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic), Napoleon and France were eager to basically give their land in the present United States away for pennies. I also learned that Haiti was the first black republic in the world! And, perhaps to set a precedent, the first president was a dictator. Poor Haiti, it's so tragic what has happened and is happening there today.<P>What troubles me most about these beautiful isles, is the unconscionable, inhumane acts that have plagued them for so many centuries there. And violence continues. Some of the acts of violence done there as equally shocking as those recounted in genocide stories of this last century. <P>I forgot to mention in my St. Kitts review, the shady practice of gun-running which happens sometimes too, the most famous being the Iran/Contra affair. I've been told that America's revolutionary war was greatly helped by the smuggling of guns from the island of Statia off St. Kitts. Whether that's true or not, I'm unsure.<P>Flying from Nevis to San Juan on my last trip, I was amazed that from 10,000 to 20,000 miles up in the air, I could see the bottom of the ocean the entire time of my flight, the water is so clear!!! But perhaps it isn't paradise, if violence will continue to be condoned, incited, or worse yet, deliberately planned!!! And, if Miami will ever be the capital of the Caribbean, with people being shot and killed, selectively, while waiting for a green light on an American street, (see Chapter 15), I'm outta here. My next Michener book to read is Space!!!<P>Can we see, as Banarjee does, how all of the Americas, the Caribbean included, can be 'continents of hope for all mankind'?</span>

                    <span>Reader beware - 800 plus pages, so this is no book for story time. Extremely prolific, James A. Michener writes as only he can write about the Caribbean, that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by Cuba, Puerto Rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape. This is a powerful history of these islands, and James Michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of Arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to Castro's Cuba. This is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from, as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel. You will learn more from this book about the Caribbean Sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you, and you will have more fun doing it! I gave it four stars simply because with a book this size, there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts, and there were. If it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a Pulitzer.</span>
