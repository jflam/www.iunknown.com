                    <span>This book speaks for itself.  Its argument offers a telling portrait of what the politcally correct movement teaches people about art, and what it has done to the humanities. Implicity it is a scathing attack on the fashionable mores of academia. Grasping the wolf by the ears, Kimball brings us back to a rational and guided understanding of how our emotional understanding of art can and should be balanced with historical reality rather then with the proclivity of modern academia to say the right and agreeable thing at the expense of the more profound and often painful truth that art offers. In this he catches them in flagrante delicto and shows us that latet anguis in herba (the snake is hiding in the grass)of modern academic fashion and so much pretension.   </span>

                    <span>Just browsed the opening chapter online in the New Criterion. The words pompous, sententious and bombastic don't even begin to do justice to Kimball's overlabored prose. You would need to reach for appropriately grand phrases like "Pseudo-Mediterranean Wind."

                    <span>Purchase this book (used, if possible), tear out the title page, then give the book to a friend and pay her to read it. Once she's slogged through it, ask her to estimate the year of its writing. Few readers will venture guesses much past 1985. 
<br />
<br />One suspects that this laughably reactionary manuscript was a long time in the peddling. However, with its call for a return to art as "a source of aesthetic delectation and spiritual refreshment," it is such fun to read aloud at parties.
<br />
<br />In plodding prose with serrated edges, Kimball is nostalgic for a time that never was in his fetishes for "decorum," "civility," and "modesty," all "dandy" virtues that he positions as antipodal to intellectual activity or interpretation of any kind. This book paints a picture of a world of art that is, at its best, reassuringly literal, neatly narrative, and, after all, decorative. 
<br />
<br />In a muddled battle of authorial intent vs. contemporary art historical scholarship, The Rape of the Masters encourages the reader to return to the tiny chairs, soft tones, and primary colors of a preschool classroom, where everything was what it was, and the teacher was awful pretty. It was so much simpler then.

                    <span>This book poses as common sense, clarity, the voice of reason, etc.: -- a reason to be skeptical of it immediately.  Its arguments and premises -- going back to "the work itself" to find the work's "original meaning" and that old nonsense -- are naive and facile.  In other words, looking at art this way is easy and narrow-minded.  The author does no justice to the nuances and  profund intellectual, ethical, and aesthetic challenges that good postructralist or "postmodern" criticism -- exemplified by Foucault, Derrida, and the other true philosophers of our time -- poses to us.  There's a reason this kind of criticism is rarely found in universities, beyond the obvious and much-lamented "liberal bias" of higher education: any less-than-adequate high-school teacher can give you this kind of understanding of art.  </span>

                    <span>This is a must read for anyone interested in the way contemporary art historians misrepresent art.  He does NOT write about little-known scholars.  Kimball tackles some of today's most influential art historians.  Sensitive readers will understand that he does address the "big picture," which is this: visual art is meant to be seen.</span>
