                    <span>This book, written in non-academic prose and strewn with practical examples, is the most comprehensive book yet authored on the contemporary involvement of coaches in the business and executive development world. The book can serve as both a reference text for experienced coaches and a 'how-to' book for coaches seeking instruction. The book is also appropriate for those who want to make decisions about using coaches or establishing a coaching culture or academics or trainers seeking a primary text on coaching for use in an educational setting. Throughout the book, the authors underscore the importance of coaching as a learning opportunity. In tackling these issues the authors provide a blueprint for coaches on how to become more effective and increase their ability to work with a variety of clients. As coaching continues to grow as an applied profession, dominated by practitioners, its credibility is strongly enhanced when solid ideas are presented in a clear, articulate, and succinct fashion. This book easily achieves all those criteria and will add considerably to the wealth of knowledge and professional skills associated with coaching.</span>

                    <span>This democratic style of exploring, learning and transferring knowledge is a huge industry. The authors, international coaching experts, go into the discipline's history and basic principles before advising on how coaching can be used to change or develop organizations. There's advice on choosing the right coach, and how accomplished professionals can become external coaches and how managers can become internal coaches, techniques to ensure coaching is effective and dozens of case studies on how it has worked in practice. There's also analysis of various industry and business sectors where coaching has been successfully applied. <p>This book will be of most use to people working in the Human Services field or to managers, team leaders, trainers, consultants or practitioners who have a coaching brief.</span>
