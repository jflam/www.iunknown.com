                    <span>This book is packed with excellent advice. It's a welcome change from the way I was raised. I view life as an adventure, to be treasured and explored. This book gave me some great ideas on how to do that even more. It's well worth the read, and will contribute a lot to your life. At least it did for me. </span>

                    <span>I'm 48 and a former CEO of a large real estate information company based in New Jersey.  Last year I voluntarily gave up my CEO title -- and all of its day-to-day responsibilities -- and assumed the role of Chairman.  I did NOT realize what a huge role difference this would be and the impact it would have on me. Stripped of a large part of my "power base" I felt cut adrift, unfocused, at times even desperate. <p>Don't Retire, REWIRE has been a beacon of light for me, providing a clear framework for mapping out the second half of my life.  This is material that I've been searching a long time for, a book that helped shift my thinking from income statements and balance sheets to life's core benchmarks -- those soulful areas such as following my passions, developing my skills, and pursuing my dreams.  <p>The most valuable part of the book for me lay in the case studies of how real people faced the challenge of life's transitions.  It sparked dozens of ideas which I narrowed down to one very fulfilling direction that I'm exploring now.  <p>Read REWIRE -- but then USE it and FOLLOW it.  It could be life-changing for you, too.</span>

                    <span>"Don't Retire, Rewire," prepares the prospective retiree to think critically  about retirement before actually entering into it.  Retirement is often not what people expect.  This well-written book drives home the point that people approaching retirement age need to understand their drivers as they consider their "post-professional" life.  The case study approach is helpful, too.  I highly recommmend this book.</span>
