                <span id="Label1">For nearly a century, the original version of Upton Sinclair's classic novel has remained almost entirely unknown. When it was published in serial form in 1905, it was a full third longer than the censored, commercial edition published in book form the following year. That expurgated commercial edition edited out much of the ethnic flavor of the original, as well as some of the goriest descriptions of the meat-packing industry and much of Sinclair's most pointed social and political commentary. The text of this new edition is as it appeared in the original uncensored edition of 1905. It contains the full 36 chapters as originally published, rather than the 31 of the expurgated edition. A new foreword describes the discovery in the 1980s of the original edition and its subsequent suppression, and a new introduction places the novel in historical context by explaining the pattern of censorship in the shorter commercial edition.</span>

                    <span>I read the original version of The Jungle years ago in school, and it had quite an impact on me. However, 10 years later, with a decade in the working world behind me, I gained a new appreciation for it's message after rereading this uncut edition. This novel is easily the most disturbing and horrific book I've ever read, and it was published nearly 100 years ago! It not only opened my eyes to how far our country has come in terms of class relationships, labor laws, etc. but has given me a new outlook on my own life. Talk about pointing out how easy many of us have it today! It's part history book, part social commentary, part politics, part tragedy, and all classic. No other character in the history of literature gets put through the ringer like Jurgis does. Upton Sinclair said after the public reacted primarily to the slaughterhouse discriptions that he was "aiming for the publics heart, and hit their stomach instead." It will anger you, it will sadden you, but it will surely change the way you view our world today, and has certainly changed some of my modern pessimism into opptomism if only that it has reminded me that we indeed have made progress as a nation (even with all our current problems). I think everyone should read The Jungle, it's educational, eye opening, and so well written. From his struggle in the slaughterhouses of Chicago, to his slowly changing opinion of the world around him, and finally to his education on the way the machine works, Jurgis lives a life that has something everyone can relate to. Highly recommended for people wanting a glimpse into urban life a century ago, and fans of plain great story telling.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. Near the end I had more of a struggle to stick with the story. The story just pulls at your heart and I found myself continually shaking my head saying, "What can possibly go wrong now?" It is very disturbing to even think that scenes like this actually happened. It makes me terribly sad.</span>

                    <span>Originally published in 1906 by Upton Sinclair, THE JUNGLE sent shockwaves throughout the United States that resulted in cries for labor and agricultural reforms. It is indeed rare that a book should have such a political impact, but although Sinclair may have been surprised at the results, it is apparent while reading this novel that his words form a political agenda of its own. It should be noted that Sinclair was a devout Socialist who traveled to Chicago to document the working conditions of the world-famous stockyards. Sinclair originally published this book in serial form in the Socialist newspaper, The Appeal to Reason. But as a result of the popularity of this series Sinclair decided to try to publish in a form of a novel.<P>Sinclair widely utilized the metaphor of the jungle (survival of the fittest, etc.) throughout this book to reflect how the vulnerable worker is at the mercy of the powerful packers and politicians. Mother Nature is represented as a machine who destroys the weak and protects the elite powerful. To illustrate his sentiments Sinclair wrote of family of Jurgis and Ona who immigrated to Chicago from Lithuania in search of the American dream. They arrive in all innocence and believe that hard work would result in a stable income and security. But they soon realize that all the forces are against them. During the subsequent years Jurgis tries to hold on what he has but he is fighting a losing battle. It is not until he stumbles upon a political meeting that his eyes upon the evils of capitalism and the sacredness of socialism.<P>If one is to read THE JUNGLE, then they should do themselves a favor and seek out this version. It is the original, uncensored version that Sinclair originally intended to publish. It contains much more details of the horrifying conditions of the meatpacking industry that Jurgis and his family were subjected to. I originally read the standard version of this book many years ago, but I didn't hestitate to invest in this edition as I wanted to read what Sinclair had originally intended.<P>THE JUNGLE is an important book on the labor history of the United States, the non-fairytale immigration of foreigners into the melting pot, and the history of Chicago. Recommended, but not for the faint of heart.</span>
