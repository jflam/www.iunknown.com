                <span id="Label1">An in-depth look at big pharma's flagship company<br>   The Merck Druggernaut takes readers inside Merck, the world's second most profitable drug company and maker of the world's bestselling drug, Prilosec. Consistently named one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired Companies, Merck struggles to maintain its reputation for being the most ethical of the big drug makers, refusing to slash research and development budgets in the face of declining profits, falling stock market prices, and questionable accounting. Author Fran Hawthorne, one of the leading journalists covering healthcare, has written an excellent examination of a business paragon with much-needed insight on the cutthroat world of pharmaceuticals. It's a story that will interest the business world as well as consumer and healthcare advocates by detailing the vital issues in medicine and healthcare today. More than just a compelling story of success in a difficult industry, more than simply the biography of one of big business's most recognizable names, The Merck Druggernaut takes a thoughtful look at some of the major issues of our time and the way those issues intertwine with the world of business.   <p>   Fran Hawthorne (New York, NY) is the Assistant Managing Editor at Crain's New York Business. She has been covering business for more than twenty years for such publications as Fortune, BusinessWeek, and Institutional Investor, with a prevailing interest in healthcare and pharmaceuticals. At Crain's, she spearheads the publication of two to three special healthcare issues per year.</span>

                    <span>As a writer with a strong interest in the pharmaceutical industry, I found this book to be an an insightful account of Merck's evolution, it's journey to becoming a giant on the pharmaceutical landscape and its subsequent decline in prestige (and value) as patents to its profitable drugs expire and obstacles to new drug development become insurmountable.<p>But "The Merck Druggernaut" is more than Merck's story.  This book provides a riveting overview of the ills that afflict the entire industry and its growing estrangement from the needs of people, medicine and the complexities of healthcare insurance.<p>Fran Hawthorne's book is a must read for anyone interested in understanding how Merck fits into the overall picture of pharma's conflict between profit and corporate responsibility.  <p>Alice Shane</span>

                    <span>This book suceeds in examining the pharmaceutical industry in general and it is a fairly balanced look at one company. Fran Hawthorn uses Merck as a standard to compare to other drug companies and even compares the present-day Merck unfavorably to the moral high ground Merck trod in the past. I think Merck employees were very careful about the information they provided, and there weren't really compelling stories about individual people within the company. The book made me wish Fran had written an expose instead of a dispassionate, although informative nonfiction piece.</span>

                    <span>I was amazed by this book! A colleague gave it to me and it proved much more interesting and readable than I'd expected. Far from a business book, it is actually as well-written as a novel. It's provides a balanced assessment of this industry and reveals both it's positive influences and negative. It's also a book about much more than one drug company: It's about big issues that are really important now, like drug prices, the political clout of the drug industry, drug ads, etc. If you want to educate yourself and enjoy the process immensely, READ THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, this book reflects the limited access that the author had to the people behind the pages. It comes across as a well chronicled excursion through the world of drug development and managed healthcare issues. However, the content is hardly Merck-specific. Much of this could have been written based on newspaper articles on the company. It offers no insights of significance into what made Merck such a great company and how the greatness might have contributed to the troubles it is currently facing. In sum, I would say that the title is grossly misleading.</span>
