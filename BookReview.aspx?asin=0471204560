                <span id="Label1">The inside story of one of the world's most legendary restaurants&#151;told by the visionary who created it    <br>    Sirio Maccioni is New York's most charismatic restaurateur&#151;the brains, the energy, and the passion behind Le Cirque 2000. Now, for the first time, he reveals the incredible story of this landmark four-star restaurant, which has launched the careers of such world-class chefs as Jacques Torres and Daniel Boulud and won a host of prestigious awards, including the James Beard Foundation Restaurant of the Year Award (199-5) and "The Best Restaurant in the World" Reader's Choice Award from Cond&#233; Nast Traveler (200-3).    <p>From a tough Tuscan childhood in 1930s Italy to the pinnacle of culinary success in the United States, Sirio recounts an eventful journey that is as magical and fantastic as Le Cirque itself. Throughout, 30 signature recipes and interviews with chefs (including Daniel Boulud, Michael Lomonaco, and Sottha Khunn), food writers (such as Ruth Reichl and Mimi Sheraton) and politicians, socialites, and celebrities (Rudy Giuliani, David Rockefeller, Bill Blass, and others) reveal Sirio's skill in handling the three rings of his unique culinary circus: its chefs, its clientele, and its cuisine.    <p>"[Sirio] and his restaurant have come to symbolize all that is so cosmopolitan, so kinetic, so thrilling about New York. . . . Le Cirque remains both a gastronomic mecca and the premier social dining room."    &#151;James Villas, in Town & Country    <p>Sirio Maccioni (New York, NY) is the owner of Le Cirque 2000 (New York, Las Vegas, and Mexico City) and Osteria del Circo (New York). Peter Elliot (New York, NY) is the host of the James Beard Award-winning radio show, The Bloomberg Executive Dining Guide.    </span>

                    <span>Not sure how many of you read this book, but if you have then you know what im talking about. First question goes to the author of this piece - Is this a cookbook or the receipe for the great "American Dream?" Second question is to Mr. Sirio - How did you do it?<BR> Noticed that this guy Peter Elliot seems to know what really matters in life and prosperity, I mean where did this guy go to school? Scotland or the "school of hard knocks"? Ohh yeah, thats a compliament, no offense Mr. Elliot. Being a young polish-american citizen this day an age has opened my eyes to how America; the land of the free, home of the brave; is being protrayed through the eyes of others less fortunite then us. And i read a cookbook to come to that conclusion, LOL - lifes funnny.<BR> To Sirrio, Jesus, if all this is true; I feel your "angoscia" - for you all who haven't read this book, thats agony. Was also wondering, i do alot of that lately, where i would be seated if i happened to walk through the doors of "Le Cirque" with a women of course, whos name i won't mention.<BR> Thanks for the great read guys!<P>Daniel</span>

                    <span>... so "Sirio: The Story of My Life and Le Cirque" does for the culinary biography.<P>Part biography of a food maestro, part chronicle of a celebrated restaurant, part food fable, part window onto American aristocratic society, "Sirio: The Story of My Life and Le Cirque" is a must-read for cognoscenti of all flavors. For cuisine fiends and the people who love them (like myself), chillin with restauranteur Sirio Maccioni is immensely more enjoyable than chillin creme brulee .... trust me.<P>"Sirio..."'s recipe for success contains merely two ingredients: a darn good story + a darn good presentation. The darn good story is a "ragazzo" to riches tale that goes from Mussolini's italy to Giuliani's NYC, with some glamorous stops along the way. Of course, Sirio Maccioni's life IS le Cirque and his climb to the top of FoodWorld's Mount Everest makes this book a page-turner.<P>"Sirio..."'s unique presentation also helps make the book a winner. Sirio's grandfatherly stream-of-consciousness recollections are surrounded by a bed of traditional biography (authored by Bloomberg food critic Peter Elliot in an easily digestible pithy style).All this is then smothered with a layer of baroque recipes that will have your lips smackin' for 400+ pages. The continual interspersing of Sirio, Elliot, and the recipes is rarely jarring and the stylistic flip-flopping keeps the narrative lively and the reader interested.<P>Using the formula that made le Cirque, the restaurant, a success... exceptional food served with flair... le Cirque the book, is a feast for lovers of food, biography, or society. Thankfully, for us all, no reservations are needed to get this Dish served up tastefully. Bon Appetit.</span>

                    <span>By Bill Marsano. Can you see yourself reading a couple of hundred pages about the nation's best-known restaurant and restaurateur? Yes, it's all a form of glorified gossip, but if you're interested in the food world and a ton of big names for lagniappe, then you will have a lot of fun here.<P>Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque is a pretty good story-teller to begin with and he has the able assistance of Peter J. Elliott. The two combine in the early chapters to give an affecting account of Sirio's early life in wartime and postwar Italy ("we lived, we farmed, we got arrested") and then move neatly into his years of building a career, enslaving himself on passenger liners on the high seas and tony restaurants in Paris, New York and elsewhere.<P>Once he gets to Manhattan things begin to pop and the only fair thing to do is set down some of the notables who talk and/or are talked about in these pages. Stars? Siro's got 'em": Yves Montand, Lauren Bacall, The Burtons ("they came--but just to fight"), the Windsors, Sinatra, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford. Peter Duchin, Claudette Colbert, Gina Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren--my what a bunch of clods our present-day stars seem to be by comparison (Britney? J.Lo? Please!). Amonmg princes and politicos there are the Reagans, Nixon, Ford, most Kennedys, Juan Carlos of Spain, King Umberto of Italy, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Princess Grace . . . Glitterati: Mrs. Wm. F. Buckley, Babe Paley, Jackie O., Lee Radziwill. Writers: Colman Andrews, James Villas, Michael Batterberry, Truman Capote, Leonard Lyons, Cindy Adams, Liz Smith, Gael Greene, Bryan Miller, Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, Julia Child. And more. Many more.<P>Ho-hum is what I thought when I picked this up, but it proved me wrong. It's fun.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.</span>
