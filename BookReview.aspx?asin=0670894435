                    <span>Nigel Nicolson is uniquely qualified to write a brief biography of Virginia Woolf.  First, he is one of the most important caretakers of her written work, having edited her letters for publication.  Second, as a small boy, he actually knew Virginia Woolf.  Third, his mother was Vita Sackville-West, one of the major figures in Virginia's life, the object of her affections, one of her closest friends, and the basis for the main character in ORLANDO.  This could well be, in fact, one of the last books written about Virginia Woolf by someone who actually knew her.
<br />
<br />Perhaps as a result of his unusual connection with her, this biography has an aura of the real Virginia Woolf that many do not.  As Nicolson puts it early on, while for many she was "Woolf," for him he was always "Virginia."  He knew her before she was the icon she was later to become.  Auden said of Yeats that upon his death "he became his admirers," and Woolf has certainly undergone a similar transformation, and frequently books deal one her deal not with who she was, but who they need her to be.  Nicolson's portrait is a remarkably rich and concrete one, a splendid portrait of an amazingly gifted and complex individual.  He captures her gift for friendship and kindness along with her need to sometimes hurt others with her words.  He deals with her openness to love between men or women along with her near dread of actual sexual involvement with either (indeed, most biographies point up the fact that while she had several romantic attachments, her sex life was nonetheless almost nonexistent).  He contrasts her feminism with her restricted view of how far women's rights should extend (she was never able to break out of her class bound views on the lower classes) with her apathy to politics in general.  He makes vivid her huge capacity for enjoying life while invoking the struggles she underwent to stay sane enough to do so.  He also provides a sympathetic portrait of her marriage to Leonard Woolf, who was simultaneously her biggest supporter, her caretaker and nurse, and greatest devotee.  If Leonard sometimes emerges as a bit codependent, one can forgive him because he seemed capable of giving a great deal while still producing a prodigious amount of work himself.  They seemed, improbably, to have a remarkably good marriage, given her mental problems.
<br />
<br />Nicolson also provides good insight into Virginia's struggles with mental health, even making her suicide seem less an act of despair than an insistence on ending life when it still was more or less sane (she killed herself largely because she thought she was about to go insane again, was about to succumb to the hallucinations that had plagued her on more than one occasion in the past, with one difference:  she was convinced that if she became insane again, she would not reemerge from it again as she had in the past).  Her's was a suicide not of despair but of a fear of losing her humanity.
<br />
<br />I have to state that I find the comments by one the previous reviewers (Rebekah) absolutely incomprehensible.  The complaint is made that Nicolson criticized Woolf's feminism and was guilty of a "macho attitude."  These are absolutely stunning complaints, since one of the very mild criticisms that Nicolson makes through the work is that instead of being a liberal, Virginia was actually fairly tied to her class, that she did hold to views of women's suffrage, but only for women of the upper middle class.  One will search in vain in his pages for views of the kind that she allots to him.  It is true that he wants to correct views that do not take an accurate view of her feminism, views that do not see how deeply she was rooted in a particular class.  The only rational reading of the book and Nicolson's position is that he seems disappointed that she did not take her feminist beliefs far enough and that she was not as a whole especially interested in politics.  Besides, it is exceedingly odd to accuse the offspring of a lesbian mother and a gay father as being "old-fashioned."  Again, Nicolson absolutely nowhere either by word or by intimation criticizes Woolf's feminism.  Indeed, if one actually reads the book, it is clear that Nicolson has a far more contemporary view of women and politics than did Virginia Woolf.  One does gain a sense that Nicolson had lived a long and rich life (he died this past fall at the age of 87), but I think most readers will look in vain for the old-fashioned ideas (and certainly the machismo) wrongly ascribed to him.
<br />
<br />This is not the best biography on Virginia Woolf.  For one thing it is far, far too brief to do even a cursory job.  For instance, her friendship with Roger Fry is almost gestured at, her relationship with her sister Vanessa is given little space, and in all descriptions are kept to a minimum to keep to the publisher's guidelines for the series.  Nonetheless, I'm quite impressed with what he achieves in such a short amount of space.  Although not one of the more complete biographies, it is nonetheless one of the best at giving an almost tangible picture of Virginia.  </span>

                    <span>One thing to know before buying or reading this book is that it is written by a man who was born in the early 1900's and still holds many of the old-fashioned beliefs of that time. It is irritating to listen to Nicolson berate Virginia's feminist beliefs, argue that her statements about women's disadvantages were not true and basically undermine what many readers admire her for - her progressive and liberal point of view. It is not what I bought this biography for. I wanted to know more about Virginia, not Nicolson's macho attitude. For the most part the biography is very good, it would just be a lot better if he kept his opinions to himself.</span>

                    <span>I read this mainly to gain a little more insight into Virginia Woolf-the-person because of an essay I was writing on "To the Lighthouse." It didn't really provide me with the biographical detail or psychological penetration I was craving -  but then, I doubt that was Nicolson's intent. Instead he offers a curiously airy yet affectionate series of character sketches, a handful of priceless anecdotes and some incidental musings, all of which amounts to an entertaining reflection on Woolf's life and personality but actually makes her more mysterious and unknowable in certain ways. It's memoir vs biography, I guess; Nicolson tends to regard Woolf from the point of view of a bemused bystander, fond of her but not overly engaged with her - but at the same time, he feels no need to make much sense of her suicide, for instance. He just dips in and out of what interests him, not striving for deeper meaning or cogency when it does not suit him, and this makes it a dissatisfying book for someone not already well acquainted with Woolf's biography.<p>That said, this is an enjoyable read. Nicolson is supremely English, in quite a charming way - his prose is coolly elegant with an occasional flash of wit or moment of restrained warmth, and he never declares anything outright, just insinuates or suggests (not unlike Woolf herself). His attitude to his subject is both touchingly and infuriatingly respectful. I think he was so terrified of being scurrilous, of exploiting his position as Vita Sackville-West's son, that this book comes off as over-polite, over-careful; he whets our interest but refuses to supply the goods. It's a pity, because he really does have an unique perspective. <br>Still, I reccommend it. It's a quick read, and a nice way to spend an afternoon.</span>

                    <span>In this "Penguin Life" Nigel Nicolson provides a balanced, affectionate and eloquent introduction to the life of Virginia Woolf. Nicolson provides us with the major events, the major players, the family background, and Bloomsbury. He also introduces the reader to some of the controversies (e.g., the extent and effect of her sexual abuse by her half-brothers.) The picture that emerges is one of a brilliant and complex woman -- difficult, loving, deeply insightful, wrong-headed, sympathetic, prickly, loyal, jealous, witty, snobbish, and liberal.<p>Nicholson is an editor of Woolf's letters and the son of Vita Sackville-West, with whom Virginia Woolf had an affair. Nicolson's having known and liked Virginia Woolf adds a personal touch without compromising objectivity.</span>
