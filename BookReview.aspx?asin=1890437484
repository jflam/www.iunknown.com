I have already read this fascinating book 3 times and each time I find something interesting that I missed the first time. Buy this book,you won't be sorry.</span>

                    <span>This is a great mix of old photos, new photos, and history.  It makes a great companion piece to the more popular "Colorado 1870 - 2000" and in some ways it is superior to that book.  For one thing, "Colorado Yesterday and Today" costs half as much as the Jackson/Fielder book.  Also, Collier takes the time to talk about each and every place that is featured in his collection of photographs, something which is sorely missing in the other book.<p>Collier's re-shoots are right on the money, and when they are not, he tells us (access issues pop up from time to time).  The connection to his great-great-grandfather is touching.  Most importantly, this is a book that you can read and enjoy.  It is not a ponderous 'picture book' that won't fit in your bookcase.</span>

                    <span>Although most people who live in Colorado have a vague idea of how much the state has changed in the past century, to see it shown so starkly in beautiful photographs like this is fascinating.  Grant Collier has created an amazing testimonial to the march of history and the turbulent growth of the Centennial State.  Collier's love of his subject is obvious on every page and the reader can't help but be drawn into a story, not only of Colorado, but of Collier's search to understand his stoic great-grandfather, the famous pioneer photographer Joseph Collier.  Buy it!</span>

                    <span>Colorado: Yesterday & Today is a truly compelling look at Colorado through the eyes of one of our state's pioneer photographers and his great-great-grandson, Grant Collier.  Everything about this book is first-rate, from the then-and-now photos and the text to the very impressive leather cover.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who lives in, or enjoys visiting, Colorado.</span>

                    <span>This book is absolutely wonderful.  We have this and John Fielder's book and, well, they're both great, but this is by far my favorite.  I love the comparisons.  The photos are marvelous.  This is a very good historical record of a beautiful state!</span>
