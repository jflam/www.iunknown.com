                <span id="Label1">This memoir from the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, now revised and updated, offers a unique behind-the-scenes look at how war is fought today. <P>In <I>Waging Modern War</I>, General Wesley K. Clark recounts his experience leading NATO's forces to a hard-fought and ultimately successful victory in Kosovo in 1999. As the American military machine has swung into action in the months following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, it has become clear that the lessons of Kosovo are directly applicable to the war against terrorism and the nations that sponsor it. <P>The problems posed, and overcome, in the war in Kosovo--how to fight an air war against unconventional forces in rough terrain and how to coordinate U.S. objectives with those of other nations--are the problems that America increasingly faces in the today's world. As the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> noted in late September of 2001, this book's "lessons are highly relevant now.... We need to think about exactly what steps will lessen, rather than increase, the terrorist threat. And we also need innovative commanders willing to improvise to meet a new kind of threat, more determined political leadership, a more flexible outlook in the Pentagon.... Gen. Clark has performed another service by highlighting these problems at a crucial moment in American history. " <P><I>Waging Modern War</I> is history, memoir, guidebook, and forecast, essential reading for those who want to know how modern war is fought, and won.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Clark has written an excellent book on the politics of coalition warfare. However, there is precious little in the book on the actual mechanics of one of the most important air campaigns ever waged. Kosovo was the first conflict, in which air power alone determined the out come of the war. The introduction of weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and other GPS guided weapons totally revolutionized the effectivness of airpower, effectively delivering what air power enthusiasts have been promising since the days of Billy Mitchell and Curtis Lemay. <P>I for one hoped to find out more about the air campaign but was sorely disappointed on this count. Nothing in the book about how the Serb's managed to obtain the Nato Air Tasking Order (ATO) in advance thereby greatly enhancing the danger to Nato pilots. Also only a few lines devoted to the bombing of the Chinese Embassy, an event of huge political significance. That the Chinese Embassy was the only target in the whole campaign nominated by a certain intelligence agency in Langley Virginia, underscores how woefully unprepared that organization is to support U.S. military operations.<BR>Nonetheless, despite the books shortcomings it does give an insiders view into the politcs behind the Kosovo Campaign. Most disturbingly it illustrates how the Service Chiefs and Chairman of the JCS seemingly undermined the spirit if not the letter of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which was supposed to enhance the powers of the regionals CINCs. This was perhaps the most disturbing element of the book. Of particular concern was how the Army Chief of Staff used his influence to deny Clark the use of Apache Helicopters deployed to Albania. Truly a pathetic tale. At any rate if your interested in the politics of coalition warfare you will love this book. If you want details on one of the most important Air Campaigns ever waged, one that in many ways was a precursor for the Afghanistan Campaign, you will be disappointed. Come to think of it, though, could we really expect an Army 4 Star, to write in glowing terms about Air Power?</span>

                    <span>"We lost our way in the world when we lost our adversary." "The 1997 Quadrenial Defense Review set the Pentagon against the foreign policy establishment and the regional CINCs [commanders in chief]... the Pentagon tried to dictate foreign policy." - Gen. Wesley K. Clark, USA (ret.) 			August 8, 2001<P>These two quotes appropriately describe the two major themes found within "Waging Modern War."<P>When I saw this book, felt a personal need to read it - I had been present at Pentagon briefings the day prior to the commencement of Allied Force and was party to personal meetings with General Clark in the waning days of the Operation. I knew it would be a damning review of NATOs actions regarding Kosovo, but I had no idea it would be so insightful and poignant.<P>General Wesley K. Clark, USA (ret.) begins by (briefly) addressing his career history and the hand he had in creating the current U.S. Grand Strategy, focusing on two nearly-simultaneous major regional conflicts (2MRC), and the strategy of overwhelming force, popular support and technological superiority, known as 'The Powell Doctrine.' He then addresses his path to becoming SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (NATO) and U.S. CINC Europe, a dual-role which would set him against the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the basic U.S. foreign policy. <P>Clark relates the inherent conflicts of interests resulting from the U.S. approach to the 2MRC policy and the needs of regional CINCs, suggesting that the policy which he himself helped pen is outdated and restrictive in the post-Cold War Era. General Clark advocates and explains the failure of the U.S. to use diplomatic compellence through threat of force to achieve policy goals in the former-Yugoslavia, as well as the failure to understand the usefulness of diplomacy during the bombing campaign. <P>Perhaps most telling are Clark's accounts of his discussions with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Hugh Shelton, USA and then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joseph Ralston, USAF - conversations that demonstrated a lack of understanding and concern for the European theater and its political and strategic circumstances. He also details the actions on the part of his subordinate and parallel U.S. commanders in Europe, some of whom were more concerned about their own careers than doing a marginally good job, as well as the circumstances that led to his dismissal and replacement by Ralston, euphemistically termed an 'early retirement.' Finally, Clark addresses his growing concern over the increasing U.S. focus on the Middle East and Eastern Asia at the expense of NATO and our European allies.<P>While not popular within the Pentagon, due to the number of high-ranking officers he blasts and his airing of dirty laundry, Wes Clark's views are privately shared by many high-ranking military officials, particularly those serving in NATO commands. In June, a personal meeting over dinner in Paris reconfirmed this with one very high-ranking U.S. flag officer. <P>Clark hopes this well-written, interesting and insightful book will serve not just to point out the mistakes of one campaign, but to cause the U.S. defense establishment to reconsider its strategy and the manner in which it deals with political goals and regional commanders. I hope so as well.</span>

                    <span>Very well-written book that outlines the issues and problems that America will face in the 21st century in low-intensity conflicts around the world.<P>Whats really funny is reading Newt Gingrich's review and how he lies (again) and spins the truth about the Clark-Clinton relationship and I might add that his review was written before Wes Clark ran for President.<P>Ouch! Too bad poor ole Newt can't delete his review!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Only a short way into this book, I quickly realized General Clark wrote the book himself without the help of a ghost writer. It appears he also lacked the help of a good editor. The story jumps around from thought to thought without solid editorial orginization. Aside from the poor organization of the book, the content has some shortcomings as well. It is extremely self serving and bears little objectivity. I found it disturbing to read that Clark viewed his role as Commander of NATO more seriously than his role as a United States Army Officer. He does not atempt to hide the fact that he entered the US into a war directly against the wishes of his civilian superior. This book makes it clear why Secretary Cohen and General Shelton are not supporting his bid for President and question his integrity. Due to his presidential bid this book is being removed from the Army's Command and General Staff reading list. This is unfortunate despite its poor style because the book serves as a cautionary tale of the possibility to abuse the powers currently resting in the US military unified command structure.</span>
