                <span id="Label1">This thorough guide explains how to harness the power of Java to create distributed systems, which the author defines as a group of "agents" working together across multiple systems.<p>In order to create distributed applications, Java programmers need to be familiar with a host of technologies and language features in Java. These include Java's networking capabilities, its threading model, CORBA, Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and the JDBC standard for connecting to databases. <I>Java Distributed Computing</I> is a step-by-step guide to all of these pieces of the puzzle, presented in a concise, usable format.<p>The author presents each topic in digestible increments with some illustrative Java code, including a distributed game of chess, a chat application, and a whiteboard application. Advanced chapters cover security issues and dealing with "limited bandwidth" applications (such as pagers or Web browsers). Useful appendices list the fundamentals of CORBA, RMI, and JavaSpaces to make it easy for the working developer to look them up. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></span>

                    <span>Do not buy this book. The code is full of bugs and does not appear to be tested by the author. You will spend ... and waste many hours trying to get the code to complie. The code is not very well explained in the text.  Overall, the book is very disappointing, and really a huge waste of  time.<p>O'Reilly have a big turkey here. Save your money - buy something  else.</span>

                    <span>In general, this book will give you quite a good overview of distributed Programming in Java. It covers many subjects from sockets to security. Some of the subjects like sockets and RMI are explained fairly well, but others  that are complex like CORBA and Security are not explained in detail. The  nice part about this book is that it gives a good overview of most API's  and subjects related to Distributed Computing in Java. For people, looking  for a clear book with lots of examples and details on this subject, this  book is NOT for you. This book is not excatly EASY to read and its  definately NOT full of examples, BUT if you are patient enough while  reading, you will learn quite a lot from this book. I also warn you that  you may need to read other books on some subjects in this book like CORBA  to be able to understand them well. In conclusion, if you are a newbie that  wants to learn distributed programming in Java I suggest that you buy this  book ALONG with another one that is clear and easy.</span>

                    <span>Given the explanations included in that book, I can't imagine anybody would learn anything but vague concepts about networking you would find much better documented in many other (much better) books.  The mere 12  pages dedicated to CORBA for instance won't teach you anything, unless you  have never heard about it before. Not worth even opening it.</span>

                    <span>I lost a lot of time reading this poor book and trying to run incomplete  code. The line followed by the author is very confusing. He is always  trying to approach a lot of things at the same time. I think a better help  with working examples would be Java Distributed Objects by Richard Soley. I  would give a zero-star review for this.</span>

                    <span>The people below slamming this book should have taken the time to finish reading it.  After reading the first two or three chapters, I thought it was pretty weak (and there are a few bizarre tangents the author takes in  there, too).   But the book as a whole is very good, especially the later  chapters and the downloadable source code (how nice to have code that  actually works!).</span>
