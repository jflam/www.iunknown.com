                    <span>Java in a Nutshell, 4th Ed.<P>If I was trapped in a desert cubicle and allowed only one Java book this would be it. I dig Sun's Javadocs that come with the SDKs, but Java in a Nutshell has proved invaluable to java developers. It is compact, easy to browse, and provides a very handy language/SDK guide. With each major release of J2SE. This <BR>edition is no exception:<P>- most up to date coverage of SDK & language changes:<BR>	- assertions<BR>	- cryptography<BR>	- XML processing<BR>	- new IO facilities<P>	- logging<BR>	- properties & preferences,<BR>	- collections changes<P>A quick search of Amazon yielded only one other book that is up to date for J2SE 1.4, and it was not a reference for experienced programmers. This nutshell reference is ahead of the pack.<P>However, there have been a few changes to this edition that aren't popular with me. I was a big fan of the quasi-UML class diagrams on the first page of each package. Especially for the IO and Util (collections) packages, it was a great way to see the architecture of an entire package. I could find out at a glance who implements a certain interface, or to find a common ancestor class. These diagrams are gone. <P>Instead of having one diagram for all the elements (interfaces, classes, exceptions) in a single package, the authors present a class diagram for each individual class and place it with each class' entry. To somewhat make up for this, the author has provided expanded narrative at the beginning of each package, hitting the highlights and providing an almost javadoc style listing of the elements contained in the package.<P>I understand this was probably done for practical reasons. Some of the packages have grown very large with one or more subpackages (java.util being the biggest offender here) and diagrams for some of the packages wouldn't fit on the smaller <BR>pages of the Nutshell series. Irregardless, it a loss of key functionality for this edition.<P>Lastly, the authors removed the singlemost important navigational tool of the previous editions: the thumb tabs on the margins of the pages indexed by package. These tabs made it very easy to quickly flip to the exact package you were looking for. In this edition you have to rely on the page footers for this information.<P>Despite the small changes, this edition continues in the tradition of the Java in a Nutshell series: the most up to date java reference that is available on the market.</span>

                    <span>This is a LARGE nutshell! This title is meant to be one volume of a three volume set that covers the entire language. Volume two covers the foundation classes, while volume three covers the enterprise classes.<P>If you're just starting out with Java and you're trying to learn the language, this isn't the book for you. While Part 1 could be used as instructional material, it is truly "no fluff". It's best suited for an experienced object-oriented programmer making the leap to Java, or a Java programmer looking for a concise review. A good learning book would be "Learning Java" by Pat Neimeyer and Jonathan Knudsen from O'Reilly.<P>The really valuable part of this book is Part 2. Each chapter defines the classes in that package with an explanation on what it does and how it works. There's a diagram that shows the class hierarchy from the root Object class, as well as what version of Java supports that class. This is then followed by all the constructors and methods used in the class. Don't expect detailed explanations on these methods. As a nutshell book, you get all the basic info on what's available, but you'll need to experiment with some of the methods before you understand them.<P>A legitimate question might be... Why get this book if I have the online API documentation from Sun? I see them as complimentary. You can probably find much of the reference material in either source. Some will prefer the online hyperlink navigation, while others will appreciate having all the information on a subject in four or five pages that can be thumbed through. I know when I'm stuck on a problem I want both sources!<P>For a Notes/Domino developer, it is somewhat similar to using online Notes help versus the manuals. In that case, the material is identical, so it's more your preference in how you like to look up information. In the case of this book versus the Java API documentation, you'll get good information from both sources, so you should avail yourself of both.<P>Conclusion<BR>If you've completed something like Teach Yourself Java In 21 Days and now you have to DO something with Java, you owe it to yourself to get this book. This will be one title you'll go back to again and again as you explore the wild, wild world of Java.</span>

                    <span>This isn't a textbook. It's a handbook, and gives good, clear descriptions of every corner of the Java language. Java isn't a big feature-sodden language, but has a few obscure corners. If you just can't remember the syntax for up-reference from an inner class, you'll find it fast and explained well.<P>The API guide is fairly complete, but terse. Well, it has to be - the API keep growing. No one book could hold a complete description of everything. Sad to say, earlier editions had more complete API descriptions. The second, for example, had a very good introduction to reflection. As the Java API grew, however, the old descriptions had to shrink to make way for the new, and the reflection discussion was squeezed out. Still, it gives a good quick look at the API. This isn't as complete as the Javadoc API information, but is hugely more browseable. Use this to direct your query into the right area, then use Sun's Javadoc to get the details.<P>If you have room for only one Java book, make it this one.</span>

                    <span>This is an OK Java book for most cases. I think the author got lost in the world of updating a piece of work he has already spent countless hours in and just wanted to get this one more revision out the door. Oh, yes, this book will be completely useless to you if you are not a C programmer. I have programmed in MANY languages for the past 15 years, and I couldn't find another reference book that does so little referencing to the language itself and so much to how it compares to C. My verdict go with some other Java book if you are not a C guru.</span>
