                    <span>You know, the program that says all technical books have to explain programming in excruciating detail for non-programmers, even when the book title says "for experienced programmers"?  The program that results in books on one small topic will thereby be expanded to 1600 pages, so we can charge $40 or $50?  THAT program!  I'm thinking this guy published it himself. It's pretty darn clear and well-written, with very few grammatical errors in spite of the lack of a professional editing staff.  If you're a VB.Net programmer, or ASP.Net, or C# programmer, and you already have adequate reference books for doing the rest of your work, and all you need is a good & thorough reference to Crystal Reports, THIS is the book you want to get.  </span>

                    <span>I've just purchased a copy of this book.  On first inspection, the contents look promising.  Howerver, the quality control is poor; pages 215 - 246 are missing.
<br />
<br />Update:
<br />
<br />The good news is that the author (and self publisher) is very responsive.  I sent an email complaining of the missing pages and within a few hours received a response from the author.  He's offered to provide a replacement.  He's a good guy.</span>

                    <span>I cannot believe anyone who has actually read this book has given it less than 5 stars.  I am a veteran software engineer and application developer who has been using CR.NET from day one of its existance (and many other report writers long before it).  Nonetheless, it is ridiculous how much I have learned from this book.  Let's face it, the MSDN content on Crystal Reports for .NET is weak; I know, because I have read all of it.  This book not only fills the gap, it cracks the walls on both sides.
<br />
<br />This is the only book on the planet that covers CR for the Visual Studio developer this well.  If you use Visual Studio, no matter which language, and you use Crystal Reports, you need this book.  And don't use the excuse that it is too late in the cycle for the current version and you are waiting for VS 2005, and the 2005 version of this book.  If you have to write any new reports with CR.NET between now and when 2005 ships, this book will a) save you a lot of time and b) make your reports better than before.  The $25 this book costs is a joke for the value packed in these pages.
<br />
<br />Final note: Brian has self-published a technical book that shames the major publishers of technical books available today.  You can really tell that this was something he worked very hard on to get right and he succeeded in a big way.  Encourage him to do this again; buy the book if you need this valuable info.

                    <span>I am a practicing (read paid) developer and needed to quickly ramp up on Crystal Reports in Visual Studio 2003. My prior report writing was done in Access using VBA.
<br />
<br />This book is extremely useful. It has good examples and is very well written. I would have spent a great deal more time learning without it.</span>

                    <span>Poorly written, very little, if any, useful information.  Some pages are half-blank! The book has a very poor layout. And a lot of the pages are wasted by extra large screen shots.  No good examples to follow. The features are explained but the examples are poor. Just opening the program and playing around with it, trying some examples I found on the web, was more useful than this book. I'm going to have to buy the Wrox book now. I had a peek at it in the book store and I liked it.  </span>
