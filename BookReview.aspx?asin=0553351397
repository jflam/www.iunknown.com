                <span id="Label1">Thich Nhat Hanh's writing is deceptive in its subtlety. He'll go on and on with stories about tree-hugging or metaphors involving raw potatoes; he'll tell you how to eat mindfully, even how to breathe and walk; he'll suggest looking closely at a flower and to see the sun as your heart.  As the Zen teacher Richard Baker commented, however, Nhat Hanh is "a cross between a cloud, a snail, and piece of heavy machinery." Sooner or later, it begins to sink in that Nhat Hanh is conveying a depth of psychology and a world outlook that require nothing less than a complete paradigm shift. Through his cute stories and compassionate admonitions, he gradually builds up to his philosophy of interbeing, the notion that none of us <I>is</I> separately, but rather that we <I>inter-are</I>. The ramifications are explosive. How can we mindlessly and selfishly pursue our individual ends, when we are inextricably bound up with everyone and everything else? We see an enemy not as focus of anger but as a human with a complex history, who could be us if we had the same history. Suffice it to say, that after reading <I>Peace Is Every Step</I>, you'll never look at a plastic bag the same way again, and you may even develop a penchant for hugging trees.  <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>I have read this book like 5 times and everytime I read it I learn something new. This book has changed my life and the way that I treat others. I would recomend this book to anyone who is looking for themselves or something bigger than themselves, for anyone who is looking for answers this book has them. I have bought copies for my friends and have loaned my own out and everyone I have given it too has said the same thing that they couldn't put it down and that it was just what they were looking for. Read this book and open your mind and heart up to it and it will change you.

                    <span>I had never read any book before on this topic, and chose this one because it seemed to be so easy to read and understand.  I dare say this book changed my life.  I came to it while in recovery for an eating disorder (which stems from a lack of coping skills), and this book helped me find peace; it showed me how to transform uneasy feelings; it showed me how to forgive; it showed me how to enjoy the present moment.
<br />
<br />I was so moved by these writings.  As I mentioned, I enjoy my life more.  I enjoy my children more.  My marriage has improved.  I have improved.
<br />
<br />I had never experienced the concepts of "inter-are" and how things don't have to be either right or wrong... things can just "be".  I can just be.
<br />
<br />I keep this book by my side because although it is a short book, it is so deeply profound that it might take me years to grasp everything in it.

                    <span>Following Nhat Hanh's book "Being Peace", this is my next favorite by this articulate Zen master. Within you will find commentaries and meditations straight from the heart of Thay, as well as stories of his life as an activist for peace. It is so very applicable to our daily lives. Lately it's become all too clear that this world needs a healthy serving of peace. Our spiritual mouths are so hungry for this. The meditations Thich Nhat Hanh has been celebrated worldwide for are captured within this deceptively slim book. For those of you who have come to know Thay through his wide body of books, you know how well he communicates points to all of us; always with a soothing ease and simplicity. That style is more than ever evident in this text. This work is a remarkable starting point for someone interested in looking into Buddhism, searching for balance in their lives; it's for non Buddhists who are simply looking for a way to bridge the gap of divisiveness.  Thich Nhat Hanh is such a good friend to us all, and buying this magnificent book can help all of us become better friends to the world at large. Enjoy it.</span>

                    <span>This is a book to savor slowly. I will sometimes just read a paragraph or two and set it down to let the words really be absorbed.  While that is my approach, this is a thin book that can be read very quickly if one wishes.  <p>The prospective purchaser (or gift-giver) need not worry about this being "too Buddhist" or religious.  Of course it encompasses Buddhism's most profound meanings, but the writing approach of Thich Nhat Hahn is warmly inviting as he simply speaks of more peaceful ways each of us can make our way in this world. His words, with little reference to Buddhist tenets, come across as common sense that we often need to rediscover.  <p>It is very much about the *personal* journey to peace, with gentle stories that remind and reveal the goodness within each of us, that goodness then expanding in ripples that touch those in our lives.  The writing is open and sincere and stated with a direct kindness.   It is truly wonderful how he makes such profound ideas and options so simple and broadly understandable. <p>This is a book I love to give as a gift.  I believe you will find his words to be worth your time.</span>
