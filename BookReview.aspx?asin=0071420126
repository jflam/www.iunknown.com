                    <span>Before opening this book, I wouldn't believe you could learn a language from a book. But the authors have done an amazing job of simplifying the language, breaking it down into the basic elements and conveying it all to the reader. Three factors make this book exceptional:<P>Structure: every chapter in the book is built on the ones preceding it. Initially it is frustrating, because verbs, the cornerstone of any language, are not introduced until chapter 5. But the preparations are essential.<P>Exercises: the exercises at the end of each chapter cover and reiterate the important aspects and stress translations in a sentence-context. All the answers are provided at the end of the book.<BR>Size: The book is small enough to travel with. The information in the book is very concise, but very detailed. Make sure to read and re-read every sentence starting with the introduction, as you may miss important points. <P>Hindi is not a difficult language, conjugations are straightforward and unusual verbs are few. After two months of studying for about an hour a day I was able to converse with Indians, albeit in very basic Hindi, but certainly get my meaning across and understand theirs. Most all Indians were very keen on taking the time to listen to me and speak slowly, especially the ones who spoke little English and found it a rare opportunity to communicate with a foreigner. If you're willing to invest your time, this book will indeed teach you Hindi!</span>

                    <span>This "Second Edition" of Teach Yourself Hindi is a real improvement over the previous edition. The lessons have been arranged in a more logical manner and the vocabulary is much more up to date. The dialogs are also more current in subject matter. The Grammar is explained in a more concise manner with better examples than the first edition. The Devanagari script is used throughout the book - with the first five lessons being transliterated completely. Which brings us to the only drawback to the book - the script is not covered in any depth. This can be a problem for some beginners. For a more complete study of the writing system the beginner should try the book "Teach Yourself Hindi Script" by the same author. If you get the book with the tapes it is one of the better Hindi resources that is readily available today.</span>
