                <span id="Label1">Robert B. Parker fans have been quick to embrace each addition to his remarkable canon, from the legendary Spenser series to the novels featuring Jesse Stone and Sunny Randall. And his occasional forays into the past-Gunman's Rhapsody, a fresh take on Wyatt Earp, and Poodle Springs, based on a Raymond Chandler story-have dazzled critics and confirmed his place among the greatest writers of this century. With <i>Double Play</i>, he presents us with a book he was literally born to write. <br><br> It is 1947, the year Jackie Robinson breaks major-league baseball's color barrier by playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers-and changes the world. This is the story of that season, as told through the eyes of a difficult, brooding, and wounded man named Joseph Burke. Burke, a veteran of World War II and a survivor of Guadalcanal, is hired by Brooklyn Dodgers manager Branch Rickey to guard Robinson. While Burke shadows Robinson, a man of tremendous strength and character suddenly thrust into the media spotlight, the bodyguard must also face some hard truths of his own, in a world where the wrong associations can prove fatal. <br><br> A brilliant novel about a very real man, <i>Double Play</i> is a triumph: ingeniously crafted, rich with period detail, and re-sounding with the themes familiar to Parker's readers-honor, duty, responsibility, and redemption.</span>

                    <span>I have enjoyed Robert Parker's books over the years, especially the the Spencer series, and when I bought this book I was expecting more of the same. The book is actually a wonderful story that weaves fact and fiction in a fabulouse way. The basic plot surrounds Jackie Robinson breaking the baseball color barrier in 1947 (fact), and the man who is hired to be his body gaurd (fiction), a WWII surivor carrying some heavy baggage. Paker develops great characters along with his typical witty dialog, and does a great job of taking you back to that time period when the races were stricly divided.</span>

                    <span>Jackie Robinson and Joseph Burke, two men so different and so alike. Robert B. Parker has written a tough novel of baseball, love, murder, rascism, mayhem and family. Into this melee, as a side story, Bobby, a nine year old from Springfield, Ma., tells his story of life with his mom and dad and his love of the Brooklyn Didgers.<P>Joseph Burke awakens in pain at the Chelsea Naval Hospital. He is a Marine survivor of Guadacanal. His recovery is slow and difficult. His wife comes to visit him once, and when it is time for him to be discharged, she is no where to be found. He goes to their apartment in Boston, where a note says she has found someone else and has moved on. He regains his strength slowly, builds up his body and readies to leave the apartment for a new life. His Marine buddy, Angelo finds him a job working as a debt collector- with his big brusier body he has no trouble with this job and and moves on to be a bodyguard for a young woman who doesn't care about much which just about matches his attitude. They fall for each other..but trouble enters with the name of Louis. Burke moves on.<P>It is 1947, Branch Rickey, Brooklyn Dodgers Manager, hires Burke to bodyguard Jackie Robinson. Jackie is breaking the color barrier in baseball and his life is in constant jeopardy. Burke and Robinson form a relationship- Burke keeps Robinson alive and Robinson gives Burke a reason for living. Burke manages to keep Robinson on the straight and narrow and Robinson has a career in baseball that will open the doors for many to follow. Burke finds his love in great trouble and solves the dilemma of time and space. Bobby makes it to Dodger Stadium to see his heroes.<P>Robert B Parker has written an unusual story of characters wound around the periphery of baseball. Not much is written about baseball, but instead about honor, duty, love and redemption. A tough, gritty time in the 1940's when the war is just about over and baseball is just about to begin. prisrob</span>

                    <span>This is Parker on the stretch, away from his favorite characters, away from his Boston setting, plunged into the past. When he's stretched he's at the top of his form and demonstrates his moves on every page.<P>Most of all, the Jackie Robinson story is a story about a time and the first third of the book is background. Parker does the postwar period masterfully and the interspersed personal chapters are a nice, innovative touch. They've drawn some criticism, unwarranted in my opinion.<P>The characters are fresh, the plotting and dialogue as economical as the best Parker, the resolution touching. I read it straight through, disrupting all of my prior plans for the day, and not regretting a moment of it.</span>

                    <span>A couple of the most recent Spenser books were, to me, short of the mark, as if Parker were a bit tired of the character. And his constant repetition of key phrases said by characters in his three series was more than annoying. ("We'd be fools not to" being the worst. There are others. Parker's publishers/editors fall down on their job here.) <P>Double Play was like a breath of fresh air. How a reviewer can simply say Burke is a Spenser clone is quite beyond me. He's a *very* different character, a most interesting and subtley complex one. <P>Robinson is black. Hawk is black. And there any comparison ends. Robinson is a very well developed character, in my estimation, and rings true as the man we came to know in history.<P>Bringing together both the criminal elements and the extreme racism of those times I thought an excellent tool as well as being true to life. Those who weren't alive back then simply don't understand how much a part of daily life these things were, even though submerged in "good company." (Unfortunately, they're both with us still.)<P>I was also impressed by Parker's grasp of the effects of war on the Burke character, how he retreated inward emotionally, the building of his need and desire to expand again as a human being.<P>I'd recommend this one to anyone.</span>

                    <span>Robert Parker's creative, fictionalized approach to the problems Jackie Robinson faced when integrating baseball makes for fascinating reading. But the other half of his double play, the personalized reminisces of "Bobby," alias him, growing up and loving girls and baseball, is basically self-agrandizement; the interesting historical observations -- and there are some --could be told within the story in Parker's as-always brilliant narrative. The Robinson character is not quite fleshed out (although it is in no way Hawk while the hero, Burke, is much like Spenser, Parker's long-running detective). No, the details in the story didn't happen but they might have. And the danger and tension surrounding Robinson were very real.<BR> You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this -- but you will lose little skipping the "Bobby" chapters.</span>
