                <span id="Label1"><div>Golf fiction's most beloved hustler, The Green's Eddie Caminetti, returns from self-imposed exile to turn the PGA Tour and the golf equipment industry on its ear. <br><br>When Eddie's former caddie, "Fat Albert" Auberlain (a cross between Tiger Woods and John Daly), loses his PGA Tour card, his endorsements, and his composure after posting a twelve on a par three at the Fruit-of-the-Loom Waste Management Open, Eddie finds the sad sack on his doorstep. Fat Albert, in debt up to his eyeballs and with several needy relatives to feed, had barely been eking out a living on Tour as it was, and the pressure was threatening to make him implode altogether. Eddie takes pity on his prot&eacute;g&eacute; but isn't quite sure what he can do, when along comes nuclear physicist Norman Standish with the most revolutionary advance in golf equipment since the double niblick-a golf ball they call Scratch. If Standish's claims are true, Eddie could make the killing of his strange and wonderful life and just possibly change the game forever. <br><br>With McAllister's patented golf hustling hijinks, roller-coaster plotting, and laugh-out-loud skewering of pro sports hypocrisy, Eddie's die-hard fans and golf fiction aficionados will laugh all the way to the putting green. As Eddie himself puts it in The Foursome, "Why do you think they call the devil  <i>Scratch</i>?"<br></div></span>

                    <span><P>There are only a few who do golf fiction really well (Jenkins, Reilly, Pressfield) and McAllister has been consistently among that pack. This is a whopping great read and a sure-fire recommendation to even your most finicky friends. All those things that drive the rest of us nuts drive McAllister nuts, too, only he expresses it far better than we ordinary folk ever could. Eddie Caminetti is one of the most memorable characters you're ever likely to meet in a book.</span>

                    <span>I love books that are not only terrific fun to read but also have something meaningful to say. SCRATCH puts me in mind of any number of classic novels that are cautionary tales about how easily manipulated we are. Even while laughing my head off I got uneasy at how marketers and the media conspire to treat us all like sheep...and how it's ultimately our own fault for failing to look critically at what's going on around us.<P>But most important is the "laughing my head off" part. This is a rollicking good story with an incredible, intricate plot and one of the most delightful main characters (Eddie Caminetti) you'll ever meet.</span>

                    <span>This book is laugh out loud funny, and an irreverent look at the big time golf equipment makers. While I still think The Green is the better book because it had more depth, this is great and a must read for any golfer. And, by the way, just who is the Medalist Corporation????</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was wondering what to expect when I ordered this book as I had loved the first book in the Eddie Caminetti series, The Green and been very disappointed by the sequel, The Foursome. Well, the third time was a charm and Scratch comes through on all counts. It is funny, incisive, educational and thoroughly entertaining. The chapters that deal with the trial over the suit by the Medalist Golf Ball Company against Caminetti's golf ball company are as funny as anything I have encountered along those lines since My Cousin Vinny. Their is a lot of common sense wisdom imparted in the book about the gullibility of golfers<BR>who just have to have the latest golf ball or the most advanced club in order to play up to their maximum ability. All I can say about that is read and learn. To tell the whole story line would be to give too much away. Just trust me. It is a hoot!</span>

                    <span>This is a great book that will hold your interest, even if you are not a golf junkie. Many of the characters provide laugh out loud dialogue and are put into situations that are very memorable. <P>This is a book that is long enough to last 2 trans continental flights and good enough to let someone borrow. All of McAlister's books have been great and I can hardly wait for the next Caminetti installment. Enjoy....</span>
