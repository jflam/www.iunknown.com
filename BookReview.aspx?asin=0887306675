                <span id="Label1">Some traders distinguish themselves from the herd. How do these spectacular winners whose success occurs across a spectrum of financial markets do it? What separates them from the others? What can they teach the average trader or investor? In <I>The New Market Wizards,</I> these wildly successful traders--some largely unknown--relate the financial strategies that have rocketed them to success. Asking questions that readers with an interest or involvement in the financial markets would love to pose to the financial superstars, Jack D. Schwager gets these financial wizards to share their insights. Entertaining, informative, and invaluable, <I>The New Market Wizards</I> is destined to become another Schwager classic.</span>

                    <span>Some readers comment that "The new" is not as good as the old. I strongly disagree with that. Schwager had tried to get the rest of the best in the market at the time to be interviewed and written about, like Vic Sperando, Stanley Druckenmiller, Richard Driehaus and some other big names. The problem is: the "stars" in the first book are just too bright, amongst all else, Paul Tudor Jones and Richard Dennis. Perhaps Schwager should have got Soros to meet the market expectation. BTW, two more tips: First, buy and read the Market Wizards before this. Second, dont get too carried away by the rosy pictures posed by these top traders and dont copy a bit from each of them. Know yourself and develop the trading strategy that fits you most unless you want to be those footstool of these wizards.</span>

                    <span>Jack Schwager is a great author. He asks very intelligent questions and seems to have a deep though un-intuitive knowledge of the futures game. (See the CRT interview, overly analytical people mask intuitive traits). The William Eckhardt interview is incredible and should be re-read many times over. This interview alone is well worth the price of the book. I have one major gripe with the author however. Schwager seemed to have had a serious lapse in judgement by including some of the traders that he did. There is no doubt that all the traders interviewed in the book are of high caliber but some definetly cannot be thought of as "Market Wizards". Who am I talking about? Linda Raschke, Tom Basso, Charles Faulkner maybe even Trader Vic. Who is very underrated? Jeff Yass, the man is the best options player around. Druckenmiller, Trout, and Eckhardt are as good as it gets.These legendary names should not be sullied by the inclusion of the above mentioned traders. Schwager left out some amazing traders, what about the people at Kenzie, Niederhoffer ( I know he blew out), Louis Bacon, John Henry, Willem Kookyer and Grenville Craig? Anyone ever heard of Jullian Robertson? Please Jack, if you ever write Market Wizards 3, try to include all or even some of these people. Not traders that you speak with at "Omega" conferences.</span>

                    <span>A great book and one that will teach you more about investing than most of the other so-called investment books that promise much and deliver little.<P>I'm not sure if Michael Lauer has been taken out of the book now. When I read his chapter I remember thinking he seemed a) extremely arrogant and b) extremely talented. Not sure what went wrong - maybe it was when he started trying to become a movie producer.<P>An essential book for any serious investor (or trader).</span>

                    <span>What is this book?<P>Jack D. Schwager interviewed some of the best traders in 1992 and compiled edited transcripts in this compelling book.<P>---------------------------<P>Who is interviewed?<P>From the currency market: Bill Lipschutz .<P>In Futures: Randy McKay, William Eckhardt, The Turtles, Monroe Trout and Al Weiss.<P>Various market times and fund managers: Stanley Druckenmiller, Richard Driehaus, Gil Blake and Victor Sperandeo.<P>Traders who play several markets: Tom Basso and Linda Bradford Raschke<P>"The Money Machines" such as: CRT (Chicago Research and Trading), Mark Ritchie, Joe Ritchie, Blair Hull and Jeff Yass.<P>Psyschology: Zen and the art of trading (person didn't want his name mentioned), Charles Faulkner, Robert Krausz.<P>---------------------------<P>I didn't recognize many of those names, probably because of these reasons:<P> * The book was written in 1992.<BR> * I'm not into really into trading.<P>---------------------------<P>Nevertheless I think the book is a great learning experience. You won't learn how to trade from this book but it gives you insight into the trader's psyche. I like learning about people who have been successful, (think Leader's & Success page, of IBD) since I feel it motivates me to learn more and work harder towards reaching my goals.<P>My favorite chapter in this book is entitled "Closing Bell" and it is a recap of all lots of trading advice mentioned over and over by these trading experts. I feel reviewing this chapter over and over is worth the price of the book.<P>Reed Floren</span>
