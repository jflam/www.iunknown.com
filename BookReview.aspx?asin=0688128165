                    <span>If you are interested in learning what the
tools of persuasion are and how they are 
used, this is an excellent reference and
 a very easy read.
 
 Some examples from the book:
 
 Find out how G. Gordon Liddy sold a $ 250,000
 breakin to his fellow watergate co-conspirators
 (Hint: It's the same technique as for used
 car sales)
 
 Going to the hospital? Find out why you may
 be at risk from and susceptible to authority
 as simply stated as the title, "Doctor".
 
 Why was Jim Jones so successful at Guyana?
 How was he able to single handedly mastermind
 his infamous massacre?
 
 What do weathermen and professional athletes
 have in common?
 
 Educate yourself about the tools of persuasion.
 Learn how to recognize when those tools are
 being used and strategies for avoiding being
 manipulated. Learn how to use these tools to
 your advantage.
 
 To paraphrase, "Manipulation happens". We can
 either accept it and move on, or we can educate
 ourselves, be aware of when and how it happens
 and of what we can do to prevent it or use it
 to our advantage. Robert Cialdini's book is
 an excellent reference towards that end.</span>

                    <span>*Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion* is one of the most useful books I have read in a long time. Its author, Robert Cialdini, a psychology professor at Arizona State University, applies his technical background to the task of explaining in everyday terms a subject that impacts all of us: persuasion, and the psychological principles that make it work. Sales professionals are a natural audience for this book; they will find in it the explicit theory and scientific research behind what they have already been doing for years by instinct and trial-and-error. For the rest of us, this book is a powerful defense against those manipulators who seek to exploit our psychological vulnerabilities to get us to comply with their desires. <P> Cialdini's basic theoretical perspective is that, to deal with a complex world, our brains have automatized responses to various phenomena. In the long-run and in general, these mental mechanisms are practical tools, enabling us to live in society harmoniously and to make decisions quickly and with minimal effort. In specific cases, however, they can misfire, leading to bad decisions. Hence our vulnerability to people who know how these mechanisms work when we do not. <P> After introducing his subject, the author tackles six of these "weapons of influence" in six chapters. He first explains what they are and how they are used, utilizing personal anecdotes, scientific studies and vivid real life examples to make his case. Much of this is fascinating stuff. For example, according to Cialdini, some of the very techniques advertisers and salespeople use today were used during the Korean War to seduce American POWs into collaborating with their Chinese captors. And the Hare Krishna Society, its fundraising efforts in the 1960s frought with public relations problems, owed its dramatic turnaround in the 1970s to the adoption of solicitation tactics based on shrewd psychology. Cialdini then rounds off each chapter by suggesting what we can do to defend ourselves. He is not a behavioral determinist; half of not falling prey to our unconscious responses is simply being aware that they exist and then taking action to circumvent them or to leverage them in our favor. <P> For the record, I must state that this book is not perfect. Cialdini sometimes interprets human psychology in ways that I do not believe are warranted given the studies he cites. But endnotes and an ample bibliography are included for readers who are interested in doing further research. Taken with a grain of salt, I believe *Influence* is a worthy read--whether you are a sales professional, or someone who is unwilling to be an easy mark for one.</span>

                    <span>I used to agree with other people to avoid making waves. Because of this book, I understand why I was compliant and I am more truthful in my responses to others. This book really made me understand why I was persuaded to do things I didn't want to do. A book called Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self also made a huge impact on me. Optimal Thinking helped me to let go of what is out of my control, make the most of what is in my control and get the best results in every situation. So I recommend each of these books. Read them side by side and you will be your best when noone is around and with other people.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up because somebody online recommended it, and the topic interested me. This has been one of the best books I've ever bought. Dr. Cialdini told me things I already knew, just had never put any actual thought into. After having read most of the book I was able to apply the material into my life and I think it helped me from making a bad decision related to my higher education. I highly recommend everyone read this!</span>
