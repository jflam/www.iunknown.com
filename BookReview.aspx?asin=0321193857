                    <span>I'm a self-publisher and create my own marketing materials. After reading Robin William's book, I re-did and entire marketing kit and the transformation was remarkable. 
<br />
<br />Before, for creative design inspiration, I looked at marketing design books that basically showed professional brochures. Williams gives you the tools you need to dissect those professional marketing materials so that you can go and create your own outstanding package. 
<br />
<br />In four simple steps, she explains how to use the elements of design: proximity, alignment, repetition and contrast. Read this book and you will never look at marketing materials the same, ever. Before, I just did "what looked pretty" on paper. Now I create sophisticated prints that deliver a clear message.

                    <span>I must admit, i picked this book up because it was on sale.  The good is that its easy to read and follow from cover to cover.  As an ameteur graphic artist with no formal training, this book was eye-opening.  The concepts are easy to understand and pretty well explained.  This book is not meant to teach graphic design rather basic principles used in design medium.  Overall, an excellent book.  I give it my thumbs up!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I am one of those people that professional graphic designers meet in their nightmares.  Totally clueless when it comes to what constitutes good design, and enrolled in desktop publishing classes which are meant to equip me with some degree of technical ability, but fall short of addressing issues like creativity and design concept.
<br />
<br />I am finding this book helpful so far (it was required reading for one of my classes) and it's given me some very useful insights on how to lay out a page. The finished examples are by no means sophisticated works of art, but my goal is really to be able to master the ability to execute decent-looking newsletters, direct mail pieces and so on... and perhaps be able to run a sideline business once I've developed more expertise (strictly small-potato variety, not Madison avenue).  But I'm not about to unleash my ineptitude on any unsuspecting bosses or clients yet! This book clearly states that it is written more for people like me, who in the course of their jobs need to get up to speed in this area fast! People in a similar situation would probably derive benefits from this book as well, but more advanced students or designers may  be disappointed.
<br />
<br />Since I have no designs on pursuing a formal degree (terrible pun intended) I found a lot of use for this book. I also have a question for the graphic designers who bashed it..what do they recommend for a student who knows vritually nothing about graphic design (besides switching to some other field) as a good primer to help them produce layouts that don't scream "TACKY!"??</span>

                    <span>After graduating from a 4 year university with a degree in Graphic Design, I get really peeved when I see books like this. Graphic design is not something you can teach yourself in a matter of hours; it's a form of art that I've spent years learning (and am still learning more about daily!). 
<br />
<br />I did not read this book. After looking through the pages online, I can tell you that this book is not going to teach you good design. I agree with the comments made about the poor use of type, which I think Williams should be embarrassed by. I am convinced that Williams is a non-designer as well.
<br />
<br />Instead of getting this book, learn about the work of well known graphic designers/ firms: Stoltze Design, Tolleson Design, Martin Venezky/ Appetite Engineers, Ellen Lupton, Pentagram Design are some of my favorites. 
<br />
<br />Also, if you want your work to look really great, I recommend hiring a graphic designer or going back to school. That's the only way you'll really learn!</span>

                    <span>I have been working as a director for some time, so I know how to design the elements of a frame.  I am therefore unbelievably surprised at how much this book taught me about designing the elements on the page.
<br />
<br />This is obviously an introductary book (read the title), but what a value of a book it is.  I've wasted hundreds of dollars on design... yet this book keeps everything so simple that I can actually translate it to use.  Highly recommend.</span>
