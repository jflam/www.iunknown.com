                    <span>Rommel's papers provide his first-hand account of the war, with a focus on defensive preparations for the defense of the coast.  This book is invaluable for military history, WWII and especially for anyone with a particular interest in Rommel.  Although many of his papers were deliberately destroyed in the midst of the July 20th plot, as Rommel was involved in it, his extant papers relay enough information on how he viewed the defense of France in 1944, for which he was responsible. Definitely recommended!</span>

                    <span>This book greatly fueled my interest in the African theatre of World War II.  Well-written and easy to follow, maps are provided when necessary to help the reader fully understand the land and troop movements/concentrations.  The Rommel Papers gave me a greater understanding of not only Rommel the soldier, but also Rommel as a man.  The hardships and difficulties facing Rommel and his troops are thoroughly described in this excellent work.  Also, this book made me better understand why the Allied invasion of France in 1944 was so successful.  
<br />
<br />My only disappointment is that there could have been more.  As with Patton, a longer life would have allowed Rommel to write a greater account.  Nevertheless, the Rommel Papers is well worth your time.  </span>

                    <span>When one tries to appreciate a historical figure for what they really were, there are no replacements for primary resources. However, it is quite helpful to balance the reading with a critical secondary source. As is often the case in our lives, its hard to see the picture when you are in the frame. If one were to accept Rommel's papers as being a true representation of what kind of a field marshal he was, they'd be led into the legend that has exonerated him to be perhaps the greatest German general ever. What is remarkable about reading this book is that when compared to the comments of those that knew him well, like von Rundstedt, we can see both the good and bad that said about him from his own words. Rommel was remarkably honest, and sincere. His greatest fault is that he micromanaged things too much, but he had a remarkable foresight and understanding of circumstances for what they really were. Furthermore, his bravery and appreciation of battle is rivaled by few figures in history that were born to be warriors. Although the book is littered with minute details of specific circumstances that were entered into his diary, to understand Rommel and appreciate a view of Hitler and the German High Command from within, this book is highly recommended. </span>

                    <span>The Rommel Papers is an excellent read.  It gives inside accounts of war.  His letters are amazing.  It touches greatly on the human side of this man.  Character is something this man had plenty of.  Highly recommended!</span>
