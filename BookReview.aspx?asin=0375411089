                <span id="Label1">Charles "Chaz" Perrone fancies himself a take-charge kind of guy. So when this "biologist by default" suspects that his curvaceous wife, Joey, has stumbled onto a profitable pollution scam he's running on behalf of Florida agribusiness mogul Red Hammernut, he sets out right away to solve the problem--by heaving Joey off the deck of a luxury cruise liner and into the Atlantic Ocean, far from Key West. But--whoops!--Joey, a former swimming champ, doesn't drown. Instead, as Carl Hiaasen tells in his 10th adult novel, <I>Skinny Dip</I>, she makes her way back to shore, thanks both to a wayward bale of Jamaican marijuana and lonerish ex-cop Mick Stranahan (<I>Skin Tight</I>, 1989), and then launches a bogus blackmail campaign that's guaranteed to drive her lazy, libidinous hubby into a self-protective frenzy.<p>  You've got to hand it to Hiaasen: He's perfected a formula for crisply written, satirical crime fiction that makes the best use of imaginatively repulsive villains, as well as less thoroughly venal scoundrels and victims who ultimately overcome their antagonists, all while stumping for the preservation of Florida's environment, particularly the Everglades. In <I>Skinny Dip</I>, we find Chaz (who'd rather be golfing than puttering around the "hot, buggy, funky-smelling and treacherous" reaches of nature) falsifying water samples to help Hammernut turn the 'Glades into "God&#146;s septic tank." That scheme, though, is endangered not just by Joey's sudden disappearance, but by the suspicions of a python-loving police detective and Chaz's own outstanding inability to tame his Viagra-enhanced tumescence. Even by assigning Chaz a baby-sitter--the hulking, hirsute, and painkiller-addicted Tool--Hammernut can't keep his pet biologist out of trouble. As Joey and Stranahan unfold their revenge plot, and Tool's conscience grows in competition with Chaz's ego, the reader can only marvel at the extent of the train wreck ahead.<p>  As much fun as Hiaasen has delivering Chaz his climactic comeuppance, what's missing from <I>Skinny Dip</I> is a more complex, more credible development of Mick Stranahan's character and the relationship he builds with the much younger Joey Perrone. Like Erin Grant, from  <I>Strip Tease</I>, Joey has far more going for her than her bra-cup size; but "hero" Stranahan is of far less interest here than any of his fellow players. <I>--J. Kingston Pierce</I></span>

                    <span>The title of this review pretty much states it all. But what a great test for a book! Considering the endless drudgery of an unspectacular civil case, this book was what I looked forward to. I saw Mr. Hiaasen on 60 Minutes and became intrigued enough to check out one of his books (I was familiar with him, having seen his books before). This book was hysterical, the characters brilliantly drawn, and a thoroughly well-conceived plot. This is definitely NOT the last book I will be reading by this author!</span>

                    <span>Skinny Dip captures its audience by paragraph two, when a woman is plunging from a cruise ship into the Atlantic Ocean, thrown by her husband in the middle of their anniversary vacation. "I married an [...]," thinks Joey as she saves herself with perfect dive into the water. This is the kind of beginning that makes it hard to put down a book, and the story just keeps getting better.
<br />
<br />The book tracks Joey's survival and revenge on her murderous and perfectly stupid husband Chaz. And as readers come to expect with Carl Hiaasen's work, there are plenty of quirky characters whose paths criss-cross as the plot unfolds.
<br />
<br />Chaz is a deliciously stupid and scummy villain, and it's extremely satisfying to watch him pay for his deeds, which include covering up pollution damaging the Everglades. His bodyguard, Tool, is pure Hiaasen as he steals roadside crosses from death sites to plant in his garden, steals drugs from patients at senior living facilities, and at the end becomes a hero of sorts.
<br />
<br />Joey would be boring if she went straight to the police to report her miserable spouse. Instead, she teams up with Mick Stranahan on his private island and plots a revenge that drives her husband over the edge.
<br />
<br />Hiaasen takes a certain amount of patience. The reader needs to be willing to accept these extreme characters and the coincidences that draw them all together. But the book is so funny, so wonderfully written, that it's a pleasure to let yourself be sucked into the craziness.</span>

                    <span>I don't know.  Maybe this book wasn't written for people like me because after reading some of the reviews here, and even in speaking with some, everyone seems to speak highly of Carl Hiaasen.  But me, I wish I could have the week's worth of evenings back that I spent reading this book.<p>Simply put, I didn't find the book funny.  For someone who is supposed to be an author who writes with humour, I had a hard time laughing at anything in this book.  And the characters?  It is really heard to believe that anyone in the world is as simple-minded as the characters he writes about.<p>Now I know this is supposed to be fiction.  And I know that because it is fiction, I should give the author a bit of leeway.  But even so.  I've read countless other fictional books and each one of those the author has managed to convey real characters.  So why couldn't Hiaasen manage to do it here?  And this really is too bad too, because the underlying plot (bad guy dumping chemicals into an environmentally sensitive area and trying to cheat the system) is a good one.  I just wish Hiaasen had managed to do more with it.<p>Suffice to say this is my first and last Hiaasen book.</span>

                    <span>I was a little disappointed in this book. It feels like Hiaasen is starting to re-hash old grounds. I have seen these oh so cool characters in previous books and the plot line is becoming old and dated. I mean you can only read the same story so many times before you start wondering if the author is permanently stuck on one track. I think the success that Hiaasen has found at the same time has paralyzed him against taking risks and the story here becomes a parody not of other genre books (such as his earlier titles) but of his own earlier works. 
<br />
<br />It seems like authors who spend a few years in Southern Florida start writing in a similar vein. Back in the 70's Elmore Leonard perfected his slapstick capers while situating several of his stories in this area. I think that Hiaasen owes more to Leonard than anyone else, but he did not out and out copy the older master of this genre. Instead Hiaasen took an ecological slant and a more erudite writing stance that managed to flesh out his characters a little more than Leonard. Several of Hiaasen's earlier works are classics, such as 'Tourist Season,' and 'Stormy Weather.' Lately Lawrence Shames has taken the mantle of Florida's funniest crime writer; though I think he does not rate up there with Hiaasen or Leonard. All three are eerily similar and if you are looking to expand your reading horizon along the lines of Hiaasen, you might want to check out the other two writers.
