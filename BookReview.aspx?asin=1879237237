                    <span>I have read several other books that offered hope but no real help.
<br />This book gave me my life back. It worked for me. I judged this book by its cover and it sat on my shelf for a month while I read other books that did nothing.
<br />I am so glad I bought, and finally read this book.</span>

                    <span>I only have one comment, because everything else has already been said.  Before reading this book, you HAVE to know the difference between shyness and social phobia.  Then, you'll be able to really appreciate this piece of litterature!<p>Thanks</span>

                    <span>This book is amazing.  It truly holds the key to unlocking the door that social phobia bars shut.  It works as a workbook, allowing you to write in your own stress management and anxiety charts, fears, goals, and a step by step guide on how to face those fears, overcome them, and literally better your life.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest phobia's about meeting new people, or even self doubt, low confidence, or even to improve your social skills for everyday life.  Before I was done with half the book, I was already the most optimistic, confident and happy, socially, then i've ever been in all my twenty years. And believe it or not, your social life variably effects all other areas of your life by determining the way you feel about yourself, in turn how you present yourself and how others view you, and setting the standard on your personal happiness.  pick up this book! you wont regret it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is an excellent source of help for anyone suffering from social phobia/social anxiety (sometimes mislabeled as shyness but actually a lot deeper than that).  I found this book very easy to read and follow, unlike some other books I've read that seem to be aimed at therapists or people studying the phobia rather than trying to gain help for it.  <p>This book has step-by-step plans outlined in each chapter that will help you get closer to overcoming your fears and anxiety.  Of course, you have to work at it every day, and this book is very encouraging and supportive.  Things like the authors considering our negative self-talk "maladaptive" (non-productive) as opposed to "irrational" (they don't feel we are irrational by dictionary definition) made me feel a lot better about myself and made me want to stick with it.  I highly recommend this book.</span>
