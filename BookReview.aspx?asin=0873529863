                    <span>After staring at the 5th edition through a 4 year B.A., and continuing to refer to it into my graduate degree, I am SO glad they put out a new edition with an update on citing the internet. Hopefully they will have updated some of the other things that are missing for university students who want to work beyond a basic level research paper. Definitely worth keeping within reach if you have to write any Humanities paper</span>

                    <span>The MLA Handbook is THE handbook used for writing in high school and colleges across the United States.  The APA handbook comes in 2nd place, but it can't stand up to the MLA Handbook. English teachers across the country swear by it, and despite what people might think, English teachers do have a great deal of clout when it comes to writing with the mass populace. There have been a few minor changes that the MLA has made since publishing this edition. Nevertheless, this is the latest edition and until edition 7 comes around, this will be the handbook on writing and researching that tons of students across the country will become familiar.  A good resource.</span>

                    <span>The MLA is the standard for most literary papers. The book itself is well-formatted and easy to read. It is fairly easy to find what you need except when it is not in the book.
<br />
<br />Because of the lapse in time from writing to publication, style requirements change as new forms of information become available. One type of citation I needed was not in the book and I finally had to search for the MLA website. That is the reason I do not give this book 5 stars, they do not list their own website for up-to-date style references. By using the website with the handbook, I find answers to most of my style questions.
<br />
<br />For reference, the website is www.mla.org/ Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Every student needs this, starting in HS, English reports start early in 10th grade, and you need this book, as I'm sure your teacher will tell you many times. However they are correct in that it is the most useful, and yet non-boring nor complicated resource available to writing papers, and college, forget about it, if you don't have this you might as well drop out already. There is no doubt this will impove your score.</span>

                    <span>The MLA Handbook is the perfect companion of any higher education student. My English teacher, Mr. Holt, has recommended this book with pride and I agree with him. Any essay assignment should be double checked using this book. Once you land your hands on this novel, skim through it and post sticky notes on the important pages for a quick check when you need it later.</span>
