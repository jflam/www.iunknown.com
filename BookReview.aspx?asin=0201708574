                    <span>This was a required text for a graduate course in database programming. Let me just tell you it is WAY too generic. Also, its way too big. It tries to cover everything, but does it in such a boring way.<p>In terms of writing style, it seems to me as if the author is trying to pad as many words as possible to each chapter. He always starts and ends with what he is going to discuss or what he has already discussed instead of just either starting or ending. I wanted to tell him, "Don't tell me what you are going to talk about just do it already."<p>I highly disliked the writing style. However, on a few chapters it was just marginal. All in all I can't wait to sell it back at the end of the semester as it was entirely useless to me in almost every conceivable way.<p>In fact, I found Ben Forta's $12 book on sql far better and more useful than this huge worthless paperback.  Throughout the duration of the course, I found myself going to the university library checking out other books in order to find out what I needed rather than this one.<p>Bottomline: I am very upset that my instructor chose this book as it was a total waste of my time and more importantly my money.</span>

                    <span>This is the required textbook for a graduate course I am taking in Information Studies. Having been assured by the professor that one needed no math, science, or computer background to do well, I put aside my reservations. But here we are, one month into the semester, with this book as our only teaching tool, and I am failing the course. (I thus far have a 3.93 average in grad school)<p>The bottom line - this book is NOT a good instructional tool, especially not for beginners.</span>

                    <span>this book is very dry and boring, i believe that anyone can learn anything if its explained correctly.  having been recommended this book by my university i bought it ( i was recommended deitel for java and that proved excellent so i stuck with their recommendation) but when i try to read this book i feel myself; not understanding but falling asleep.  <p>its more like a reference book and the chapters dont seem to be in any order.  i'm annoyed that i have wasted my money on this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is also one of my reference in database systems. Why? Because this book was written in a very informative way, it covers most of modern databases topic, e.g. RDBMS SQL3 ORDBMS OODBMS etc. Also it is easy to understand, lot of examples, etc. It is worth buying this book. I think it is suitable for any beginner or student or experienced guys who need a clearer understandable way.<p>Although this book is not enough, but it is a great starting point.</span>

                    <span>This book opened the doors of relational database management systems to me.  Prior to reading it I had some general experience with MySQL but an incomplete understanding of the subject.  Much to my surprise I found I really liked working with a RDBMS's so I began searching for a book that would give me a solid introdcution to the theory and practice.  I think this book fit the bill.  After reading it I was ready to tackle a data migration project from Unify to Informix.   Now I work as a database programmer.  I have since purchased and read other RDBMS books about Informix (the RDBMS I have worked most with) but I find that I still refer to this text from time to time to clear up some minor points of confusion.  This book will not make you an expert with RDBMS's but it will give you the background necessary to build up your confidence so you can tackle other tasks.  At times the prose can be a bit drawn out but those sections are few and far between.  Be advised though that this book uses conceptual/practical approach to database design.  While it provide some examples using MS Access and Oracle I find the conceptual discussions more interesting and indeed more useful.  With this foundation I was able to begin working with Informix Dynamic Server-an RDBMS that is clearly not the focus of this book.</span>
