                    <span>Details core facilitation tools and techniques. Chapters cover: understanding facilitation; facilitation stages; assessing and understanding participants; creating participation; effective decision making; facilitating conflict; meeting management; process tools for facilitators (e.g., visioning, exit surveys, brainstorming) and process designs. This is a well organized 'soup to nuts' reference including worksheets on CD-ROM that can be customized. Comprehensive, clear, and concise.</span>

                    <span>Companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth: More teams mean more meetings. Management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork, but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long, sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed. With teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world, meeting management, or facilitation, is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions. Author Ingrid Bens' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting. A host of charts, examples and worksheets (not to mention the accompanying CD) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome. We [...] recommend this hands-on how-to guide to anyone motivated to minimize the waste of meeting-creep.<br /></span>

                    <span>I have had the privilege of participating in workshops taught by Ingrid Bens: this is like having her in your own training room!  The information in this book is both relevant and concise.  I use the book to lead my facilitation team through all of their group dynamics training.  The CD-ROM allows me the freedom to customize the worksheets to meet our needs. This is a great book that I highly recommend to all individuals who work in teams, lead meetings, or need assistance in group dynamics</span>

                    <span>As a failitator of a process using storyboards, I am always looking for new twists on facilitation in general. As a compact, to the point resource on facilitation and basic meeting management, I think Ingrid's is at the  top of the list. While, like any such work, you truly gain the value when  you attend a workshop, this book is worth the price in things anyone can  adapt and use in any organization. You can never become "good  enough" at facilitation and I am glad someone referred me to this  book. Two thumbs up......Oh, and one other nice thing. Everything in here  is to-the-point instruction - no big ego trips with the author's name  dropped into war story after war story...</span>
