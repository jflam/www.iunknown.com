                    <span>The book Skeleton Man is definitely a quote on quote spine chiller. If you addventours and mysterious books then pop in the car and go the the library because it is a darn good. I would give this book as many stars as it would offer. It starts out as a creppy and horrifing legend and just keeps getting creeper.When Molly, the main character, gets sort of scared when her parents don't come home from a night out in the town.Then her skinny and boney so-called uncle comes and claimes her.When he feeds her for the first time she gets dizzy and never eats his food again. And she especially gets creeped out when he lockes her in her roomand goes to the shed every night. one night she gets a hammer and knocks down the door then she hides in the bushes next to the shed. When her uncle leaves the shed, she sneaks into the shen and looks around. It is all neat and tidy. But then she sees a trapdoor in the corner and goes over to it. She opens it and what does she see!!!!</span>

                    <span>This book does a number of things very well. The story is tremendously creepy and scary which is something intermediate grade readers always enjoy. Molly is a great character. She is strong and resourceful and ultimately saves herself. She also does something very sensible, intelligent and believable in the context of the story. She TELLS a trusted teacher about her situation and concerns with her "uncle." Even better, the teacher believes her and tries to help. So often as a reader I wonder why a character doesn't just TELL someone they need help. The background of the Native American folktale is terrific. The final scenes are absolutely gripping.</span>

                    <span>Skeleton Man is a very well written book about a young Mohawk girl named Molly whose parents mysteriously disappear. She is left alone to care for herself until a mysterious man claiming to be her uncle arrives to take care of her. Molly knows that the man is not really her uncle, although he convinces social workers with family photos of Molly's parents. These photos appear to be the same photos Molly's parents were carrying when they disappeared. Molly is taken to a spooky old house to live with the uncle who is careful not to reveal his face to Molly, and speaks only to tell her to eat. She is locked in her room each night, and is only allowed to leave to attend school. Molly's only escape from this frightening man is through her dreams where she is befriended by a rabbit who informs Molly her parents are buried but still alive. Is the skeleton man responsible for the disapperance of Molly's parents? Will Molly escape this frightening man, and find her parents? This is an awesome book filled with suspense and impossible to put down until you reach the very last page.</span>
