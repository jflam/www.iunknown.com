                    <span>This book is the best book I've read on SNMP MIBs. The author really knows his stuff. Most books on SNMP don't cover MIBs in enough detail. This book is a must have for any MIB designer. The author covers all the pesky little details that you need to cover.</span>

                    <span>I disagree with most of the reviews on this book. I was tasked with writing a MIB and this book did not do much for me. For instance, the IMPORTS clause, standard in any MIB. The author only gave a brief defenition of what it is, no examples, no explination of WHY one imports something! A MIB you write will not compile or work without a proper IMPORT clause. <P>Reading this book takes great effort. Not an easy reas at all and I have been working with SNMP for 5 years and am a Certified OpenView Consultant, and have been for 3 years. There are part of this book that are helpful, but if you are going to be writing a MIB for the first time do not count on this book to help you get it done. Try Total SNMP, which gived a better breakdown and look at some of the MIBs already out there like the UPS MIB.</span>

                    <span>As co-chair of the IETF's SNMPv3 working group (the group that defines SNMP), I am constantly asked questions about how to implement some detail of a MIB, or to act as the authority in settling a dispute over the way somebody has implemented a MIB, ot to guide the empoyees in my company about organizing our enterprise MIB. This book, more than any other book I own, provides me with solid reference material about MIBs and SMIv2, and it is the first book I use to find the answers I need.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on information provided by the reviews here. To be honest, this book is outdated, confusing, and probably a sales pitch for the so-called SMICng tool the authors had developed. I wish I could return the book and spend the money somewhere else.</span>

                    <span>I have read a pretty good portion of this book, but I just can't continue. <P>My task at work is to learn about SNMP and start monitoring our equipment. This is a simple task that should be fairly straightforward. Unfortunately, I haven't found any two resources that can even agree on the definition of a MIB. Not even this book, one that's dedicated to MIBs, has helped me out. <P>If you're looking for a good beginner's guide, don't waste your money on this book. If you don't know where to begin to compile MIBs, don't buy this book. Unless you deeply understand SNMP and are to the point where you feel you have to write MIBs, don't buy this book. You'll be sadly disappointed.<P>I'm sure this is a wonderful book for the right audience, and I respect the authors for their technical abilities. My problem is not with the book, but with the way the book is marketed within the SNMP community.</span>
