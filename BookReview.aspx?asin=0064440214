                    <span>Author Arnold Lobel does it again in Frog and Toad Together. This book contains two of our family's favorite stories: "A List" and "Cookies." "A List" is the first story. One morning, while still in bed, Toad makes a list of all the things he must do that day. As you read this one, you'll recognize people you know (or have known). "The Garden" is the second story and is quite precious. Toad plants flower seeds and is impatient to see them grow. As usual, he puts himself through much in order to accomplish the inevitable. "The Cookies" is a great story for those of us who are cookie monsters. The two friends try to figure out how NOT to eat the delicious cookies Toad has just baked. Priceless. "Dragons and Giants" is next. This story is about being brave...a real challenge for these two fellows. Last, but not least, is "The Dream." This story is about ego and has an important lesson for all of us about what's important in life.
<br />
<br />Again, the accompanying audio tape for Frog and Toad Together with Arnold Lobel as storyteller is a must. Lobel's dry, monotonic delivery is exactly what is needed to depict the characters, the scene and the humor in these totally delightful tales.

                    <span>Hi,
<br />I use to watch a "Frog and Toad" childrens program on PBS in the 80's.  I'm trying to find the video.  Are these stories based on the PBS series?  Where can I find them?
<br />Thank you,
<br />
<br />Shirley </span>

                    <span>Frog and Toad Together is a funny and imaginative book.  It shows friendship at its best and worst. The book has a meaning but is not just dull in telling it.  The characters are easy to relate to, even though they aren't human.  A book worth reading.</span>
