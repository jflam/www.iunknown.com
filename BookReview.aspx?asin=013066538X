                    <span>If want to learn about shells and you learn by example, like I do, this book is essential.
<br />
<br />The first 6 chapters (nearly 200 pages) goes over the basics of all shells; what they are, what they do, what programs are most used to manipulate data in them. There are whole chapters devoted to grep, sed and awk, and the author doesn't skimp on details. You will be a virtual grep/sed/awk guru by the time you learn everything in these chapters.
<br />
<br />Chapters 7-15 introduce and get you into scripting of each major shell: Bourne shell, C and TC Shells, Korn shell, and Bash (bash is the standard shell in most linux distributions). It then spends a chapter on general debugging shell scripting problems.
<br />
<br />The last chapters touch upon system administrating via the shell (rather than using gui tools). Again taught by example so it's very clear to the reader.
<br />
<br />I learned more about bash (my shell of choice) from this guide than any other that I've read, and not for lack of trying, I've read several bash guides. I was happy to see that examples given were explained line-by-line so you don't lose track of what is happening in each example. I was delighted by the useful appendices covering useful commands and giving side by side shell comparisons.
<br />
<br />This is my favorite shell book to date.</span>

                    <span>(This is a review of the 4th edition)
<br />
<br />As I start playing around more with Linux, I'd like to get into some shell programming.  After reviewing Unix Shells By Example (4th Edition) by Ellie Quigley (Prentice-Hall), I think I've found the book I need to get started.
<br />
<br />Chapter List:  Introduction to UNIX/Linux Shells; Shell Programming QuickStart; Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching; The grep Family; sed, The Streamlined Editor; The awk Utility; The Interactive Bourne Shell; Programming The Bourne Shell; The Interactive C And TC Shells; Programming The C And TC Shells; The Interactive Korn Shell; Programming The Korn Shell; The Interactive Bash Shell; Programming The Bash Shell; Debugging Shell Scripts; The System Administrator And The Shell; Useful UNIX/Linux Utilities For Shell Programmers; Comparison Of The Shells; Index
<br />
<br />I know that there are a number of different shell scripting platforms, but I really don't know enough to understand what is different between them.  In a single book, Quigley covers all the options so I can start to make some decisions about what direction I'd like to go in.  And regardless of whatever choice that might be, she covers all the different platforms in equal depth so I don't have to go out and buy another book to get started.  Each chapter is filled with a number of examples, immediately followed by an explanation of how the example works.  So not only do you have the benefit of reference material on how something like the grep utility works, but you also have the benefit of seeing working examples in order to translate theory into practical knowledge.  Her style of writing is clear and concise, and I really think that with a little time on my part, this book will take me well down the road to where I want to be.
<br />
<br />An excellent choice if you're looking to get into command line scripting of your UNIX or Linux systems...</span>

                    <span>I've been a unix sysadmin for over 5 years and am learning lots from this book. The author has a knack of teaching by providing examples that show exactly how a command / process works without jargon or oversimplification. I'm clearly understanding things (like regular expressions) that I frequently used casually, but didn't know exactly how they worked and why they sometimes didn't.
<br />Highly recommended for a range of experience levels!</span>

                    <span>Unix Shells by Example is my sixth UNIX-based programming book. And certainly the BEST of all. DOS-like Command-line oriented interface has been my favorite over windows for obvious reasons... I have been working with them since the days of Wordperfect5 (wp5) for DOS; ... way before the introduction of Windows 3.1. Since then, I have gone through several batch scripting/programming books. Now transitioning to the world of Linux/Unix, I was disappointed by all the shell programming books that I have used so far before coming across Ellie Quigley?s book. It was so good that 3 of my colleagues ordered a copy each (a new 3rd edition).<p>Pros: Provides a step-by-step on how-to accomplish a real-world task with a sample code. Plus a concise & straight forward narrative/explanation of every line or special character used in the examples. Before reading this book, I have used many Unix symbols without knowing the reasons behind their use or alternate options. Other books have always provided a generalized answer of "it is the standard procedure". Such as "#!/bin/ksh" <br>Also, it provides comparison between various flavors/versions of unix shells. So whether you are cranking out a new shell script or you inherited a some with your legacy system, be it in Csh, Sh, bash, or my favorite 'ksh'; be rest assured that help can be found within the pages of the book.<p>Cons: the author could have provide more than one scenario for each of the examples.</span>

                    <span>I cannot imagine anyone tryng to learn UNIX shell scripting without this book.  I've used this book countless times to teach shell scripting to programmers and neophytes alike.  Plenty of books provide shell script examples, but none give such thorough, line-by-line explanations of what the examples are doing.</span>
