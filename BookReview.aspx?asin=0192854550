                    <span>I studied philosphy as an undergrad, theology as a grad student, dropped out of a Ph.D. program in philosophy to write fiction, and as a result, grew more curious about human beings and why they act the way they do. <P>So I took up the study of psychology. I'd heard a lot about Dr. Freud: about how great he was from some people and what a crackpot he was from others. Still, whatever view you have of him, you must admit (and I mean MUST admit) that the man was a genuis.<P>Dr. Storr's book is a nice intro to Freud; all the bases are covered in this little book. It's written in a simple style and offers clear explanations of Dr. Freud's views of sexuality, dreams, religion, and more. There are plenty of quotes throughout the book and biographical tidbits. I checked this book out at the library but will probably buy it to have on my bookshelf. A very interesting read and a solid foundation for any future reading of Freud.</span>

                    <span>An interesting and informative reader on the works of Sigmund Freud which should assist the lay reader who does not require too much detail. For the professional reader it is a quick and handy guide/refresher on the important things that Freud wrote. Storr's approach is lively and succinct. He helps us to understand Freud and his thinking by example, illustration and critique. He also shows us the progression of Freud's work and the development of psychoanalysis as we know it today. This short introduction is an excellent achievement in condensation of the Standard Editions.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very good general view of freud's ideas, theories, and views. I would recommend it if you are just stating out. It has clear language too. However it is not terribly indepth so be forewarned that it may not meet all needs. It is a good general resource though.</span>
