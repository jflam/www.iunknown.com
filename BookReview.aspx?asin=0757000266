                    <span>As the title of my review suggests, I think this book makes a good introductory text for someone who doesn't have a lot of time to dedicate to studying bushido, someone who is just getting acclimated to the new way of thinking, or someone who is merely curious.  
<br />
<br />The positives:
<br />
<br />-Each quotation is clearly titled and indexed, making it easy to find and reference specific quotes regarding specific topics.
<br />-Some translations have been changed to better accomodate the literal English-speaking reader.
<br />
<br />The negatives:
<br />
<br />-Short.  It is only a small sampling of the wisdom of Hagakure.
<br />-While the modified translations will help English speakers avoid some of the pitfalls associated with reading from a different cultural context, they are also an incomplete and sometimes shallow understanding of the text.
<br />
<br />Again, as an introductory text this one is a good one. For a better, more complete translation of Hagakure, look for the one by William Scott Wilson.  It is one of my favorite texts, though I will admit that when pressed for a quotation on short notice, I will still often turn to the present book because of its reader-friendly indexing.</span>

                    <span>Bushido was interesting to read because it opened insight for me into the relation of the samurai and his feudal Lord. Being Christian, I had an outsider's approach to the text. I noted the author's disdain for the foreign religions invading his country and clouding the minds of the younger warriors from their duty to their Lord. I found interesting his advice on relations with one's superiors such as not being too free with advice early on and sharing with the superior that his opinion of your actions upon learning of them is important to you. The author worked hard to avoid appearing "bright" and hid for one year after receiving a haircut that might make him look too bright. The point the author shows of making the choice between life and death (and choosing death with honor over life with disgrace) before confronting the moment of acting is a notable window into the thoughts of the warrior on a desperate mission. Many times in the history of Japan since the early 1900s (the date this text was first widely available) has this focus, resignation, and fierceness amazed Westerners. 
<br />
<br />As an aside, I was unaware that homosexuality was as widespread and encouraged among the samurai as it was. I Googled this topic and found it compared to ancient Greece in its scope.  One commentator says that it is not possible to understand current Japanese society without understanding the historic reference of male attraction to young boys in samurai culture (see The love of the Samurai: A thousand years of Japanese homosexuality by Watanabe). The wikipedia(dot)org has a good reference on "homosexuality in Japan" and its cultural framework. I doubt many contemporary Japanese wives would like the author's helpful advice for men about maintaining a wife and a male lover on the side.
<br />
<br />Many reviews have told about the process of the transcriptions of the hermit samurai by his friend and then its release. The book has a stream of consciousness feel to it and so the thoughts are rendered in sound bite format. Can this book be a tool to understand modern Japanese business people? If one anticipates that the Japanese pick and choose from among the relevant items it might be. The dedication to the employee to the company has an interesting analog with the samurai and his Lord. However, some of the content slips below the waves of cultural and historical irrelevance.</span>

                    <span>Bushido is the way if the samurai. This book is a great collection of anecdotes, stories and phrases that reflect a way of life, the way of the samurai.
<br />I recommend this book especially to those that are interested in the Japanese culture, the samurai and their philosophy. It is quite a fascinating and informative read.</span>

                    <span>This book was written at the very start of the 19th century, by a samurai in retirement. It gives a unique look back to the late 18th, when Yamamoto was active as a samurai. The view is unique, in part, because Japan was unifying and there was less need for each minor lord to have an armed class. The warrior ethic was changing as war became less common. In part, these notes seem to mourn the passing of the clearest, purest form of that ethic.<p>The warrior ethic only changed, though and still underlies many aspects of modern Japanese thought and policy. The feudal caste system still gives a fair decription of different levels of management. <p>This book is not just about a time and a culture different from that in the modern West. It teaches personal responsibility, a lesson that many too many people still need. In part, this means responsibility to one's self, in maintaining professional skills and personal credibility. It also means responsibility towards one's employer. I do not feel crass in saying that, by accepting the pay that feeds and houses me, I have a duty to return the value given. Self interest, if not personal honor, should encourage me to support my employer well enough to keep supporting me and to support me better in the future.<p>I was also interested to see that a strict code of honor can include a strictly preserved set of personal freedoms. Yamamoto stresses the need to tolerate a few flaws in order to use a person's strengths. He also notes that samurai - or, I think, any professionals - can be effective only when free to make decisions on their own. This is not insubordination, quite the opposite. The skilled employee must be able to make decisions based on that skill. Too tight a managerial rein just strangles the professional's effectiveness.<p>I was surprised (but perhaps should not have been) that this book describes the modern professional so well. Yamamoto's advice is right in line with my own business experience. I think that more of today's skilled workers, and their managers, would be more effective if they applied this book in their lives.<p>It was also surprising, but satisfying, to read Yamamoto's most secret advice: to do what you love most. I certainly see why this maxim must be held back. This advice can only enrich a person who is already so trained that their loves are honorable, loyal, and productive. Keeping with Yamamoto's Zen spirit, though, I would say that such people do not need that inner secret. Today, as then, such people already follow what they love.</span>
