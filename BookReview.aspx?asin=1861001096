                <span id="Label1">Getting started with Visual Basic (VB) is easy, but for serious  enterprise development, you need to master a lot more. <I>Beginning Visual Basic  6 Application Development</I> puts enterprise-level programming into the hands  of intermediate VB users with a capable tour of every facet of multitiered  development. This book is all you need to start using server-side objects and  Web-based interfaces with VB.<p>  What's best here is the comprehensive yet approachable guide to all of the  Microsoft tools, APIs, and standards that are needed for using VB to create  large enterprise-level applications. This means looking at the three tiers for  application partitioning--user, business, and data services--along the lines of  Microsoft's recommended practice. The authors cover all of the steps needed to  design and code applications in today's corporate environments, along with a  solid introduction to UML diagrams. Wherever possible, they make use of tools  (like the VB Class Builder) to speed up development; also, the title is chock  full of actual screen shots to help you along.<p>  These project-design techniques are illustrated through an online banking  application. The authors walk through all of the steps that are required to  build it on all three tiers, starting from the underlying database schema  (created in SQL Server 7, then accessed through stored procedures and ActiveX  Data Objects), plus business objects for simulating basic banking transactions.  (Here, the authors show how to create objects in VB classes by using COM and  Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS)). Despite some high-level material, this text  is anchored in a practical, very hands-on sample application that you can build  and deploy on your own.<p>  Later sections turn to the user interface or presentation layer. First, the  application is built by using a traditional stand-alone client; then, the book  presents a Web-based HTML interface that's generated with Active Server Pages  (ASP pages). A final section even looks at XML for sharing data between  applications.<p>  It's hard enough to use VB with objects for the beginner, and mastering all of  the standards (with such acronyms as UML, COM+, SQL, ADO, MTS, HTML, and ASP) is  even tougher. <I>Beginning Visual Basic 6 Application Development</I> covers all  of the necessary terrain and gives intermediate developers what they need to  tackle serious enterprise projects by using VB. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to enterprise applications: scalability,  reliability, and high availability; basics of Microsoft Distributed interNet  Architecture (DNA), tour of Microsoft tools and standards (MTS, IIS, ASP, COM,  MSMQ, UDA, SQL Server, and COM+), case study for an online banking application,  comparison of software development methodologies (the traditional "waterfall"  approach, the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF), and the Rational Unified  Process), object-oriented design tutorial, Visual Basic (VB) classes and the  Class Builder tool, COM, ActiveX and DCOM basics, Microsoft Transaction Server  (MTS), adding transaction support to VB components, deploying VB objects,  Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, logical and physical database design,  tutorial for SQL and stored procedures, querying and updating databases by using  ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), building the data- and business-services tiers, GUI  design, creating VB forms for users and administrators; testing, deployment, and  maintenance; HTML and ASP tutorial, and XML used with VB.</span>

                    <span>The first third of the book deals with subjects covered in other WROX publications. The treatment here is cursory, but enough to be usefull. However, once the code is covered things get messy. Properties are all named with Get (not good practice) and several properties should be coded as methods, for which the authors seem to have little use. ADO should get more attention, but the authors just go ahead and hard code database connections. The same parameters are sometimes treated as variants, then strings or integers. The stored procedures for the T-SQL database were all named with an sp_ prefix (which is a no-no), and so on... On the whole it's a usefull book, once you clean up the authors' mess.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, this is how every book that attempts to teach computer programming should be written. Most books on programming tend to teach bits and pieces that leave the reader hanging in mid-air. You learn the "alphabets" and the "parts of speech" of a programming language, but you are not taught how to put it all together into a beautiful prose, right? <br>Not this book. "Beginning VB 6 AppDev" takes you, as it were, by the hands, and leads you through the tunnels, the caverns and other subtleties of application development. What you have at the end is a superb application, and a well enlightened reader. It is very rare to find a book this good: a single book that covers virtually everything needed to develop a fully, functional scalable application. Yes, it covers the whole development life cycle of a multitiered application. <br>The authors did a very good job. I gave it five stars because it is worth five stars. If you are not convinved, get a copy, and study it.</span>

                    <span>I'm a huge fan of the book that WROX has put out over the years (the 2 Beginning VB 6 books are phenominal).  They've taught me virtually everything I know about programming.  However, I must say that this book falls far short of my expectations for this publisher.  It started out great; the examples of using RUP and UML were very helpful.  I also learned a lot about MTS, XML, etc. that I did not know before.  However, when it got to to actually writing the application, I had to take charge.  Repetitive logic, misaligned object architechture, and not enough descriptions made me so frustrated that I only finished the book so I could rewrite the application more efficiently.  Now, I'm a far cry from a professional programmer, so maybe I'm not seeing the whole picture.  But, when I read a book to lean a new technology or method, I don't expect to be saying things like "Why did they do it this way?" or "It'd be much more clear if they did it this way."  These, among other things, were said while reading every page in the sections dealing with writing the app.  All in all it was very disappointing, but I won't hold it against these guys; they're still my favorite.</span>

                    <span>Before buying this book I was curious how the enterprise level VB developement has been done. Though I am a developer, I did not have enterprise level experience. I was searching for a book which gives a real world development. It's a great book !!. It jumps into the subject with real world example, Banking Application. This is the pattern required by the people who're waiting for a enterprise level experience. I can recommend it without haveing any doubt. Go ahead and buy it, you never regret it. my congratulations to all authors to this book. <p>Thusith Kathaluwage AACS,MCSE,NCC</span>

                    <span>The target audience for this book is someone with some VB/VBA/VBScript experience who is looking to expand into serious VB development, and has possihly been put off by more advanced and detail oriented books. The writing style is casual but not cute. Concepts are presented first from a big picture view followed by more detailed explanations and code. A single main project is woven through the book with numerous additional short examples for introduction of new topics. Examples are kept to just the point being explained and contain numerous screen shots. The introduction to COM is outstanding and of correct depth for the intended audience. Although there were 3 principal writers, the book speaks with one voice and one writing style. It is, I believe, an outstanding choice to follow completion of a book like Peter Wright's Beginning Visual Basic 6.<p>Bruce Kirkpatrick MCDBA, MCSD, MCSE+I, MCT, i-Net+, Network+, A+</span>
