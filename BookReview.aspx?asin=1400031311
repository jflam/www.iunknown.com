                <span id="Label1">Since its establishment in 1919, the O. Henry Prize stories collection has offered an exciting selection of the best stories published in hundreds of literary magazines every year.   Such classic works of American literature as Ernest Hemingway&#8217;s <i>The Killers </i>(1927); William Faulkner&#8217;s <i>Barn Burning </i>(1939);  Carson McCuller&#8217;s <i>A Tree. A Rock. A Cloud </i>(1943); Shirley Jackson&#8217;s <i>The Lottery</i> (1949); J.D. Salinger&#8217;s <i>For Esme with Love and Squalor </i>(1963); John Cheever&#8217;s <i>The Country Husband</i> (1956) ; and Flannery O&#8217;Conner&#8217;s <i>Everything that Rises Must Converge</i> (1963) all were O. Henry Prize stories.   <br><br>An accomplished new series editor--novelist and short story writer Laura Furman--has read more than a thousand stories to identify the 20 winners, each one a pleasure to read today, each one a potential classic.  <b>The  O. Henry Prize Stories 2003</b> also contains brief essays from each of the three distinguished judges on their favorite story, and comments from the prize-winning writers on what inspired their stories. There is nothing like the ever rich, surprising, and original O. Henry collection for enjoying the contemporary short story.<br><br><i>The Thing in the Forest</i>    A. S.

                    <span>Certain things are in-built with literary competitions as the O. Henry awards, as with their reception. Since the O. Henry Prize anthologies, like the Best American Stories, aren't available in England I can't make any comments about whether this year's editor is any better or any worse than the editor of a previous year's anthology. I can make a few comments, though, and it's as well to start that I could name a few worthier stories that aren't included here (by George Saunders, by Tobias Wolff, to name only two) to supplant two or three that are.<P>I'm glad to see that the New Yorker fiction isn't as dominant as I'd imagined it would be. Granted, the New Yorker prints more fiction annually, and publishes the 'big names', but that's hardly to imply great, even wonderful, short fiction isn't being written and published elsewhere. I'm somewhat disappointed, even angered, to see that this is William Trevor's first O. Henry Prize-Winner. Besides being a writer to whom many short story writers owe their craft, he has been quietly writing some of the world's best short fiction before a number of the present contributors even entered their adolescence. As of the late V.S. Pritchett, who was never awarded one. Despite (because of?) being acknowledged as the 20th century's greatest writer of short stories. Though nominally open to short story writers all over the world who have their work accepted in U.S. publications, it's far from unfair to point to the O. Henry award's bias towards American stories in this volume (though I dislike A.S. Byatt's story, as I dislike her ill-advised recent publication 'Raw Material' in the Atlantic Monthly).<P>My favourites - I do not mistake them for the 'best' - include William Trevor's 'Sacred Statues' (though his story 'Justina's Priest', which appears in his new collection, A Bit on the Side, is better, at least to my mind), as well as the stories by TC Boyle, Alice Munro and Evan S. Connell. I have much back-tracking to do, in regards to this series.</span>

                    <span>I agree with another reviewer--this collection is like a box of chocolates--you never know what you're going to get. With all short story collections, not everyone is going to like everything in the group, but I did find that for the most part I was pleasantly surprised. By far, the best was "The Shell Collector." This story's form and pacing was reminiscent of other great short stories out there (think McCrae's stories in "The Bark of the Dogwood.") Others worth mentioning are "What Went Wrong"--Tim O'Brien; "The American Embassy"--Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; and "Kissing"--William Kittredge. While this may not be a vintage year for the O. Henry, it certainly is still worth looking into!<P>Also recommended: McCrae's "Bark of the Dogwood"</span>

                    <span>Prize Stories now has a new editor. I never thought I'd miss the old editors, but I do. This year's collection has reached a new low. There are almost no stories within this volume worth reading. Anthony Doerr's "The Shell Collector" is a phenomenal story. The other stories worth reading are by: Robyn Joy Leff, Marjorie Kemper, Tom Johnston, Tim O'Brien, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Other than that, I'd just skip this edition all together.</span>

                    <span>I don't think you can go wrong reading either the O. Henry or the Best American short story anthologies; I read both each year. It's somewhat surprising that they are not more popular, since they expose the reader to a wide variety of the best writers and writings, and since short stories can be easily fit into the busiest of lifestyles, especially plane and train rides.<P>Each anthology attempts to identify the best 20 short stories of the year, but together they prove just how subjective this quest ends up being. This year, 2003, there is only one story that appears in both volumes, Anthony Doerr's "The Shell Collector". Thus, the views and biases of the editors end up determining the final selection - and in fact, this is one of the selling points of the Best American series, which features a different guest editor (a well-known author) each year. The O. Henry volume can rightfully claim to have a more consistent selection process, which produces more uniformity year to year.<P>2003 is the first year that Laura Furman (an author and professor at the UT at Austin - where does she find the time to read all these stories?) is editing the O. Henry series. What are her biases? She is kind enough to state them: she favors stories whose emotional impact is "revealed ... by stress or loss, the twin capitals of the short story's dominion. The peace of daily life, even the dullness of it, is what is decimated in the short story and replaced by the nightmares or sometimes the consolation of understanding another's existence or our own." With this as a prelude, don't expect any light-hearted love stories or comedies of manners.<P>Each of the twenty selections concerns itself with dark subject matter (death in many forms, alcoholism, doomed love affairs, to name a few), yet I did not find the overall effect to be depressing. Rather, I think Furman has succeeded in her mission - these stories do teach the reader about humanity and what it means to be human. My favorite was the aforementioned "The Shell Collector," which is a classically structured short story with easily deciphered symbolism and meaning. Denis Johnson's "Train Dreams," which two of the three prize jurists picked as their favorite (Furman did not want to cite any one story of the 20 as being the overall best), is a fantastic portrait of how the pioneer lifestyle has been affected by modern day inventions and society. I felt these two stories stood above the rest, but I also enjoyed "The American Embassy" (which reminds us how America is viewed by people in many oppressed nations), "Lush", and "Bleed Blue in Indonesia".<P>Everyone who reads this collection will have his/her own favorites. As the editors of the O. Henry and Best American short story series prove, it is impossible not to bring one's own biases to the subjective process of reading and experiencing a story. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>I have to admit that I was apprehensive to read THE O.HENRY PRIZE STORIES 2003 because I was disappointed with the quality of short stories in last year's volume. But looking back I am now very glad that I took the chance and purchased the 2003 volume. I'm not certain whether the drastic improvement can be attributed to the resignation of the former editor Larry Dark or simply a better publication year for short stories. Regardless, the 2003 volume of O.Henry stories is definitely worth reading. I took my time reading each story and was always pleasantly surprised when each story's quality did not falter. There are a wide variety of stories included. Some of my favorites include Adam Desnoyer's Bleed Blue in Indonesia, TC Boyle's Swept Away, Evan Connell's Election Eve, Tim Johnston's Irish Girl, and William Trevor's Sacred Statues. Some of the authors are well known (such as TC Boyle, AS Bryant, Alice Munro, etc.) while others are less. However, the variety of authors always proves to be a hidden gem in short story anthologies as it proves a great avenue in discovering new and more obscure writers. Any fan of the short story would enjoy reading this book.</span>
