                    <span>I was well into the book still wanting to say: "No tell me about the BIG impact trick."  Then I realized the book was full of technique and ideas from every possible angle.  Scientific, artistic, graphics, lists, logic, emotion and even down to: "It's something like this."  I would be amazed if there was an angle about impact that is not in this book.  The book is easy to read but I will be reading it again and again.  Sometimes the smallest insight opens the biggest doors.  My only complaints would be that sometimes the word selection is weak or wrong and some poor sentences slipped through the process or were wrongly slipped in by an editor at the last minute.  Sometimes the author is high handed with branding some techniques as losers. You will know where she stands when you read this book. I am very happy I found and read this book so early in my quest to find expert help on public speaking.</span>
