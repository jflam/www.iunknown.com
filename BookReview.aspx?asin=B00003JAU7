                <span id="Label1">With its responsive user interface and improved reliability, Windows 2000 Professional is truly the most appealing version yet of Microsoft's operating system. Provided you have the hardware to run it (at least 64 MB of RAM is required), you won't find a better, more serious OS for business computing.<P>  If you are upgrading from previous editions, the Windows 2000 wizards are particularly useful; they'll detect all your software and possible compatibility problems before you make the switch. In testing, our upgrade for a laptop was smooth and sure, and all previously installed software was automatically brought onboard to the new version.<P>  Previously, Microsoft offered only limited support for notebook users within Windows NT 4.0. Windows 2000, however, allows most recent laptops to take advantage of power-management features, plug-and-play standard, plus recent hardware advances, such as the Universal Serial Bus (USB), IrDA for infrared devices, and FireWire. All these improvements mean that Windows 2000 will run on a greater array of systems.<P>  There are some unexpected additions, too. You can also "hibernate" your Windows 2000 notebook to save and restore your work quickly as you go out on the road. In addition, this new OS adds more support for working offline with data saved from the Internet. (The Windows 2000 version of Internet Explorer 5.0 and Active Desktop, which allows you to access Web content from the desktop, are bundled here too.)<P>  Besides support for mobile users, Windows 2000 beefs up reliability and greatly reduces the need to reboot as you update drivers, settings, and the like. Although you can still expect your Linux friends to brag that their favorite OS is even more reliable, the ease of configuration in Windows 2000 and its new-and-improved reliability make for an excellent choice for any serious computer user. Of course, if your business is using Windows 2000 Server on the back end, you will also benefit from easier installation and configuring of software, since these tasks can now be automated by remote administrators.<P>  In all, Windows 2000 is a great-looking operating system, with a slick visual style, a responsive user interface, and plenty of power beneath the hood. For desktop and mobile users, it's a state-of-the-art choice for running today's Windows applications and for getting to the Internet. --<i>Richard Dragan</i></span>

                    <span>Let me tell you Microsoft has done something right finally. Windows 2000 has the stability of NT and the compatability of 98(well almost). I have it running for a week(I had advanced copy) so far and there hasn't been a crash nor a blue screen of death like in Windows 98 SE. The basic requirement I think is a lot of ram, 64+ is fine but I think 128 is good and 256 the optimal. Windows 2000 Professional is easy to use, it looks just like Windows 98 except underneath all of it, it's the NT kernel, which means stability. Windows 2000 has gotten rid of DOS(almost) there is very little dos support and you may not be able to play certain legacy games. The good thing is that companies are writing drivers so that there is a lot of compatability with new things. Basically everything you have in Win98 can probably run in Win2000. There is a program you can download at Microsoft.com to check if there are any compatability issues. The fact that Microsoft must first approve software drivers before it is made available to the public is another boon. I hope this has helped you! Windows 2000 is really great compared to Win98 or 95!</span>

                    <span>I have been using Windows 2000 at work for about 8 months now and warn anyone installing it on their desktop PC. This is an excellant Server solution (although there are still bugs) but I have the following points for antone thinking it will solve their problems for NT4/98 desktop users.<P>1) It hogs more resources. Even on a P450 my P200 with 95 runs faster! Its the great debate - Upgrade your hardware to make the sofwater quicker and the newer software runs slower! You need AT LEAST 64 meg RAM. I have 128 and it still runs low on virtual memory every now and again.<P>2) There are compatablilty problems with other software. Teamlinks 4 has problems with notification, Lotus Notes and parts of IE5 go wrong too.<P>3) Lack of game support, Direct X dosen't work properly, yet. Version 6 and 7 wont install.<P>4)It still crashes as often as my machine used to. Infact probably a bit more. <P>5) It takes longer to boot and shut down<P>6)Oh yes one ther thing - my install takes up 800Meg<P>True it has got more user friendly but you will have to upgrade your hardware. Dont even try running it on less than a PII with 128RAM. And if you want to play Half Life - forget it!<P>Home users stick with 98 if you have experience and Work users, its not worth the hassle upgrading from NT4.<P>WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT RELEASE WHEN HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE BUGS ARE IRONED OUT!</span>

                    <span>Okay, I'll share my recent experience with Windows 2000. This weekend I reformatted my hard drive at home, created two partitions, and installed Windows 98 on one and Windows 2000 Professional on the other.<P>I have yet to get Windows 98 to be able to see my brand-name, recently purchased 56K modem, but Windows 2000 saw it with no intervention on my part whatsoever. I had the same experience with my sound card (cheap, on the motherboard). The Win2K install was very smooth, including the formatting of my second partition to NTFS. The product is friendlier than Windows NT 4 was; it even allowed me to choose to "assume" a "default" login each time so I don't actually have to log into my machine (I'm running standalone, not on a network). I had no technical problems during the install whatsoever.<P>Here's the weird part. I thought I'd be clever and use a 30-day AOL trial as my ISP. However, I eventually learned that AOL isn't supported yet on Windows 2000, and here's the problem: the client software works, you can even connect and browse AOL, but you can't see anything on the web at all. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the version of IE5 that's built into Windows 2000. AOL acknowledges this on their web site and states that a special version of the client will be available this spring.<P>I did try to install some of the game software that didn't work under NT before just to see if it would work now (Civilization II, etc.), and it still doesn't work under Windows 2000, unfortunately. (I'm glad I have that Win98 partition!)<P>Make sure you check the documentation for the various components in your system--I hadn't realized before I made the conversion that my HP CD-Writer wasn't supported under NT, period.<P>So far, however, I'm really glad I installed Windows 2000; it's already VERY clear that it's more stable than Windows 98 and it's nice to have the NT Task Manager (with performance metrics and the whole works) available. There were some Visual Basic projects I literally couldn't even work on with Win98 because of memory management issues; the IDE would freeze and I'd have to kill the process. The same thing works as smooth as butter under Win2K.<P>Overall, it was certainly a more friendly install process than had I brought an NT 4 CD home. I recommend this product to computer-savvy users--especially software developers and power users--who want something more reliable on their home computer than the consumer versions of Windows.</span>

                    <span>This is a great operating system. I've never had a problem with it. My computer's at 1.3 gig, but it seems like 3. Games run smoothly, extremly fast word processor, can it get better? Internet runs quickly (probably because I have a Cable Modem), if you just want to open a file on the internet, you can do that. If you compare it to Mac OS 9, it beats it in every possible way. Trust me, this is the best OS you will use for a while. 2000 is better than XP.</span>

                    <span>The year is nearly 2004 and I am still using Windows 2000. I used to be an NT 4 user but 2000 has to be the most solid Windows OS I have had the experience of using. Most software packages will still run under 2000 and so will new ones, even most games.<P>Windows 2000 is very secure and I use it mostly for hardcore multimedia work. I can count the amount of crashes I have had within almost 4 years using this OS on 1 hand! For the type of work that I do (Video, web, 3D) I need an OS that is going to be put through some intensive processes. 2000 did it for me.<P>Going with 2000 may not be the best choice for everybody, and XP is probably much better for the domestic home computer user, but if you want a solid system then look no further than 2000. It will not let you down.</span>
