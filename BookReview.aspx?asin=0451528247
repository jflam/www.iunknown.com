                    <span>You are a jackass.  No one "sold us to the US".  We were STOLEN and taken back.  Who is to say what changes there would have been if we had not been.  Africa might be a better place today.  <br>I say BE THANKFUL for what you have, but don't be a self-righteous a$$hole about it. <p>Expand your mind and buy this book!</span>

                    <span>You speak of enslavement in the US--who sold you to the US???Never is THIS mentioned.  In Africa today, people are dying in the thousands of AIDS.  Could the African Americans of today not thank our forefathers for coming over and sacrificing for our legacy??  What are you thinking??  We have it made now,  we are not in Africa with disease, pestilence, violence, and an anscetory that sold us to the US.  Go ahead with your pitifullness--I am grateful that our own people sold us out.  We are now successful, healthy, and for me--I am thankful to be here.  Sometimes, things happen for a reason, no matter how bad things might be.  Give thanks to your grand-parents, great grand parents and to the US for making your life so much better.  Above all-----------THINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AND don't lick wounds--they are long gone.</span>

                    <span>The practice of enslavement in the Americas is a phenomenon of staggering proportions. It is also one of the most thoroughly documented systems of human rights abuse in history. "The Classic Slave Narratives" brings together four powerful testaments of individuals who survived enslavement in the Americas. The book also contains an insightful introduction by scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr.<p>As Gates notes in the introduction, it has been estimated that more than 6,000 ex-slaves left some form of written testament between 1703 and 1944--an amazing body of literature. "The Classic Slave Narratives" is thus just a tiny part of a vast genre. Specifically, this anthology contains "the Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano," "The History of Mary Prince," "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass," and Harriet Jacobs' "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl."<p>Each of the four powerful texts offers an effective complement to the others in the collection. In other words, each narrative illuminates at least one unique and important aspect of the American slave experience. Olaudah Equiano, for example, tells what it was like for a native African to be enslaved and transported across the Atlantic in a slave ship. Prince illuminates the life of a slave woman on the Caribbean islands. Douglass, born to a slave mother and a white father, describes in detail his quest for literacy. And Jacobs offers an incisive window into the sexual pathology of the slaveowning society.<p>These four texts are both valuable historical documents and fascinating works of literature. Much American literature--autobiography, poetry, novels, essays, and other genres--demonstrates the influence of, or parallels to, these pivotal texts. "The Classic Slave Narratives" is a necessary text for those interested in United States and Caribbean history, in American literature, in literacy, or in human rights.</span>

                    <span>These are stories of courage against great odds, first-hand accounts of an incredible institutionalized holocaust that was standard operating procedure in this country for hundreds of years. Some of these writings  were best sellers of their time, but today they are too much an ill-kept  secret. Yet I bet the average person living in the U.S. today only knows  the name of one of the authors of these narratives.  Read a first-hand  account of the middle passage. Learn about the woman who spent almost a  decade in a crawl space to escape the life of a slave. Find out the story  of a man who risked life and limb to give public lectures against slavery,  while he himself was still not legally free. You will never know what has  been hidden from you, you owe it to yourself, your mother, and your child  to read these stories told by Black people who lived through, and fought  against, slavery. I also highly recommend Beloved, both the movie and the  book, as well as the recent PBS series on slavery.</span>
