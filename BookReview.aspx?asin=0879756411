                    <span>Or Pound as the case may be.  Humanist or non-religious ceremonies don't seem to be as popular in the US as they are in GB, so it probably shouldn't have surprised me that this booklet is centered around ceremonial practices in England rather than a focusing on a universal approach to the subject.  I found the examples of ceremonies kind of flat, lacking compassion, and not terribly creative, but everyone has their own style.  Having said that, it was a start, and I'm glad to see someone out there is trying to add to the knowledge base of non-religious ceremonies.  If the price were significantly lower, I would recommend this work as a good place to get some direction, but don't get your hopes up.</span>

                    <span>The main purpose of this booklet is twofold: to help Humanists who are thinking of becoming officiants on a regular   basis; and to help families and friends who are faced with the need to organise a ceremony themselves  at short notice.   A third group who may find parts of it useful are  funeral directors coping with funerals where there is no officiant and    the family has no wish to play an active role. The booklet aims to set out  clearly the basic format of a Humanist   ceremony, to suggest possible  readings and turns of phrase, and to state simply the various practical  measures that   need to be taken. In short, it is a straightforward working  manual. After the event . . . . "(It was) the first funeral I had    attended where I felt comfortable, and comforted by the words spoken."  " . . . it gave me a sense of great peace." "To   hear  others publicly proclaim their love, respect and admiration for my husband  made the funeral an uplifting   experience. Afterwards so many who had  attended told me that it was the most interesting, most moving, most    relevant and best funeral that they had ever been to. Their remarks gave me  a great deal of comfort and I knew that I   had treated my husband's  atheism with the respect and dignity that it deserved." "A large  number of those present,   from a wide range of beliefs and backgrounds,  later expressed what we can only call enthusiasm for an experience that    was new to them, and in many cases compared very favourable with the often  awkward and impersonal alternatives   with which they were familiar."  "Bearing in mind that this is a form of ceremony which has not yet  gained wide   acceptance, we consider ourselves fortunate . . . to have  received such expert and personal attention."</span>
