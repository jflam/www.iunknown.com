                    <span>If you are leading a fast growing company you have to read this book. It is the first book I've found that clearly lays out the role of the CEO of a growing company. Your role changes as your company grows. This book helps you recognize when it is time to change and helps you understand what is required of you as a leader of a growing company. <P>Many people would say that entrepreneurs are great at starting companies but there is a time when they have to step aside and let people who know how to run companies take over. Yet some of the greatest companies of our time have had their founders as leaders well past the start up phase. Wal-Mart, Fedex, Microsoft, HP, Siebel, Dell, Disney, Starbucks, Motorola, Sony - just some of the companies where the founders were able to transition from Entrepreneur to CEO. Leading at the Speed of Growth may help you create the next great company. It will certainly help you understand the transitions that a company and its leader goes through as it grows.</span>

                    <span>Entrepreneurs who hope to build lasting businesses should read this book and then keep it within easy reach at all times. The invaluable lessons that the authors provide about how to grow into the role of CEO will save many people from driving their businesses into the ground or being cast aside by their investors because they don't know how to change the way they lead as the company moves from one growth stage to the next. I plan to make this book my standard Christmas gift to clients who need the wisdom contained in its pages.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very insightful and refreshing. I have been reading about 2-3 books on leadership/marketing/business for the past 3 months as I have considered going the entrepreneurial route. If you are an entrepreneur or thinking about becoming one I highly recommend you read this book. Why? <P>This book clearly illustrates to the entrepreneur the different skill sets he/she will have to adopt over the long-term if your company is on a high-growth trajectory. Have you ever noticed that most CEOs aren't the person that founded the company? I have seen many founders resign, step aside to bring in more seasoned managers, etc. The United States is such a successful country because of our capital formation and entrepreneurial spirit. Entrepreneurs create a huge number of jobs as capital and people are always seeking out companies they believe can change the way a certain business is done. <P>Lets say you have money, you have growth, and you have employees. What do you do to manage these different constituencies and grow the company so you will still be around to see the company prosper? This book clearly provides the roadmap (almost like a blueprint for the fast-growing CEO to adhere to.)</span>

                    <span>Commentary, August, 2001. This is an important book for several audiences. First, it should help entrepreneurs understand the skills and experience that are required to move from start up, or as the authors put it, from "initial growth," through "rapid growth," and finally into "continuous growth" phases. Thoughtful entrepreneurs will ask of themselves: "Do I have those shills - if not, what must I do to gain them? And, do I have what it takes to do so?" If they are truly honest with themselves, a good number will realize that it will take different individuals with different skills and experience to lead their creation through these phases, and act accordingly. <P>The second group range from board directors, especially if venture capitalists are among them, and trusted personal advisors, especially if the entrepreneur does not have a true board comprised of some seasoned executives or consultants with requisite experience. These are the individuals who are in the best position to make these kind of judgments.<P>Many years ago, I was in the office of the head of one of the more successful venture capital firms in Boston...let's call him Mr. D. The purpose of our meeting was to discuss a possible collaboration with one of his ventures. As the discussion unfolded, it was clear that his attention was elsewhere, so I asked him if this was the case. He seemed relieved, and emotionally stated that he had just concluded a phone conversation with the outside directors of a promising venture in which he was the lead investor. The venture, with annual revenues over $20 million, was pioneering a new, important technological field. The outside directors were aware of the leadership problems, and were not surprised that Mr. D. was recommending the removal of the founder and his replacement an individual Mr. D. believed had the skills, experience, and desire to lead the company well into the rapid growth phase profitably. This was in spite of Mr. D's several frank one-on-one discussions with the firm's founder that revolved around his bringing in a new CEO, thereby permitting the founder to concentrate on the R&D efforts that were so essential for success. The founder refused to relinquish total control of his baby.<P>The founder's loss represented a serious setback for the investors, but one if not taken put the venture at extreme risk. It took several years before the company got back on its rapid growth phase while retaining its leadership position in its markets.<P>Would the entrepreneur have acted differently if he had read Catlin & Matthews' book with its real life examples? I can't tell, but he might have accepted his new role...after all, it would have been in his own self-interest - he owned about 30% of the stock.<P>Another example. I was on the board of a company facing the same kind of problem. The company had grown from $800,000 in revenues to somewhat over $5 million in 15 months. The CEO confided in me that the joy of building his creation was being displaced by too many operating details. First he brought in a solid COO, but soon thereafter asked us the board to find his replacement. He gave us enough time to do this as we worked out ways we could collaborate with him in the near future.<P>Similar stories repeated time and time again. Catlin & Matthews offer constructive advise to help entrepreneurs make it through their growth phases - or to counsel them to face reality. Bravo, Katherine and Jana; may your book gain widespread use.<P>Catlin & Matthews at least spell out for entrepreneurs the nature of the game they are in. To ignore their advice seems, to me, to be foolhardy.</span>
