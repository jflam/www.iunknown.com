                    <span>I have been a Packers fan all my life but I have never bought a Packer book. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It talks about Favre's best games when he played the raiders and when his dad died. It had stories on his comebacks, toughness, and childhood. Brett Favre and Bonita Favre did a great job writing this book. I believe the best part was when Terry Bradshaw had a little story and mentioned the first game against the Bengals. I didn't know much about it and his explanation tells a lot about the situation. I would rate this book at about a 100 because it is one of the best books I have ever read. I believe any one should read this to learn, to learn about a star, Brett Favre. I really liked this book because it is out of this world!!!</span>

                    <span>First of all let me begin by saying, I am a Brett Favre fan.  That said, this book makes him out to be a little larger than life (which he may be?).  I appreciated his insight into his own game, the words of his family and the words of others closely involved in the game of football.  The pieces on his father were touching.  There were parts of the book that were quite insipirational.  That said, many times the book seemed to go a little too far.  When I read a biography / autobiography I am reading it to gain an appreciation of the individual.  I want to hear them say "I regretted that" or "I could have done that better".  Give me the complete picture!  I just don't feel like I get that from the book FAVRE.  That said, I enjoyed it and will keep it on the shelf as I anticipate it will become a collectors item.</span>

                    <span>This book and DVD combo is the ultimate Brett Favre football career highlights. (So far!)  "Favre" takes the reader to the earliest years of Brett Favre with his father Irv Favre.  Irv coached Brett to have fun playing football. Always. Irv instilled hard work and discipline for all of his sons. Then the book takes the reader to Brett's NFL years including last years (2004) amazing Monday Night Football game versus the Oakland Raiders. (One day after the death of his father.)  Brett tells you what he was thinking and feeling at each highlighted moment.
<br />
<br />  Contributing writers include: Mark Bowden's "Love of the Game", Terry Bradshaw's "The Best" and Peter King's "Legend." Chris Havel (Sports columnist for the Green Bay Gazette), Bonita Favre and Deanna Favre write intimate stories that only can be cherished by the reader.
<br />
<br />  Being from Packer country I have known the lean years of Packer football. But all Packer fans every year was going to be there year to make the playoffs. Lynn Dickey, James Lofton and John Jefferson come to mind in my time. Those teams were always compared to the Vince Lombardi and Bart Starr championship years. But always came up short.
<br />
<br />  Bob Harlan hired Ron Wolf. He hired coach Mike Holmgren. Together they brought in Reggie White and Brett Favre to bring a championship back home to the smallest market in the NFL. And they did!
<br />
<br />  I was very fortunate to see Brett's Favre replace Don "Majik" Makowski. The gunslinger never looked back. And know the Packers are expected to make the Super Bowl every year. A far cry before Brett Favre! 
<br />
<br />  This book/DVD combo is must for every Packer fan. All NFL football fans will appreciate and treasure our future Hall of Fame quarterback. As a note, NFL films produce the DVD so you know it is the best quality. The book features detailed, action photographs from Mark A. Wallenfang.

                    <span>The book "Favre" is the best book that I have ever read. It goes into detail about certain plays and times during Brett's life. It is cool because then you get to know what Brett was thinking during specific events or situations. It's really interesting to know what Brett was thinking about before and during his game that he played right after his father died. The book also lets people know about Brett's childhood, his family, and all the hardwork that he has done to become a legendary NFL quarterback.</span>

                    <span>This book is awesome!
<br /> If you are a Brett Favre fan, this book is THE book that you will want to open when your Grand kids ask you about Brett Favre ,and what he was all about, as a football player, and as a person.
<br />  With countless, beautiful, full color photos of Brett, and his family, this is a book that any Favre, or Packers fan wont want to be without.
<br /> Some books lose their importance over time. This one should be put in a Green Bay Packers time capsule, and opened up a hundred years from now.....it will still be a relevant look at Brett Favre and the way that his football talent, and his love for the game changed the Packers organization forever! 
<br /> This book, by itself is awesome. Add to that, the fact that you also get an awesome Brett Favre DVD and this is as good as it gets when it comes to Brett Favre.
<br />Looking for that perfect gift for a Brett Favre fan? This is it.
<br /> Better yet, if you visit the shop at Brett's official website, you can get a copy of this book (DVD included) personally Autographed by Brett and his Mom, Bonita.
<br /> For the autographed book, visit www.officialbrettfavre.com
<br />   Or, if that is just a little beyond your bank account's grasp, simply order the unsigned copy here, at amazon.com
<br /> This is THE Brett Favre book!
<br />   It is a "Favre-olous!" book that any fan of Brett or the Packers will treasure!
