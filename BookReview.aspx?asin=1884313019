                    <span>After taking the MSF course I bought this book and others as a follow-up. My main disappointment with the MSF Guide to Motorcycling Excellence is that it little farther than the booklet that came with the course. <p>The information contained in the book is obviously valuable and correct (given that MSF are the subject matter experts on motorcycle safety) but there is not a lot of depth to the material in the book. It is written in a push button manner lacking sufficient exmplanations of the "why" of the techniques it describes.<p>If you are looking for a simple to read, basic guide to motorcycle safety this book is probably for you. If you know nothing about motorcycling then this is a good (if a bit expensive start).<p>If you want to  learn more, are detailed oriented, or need to really understand something before you can apply it, I would recommend looking for one of the other books on motorcycling that are available.</span>

                    <span>A review of the MSF course I took.  A lot of technical explanations I couldn't get, such as degrees of lean angle.  I would have preferred this to be an easier and simpler read.</span>

                    <span>This book is great.  I was planning on taking the advanced class again this spring, but alas, they are booked up through September in my area.  So, I picked up this book; it's a great supplement to the class, and an excellent refresher-read for those who have taken the course in the past.  The drawings that illustrate the techniques are excellent, and sound safe-rider advice is prevalant throughout.  The text is clear and easy to understand, and the book is organized very well.  The chapter on counter-steering is the best I've seen.<p>Not as good as taking the class, but valuable just the same.</span>
