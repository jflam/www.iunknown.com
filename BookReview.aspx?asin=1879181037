                    <span>Ms. Starbird has made a remarkable effort.
<br />
<br />The work is fascinating and *just* scholarly enough without being dry.  Well-researched, clearly.  
<br />The Tarot information is especially deep, giving a concise, well-matched explanation for the existence of the Major Arcana.
<br />
<br />She did not go into enough detail regarding several of the watermarks, in my opinion, but that in no way detracts from 
<br />their validity within the work.
<br />
<br />I can appreciate that this work made me think and made me willing to expand my spiritual horizons.
<br />
<br />My only *MAJOR* problem with this work is it is very Essentialist--It is very firm in "how men *are*" and "how women *are*" and "how the relationship between the genders *should* work".
<br />It claims women *are* inherently by their nature passive and receptive, the nurturers, while men are always naturally prone to aggression and the tendency to rule.
<br />It denies validity to many other personality archetypes within both women and men, to the detriment of both.
<br />For this, I attempted to give the book 3 1/2 stars, but since that wasn't permissible, I felt it warrented the extra half-star, bumping it up to four.
<br />
<br />A worthy read all-in-all, but balance it out with, say, Jean Bolen (Goddesses in Everywoman, Gods in Everyman) for a better perspective on gender archetypes and interrelationships.</span>

                    <span>Margaret Starbird was the pioneer of this material and should be acknowledged as such.  Anyone who wants to gain a greater understanding of the controversies surrounding Mary Magdalene should use this as their starting point.  This was the first book of its kind.  It stands on its own as a work of wisdom, insight and pure art.  </span>

                    <span>I was mesmerized by how grand the secrets behind the Holy Grail. Like all the rest, I assume it was just a relic hunt. But No, Dan Brown saw to that and now I am hunting for the facts.
<br />
<br />Named in Da Vinci Code, this book is one of the source Langdon and Teabing used in their explanation. So naturally I looked for and was very fortunate to find it. With more that 30 pictures attached as the references of what she tried to say in her book, this was very satisfying in its own way. 
<br />
<br />The book is started by a fiction story of Mary Magdalene which was not clear who wrote it, then it proceeds to each subject concerning Magdalene based on the Bible, along with the facts and fiction gathered from books by other researches , added with some hypotheses from Ms. Starbird. There is so much info I get from reading this, including more understanding of what Tarot cards really hold in their pictures. 
<br />
<br />But I think there are still too many repetitions of subjects between the chapters which sometimes made me lost focus of what was being discussed. It is very helpful to have the Index page but it would be better if Ms. Starbird could reorganized some of the subchapters an make it more systematic.</span>

                    <span>Margaret Starbird does an excellent job explaining the history of the Holy Grail legends as they apply to Mary Magdelene, and explains the evidence very well, pointing to the fact that many have believed them for over 1000 years. What she does not do well is find evidence that they are true. She claims that Mary of Bethany and Mary of Magdala are the same person, based largely on the declaration of Pope Gregory I over 1300 years ago, with no reference to any other scholars since then. She also places great emphasis on this Mary anointing Jesus on the head, but the gospel of John says that Mary of Bethany anointed his feet! Other versions of the story in Matthew and Mark do say that an un-named woman anointed his head, but neither of these books imply that it was either of these Marys. In fact, Mary was one of the most common names in Israel at the time.  So, the evidence that these two women were one and the same is extremely thin.  I agree that the Christian church has suppressed the participation of women for many years, and it is high time to elevate women and encourage their full participation in the church in every way. But I think that while Starbird's history is good, her theology takes some very large leaps that are not supported by enough evidence to convince me that they are true. </span>

                    <span>A nicely thought out book, passionate in its response to our need to recognize the feminine in our spiritual lives.  But what always astounds me in our search for "truth," (damned elusive Pimpernel) is our blindness to the great truth staring us all in the face from the first moment any of us ever questions our own religion, or our neighbor's religion.  I know this.  I was subject to the same belief-blindness when I first began my quest to know God...or at least Jesus.  The blindness is simply this: all these stories are MYTH.  I know.  I know.  Many of you think myth is just another way to say: lie, to commit a falsehood.  Wrong.  Myth is one of the most powerful words/tools in any language.  Joseph Campbell tried to tell us all this.  But Christians appear to be amongst the only people on earth who can't face their deeply symbolic stories as anything but literal truth.  (For which we have so many early Church Fathers with so many early agendas to thank.)  Myth tells the ultimate in truths about the state of being human.  In myth is woven all that we believe about ourselves, and that we hope for ourselves: as individuals...and as an entire race.  This book is Ms Starbird's myth. And I like it very much.  It's not mine since I don't need there to be an actual Jesus or an actual Mary Magdalene who were actually married and had an actual child.  It's more than enough for me to know that Jesus = Christ = Cosmic Consciousness.  And that Mary = Bride of Christ = the body coming to consciousness through Christ.  The child can only symbolize US.  We are the Grail.  
<br />
<br />This is all Gnostic teaching.  You can find all this by a careful and open-hearted reading of Gnostic texts, which very much include the four canonical gospels.  (Elaine Pagels is trying to tell us all this without going too far out on her own establishment limb.)  But still, Ms. Starbird's plea for Mary as the Bride is sweetly sung.  If it weren't so tied to the literal, it would soar higher.  
<br />
<br />Now, if you want some real red meat about Gnostic ideas, some profound scholarship,  and some storytelling on the order of the master story-tellers, you could do much worse than go read something I just stumbled across: Ki Longfellow's "The Secret Magdalene."  For me, the best of the best.  </span>
