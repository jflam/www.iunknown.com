                    <span>got me the job.  every interview i went into asked at least a couple of the questions in the book.  I am now an interview ace.  before I bought the book i did some interviews and I failed miserably.  I answered their questions stutteringly and with difficulty.  Once I bought the book and prepared, I blew the interviewers away.  buy this book if you want the job.</span>

                    <span>This book does a great job of helping you answer the most difficult interview questions.  As a training manager, who trains managers and executives on how to interview, I feel I am qualified to say this book works.  <p>This book is a wonderful resource once you get the interview.  This leaves us with the question, "How do you get an interview?" Simple, know the type of job you want and pursue it, if  you do not know what type of job you want you may want to read the classic, "How to find your dream job and make it a reality."  By Jason McClure.  <p>Read this book, and practice for your job interviews and you will be successful in your job hunt.</span>

                    <span>I personally recommend this book.  When I interviewed with Microsoft several years ago, I was astonished at how IDENTICAL their interviewing process was with that described in this book.  After reading the book, I was not surprised at ANY of the questions that were thrown at me.  And I could tell exactly when the interviewer was trying to "drill down" to catch me off-guard.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who is interviewing for the first time, or for anybody who has had a job for a decade or more and is just now venturing out again.  Interviewing tactics have changed radically since a decade ago.</span>

                    <span>This book can rehabilitate you and may indeed place you where you'd like to be.   I have been on both sides of the interview process over many years and it's amazing, in retrospect, that I've managed to work or have any decent employees.   From the most basic preparation, (something I've never done- except to fret over my outfit,) to practicing, seems like a no brainer- I speak for myself. <p>EVERYBODY knows you're not suppossed to dis a past employer, right?  I've known that for years, and I just did it last week.  I knew when I was doing it,  that it was wrong; but I couldn't dig my way into a more positive response. In fact, that's why I bought the book.  Fry  takes you around those stumbling blocks with a variety of approaches, even with regard to keeping a flow in the facts that you are putting forth.  <p>Of course, you have to do the work.  As with every manual, it isn't a novel, it's behavior, and practice, not how well, (again, in my case,) you `understand' it.<p>You can't go wrong with the material here.  It's sound, it's been tested and it's completely common sensical- it just doesn't come by osmosis.  Do it, it helps.  Good luck.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps the best endorsement I can give for a book on interviewing is that it helped me get the job I wanted. I graduated recently from an Ivy League college with a great record, but I failed after a round of interviews to secure the jobs I wanted. I bought Ron Fry's book, studied it, and realised the many things I was doing wrong during interviews. <p>This is probably obvious to the savvy, but fresh graduates may not realise that interviews are not the time and place to "be yourself", but to prepare and approach it purposefully like a saleman trying to get the customer to buy the product.</span>
