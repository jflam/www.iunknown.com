                    <span>While the book is supposedly a fake book for musicians, it includes trio and quartet recordings by key members of the Mingus big band including Seamus Blake, the outstanding Thelonius Monk Award-winning saxophonist who doesn't yet have his own CD out. The two CDs is an excellent introduction to the music of Monk and holds up well on its own. Listen and enjoy and don't worry if you are NOT a musician.</span>

                    <span>An must-own for jazz players and Mingus fans. It's all here- stories behind the tunes, accurate transciptions (some in Mingus' hand) and plenty of great trivia, like the Mingus comic book promoting his anti-bootlegging  project, and even his booklet on toilet training a cat. But mostly there's  the music.</span>
