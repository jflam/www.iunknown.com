                    <span>Although the focus is specific to software development, this book is a good primer for Project Leaders, Team Members and Managers on overall results oriented performance. Key points covered:<P>·	Focus on project goals and priorities ·	Simple process changes yield big results ·	 Attack the right problem ·	Features must be strategic for the product ·	 Look ahead, don't let foreseeable problems surprise you ·	Effective meetings end with decisions and minimize disruptions to work ·	 Post-mortems are effective if they answer how to fix problems ·	 Schedules are best if milestone driven, giving the team a sense of "wins" ·	 Grow your people, focus on immediate opportunities for feedback, avoid end of season coaching ·	The product is everything that's in the box ·	 Leverage ·	Productivity<P>I liked the real-world examples, and the varied experiences cited from within the walls of a respected development organization.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book on software development process improvements. Steve talks about practical strategies for staying focused, hitting ship dates and building solid teams. These strategies are common-sense but are often ignored by managers, project manager and technical leads.<P>Chapter 1 talks about "laying the groundwork" -- priorities work, establish goals, coding priorites. How true this is ... how often have we started development when we are unsure of what the management wants to achieve out of it.<P>Some of the other strategies include having 40 hour week(hmm ... reminds me of Extreme Programming) and about the danger of having working 12 hours per day. He also spoke about ensuring personal growth in dividuals, and how it directly helps the company.<P>This book is written in simple english, straight to the point. To everyone doing software development, this is a must-read!!!</span>

                    <span>When I read this book, the information seemed simple and obvious. However, I also realized that there were a number of things mentioned that I wasn't doing. That begs the question: Is the material that simple and obvious? Maybe not.<P>Maguire gives some simple, practicle advice for improving the development environment that a manager is responsible for. For example, he recommends starting each day by asking, "What can I do today that will help keep the project on track for the next few months?"<P>I also found the section on feedback loops to be interesting. The suggestion that you have a person stop feature work to fix a bug that they created as soon as it is found is a way to emphasize quality and make it in the best interest of developers to produce high quality code.<P>The chapter on attitudes is also very good. Much of the time, there isn't a lot knowledge wise that separtes good and bad developers. The difference comes in attitude. Attitudes such as, "We can't do that!", "The users won't care!", "Bugs are going to happen!" need to be rooted out.<P>This book gives good insight as to what you as a manager can do and help your developers do in order to have smoother projects that are high quality and on time.</span>

                    <span>This is really a very good book. I wanted to use it as a textbook for a Software Engineering class I am teaching, but now that it is out of print I felt I couldn't.<P>Anyone who needs to manage programmers, or is dependent on programmers should read this book. It is also a good read for anyone looking to help improve the overall productivity of "information workers." Simple things like how and why you schedule your meetings make a big impact.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the great books that i have come across on software project management. The book is not only good for project leads/managers but also for individual developers. Steve McQuire provides an excellent practical realistic insight into project teams at microsoft. Once you start reading this book you would not feel like putting it down. All the concepts are as we encounter them in our software development lifecycle and you can practice them and see the difference, voila!.<BR>I was greatly inspired by this book, love it and its a must have for every software engineer.</span>
