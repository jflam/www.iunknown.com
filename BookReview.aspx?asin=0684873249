                    <span>i own this book, and i have to say mr. thompson is one of my favorite authors, this book gives secrets to some of his life, while making you laugh and think hard at the same time, i perticularly like the story at the begining of the book about the mailbox, and later on while in the interview he talks about why he got a lawyer, and how he admits to have worked in the "sex" bussiness when he was younger, its a good read, a must for all thompsons fans, or just fans of gonzo journalism/novlism in general</span>

                    <span>This is my first taste of Thompson's adrenaline-fuelled writing and although entertaining and thought-provoking, I'm left with mixed feelings about the book's overall coherency. There's no denying Thompson is a talented writer with the ability to dig his nails into you, dragging you on a wild rollercoaster ride, but at the same time he tends to come off the rails every now and then and take you on massive, sometimes pointless, detours before finishing off the original thread. However, the energy of his writing still makes these sidetracks entertaining.
<br />
<br />This book is not an autobiography by any means, more a collection of anecdotes which highlight Thompson's central theme of an America wrought with Fear, demanding justice at the expense of individual liberties. According to Hunter, America is in decline - it is the end of the American Century - and he'll go down fighting and screaming to protect the rights of the individual already eroded by the Bush administration. Will you join him in protecting the liberty on which America was founded or stand by and watch as we slowly bequeath our rights to the State? 
<br />
<br />That is Thompson's main point but often it gets lost in the fog of his stream-of-consciousness prose. I'm still not sure what relevance his Cuba visit had to the overall theme and there are other instances where he seems to ramble on for no apparent reason, diluting the central message of the book. As I mentioned earlier though, he's a fantastically energetic writer who mostly gets away with this through the addictive power of his words. This book is a good read so don't be frightened off by the above criticism; I'm merely preparing you to be yanked all over the place while Thompson gets his point across. The core theme of the book is such that it will hopefully shock you into action. As Thompson quotes Edmund Burke, 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is for good men to do nothing.'</span>

                    <span>I was in the biography department of a bookshop thinking that I didn't really need to read another life of Jane Austen when a display of Hunter S. Thompson's paperbacks caught my eye.  It's a tenuous link but a friend of mine was an extra in the film adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", so I picked up a copy of KoF and was blown away.
<br />
<br />Right at the beginning where Thompson describes a childhood meeting with the CIA and again at the end when he's involved in a motor crash, the author writes what I can only describes as perfect prose,
<br />
<br />"All these things have happened and probably they will happen again.  I have learned a few tricks along the way, a few random skills and simple avoidance techniques - but mainly it has been luck, I think, and a keen attention to karma, along with my natural girlish charm."
<br />
<br />I have no interest in drugs, fast cars or pimps yet, as with all great writers, it hardly matters what they take as subject matter since they have you in the palm of their hands.  Thompson not only tells you about his mad life, he takes you there.  This is a classic of non-fiction writing, gonzo journalism at its peak.</span>

                    <span>Hunter Thompson takes stock in his tumultuous life and assesses the current situation in America in a very aptly titled book.  At its best, Kingdom of Fear evokes the glory days of Thompson.  At its worst, it wallows in some rather pitiful encounters which may have been better left unsaid, such as his flirtation with an 8-year-old Xania.  <p>Thompson launches into the current administration, as it inflicts its reign of terror on the civil liberties in this country.  He recalls his bouts with the law, in particular a sordid case involving a former porn queen who takes him to court for allegedly abusing her at his home in Aspen.  While he managed to survive these battles, he doesn't hold out much hope for the future because of the notorious Patriot Act.<p>But, his thoughts range far and wide, taking in his early years in Louisville and the proud highway to his remote home in Aspen, which he currently finds under seige from unscrupulous developers and former porn queens bent on ruining his mostly peaceful life. There is plenty of dark humor and pithy insights into the loathsome nature of the American dream.  It is a very uneven book, but then that is what I have come to expect from Thompson, who hasn't been able to repeat his past great efforts such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.</span>

                    <span>Unlike many reviewers of this book, this was my first experience reading one of Hunter S. Thompson's books. Having seen the bizarre and hilarious film, Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, however, I had some idea of what to expect (I look forward to reading that book). So the fact that some of this material may have been in previous books did not bother me. On the other hand, not being familiar with the well known episodes of Thompson's life made the erratic and disjointed style of the book -he jumps from one time period to another without warning-- harder to follow than if I'd had some background. You simply cannot read an author like Thompson expecting a conventional style, and I appreciated his unique, if often drug-induced perspective. With Thompson, all of the usual barriers are meaningless, such as those that separate fact from fantasy, the humorous from  the serious and even past from present. There is simply a barrage of words, emotions, perceptions and anecdotes, revealed in a seemingly random order.<p>Yet Kingdom Of Fear is not entirely without theme or structure. There is an underlying message, as the title suggests, that the nation is moving into a dark period that seriously jeopardizes our privacy and civil liberties. Thompson relates this post-Sept. 11, 2001 environment to episodes in his own life when authorities violated his rights. Unlike a book by the average political commentator or activist, however, Thompson makes his case with emotional verbal outbursts and poetic observations more than logical arguments. This is refreshing; Thompson's style is an anachronistic challenge to the overly regulated, homogenized and conforming culture that has been building, not only since 9/11, but over the last few decades.</span>
