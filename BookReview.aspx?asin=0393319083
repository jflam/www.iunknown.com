                    <span>I've been a fan of Nahid Rachlin and her portrayls of Iranian women for some time. Like another reviewer, I couldn't put this book down. In Foreigner, Rachlin explores culture shock (as Feri first feels it as an Iranian studying in the U.S., and then on her return years later to Iran, where it seems as though she is stepping back several centuries, both in people's way of life and way of thinking (e.g., the attitude toward women). When she becomes ill, she has to deal with the fear that medical facilities may be nothing like what is available in the States. In culture shock, she also re-experiences the difference in Eastern and Western ways of thinking. Rachlin makes very clear the unhappiness that comes with exile from one's own country, even if a person is forced to leave for the sake of his/her freedom or even life, and yet, on return to that country, it is never quite the same as remembered. Feri's uncertainty, feeling of being pulled in several directions, and reluctance to follow in her mother's footsteps are entirely understandable. What I find intruiging is this book was written (and takes place) right before the overthrow of the Shah and the Islamic revolution. Feri's decision to go or stay could make an interesting sequel for this book.<P>Nahid Rachlin's writing is exquisite; she lets you picture Iran in detail even if you have never been there. Her work ought to be publicized more, to give readers a better understanding of the culture and country that she came from.</span>

                    <span>Foreigner is a remarkable story of a young Iranian woman who, as a child, is left with her father when her mother runs off with another man. Her name is Feri, and the beginning of her life urges her to see the western world, and its differences. She decides to study in America - where she ends up settling and becoming a biologist. She marries, buys a house identical with the ones next door- when she should feel complete, she feels emptier than ever. Feri realizes she needs to go back home to Iran. <BR>While in Iran, she reconciles with her family, yet feels uncomfortable with her short hair and slacks among the women in the streets wearing chadors. Upon attempts to leave Iran, she needs a written consent form from her husband, calls and cannot reach him; and goes on a search for her long gone mother. She travels hundreds of miles to see her, and while there meets a doctor when she falls ill - and falls in love with the eastern man. When her husband comes to claim her, Feri must decide between two worlds, and two pieces of her heart.</span>

                    <span>Not everyone with an opinion or a story should write. This applies to Ms. Rachlin as well. Her literary style is poor and shallow and does not render anything new and worth consideration. The characters are irrationally and poorly developed and events do not make sense.<BR>Ms. Rachlin's portrayal of her country, her people and her culture is also very unfair and unjust. Some of the facts she presents in her story still are and have been valid when she wrote her book in 1978. But I do not know what she wants to achieve with this. Her biased and superficial view strips her work of any credibility and respect. <BR>I feel she is someone like her heroine, Feri, who has been away from Iran for several years (Ms. Rachlin is indeed married to an American gentleman) and that she has lost touch with her background and her roots. Good for Ms. Rachlin, but a person in that situation has no right to make an attempt in depicting a culture and a country she hates so much. Ms. Rachlin is a very good example of an immigrant with no roots and no attachment to her origins, suffering from a severe inferiority complex and a vision blinded by her extreme perception of the virtues of her adopted coutry/culture.<BR>Please Ms. Rachlin, there are all sorts of people, beliefs and lifestyles wherever you go. People all over the world and throughout history have lived and will live with their ignorance, prejudice, traditions, and their human instincts. You should know this better than me, the common reader. After all, you are the writer and I am not. So, please stop feeling inferior, stop being so prejudiced and biased yourself and while you are working on that, please stop writing.</span>

                    <span>I found this book in many ways deep, showing the complexity of immigrant's lives. Although this is a snapshot from Iran before revolution but many on the facts are still true. The image is from a foreigner point of view which finds herself belonging to that foreign culture. This is actually a story about people living in that area picturing believes and thoughts in depth. Those people that have not been influenced by western culture, I found this an interesting point of this book. Old culture and old people surrounding the writer. There are few signs of youth and happiness which is contradicted with the nature of that society, One the youngest countries in the world. <BR>Another fascinating point of this novel is the story of immigrants that have chosen to leave Iran and find themselves empty inside after they become successful in their life and carrier in west.<P>I hope to find her contact address in order to invite her for speech about her novels and meet with Iranian immigrants with almost same feelings as Ferri's feelings in Toronto.<BR>farhadv@rogers.com</span>
