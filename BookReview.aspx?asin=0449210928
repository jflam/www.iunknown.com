                    <span>Texas is like the Texas it describes, large, diverse, bold and beautiful. Michener has developed a masterpiece that might take the average reader awhile to "get into." (I delved into its 1000+ pages once a year ago and put it down, only to recently pick it up again) But, Texas is well worth the time and the effort. Texas traces the history of the state from its beginnings as a Mexico territory through its short stay as a independent state into its annexation into the United States, role in the civil war and beyond. Michener saturates the book with interesting people and places, puts you at the Alamo, San Jacinto and the battle of Vicksburg... you follow a cattle drive, live through a hurricane and do battle with Indians. His characters experience all the best and the worst that Texan history has to offer and see famous Texas patriots (Sam Houston, Davy Crockett) and infamous vilians (Santa Anna, Benito Garza, the Comanche Indians) at work and play. However, the best part of the book is its description of the "culture" of Texas, the way the reader is shown the influence of Spanish, Mexican, French,and German settlers, the influx of adverturers from Kentucky and Tennessee mixing with northern merchants, southern cotton growers and, of course, the various Indian tribes that occupied Texas. You learn to appreciate the diversity and the psyche that made Texas the place it is today. It is a delightful, adventuresome, wonderful book-- by the end, you may want to move there yourself.</span>

                    <span>Michener has a great way to recount history in story-like prose. I learned a lot about Texas; what a neat story about how this state came to be. Michener tells it like he thought it was; the good and the bad. This book should be mandatory reading throughout high schools in Texas.<P>The book is long and a bit slow to read. But it is one of those things you invest time on and it really gives you a lot of return.<P>I would recommend it and look forward to reading it again some day.</span>

                    <span>The length (my version is 1500 pages!) did scare me at first but it far surpassed my hopes in bringing my state to life - I felt as if it were my personal history and made me proud to be a Texan, born and raised. It was informative and educational without being dull or preachy, and made me genuinely interested in the characters - both the historical and the fictional ones. Also made me a bit homesick.... all in all incredibly entertaining!!!</span>

                    <span>This book is among my favourites. I have read most or many of his books twice and always find them to be entertaining and educational. I keep a copy of Hawaii, Alaska, and Texas near at hand. This is a nice 1000 page historical novel that gives a very detailed picture of the evolution of the great state of Texas, now one of the most dynamic states in the USA.<P>Michener's books use a common plot formula that starts out by telling a story that in some way reflects and utilizes accurately the actual or known historical developments and time lines and people of a region. In the present case it is about a group of people that came up from Mexico to settle in what is now Texas. It progresses through the development of the region adding in settlers, farmers, outlaws, lawmen, business people, adding in more characters and phasing out as time moves forward up to current times.<P>When I decided to review this book I was not certain if people were still interested in buying this book but I was pleased to see that there is still interest at Amazon.com in buying and reading this great story but perhaps not quite as popular as some of his other works.<P>Good read and a good gift.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>This has to be one of James Michener's greatest achievements. If this isn't his best book, it is one of his best. At 1322 pages you would think that would be enough, but with all of the topics JM touches I actually found myself wanting more.<P>Mercifully this one does not start with the formation of the earth's crust. Instead, JM jumps into the action and begins a saga that lasts almost 500 years. From the Indians, to the Spanish Friars, to the Alamo, gunslingers, frontiersmen, immigrants, cattleman, entrepreneurs, Texas Rangers, real estate barons, King Cotton, oil men, and football. This only scratches the surface.<P>JM follows the lives of several families from their immigration to Texas and the lives they cut out for themselves while there. Beyond fascinating. I highly recommend this book. Don't let the size of it scare you off because if is a fast read.</span>
