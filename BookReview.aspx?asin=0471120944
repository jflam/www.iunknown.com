                <span id="Label1">From a leading expositor of testing methods, a practical, comprehensive, hands-on guide to the state-of-the-art black-box testing techniques<br>    <br>    This book fills a long-standing need in the software and general systems development communities to make the essential aspects of black-box testing available in one comprehensive work. Written by one of the world's most respected figures in the field of testing, it is both a valuable working resource for independent testers and programmers and an excellent practical introduction for students. Dr. Boris Beizer clearly explains the principles behind behavioral testing in general and behind the most important black-box testing techniques in use today, which involve testing a system based on its desired behavior or function and for conformance to its specifications. Then, with fully worked examples, he leads you step-by-step from specifications to finished test cases.<br>    <br>    Complete coverage of all important test techniques&#230;including those that apply to object-oriented software<br>    * Up-to-date&#230;including the most recent breakthroughs in domain testing that now make this technique available to the working tester with no tools needed beyond a calculator or spreadsheet<br>    * Examples based on the popular off-the-shelf tax preparation packages let you try the techniques on your favorite tax software<br>    * Includes all necessary IRS tax forms<br>    * Self-evaluation quizzes help you evaluate your understanding of the material</span>

                    <span>I tend to agree with all of the above reviews regarding this book. I am attempting to read this book at present and find it very difficult to understand how the different test models apply in the real world. I use to test setup for a major computer company. I am guessing that Chapter 8, Syntax Testing, or Chapter 9, Finite-State Testing, would apply. But I need more than the brief introductory paragraphs to know which one applies: Ch 8 - "Syntax testing is a powerful technique for testing command-driven software and similar applications. It is easy to do and is supported by commercial tools". vs Ch 9 - "Originally motivated by hardware logic testing, the finite-state machine model is an excellent model for testing menu-driven applications." The material in the chapters is thorough but dry. </span>

                    <span>If you don't "Memorize" Chapter 1 and 2 It is impossible to understand this book. I realy did not like his approach. I prefer people explain to me and understand the example instead of forcing us to memorize. If you are software Quality Engineer and tester  and if you think you can use example of this book to devlope test script, forget this book. it is useless without memorizing above listed chapter.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Beizer appears to use the medium of a textbook on black box testing, which is the domain of testers without knowledge of source code or design, to promote the opinion that independent testing is useless except to protect the independent tester. Later, he admits that 80 percent of an average product lifecycle is maintenance phase, which he admits is an appropriate use of independent testers, as he admits also their use for specialized testing tools such as performance tools. His techniques may be effective but an executive level review of this book could be dangerous to the future of quality software engineering practices.</span>

                    <span>While this is a well put together book, it's reliance on the US IRS Tax Form for all examples, makes it doubtful that anyone not familiar with the form will gain much. This book is probably fine for a US Citizen, but for  the rest of the world, his other books are far more accessible.</span>

However, it is certainly thorough, and if you're willing to sit and work through the examples, it's extremely informative.  Ironically, I found a number of errors in the examples.  Guess he should have applied his own methodology...</span>
