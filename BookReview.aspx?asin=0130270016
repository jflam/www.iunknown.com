                    <span>This book is unfortunately very overpriced (a fact which didn't stop my cover falling off after a couple of weeks though) and difficult to recommend. The best the book has to offer is an accompanying Cd with a relatively current version (2.1) of Qt, which may be a reason to buy for those with a poor or no internet connection (Downloading qt is an ~ 10M undertaking depending on exactly which version, and although most linux distributions come with a version is currently much earlier (1.4, I believe at present).<P> The author seems to have tried to write a reference book in 270 pages. Instead I would suggest such books should try to offer introductions and an pedagogical overview as does Solin ("Qt Programming" by Sams), since the online Qt documentation is almost impossible to beat as a reference (what it leaves to be desired is the short complete examples covering the wide spectrum of classes/concepts that Solin achieves).</span>

                    <span>I have the the "Qt Programming for Linux and Windows 2000" by the same author, that was a poorly written book, only 20 percent of the content maybe usefull, I am surprised even such book got published, it raise my doubt about HP Professional Books. The list of Qt classes takes at least 20 percent of that book's content. I would sell mine brand new one for...(just to recover part of my cost).</span>

                    <span>The book is OK for what it is, but keep in mind, it's very superficial, so you won't master Qt with it, plus is way too expensive for what it is. Also, this book -- supposedly on GUI programming -- has a grand total on one (!) screen print (I don't count views of buttons and doodads like that.)</span>

                    <span>If you have never seen Qt, this is a useful book. It has a good explanation of the concepts and basic programming.<BR>But if you are spending your time reading the online documentation and coding, the book soon becomes useless and goes to the desk eternally. <BR>I bought it because O'Really book looked outdated. I think there is a new edition comming soon.</span>

                    <span>Whoever it was that tried to tell me this book was a huge disappointment was absolutely correct. I've already been programming with Qt quite extensively, and this was no more than a repeat reference of the online docs by Trolltech, but worse. At least I can use "Find" on my browser to do searches. 	I feel ...no more knowledgeable than I am already. Please save yourselves the (PRICE) and find a useful book on the subject.</span>
