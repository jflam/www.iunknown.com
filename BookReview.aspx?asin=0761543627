                    <span>This book is the absolute best things to come out ever!! I bought 2 copies because I wore the first one out! I mean really, without this, the game would be impossible to play! I highly recommend any book that can help you complete a game before its ever released!! Wait a minute...maybe Valve should buy a few of these...</span>

                    <span>The whole point of playing the game is to get the story slowly as you puzzle (and fight) your way throught it. Nobody should buy a strategy guide anytime, but certainly not before at least trying to play the game on their own. And with HL2 especially, there is free help from other gamers in online forums if you get stuck. This book is intended to be "acquisition therapy" for those of us impatiently waiting for the game itself.<P>Plus, unless the guide is sponsored by the makers of HL2 (it does not appear to be), all of its advice is suspect. Valve has released very little information about HL2, so this strategy guide is likely just fan fiction.</span>

                    <span>A VERY interesting strategy guide for a game that admittedly has only been released unofficially, so to speak. Anyway for all those who want to read spoilers before the game, then you will find this walkthrough a great font of knowledge, containing some very cool facts that help illuminate some of the first game and help clear up some of Gordon's past. So yeah, if you can't wait for the full game, read this, reveals a much more complicated plot than the first game, with lots of twists and surprises, much more story-oriented (a bit on the level of Deus Ex in it's complexity)<P>Fans of Half Life who are fed up with waiting for the game will love it, others might just want to take the patient approach and wait a few more months for the full official game release.</span>

                    <span>i have no clue why they made a strategy guide without the actual GAME!!!!!! Come ON people you would actually buy a strategy guide without a game? you probably just want to look at the final boss obviously, not the MAPS, please, spare me the excuses.</span>

                    <span>Thanks Prima for releasing your guide early! How else would I have found out that Gordon is actually an ALIEN before the game was released! and that G-man was trying to keep his identity secret so the government could actually use the aliens' greatest weapon against them! Man, what an ending! Saves me the trouble of actually having to buy and play the game to find out the story. Thanks for saving me a couple of bucks and a few months!</span>
