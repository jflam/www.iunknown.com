                    <span>I just listened to all seven of these CDs, and I feel like I went to a top-level negotiation course. I've never gotten so much expert assistance for less than $20 on audio before!
<br />
<br />Roger Dawson says that everything in life is a negotiation, and after listening to this, I'm convinced. Day in, day out, we're constantly trying to get people to give us more of what we want then they are willing to give. Personally, I've always been a little intimidated by having to negotiate for myself. Not anymore! Not only do I realize how important it is for to be able to negotiate, I understand how its is a skill that can be mastered with practice and attention.
<br />
<br />Dawson's power negotiation principles make it easy for anyone to stick up for yourself without seeming overbearing-even without letting the other person realize they've giving you what you want!
<br />
<br />The bonus CD - on how to buy a car and get a raise - is worth the price of the whole package. I wish I'd had this when I leased my car last year!</span>

                    <span>This book has been sitting on my shelf since 1984 (God I wish I'd read it long ago) and for some reason I picked it up. WOW is all I can say, after just a few chapters I made $150. I was talking to a sub about some extra work, he was wanting more than I thought was fair, and I used one of the gambits and saved $150 in about 5 minutes (thats an $1800/hr rate)and he was happy with the deal. I would say this is the first book you need to read if your in sales or own your own business or are a manager or buying a car or buying or selling anything. I can honestly say this book will make me a few thousand dollars a year in my business and potentially much much more on bigger deals. I've done a lot of construction business in the past with motel owners from India and they've always spanked me on the negotiations. The motel owners loved to haggle and hammer you down on price. Now I'm armed so I can compete with them. I guess it's like the author said people all over the world grow up learning and praticing negotiating but we don't here in America. But now, at least I do. This is the best business, sales book I have ever read. The methods are simple to use and effective. Over the last 25 years I've read scores of sales books, been to training seminars, visited with very wealthy and sucessful people and nothing comes close to the information in this book, period.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book a year or so ago because things like buying my first car or even "bargaining" at a flea market rattled me more than I liked to admit.  I always felt I could've done better but not sure where I went wrong.  Anticipating a career in business, I knew I'd have to start getting over that - fast - and learn to hold my own no matter how smooth the salesman!  Of course, having read nothing much on the topic of negotiation before, all the concepts were fresh and new to me from Chapter One onward.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the details provided.  <p>The techniques Dawson teaches were much more advanced than I at first thought practical for my present use, but I was able to put even some of the more advanced concepts to use in my life.  Altogether, it was a very instructive lesson in psychology even:  Being a Power Negotiator is like being a master of the martial arts. You need complete control of your emotions so that you can clearly observe and evaluate your opponents every move; adapt your strategy as he reveals himself and his weaknesses.  Although deception is elemental to negotiating -- and even unethical gambits are included in this book to further prepare the reader for the counter-strike -- Dawson instructs the discipline as an honorable art and emphasizes that the successful, power negotiation ends with both parties feeling that they have won.<p>Dawson uses plain language with very little jargon to instruct.  Mostly he draws from his seemingly endless arsenal of professional negotiating experiences - in political as well as business situations.  He even devotes an entire 4-chapter section on an analysis of American & Non-American negotiation characteristics.  This is, of course, the only book I've read on negotiation, so I can't compare it to others as far as content.  Suffice it to say, I haven't looked elsewhere yet!<p>Because I'm a poor student with mounting debt, a lot of the book reinforced the depressing reality that you gotta have money to make any.  But it inspired me all the same - negotiating is one of the fastests way to make money!  If you talk down a seller by a thousand dollars and it took you five minutes... you just made a grand in 5 minutes!  Very simple concept - but I'd never thought that way at all.  This book improved the way I think so I gotta love it!</span>

                    <span>This is simply the best negotiation book ever written. Whether you are in sales as a manager, vp or in the street salesperson, this book should be required reading. Roger's "common sense" techniques, from "flinching" to "using the higher authority" are things people use all the time that work, whether they are aware of it or not. This book isn't just for salespeople. It's for anyone who's looking to improve their lives through verbal communication skills. 5 stars all the way!</span>

                    <span>This book is truly a must read! It shows you the intricate details of how to negotiate for anything that you may want. It could be your next salary, car or even the allowance amount for your kids. Mr. Dawson takes you step by step through his win-win negotiating style. <p>The book will show you the different negotiating gambits that you can use. For example, Mr. Dawson explains gambits such as "Ask for More Than You expect to Get", "Never Say Yes to the First Offer" and many more. <p>Just a note on Mr. Dawson's writing sytle. I felt that writing could have been more concise. At times, he uses more words than necessary. However, the writing was extremely clear and it made the book so much easier to read.<p>Overall, this is a great buy. Don't hesitate and pick up a copy.</span>
