                <span id="Label1">Untitled<P><B>Macromedia Flash MX ActionScripting: Advanced Training From the Source</B> teaches readers ActionScript using a hands-on, project-based approach. This book will be different in several ways. Instead of just explaining how scripting works, explains scripting by translating real-life activities into scripts, so that users can begin to see the association of how programming and scripting is something they instinctively already know how to do. Readers will be shown many methodologies and techniques for building nearly thirty real-life Flash ActionScript projects, including sample games, wireless applications, Web sites, and more, enabling them to work faster and more efficiently. The companion CD-ROM contains all project files and images necessary for each project in the  book.</P></span>

                    <span>Macromedia Flash is a not a tool for casual users. Getting used to its complex interface can be a daunting task. To add to the frustration for those of us who are self-taught Flash users, many Flash books are poorly written, rife with errors, and full of "examples" that have no practical application.<P>In contrast, Derek Franklin and Jobe Makar's Actionscripting: Advanced Training from the Source towers above the rest. This book is simply one of the most comprehensive, well-written instructional texts on the market. You don't often find a book that could be used as a textbook in a university course and still serve the solitary learner equally well, as this one does.<P>The authors have the rare gift of being able to explain concepts clearly while keeping their material engaging. The material is organized into manageable and logical sections, facilitating ease of use and ease of study. Kudos goes to Macromedia Press, too, for its clean presentation and use of color for the code samples.<P>With its accompanying CD-ROM, Actionscripting provides hands-on, useful projects covering a wide range of topics and providing plenty of ideas and inspiration. Reading this book not only raised my Flash skills and understanding to new heights-its sample scripts served as springboards for my own projects. For example, after having used only streaming sounds with varying degrees of success, I learned from the book how to create sound objects inside movie clips. This gave me more control over sounds and their accompanying actions and changed my approach to how I was using sound.<P>I'm not going to join in the discussion regarding semantics of the use of "advanced" in the title of this book. I will only say that no book provides a better, more rock-solid, foundation in the ActionScript language. Besides being a superb instructional tool, Actionscripting is also a handy reference. It remains on my desk, and I turn to it often for reinforcement of concepts and for its useful examples. <P>Watch for Derek Franklin's forthcoming book, Macromedia Flash MX Creative Web Animation and Interactivity. It's already available for pre-ordering on this web site.</span>

                    <span>This book arrived by post at 06.57 in the morning - by late in the evening, I'd read through all 606 pages of it. I couldn't put it down. It is the most comprehensive book on ActionScripting I've ever seen and very easy to read. Best of all, for my money, is the fact that it fills in gaps which other books seem to leave uncovered. As a very general example, it explains things like 'levels' in a way in which it is very easy to understand, whereas I have other books which go 90% of the way, but which leave some tiny doubt as to the exact ramifications inherent in the usage.<BR>The book is thorough in its treatment of every topic upon which it touches - and it touches many of them! It also covers pretty well all the new features of Flash MX: text objects, listeners, improved object orientation etc. and makes topics such as prototyping and how/why it is used, simple enough for anyone to understand. The book assumes no real prior knowledge of ActionScripting, or even programming in any form. What it does assume and quite rightly so, is a reasonable grasp of Flash itself. Had it not done so, it would not have been able to squeeze so much information into its 600-odd pages.<BR>In short - this is a great book and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone interested in getting to grips with the more in-depth aspects of Flash MX. Well done, Derek and Jobe!</span>

                    <span>Before I bought this book, I only know a little about programming and knew only the basic stuff in Flash: tweening, point a to b animation, etc. Wanting to go to the next level, I bought this book. I never look back since. What makes this book perfect to learn actionscript, in my opinion, is that every line of code is always explained clearly and thoroughly in lay man's term. This book is written in such a way that as if the author's are there with you. By the time you finish reading this book, you'll be more than ready to make your own applications.</span>

                    <span>I do a lot of advanced ActionScripting and development, but I have had a lot of holes missing and things that I did not quite understand. This book fills in the gaps that are left out with other Flash books. This book explains the process and programming in a complete and easy to understand fashion. This books shows and explains the how and the why. <P>This is a great book, even if you are more advanced with ActionScript, you'll find yourself understanding more about it and new ways to develop and program your Flash development projects.</span>

The lessons are clearly and entertainingly written and the humour is an unexpected bonus. I found it especially helpful that the book gives a detailed description of what each element in a script does.</span>
