                    <span>Although this is clearly not a 260-page book based on content, there are some valuable lessons here for both mid and upper level management that can be gleaned in one sitting.  I was recently promoted, and now find myself an active participant in meetings that I griped about as a grunt.  This book helped re-shape my approach to meetings with my team as a leader, and with the other managers as a member of the group (although I do not have a problem with being outspoken).  However, one thing the book does not go into, which a lot of people deal with, is when the problem with the meeting lies with the person at the head of the table who 1) does not enforce timely attendance, 2) constantly goes off on random tangents, or 3) is overly in love with their own ideas.  Another issue that I have seen in meetings is the gender dynamic in the room - whose ideas are taken seriously, and whose are not.  However, this is not a book about office politics or interpersonal issues, but how to structure and manage meetings efficiently.  A good read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As with Leoncini's other books, information is presented via a fable with explanatory text afterward.  And, as with Leoncini's other books, this is a quick read (although a bit longer than a couple of his earlier works) with a useful message.  The ideas  will need modification depending on the type of organization with which you work.  Still, the book is helpful and a useful tool for someone who is new to management (and a good reminder for those who have been at it for awhile, even if successful at leading meetings and management generally).
<br />
<br />My gripe?  This book should be a pamphlet or very short paperbook selling for $5.95, not a $22.95 hardcover book.  I won't say it's a rip off because the message is good and some would likely say "good for him [the author]" but I can't. In today's world, it's troubling to see such little attention paid to environmental and economical factors.  Once again (as with his 5 temptataions of a CEO and 4 tips for an extraordinary executive), the book is written in three- to five-page chapters and short paragraphs - with wide margins and lots of extra spacing between pages.  There's at least as much white space in this book as text, maybe twice as much. What a waste of paper!  And, why price this book at a level where it may be too expensive to get the message out as widely as the author would presumably wish.  (The book is useful for non-profits, etc., and, if priced right, might get picked up by more people.)  
<br />
<br />My suggestion: unless you use your local library, pull the book off the bookshelf at your local bookstore and sit in a comfy chair and digest it all in one quick read.  The ideas are simple and will stay with you, so you can jot them down later.  And, if you feel you need to return to the story, a 15-minute trip to the bookstore will do it!

<br />Editorial Reviews
<br />
<br />From Publishers Weekly
<br />The business meeting-a necessary evil or a vital and invigorating component of running an organization? According to management consultant Lencioni (The Five Temptations of a CEO), meetings should fit the latter description, but more often than not, he says, they don't. In this lackluster audio fable, Lencioni offers practical advice on how to revitalize your business by energizing your business meetings, but his pallid, passive prose would challenge the most skilled narrator, and Arthur is no exception. The voice Arthur lends Will, the young hero of this tale, resembles that of Sesame Street's Ernie on downers, and the various inflections he gives business owner Casey McDaniel and his management team don't make up for the characters' lack of character. Nevertheless, Lencioni's message comes across loud and clear-meetings should be interactive, not passive, and they should be structured (i.e., issues of immediate importance should be discussed in "weekly tactical" meetings, and issues that will fundamentally affect the business should be addressed in "monthly strategic" meetings). Although managers will find this advice worthwhile, they would gather just as much if they skipped the sluggish fable and listened to the last few tracks.

<br />
<br />Product Description:
<br />Casey McDaniel had never been so nervous in his life.  
<br /> In just ten minutes, The Meeting, as it would forever be known, would begin.  Casey had every reason to believe that his performance over the next two hours would determine the fate of his career, his financial future, and the company he had built from scratch. 
<br />
<br /> "How could my life have unraveled so quickly?" he wondered. 
<br />
<br /> In his latest page-turning work of business fiction, best-selling author Patrick Lencioni provides readers with another powerful and thought-provoking book, this one centered around a cure for the most painful yet underestimated problem of modern business: bad meetings.  And what he suggests is both simple and revolutionary. 
<br />
<br /> Casey McDaniel, the founder and CEO of Yip Software, is in the midst of a problem he created, but one he doesn't know how to solve.  And he doesn't know where or who to turn to for advice.  His staff can't help him; they're as dumbfounded as he is by their tortuous meetings.  
<br />
<br />Then an unlikely advisor, Will Peterson, enters Casey's world.  When he proposes an unconventional, even radical, approach to solving the meeting problem, Casey is just desperate enough to listen.  
<br />
<br /> As in his other books, Lencioni provides a framework for his groundbreaking model, and makes it applicable to the real world.  Death by Meeting is nothing short of a blueprint for leaders who want to eliminate waste and frustration among their teams, and create environments of engagement and passion.

                    <span>The author attributed the usual failure of meetings primarily to two problems: lack of drama (say, how to raise the interest of participants in the first ten minutes etc) and lack of contextual structure. For the later, he suggested four types of meeting including daily check-in, weekly tactical, monthly strategic and quarterly off-site review as remedy. 
<br />
<br />If you believe the above prescriptions suit your situation, fine. Go for it. If not, as in my case in a highly political (intra and inter departmental), competitive (business wise) where your boss and your boss's boss just make use of every opportunity to squeeze you for short term performance to meet requirement of quarterly target (in my case weekly targets) and find a scapegoat, please give it a pass. 
<br />
<br />p.s. The second key actor of the fable: The once sole proprietor of the software company had been kind and generous enough to sell his company to a publicly listed company and distribute the stock options to "cheer up" his staff. How kind and rare he had been! Hope you and me can come across one sooner or later!</span>

                    <span>I'll add my voice to the many positive reviews this book has received. Death by Meeting clearly lays out the principles for holding effective meetings. Lencioni skillfully articulates key principles that WILL make a difference. Be forewarned, though; people generally will fall back into old habits without some consistent coaching and reminders. But once the former habits are broken, you will wonder how you ever got by.</span>
