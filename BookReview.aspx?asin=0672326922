                    <span>Wow! This book does a great job at explaining the Unreal Editor in a simple, easy to understand way. When I first opened the editor, I was intimidated by the all the menus and commands, but this book really takes the mystery out of it. It also gives you the confidence you need to succeed in making your own levels in Unreal! The wording is coherent, the text is easy on the eyes, and the images are well organized and inspiring to look at. It even covers character modeling, rigging, and animating in Maya. What a deal! Level editing should be fun and this book does just that.</span>

                    <span>I think that as a former QA guy in the game business, you should learn that if you want to use a game editor, you should buy the game. It cost $39.00 when it came out.  This book is for those who want to make levels that modify the game. For that it works flawlessly, and explains things masterfully.
<br />
<br />If you download the Free Unreal Runtime from UDN, yes it will not work, but you cannot make levels for the game with just the RunTime.  The RunTime on UDN is to show what the engine can do, not to allow you to make custom content.
<br />
<br />The tutorials in this book are crisp, well thought out and extremely accurate.  It is by far the most comprehensive collection of content for building unreal levels that exists on the market today.  
<br />
<br />If you are looking to purchase this book, please realize that the people who know what they are doing love it, and praise it.

                    <span>I've programmed and used game level editor tools professionally. The Unreal Ed tool is a bear for anyone without previous knowledge of Unreal's editor. This book tells you half of what you need to know to get going. You'll have to guess and find by trial and error what and where the menus and tools are that the authors tell you about. Be prepared for a lot of frustration. You're probably better off going to the Epic Games site and downloading the same Unreal Runtime editor that is on the CD and accessing their tutorials for non-licensed users. You can also access a free learners edition of Maya.
<br />
<br />And to add insult to injury, the tutorial files cannot be accessed with the runtime engine on either the CD or the Epic Games site. You'll need a fully licensed version of the Unreal Runtime engine to use the tutorial files. The tutorial files don't work with the free version of the Runtime Engine.
<br />
<br />It does't say much for QA, if you sell a product that doesn't work out of the package, and this one doesn't. As a former game QA guy, I can't believe the publisher went gold on a CD that crashes the Unreal Runtime Editor, everytime you try to access a tutorial file. This book and CD is "unreal." If I could get my money back after opening the worthless CD, I would.</span>

                    <span>This book is the definitive bible for creating 3d content using Unreal 2.5 Engine. I have been using it a lot for the level, I'm working on. Instead of scouring the web looking for a tutorial on how to do "that", you can check the index and learn what "that" does and how to use it in your level.
<br />
<br />The book covers everything from learning Maya PLE, learning 3dsmax, unwrapping, vehicle modeling, everything that 3D Buzz's team has on their website for download as a video tutorial is in this book, except the information's is right at your finger tips.
<br />
<br />I was recommended to this book from a friend who works in the gaming industry and even his company uses the book for a quick reference. Jason Busby, Zak Parrish & Joel Van Eenwyk thank you for making one of the best references a level artist could possibly have!</span>

                    <span>I was a little skeptical before purchasing this book because I already own and watched the Unreal Tournament 2004 Special Edition training videos produced by the same authors as this book. I was afraid that the 60+ hours of content in those videos would cover all the same material as the book. Boy was I wrong.
<br />
<br />Not only does the Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design go into detail far surpassing the training videos, including a surprisingly enlightening (and helpful) section on the theory behind how the Unreal Technology works, but Mr. Busby, Parrish, and Van Eenwyk guide you step-by-step through designing a level. As they begin introducing new, more advanced, features they'll explain - option by option - how the feature works and provide numerous examples of where it would be useful. For a level designer, having a single clear guide of what each of thousands of settings do is an invaluable resource.
<br />
<br />This book serves as an excellent introduction to Maya reference as well. As I said earlier, having watched through the video tutorials, I was already somewhat familiar with the Maya package. But even for complete novices, the book will quickly bring you upto speed with the basics of the package, and help you learn how to use it to import your own creations (such as static meshes) into your Unreal levels. The Maya content in the book alone, is worth the price of admission.
<br />
<br />The previous reviewer mentioned that he uses 3DS Max instead of Maya. While I have no doubt that Max is an awesome package, it should not be overlooked that Maya has a free personal learning edition - that ships with Unreal Tournament 2003/4. Consequently, I am very pleased that this package was used instead of Max, because in doing so no initial investment beyond a copy of this book is needed. Heck, they even ship a copy of the Unreal Engine Runtime with the book! This means that people who don't own Unreal Tournament 2004, but wish to learn about level editing, can do so. Overall, I was extremely impressed. :) Way to go.</span>
