                    <span>I bought this book in hopes that the author would clearly explain building the halloween shop sample application from the ground up, but after chapter 1, the author totally loses you as far as next steps are concerned.
<br />The first chapter has actual "excercises" which get you started in building the sample application. After that, most chapters don't contain these exercises, therefore you have to build the rest of the application based on the screen shots/code snippet's in the chapter.</span>

                    <span>Simply said: One of the best books I have ever bought!
<br />
<br />I needed to dive into ASP.NET pretty fast because I had a project running to its deadline. I was a programmer who knew Visual Basic and Delphi pretty well. I did know the theory of ASP.NET but had no practical experience. This book teached me in a record time how to build and get my first web application up and running. 
<br />
<br />The best starter's book you can imagine. The second book I bought on the subject was ASP.NET Unleashed, which is a marvellous book if you have some ASP.NET experience.
<br />
<br />For a beginner Murach's book is simply a dream, and although I have written a couple of web applications now, I still use it as a quick reference. WORTH EVERY PENNY IN GOLD.</span>

                    <span>I have never been so irritated and frustrated by a book in terms of its presentation and format.  If any newcomer is able to follow along with the tutorial application and actually build it, I'd be very, very surprised.
<br />
<br />I just do not see the point of having the book's text on even pages and a bulleted review of that same text (along with code) on odd pages.  There's no mention of how to code the HTML portions, you have to already know how by looking at some screen shots.  There's just no follow-through from chapter to chapter as the author grows the application.
<br />
<br />I'm still searching for a book on ASP.NET that walks the reader through the construction of an actual, useful application from A to Z.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a teacher of ASP.NET, I have tried several textbooks. I always like a textbook that supplements my teaching rather than dictates it. Murach's ASP.NET does just that and is an excellent book for teaching web programming because of its format.
<br />
<br />The left-hand page explains a particular concept while the right-hand page illustrates the concept with code snippets that are easy to understand. My students get frustrated trying to sift through long sample programs to find the few lines of code that illustrate a given point. With Murach's code snippets, the code is easy to understand.
<br />
<br />The authors also use code-behind instead of embedding code via the ASP.OLD style. Not many books do that, thus giving this book a rich, more modern approach to the way ASP.NET programming should be done.
<br />
<br />The more I read this book, the better it gets.</span>

                    <span>The book is a good reference for either beginnner or expert ASP.NET developer. It has the depth and provides a very detailed description of several aspects of ASP.NET, covers all major topics - controls, validators, state management, session, security, ADO.NET programming and simple HTML tutorial. The weakness is not a deep presentation of VB.NET, web services, XML, .NET framework in general.
