                    <span>I had to read this book for a class on the Story of Christianity. I liked it so much I plan on buying it for fellow women for Christmas.  This book fills a hole in the literature telling the story of Christianity.  It covers writings by and about women that are hard to find in one volume.  The first chapter is significant writings from the Bible.  Later chapters include theologians commenting on women and the writings of women themselves.  Most selections are two or three pages long.  I majored in religion in college and had not heard of most of the female writers I was reading.  It was refreshing.  Because history is written from the perspective of those in power, those without power are often ignored.  This book gives a voice to women in the story of Christianity.  Parts make a person angry in how they understand women, others give hope, and still others tell what life was like for women.  If you are interested in reading "his"story in a new way, I reccommend this book.</span>
