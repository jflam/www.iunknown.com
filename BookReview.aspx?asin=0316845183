                    <span>Un libro muy completo, vertiginoso para quienes queremos conocer mejor la naturaleza de las personas y la nuestra¡¡¡ Con una redacción muy clara, ejercicios y feedback extremadamente reveladores, estoy convencido que expandí notoriamente mis capacidades de entender a las personas así como identificarlas y comunicarme con ellas. Gracias por este muy buen libro. Un único detalle; que la tapa es más bien fea y poco seria, ¡¡aunque esto dependerá de la persona que lo lea!! El contenido es muy valioso. Sí deben estar dispuestos a leerlo con calma y profundidad; ¡hay mucho que aprender!.</span>

                    <span>I have used MBTI at work and found it to be useful.  I came across this book when I was looking for something to add to the basic knowledge that I had.  Don't worry though, the first two chapters go over the basics.  If you are not familiar with MBTI, this will get you started.  If you are familiar with it, it serves as a good review.
<br />
<br />Then the heart of the book takes you through three tools for identifying peoples preferences:  type preference as a whole, temperament, and extraverted/introverted feeling.  After putting all of these together, the authors present you with some case studies where you use the various techniques to try to identify the types of the people involved.  They are simple but useful.
<br />
<br />The book closes with some detailed advice for interacting with the four different temperaments in general and then specifically the four individual type preferences within a given temperaments.
<br />
<br />The final chapter is titled "How Will I Ever Look at People the Same Way Again?"  Truthfully, you won't.  You will notice things about people, and hopefully these things will help you improve your interactions with the people you come in contact with.</span>

                    <span>The Tiegers wrote a book that is appropriate for all, well, types of people.  The book is tremendously well organized.  I have been able to use the information to read people I would otherwise might not have guessed.  The exercises in the book are marginally useful (at least to me), but the techniques are sound and can be applied immediately.
<br />
<br />The reader completely unfamiliar with the sixteen types and the Myers-Briggs type indicator (often talking about the types is summed up as 'the MBTI') is not at a disadvantage, because the Tiegers explain each of the eight preferences and give a nice background and summary about the sixteen types later on.  I would be cautious about overgeneralizing people's behavior, and unfortunately unscrupulous readers will misuse the MBTI and the information in the book.  The Tiegers give a nice response to the ethics concern and hopefully those who read the book will use it to improve their lives and relationships and not use the information to abuse others.
<br />
<br />As the title suggests, reading people is a bit of an art.  After absorbing the book you will have a solid basis for categorizing people and hopefully a more scientific way of reading their type.</span>

                    <span>This book, as opposed to other books concerning "Temperament Typing" offers a less official, more relaxed and practical way of harnessing this theory.  I think it is worth a read for everyone who feels he wants or needs to know people more, on both the personal or impersonal level</span>
