                    <span>At long last, NFL Flims has released a DVD on the Super Bowls. It is complete with NFL Flims narration of the first ten games, unedited and without commercial breaks (unlike when ESPN, ESPN2 or ESPN Classic shows them). Plus, the bonus:<BR> Seasonal recaps from 1966-1975 and extra features.<P>Now bring on Super Bowls XI-XX!</span>

                    <span>This DVD is excellent. Not only do you get the first 10 Super Bowl films uncut, but you also have season highlight films from that Super Bowl year. I also liked "They Call it Pro Football" which was the first film John Facenda narrated for NFL Films. The extra features were interesting too. I can not hardly wait for Super Bowl XI-XX to be released.</span>

                    <span>For fans who are very familiar with NFL Films' Super Bowl highlights after countless marathon viewings right before each year's big game, the main draw of this five-disc set is having the added context of the annual season-in-review films. The 1966 season isn't really summarized in "They Call It Pro Football," the feature preceeding Super Bowl I, but beginning with "1967," we get some sense of how the conference champions reached the Super Bowl. Also interesting to see are the very good playoff teams that came up short.<P>Some of the season-in-review films take the straightforward approach of explaining which teams won each division, and briefly recap what happened to the also-rans. This is true of the 1967, 1969 and 1970 features. In other years, the approach is less direct, as a look at the season's outstanding rookies, strategies or units segues into a discussion of the teams. Key playoff games are generally highlighted, including many classics, such as 1967's "Ice Bowl" between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, the 1969 Minnesota Vikings-Los Angeles Rams divisional playoff, the Miami Dolphins-Kansas City Chiefs overtime thriller in 1971, and the Dallas-Minnesota showdown in 1975. <P>The extra features are all very short, and some of them will be familiar to viewers of "NFL Films Presents" and other NFL Films programs. <P>The Super Bowls themselves are presented in the traditional, effective NFL Films style, making even lackluster contests compelling through thorough explanations of strategy, Sam Spence's celebrated music scores, and John Facenda's classic narration. <P>The fascinating season-in-review footage underscores the need for a comprehensive release of annual highlight films, at least for the dominant teams of the last few decades, as I said in a review of "NFL Films Inside the Vault: Vols. 1-3." I have not seen the "History Of" DVD sets on the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers, but it does appear that these, taken together with the "Super Bowl I-X" set, represent a definite step in the right direction.</span>

                    <span>I've always been a fan of NFL Films' half-hour Super Bowl game recap/highlight shows that play on ESPN2 during the week leading up to the big game, and lamenting the fact that they never bothered to put any of 'em out on DVD. Fortunately, they finally came around and put out this collection of highlight shows for the first ten Super Bowls, as well as quick NFL season recaps leading up to the championship. Which is good, 'cuz now I won't have to worry about my gradually deteriorating VHS tapes of the episodes I've recorded off of ESPN2 over the few post-seasons getting eaten by my VCR!<P>While I thought the recap shows alone were worth the bucks my mom & pop paid for it as a Christmas present (thanks, guys!), NFL Films added even more value to the presentation by throwing two featurettes in with each Super Bowl game. Included among these mini-shows are brief profiles of the careers of Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Bob Lilly, Jack Lambert, and Roger Staubach. Also showcased: the silent enigma that was Cowboys RB Duane Thomas, the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season and their famed(?) "No-Name" defense of the early 70s, the legacy of Tom Landry, the fights that broke out between CBS and NBC before, during, and after their simultaneous broadcast of Game I, the Minnesota Vikings setting the standard for Super Bowl futility, and other sideline stuff I never knew about before. Now if only they'd release on CD some of those amazing soundtrack tunes that compliment the game action....<P>Topping off this set's sack o' goodies is a booklet that features images and basic info on each contest, including the date each game was played on and the city & stadium it was played in, program covers, championship rings, rosters, scores by quarter & final scores, and the name & position of each game MVP. A glossy, full-color Super Bowl X ticket facsimile adds a nice finishing touch to it all.<P>But even though I enjoyed viewing just about every single show and featurette contained within this set, being the big-time 49er faithful and Redskin-rooter that I am, I never really appreciated the first decade of "the great American time-out" as much as I do the Super Bowls to come. With luck, this bad-boy will sell well enough to justify the release of the Super Bowls XI-XX DVD box set, which'll cover a few of my all-time fave championships, including the 49ers's victories in XVI & XIX, the 'Skins claiming XVII, and the Bears' 46 defense in peak form against the Pats in XX. And don't even get me started on XXI to XXX...<P>'Late</span>
