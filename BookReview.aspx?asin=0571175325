                <span id="Label1">Spain produces some of the finest wines in the world, yet twenty years ago it was known only for sherry and rioja. Today, however, world-class wines are produced in Costers del Segre, Navarra, Peneds, Priorato, Ribera del Duero, and Somontano, to name just a few areas that are covered in this comprehensive book. Julian Jeffs, one of Europe's foremost writers on wine, traveled all over Spain looking for fine vineyards in remote places. He sought out and evaluated the many varieties as he also researched modern Spain's impressive methods of vinification, which have helped Spanish wines progress in just a generation from being little known and poorly regarded to becoming recognized as among the world's best.</span>

                    <span>Why Spanish wines? <BR> When experimenting with wines that suited my budget (less than ten dollars a bottle), I found that most French wines disappointed, while ALL the Spanish wines were very good. <BR> Hence, Spanish wines. <BR> A quotation from the book supports, at least in part, my observations - <BR> "It is now almost impossible to buy a bad Rioja"<P>Julian Jeffs book is extremely well written, with thorough discussions of the climate, the soil, the grapes, the wines and the Bodegas of the various regions in Spain. Interspersed are several interesting historical details and cultural and literary references. Wonderful to read in the chapter on Sherry was Falstaff's speech in praise of "sherris-sack" from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 quoted in full. Even better was to find out that they have a monument to G. K. Chesterton in Sitges, a Catalonian town where he often visited.<P>Refreshingly, this book does not have any photographs - it is not wine-porn! Instead there are lovely line drawings by Wendy Jones, that blend in well with the text, without distracting from it. Again refreshingly, wines are not classified individually. The book will not drive the potential wine buyer to worrying about the relative worth and merits of an 85 point wine compared to a 90 point wine. The classification is done for each region by rating the vintage years on a scale of 1 (least good) to 7 (best). There are additional comments about individual wines in the discussions of the Bodegas.<P>The book is useful for the Spanish wine enthusiast, and it is good reading for anyone interested in wine.</span>
