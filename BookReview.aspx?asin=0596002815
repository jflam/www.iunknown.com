                <span id="Label1">Thoroughly updated, <i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition introduces the basic elements of the latest release of Python 2.3 and covers new features, such as list comprehensions, nested scopes, and iterators/generators. Beyond language features, it also includes new context for less-experienced programmers, including fresh overviews of object-oriented programming and dynamic typing, new discussions of program launch and configuration options, new coverage of documentation sources, and more. There are also new use cases throughout to make the application of language features more concrete. The first part of <i>Learning Python</i> gives programmers all the information they'll need to understand and construct programs in the Python language, including types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules and exceptions. The authors then present more advanced material, showing how Python performs common tasks by offering real applications and the libraries available for those applications. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises that will test your Python skills and measure your understanding. </span>

                    <span>Overall this is a well-written book. I highly recommend it to a person learning Python.  The concepts are well explained with an economy of words.  Some programming books are dry; whereas I found this book answering questions that a person learning Python (like me) has.  The authors give a background on the language and do a good job discussing the language.  The book is well laid out and has a decent amount of white space in the margins for notes.
<br />
<br />The index was fairly good, but has room for improvement in having more entries in it so that key concepts can be zeroed in on quickly.  One feature that would have helped would be to have longer program examples listed in the book.  Solutions are provided in the back of the book.  This comes in handy in case one gets stuck doing an exercise and/or provides insight to an alternative approach.  If a person is going to learn Python, this book will definitely get them boot strapped quickly.

                    <span>I would never try to use this book as a reference. It was not designed and it's not good for that. 
<br />
<br />It was designed as your first book on Python, especially if this is your first programming language. As such, it gives you a really thorough and extensive introduction written by a renowed authority. The parts on functional programming, Python's OOP and modules lay the solid foundation for the future Python programmer. Beware though: compared to similar "foundation" books in other languages' realms, this one is slow-paced, limited in scope, wordy and even redundant at times. 
<br />
<br />If you already know a language like C++, Java or Perl, and especially if you've already written some Python code, then this book is not your best choice: it will seem terribly slow paced, tedious, bloated and of no value as a reference (which is what an experienced programmer like you really needs most of the time). In this case, you could use a short and freely available tutorial like Guido's, then a good reference book like Python in a Nutshell and maybe some more advanced books like Python Cookbook and Python 2.1 Bible (provided there will be a new edition). 
<br />
<br />As an intermediate or experienced programmer, you may still benefit from Lutz's "textbook". You may want to skim quickly through the first 3 Parts (which make 180 pages of beginner's stuff you've learned in highschool, decorated with the occasional gem toward the end of some chapters), then slow down a bit for the rest of the book and pay special attention to chapters 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, and 27. This book has too many chapters for my taste, btw.
<br />
<br />Part VIII, written by another authority (David Ascher), is a little too short and still bad for reference. In the next edition, I hope it will be expanded to a reasonable level of detail. I found the coverage of regular expressions particularly disappointing -- probably because they are covered by Mr Lutz's other book, Programming Python, which was supposed to be your second book. The exercises at the end of each Part are not the most interesting and useful I know of.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I did not like this book. It is terribly organized. It is incomplete. Although it doesn't present wrong information, the way it is presented makes it seem inaccurate. Information on one same subject is scattered in many different chapters and never presented in one place. For that reason it is practically impossible to use as a reference or to quickly find a piece of info.
<br />
<br />For example, while I was mid-way through the book, I wanted to quickly check what kind of comments Python supported. Does it support only one kind (line comments), or like C++ and Java has two kinds (line and block) ? So, I checked the contents - I was searching for a chapter called something like "lexical structure", or even "comments". No luck. (However, I did find a chapter called "Clicking Windows File Icons" ... - very useful! )
<br />I didn't give up. Next step, check the index. "Comments" are mentioned three times in the book. The first time in the chapter "Basic Operations and Variables" (good choice!!!) - one kind of comment is described briefly in a paragraph with no relation to the rest of the chapter. Sadly, no answer to my question there. 
<br />
<br />The second time is in a chapter titled "Python Syntax Rules". Hmm, that makes more sense. Well, technically not, since comments are not part of the syntax, but let's not get technical ... Here it says that comments are ignored. Good to know. But how many kinds of comments are there ???
<br />
<br />The third mention of comments is in the chapter "Documenting Pyhton Code". "Finally!", I say to myself and naively rush through the pages. Alas, no luck again. It says that "#" comments are a way to document code, but again it doesn't say if they are the only kind of comment, or if there are others.
<br />
<br />By this time it is probably implied that there is no other kind of comments, since it is never never mentioned, however one SHOULD NOT have to guess about such things when reading a technical book. 
<br />I went ahead and checked the online Python documentation at http://www.python.org/doc/2.4/ref/ref.html . It took me 5 seconds to find "Lexical analysis", "Comments" and read what I needed. Why did I bother with the book ??
<br />
<br />In defense of the book, I must say that it is not all bad. It does sucesssfully teach you to program in Python, even though it is strongly geared to inexperienced programmers (and thus annoying at places). However you absolutely need one more source of reference for Python, and if you have that, why buy this book ?
<br />
<br />It is nothing like "The Java Programming Language", which in my mind is an example of an excellent language book and reference. </span>

                    <span>If you're familiar and comfortable with other languages, you may find this book too long-winded. I think it could have slimmed down by 300 pages and been easier to follow and more useful for learning. 
<br />
<br />If you get annoyed by incessant references to Monty Python, you may find the various examples very distracting and irritating. ('Foo' is a nonsense word, and doesn't interfere with anything, but to constantly read 'spam' and 'eggs' gets really distracting.)
<br />
<br />If you've never done scripting or programming, then the pace might be appropriate for you.</span>

                    <span>Even though this book was a little too slow for my personal taste (I already had quite a bit of experience in various object-oriented and scripting languages), I nevertheless gave it 5 stars for the phenomenal task the authors solved by making the book accessible and thorough at the same time.
<br />
<br />The first half of the book provides an introduction to the basic elements of the Python programming language, such as built-in data types, control flow, functions, and modules. The second half deals with more advanced, but equally fundamental, programming concepts such as object-oriented programming and exceptions, and gives examples of how to solve common tasks like file processing or string manipulation in Python. The text carefully defines all introduced concepts, and supplements them with many examples, so it should be quite accessible even for people with little previous programming experience. At the same time, it is fair to say that, after studying this book, the reader will have a thorough foundation and a solid grasp of all important Python concepts.
<br />
<br />For example, the two concepts that distinguish Python from most other programming languages, are "everything is an object" and "every variable is a reference". This might lead to some surprises for programmers that grew up with compiled languages such as C++, but the book points out the differences in pilosophy and the resulting "gotchas" in quite some detail. In fact, each chapter concludes with a list of such "gotchas", which is likely to save both the beginner and the experienced programmer some headaches. 
<br />
<br />Another aspect I liked about this book is that, even though it is aimed at Python beginners, more advanced concepts are not just swept under the rug, but the authors are honest enough to point out their own omissions, and to refer the interested reader to some more advanced text.
<br />
<br />The last two chapters of the book introduce the reader to a variety of Python extensions, such as GUI toolkits and scientific computing libraries, among many others. Due to the huge number of  Python extensions available, these chapters are necessarily very dense, and in this way break with the book's general style of providing a thorough, comprehensive introduction to all new concepts. These chapters serve well as a platform, or rather a guide map, with the help of which the world of Python can be explored further.
<br />
<br />In summary, I'd enthusiastically recommend this book to all but the most experienced programmers, since for the latter the book's pace will likely be a little too slow.</span>
