With <B> Macromedia Flash MX Hands-On Training</B>, you'll learn core Macromedia Flash MX principles and techniques in a real-world Web design environment. The step-by-step projects build successively, teaching you not only the various features of Macromedia Flash MX, but also how to actually work with the program to achieve results. Each lesson is chock-full of background information, tips, and insight aimed at helping you understand the process as much as the exercise itself.

As the projects progress, you'll tackle more complex techniques, such as working with movie clips, text, sound, and video. The latter part of the book addresses publishing and managing Macromedia Flash MX content, as well as how to create content by integrating other software into Macromedia Flash MX.

                    <span>I bought this book so I could work with my son and daughter (10 and 12) to teach them Flash MX (or, rather, teach them digital animation and video game programming). The book is a great introduction to Flash MX - easy to understand, good example/projects, alot of relevant 'hands-on-training' (as opposed to alot of programming books that have large sections of code).<P>It's probably too much for my kids to independently read and stay motivated (since it's written for adults), but we've really enjoyed my working through the chapters and then teaching my kids each of the lessons. We're all creating our own Flash MX movies and are just starting a video game. The book has provided a very nice foundation for us to quickly get up to speed and start using Flash MX. It's also really nice to see my kids to take such a strong interest in starting to write video games instead of just playing them ;).<P>(As with most introductory books, it's been great to get us started, but I don't really think we'll pick it up again now that we're pretty comfortable with the basics).</span>

                    <span>This book starts out very slowly teaching the fundamentals of Flash MX and then using the learned knowledge to advance to some of the other topics. The beginning of the book can seem somewhat annoying and tedious, but if you follow the book from the first chapter all the way through the end, you will be solid in fundamental Flash MX. Some of the examples seemed to be here to fill up space, for example there was one "lesson" showing how to convert a graphic to a symbol. If you know how to do this you already know there isn't much to this process. However, by including this type of information it won't leave you frustrated that they left steps out... as most tutorial books do. I WILL keep this as a reference, as it outlines the fundamentals of basic Flash MX projects. Naturally, your projects will become much more complex, but this can certainly serve as a refresher or starting point when you've got that idea but don't know how to make the connection from idea to to Flash MX. Good Book - I will look for Lynda Weinman books in the future. On last thing, I recently made the switch and I am running OS X - great job in making clear any differences between Mac OSX and Windows versions!</span>

                    <span>This book stands out from other books dealing with Flash because it makes you get your hands dirty by actually USING the program. It comes with a CD that contains trial software and movies that demonstrate exacly how to perform certain tasks. It's easy to read and while the first few chapters are perfect for beginners, by the time you get to the end of the book, you'll be creating Flash presentations at an expert level.</span>

                    <span>This book was exactly what I had been looking for. I got my Digital Media degree and went through so many technologies so quickly, I only got a basic understanding of all of them- Flash included. <P>This book helped me go back and review what I knew and WHY things are done the way they are. It answered why some of my projects didn't work and it also gave me a WHOLE new bunch of features to use.<P>I do agree with a few of the others that if you have a solid knowledge of Flash already, you want something more in depth. However, for those of us trying to learn it quickly for basic functions, this book is wonderful.<P>It is logically organized, no distracting typos or misinformation and the exercises and info on the CD actually match. <P>I have 2 other books on Flash that I wasted money on- even after reading this book, I find that the others are useless and hard to understand.<P>I think this book will be a nice reference if I forget something until I have used Flash more.</span>
