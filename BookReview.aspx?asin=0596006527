                <span id="Label1">In September 2003, Macromedia released Flash MX 2004, and with it, ActionScript 2.0, a dramatically improved version of Flash's programming language.  ActionScript 2.0 introduces a formal object-oriented programming syntax and methodology for creating Flash applications.  From a developer's perspective, the new OOP-based techniques in ActionScript 2.0 make applications more natural to plan and conceptualize, more stable, more reusable across projects, easier to maintain, change, and expand upon, and much more. In short, they enhance the entire development process.  In <i>Essential ActionScript 2.0</i>, bestselling author Colin Moock--one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community--covers everything you'll need to know about the new ActionScript language and its methodologies for producing movies, animation, and applications on the web. Moock guides readers through this important new territory with his trademark easy-to-understand style and expertise. Moock's goal throughout the book is not just to get you to use object-oriented programming in your daily Flash work: he wants you to reap the benefits of OOP; he wants you to understand ActionScript 2.0 completely.  And without question, Moock is the author who can make this happen.  <i>Essential ActionScript 2.0</i> begins with a tour of the language, including the fundamentals of object-oriented concepts, syntax, and usage. Those who are new to OOP will learn the basics and how to apply their understanding. Those who are familiar with OOP will leverage their prior experience to learn about Flash-based OOP. The next part of the book shows how to structure entire applications with ActionScript 2.0, teaching you best practices and techniques to build scalable, extensible, stable apps. Next, you'll explore a variety of approaches to various programming situations by applying object-oriented programming strategies, known as design patterns, to Flash.   Experienced Flash developers and programmers coming from other languages will enjoy the sheer depth of Moocks's coverage and expertise in <i>Essential ActionScript 2.0</i>. Novice programmers will appreciate the frequent, low-jargon explanations that are often glossed over by advanced programming books.  As usual, Moock guarantees quality and accuracy by working closely with Macromedia Flash engineers, including Rebecca Sun, lead developer of ActionScript 2.0.  Whether you're ready to make the move to ActionScript 2.0 now or simply assessing it for the future, you'll find everything you need to know within this book. <i>Essential ActionScript 2.0</i> is the one book every ActionScript coder must own. </span>

                    <span>This book is a new cornerstone in my Flash reference library. Explains not only the 'what' and 'how' of Actionscript 2.0, but the 'why'. As an intermediate-level actionscript 1.0 programmer, this book gave me the information (and the encouragement) I needed to upgrade my skills to AS2. Part III, which introduces various design patterns, was especially eye-opening to me as a 'learn-as-you-go' programmer. Colin's easy-to-read conversational style makes this book a readable reference that makes OOP approachable.

                    <span>Though you'll be bleary-eyed and exhausted at the conclusion of each lengthy and dense chapter, the book is worth adding to your ActionScripting Library (right next to ActionScripting in Flash MX by Philip Kerman, which is the only ActionScript book I'd give 5 stars)
<br />The only real shortcomings here (other than the lack of data connectivity topics, as another reviewer noted) are the author's occasional forrays into how ActionScript compares to Java (not learning Java so I don't care, thank you), and the occasionally convoluted examples (you can tell someone used to work at Macromedia when they weave four different concepts into one example, obfuscating the topic at hand). 
<br />
<br />//Also annoying are explanations 
<br />//commented out in code samples  
<br />//instead of beside the code in
<br />//callout boxes. This makes all
<br />//the scripts four times as long
<br />//as they need to be, and much
<br />//harder to read.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, the author does do a good job dividing the content onto fundamental OOP concepts, and includes a usefule appendix covering methods and events of all the classes (noting the errors in Macromedia's own documentation).
<br />
<br />For someone without any programming experience outside of ActionScripting (like myself), this book is challenging to plod through, but doable. But learning ActionScripting is like learning to practice law (instead of learning every statute on the books, lawyers focus on legal prcedents, and research their own issues). That's what this book is like: a primer on advanced ActionScript "precedents". After reading it, you'll have a better general understanding of how solutions can be implemented, but you'll still need to visit the Flash Developer Center and the HELP panel to make applications that really work.</span>

                    <span>-This book provides a great introduction to OOP concepts, design patterns, coding styles and other techniques that are vital in producing quality applications.  
<br />
<br />-This book will be used mostly as a learning tool, and not so much as a reference tool.  
<br />
<br />-I am working on developing some applications but nothing too complex at the moment.  If you are looking for a book to develop simple applications, or just a want a reference guide to flashMX objects and components DONT buy this book.  But, if you are however developing more complex applications that need to be upscaled later, are connected to external datasources etc BUY this book.  It will give you examples of best practices and ways of solving your application development questions.  Another plus comes in the fact that it is based on ActionScript 2.0, so you will be coding with the most up to date, highest performance and capability available today.</span>

<br />
<br />It's the blockbuster followup to his action packed Actionscript for Flash MX The Definitive guide and it just getting crazy as I read it. Now variables HAVE to be declared. It's like a fascism that these variables have to declare what type they are before anyone can interact with them. I picture them scurrying around the system architecture as if it were post-War Prague, carrying their papers just trying to get to their destinations. But there's more! There are ways around variable declaration, that fool the system into thinking one variable type is quite another and doing this brings about _system instability_. Yes, the revolution is on as some variable sneak through the system passing themselves off as others and then throwing a monkeywrench into the works. This is edge of your seat intrigue as only the Master, Colin Moock, can bring to the table.</span>

                    <span>Colin Moock is extremely talented in all areas of Flash, and object oriented programming. 
<br />
<br />In general, this is book has very good ceverage of actionscript best practices, when implementing an application that uses the AS2.0 class framework.  That is what gets the 3 stars.  Now the missing part.  I include myself in the 99.9% of all Flash MX 2004 developers that are building Rich Internet Applications.  Rich Internet Applications need to connect to and update data, whether using Flash Remoting, Web Services, or both.  This book gives no coverage to data connectivity using the runtime Actionscript 2.0 classes.  Although you can accomplish this in the authoring environment, this has a negative effect on  runtime performance, as well as not adhearing to the MVC design approach that object oriented programming promotes.  There are currently no books that cover the data connectivity classes in AS2.0, a fact I find to be truely unbelievable.  </span>
