                    <span>This book is pretty good. I was surprised to see a few bad reviews for something which seems to hold good amount of merit, especially in comparison to most. Of course, it's not Ulysses, or even Burroughs's best. It's simply good.<p>Exterminator!, The Colonel Issues DE, Cold Lost Marbles, and The Perfect Servant have been my favorite passages since I first read it. The book is hilarious if you can manage to analytically wipe the opaque layer of genius-dirt from the neglected window obscuring Burroughs's warm, cozy, funny soul.</span>

                    <span>The back cover of William S. Burroughs' "Exterminator!" describes the book as an "experimental novel." Because of the book's fragmented, mosaic-like structure, I think you could also describe it as a collection of experimental prose fragments. It's a blend of science fiction, political satire, and linguistic theory, punctuated by violence and gay sex. Burroughs sometimes uses language that mirrors cinematic techniques.<p>If there's a plot in here, it eluded me. Along the way the reader will encounter a secret agent, a pest exterminator, Scientology, the queen of England, and John Genet. "Exterminator!" is often outrageous and absurd; it feels at times like Burroughs is just writing to amuse himself.</span>

                    <span>This was the first book by WSB that I ever read.  I think this was a case of trial by fire, because numerous people I've spoken to found this book impossible to read.  Many of the scenes are hilarious and all are memorable.  The book within the book within the book... the 1968 democratic convention... the mexican pistolero in the brilliant "Twighlight's Last Gleaming"... Fu Man Chu... This book is a nexus point, threads running through all the other burroughs novels pass through here at some point.<p>I can't recommend this book enough, but read Naked Lunch or The Wild Boys first, they are easier gate-ways into the wierdness of Burroughs.</span>

                    <span>EXTERMINATOR! A NOVEL is without any question my favorite William S. Burroughs book. The "A Novel" of the title must surely be ironic, because the book is not in any recognizable sense a novel. It is a collection of largely unconnected sketches and scenes. Not every section is a masterpiece, but several are among the most surreal and brilliant things that Burroughs ever wrote. And for anyone who has not previously read any Burroughs, it is a brilliant introduction.  I personally find it far more accessible and enjoyable than NAKED LUNCH, which, while it has many fine passages, nonetheless can at times become tedious.<p>Although by and large the various parts are unconnected, several are focused on the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. In particular, the amazingly creative and hysterically funny "The Coming of the Purple Better One" takes that as its locale. The "Purple Better One" of the title refers to a baboon that is placed upon the convention podium, and upon whose face is superimposed the face of a white Southern, racist politician, whose recorded speech is then played. It is one of the more bizarre, brilliant, and absurd scenes in recent American literature. Another favorite is "The Discipline of DE," the DE standing for "Do Easy." The story is a strange blend of Zen Buddhist tract and self-help manifestation. Other favorites include the title story, with the narrator/exterminator repeating ominously "You want the service?" and a supposed film treatment "Twilight's Last Gleamings." <p>The collection features many of the themes usually associated with Burroughs: Sci-fi, fantasy, drugs, usual medical practices and phenomena, governmental nefariousness, and the corruption of capitalistic life.</span>

                    <span>...and in the case of "Exterminator!" that's not a good thing.  Granted, this sloppy collection of short stories stitched together as a novel will appeal to fans of the author's fragmented, "Naked Lunch" style (run-on sentences, nonsensical incidents, etc.)... but will likely turn anyone else off.  The first hundred pages, especially, consist of some of the most alienated, distant, and boring prose I've ever read.  For the rest of the novel, however, there are poignant and poetic passages relating to politics, the Vietnam war, and racial and sexual discrimination, among other things, so "Exterminator!" isn't entirely worthless, but it's a far cry from Burroughs' best work.</span>
