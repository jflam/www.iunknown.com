                <span id="Label1">Before Everest, there was Annapurna. Maurice Herzog led an expedition of French climbers to the summit of this 26,000-foot Himalayan peak in 1950. At the time of the assault, it was the highest mountain ever climbed, a remarkable feat in itself made all the more remarkable by the fact that it had never previously been charted. Herzog and his team not only had to climb the darn thing, they had to find the route. As riveting as the tale of the ascent remains nearly half a century later, the story of the descent through virtually unsurvivable--think avalanche and frostbite, for starters--conditions is unforgettable. Herzog's masterful account, finally back in print, is a monument of courage and spirit, an epic adventure excitingly told.  </span>

                    <span>First and foremost, the topic of the book is of historical significance in the world of climbing, so it's a "must read" if you are into that sort of thing.  If you aren't, it's still a great adventure read.  Well worth the time.  I'm glad I read it and would recommend it to people who enjoy outdoor adventures.
<br />
<br />The text itself is written well, flows nicely, and is generally an easy read.  I also found it to have a good balance between the characters emotions, the activity of the climb, and local color and flavor.
<br />
<br />Something I found interesting was the attitude of Herzog.  Granted, this was written in the 50's, but it was intersting to see his attitudes towards the local people.  He certainly had a "I'm better than you" attitude towards the local Porters and Sherpas.  He also displayed a lot of attitude towards other members of his expedition.  At one moment he would be very condescending and critical, then a few pages later he would be singing their praises.  
<br />
<br />I wish the book had a bigger glossary than it does.  I frequently found myself going to the glossary to look up the meaning of a word that was used, and didn't find it.  Here, I'm talking about "climbing lingo" and words and phrases that Herzog uses that are relative to the language of the locals in Tibet and India.  
<br />
<br />I also didn't care for the placement of the photographs.  They often didn't follow the text.  A picture could preceed or follow the pertinent text by 100 pages, which made for a lot of "page flipping".  It would be helpful to familiarize yourself with the photographs before reading the text, so that you know when to go back and find a specific photo.
<br />
<br />Outside of this book, I've learned that there is a lot of controversy over what "really" happened and Herzog's attitude and motivations.  If you read this book, keep in mind that this isn't necessarily what actually happened, but more of an account of what Herzog wanted you to know.  Take most of it with a grain of salt, and do some additional research to get the full picture. 
<br />
<br />Also, understand that this climb was a "first" at that height, and was using technologies and understanding of altitude at that time.  A reader with current climbing knowledge will often read a passage and think to himself "No Kidding, Dummy!", but we know that hindsight is 20/20.  Their accomplishment is all the more exciting knowing that things we know and understand today, were unknown to them... and don't forget, they didn't have the high tech equipment that todays climbers have.

                    <span>When my Mum bought a beaten early edition back from the Hospital Auxillary Store it sat on my shelf for about a year before I decided to take it up. I had read tons of mountaineering literature before that time and much since, but this book is one of the benchmarks against which all others are measured. It is simply one of the greatest adventure stories. It is also proof that truth is indeed stranger than fiction. <p>For those who are more familiar with all of the traditional British siege tactics used in the 50's, 60s and 70s will find French tactics and the general story familiar. What is different is the extended struggle for survival at altitude that is truly amazing. Having some mountaineering experience myself in extreme cold (though not at this altitude) I was constantly amazed by their ability to cheat death, just when you figure that they are all for the worms. Spending the night inside the crevasse is one of great fingernail biters of all time chapters. I am just left shaking my head that anyone could survive after a night without boots in extreme cold, at altitude --- and then attempt crawl off the mountain the next morning --- in stocking feet. <p>Of course they paid for it. Herzog himself supporating all over Nepal and Northern India, loosing digits and appendages for the glory of France. <p>This account is clearly colonial, sanitised in some points, and omits some of the fine climbing by other members of the group... so be it --- screw post-modernism, Jean Paul Sartre, and doubt. It is still one of the best ripping yarns in the mountaineering genre --- that modern climbers suffused with petty personal ego problems, the quest for personal gain and money could ever write so well --- that would be a miracle. Let the plain tales of the quest for rotten glory riegn. <p>Look for a worm eaten, faded copy. It will hold pride of place on your adventure shelf for many years to come.</span>

                    <span>Muarice Herzog's account of climbing for the first time of an 8,000 meter peak has its assured place among the classics in the climbing literature. The description of the harrowing descent and sibsequent medical treatments will surely leave a long lasting trace in every reader's memory! What one must remember is that equipment, techniques and psychological perspectives  were different in the immediate post-WW II era than they are today in the time of guided expeditions. In reading this book, one gets a real sense of the true challenges experienced by the climbers.<p>While the book does not fall short in telling the story, it fails to provide an unbiased picture of the expedition and it's role in French society at the time. First of all, Herzog, for all his qualities, clearly orchestrated media attention, so that he will come out as the hero (at the airport prior to departure he had all other climbers sign releases authorizing only him to give first-hand account of the expedition). The national fervor following the success largely overlooks the achievements of other expedition members, including Lanchenal, Terry and Rebuffat.<p>Similarly to the first successful Italian expedition on K2 (where Compagnoni, Lacedeli and Desio get the credit, while Walter Bonatti's role is overlooked), here too the truly outstanding climbers prove only through their subsequent deeds (see "Starlight and Storm" by Rebuffat or "Conquistadors of the Useless" by Terray)their far superior mountaineering qualities.<p>In spite of all this, Herzog's book is, in my opinion, a must read for climbing enthusiasts.</span>

                    <span>This is perhaps the most famous and long lasting book in mountaineering.  The account of how Herzog and Lachenal reached Annapurna's summit is the culmination of a long and difficult journey in which the team gets lost and found dozens of times. <p>I found most interesting to be the differences between an expedition in the 90s (such as described in Into Thin Air) and Herzog's expedition; it is hard to understand how they could ahve made it without the modern equipment, however they did pay the price through amputated limbs.  <p>This is a mountaineering classic, perhaps the best one, despite the recent questions as to the veracity of the team dynamics described by Herzog.  Herzog describes a team of selfless members that were working towards one common goal, to get one of them on the summit.  Question have arisen on whether such dynamics were not exaggerated.  Either way, it si a wonderful book to read, as Herzog takes us on a ride all the way to the summit and back.  Highly recommended for the armchair mountaineer.</span>
