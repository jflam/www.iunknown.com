                <span id="Label1">It looks like all that money NASA spent on the Hubble Space Telescope  was worth it after all--at least from an aesthetic standpoint.  <I>Stargaze: Hubble's View of the Universe</I> captivates the viewer with stunningly high-definition color images of galaxies, nebulae, and heavenly bodies closer to home. Each shot pans and lingers over the richly colored pictures as unobtrusive narration in English, French, German, or Spanish explains the history of the Hubble mission, its targets, and what we've learned so far. The music by 2002 is harmless and quiet, though viewers pathologically averse to New Age will scramble for the audio control. Including screensavers and Web features, <I>Stargaze</I> will keep spaceheads happy and entranced for hours, and convert the unbelievers. <I>--Rob Lightner</I></span>

                    <span>The DVD is fine for exactly what it is. The music is a matter of taste (just like, amazingly enough, all other music ever created) which I happened to quite enjoy. It is also apparent that several reviewers cannot be bothered to admit that they neither understand the word 'Nomenclature' nor do they grasp the concept of a dictionary. Finally (if you'll pardon the negativism, but it is necessary to refute several blatantly wrong reviews) it's obvious that they don't understand DVD defualts (hint, ALL movies default to the base audio/video track and you have to go manually change your options). <P>The DVD is a straight slideshow of many of the best Hubble images set to music. The format, narration, and options are exactly what I expected after reading the exterior of the DVD. The narration wanders in and out of the slides (it wanders out either to introduce new concepts or to expound on something that could use it) but overall is quite good.<P>What this DVD is NOT is a movie or in-depth educational tool. It is meant strictly as background entertainment or as a kibitzer's toy. It fills this niche extremely well and is an excellent introduction to space science for the uninitiated. Approach it the same way you do any functional art and you won't be dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased this DVD. I popped it in my DVD disk drive, and I was not dissapointed. The image quality is astonishingly crisp, and sharp. The colors are wonderful, and even the music (all by "2002") is a good match for images. I originally thought that the image quality would not be great because of all the pictures I have seen on the inernet, but none of them compare to the clarity of the images on this DVD. This dvd is also wired to the Internet somehow, although I have not tried this feature yet (supposedly you can go to www.stargazedvd.com and the dvd is interactive, to a certain degree). It also includes a screen saver, which I have not tried either, but I am assuming it uses images from the DVD.<P>Don't want to have music? Need more information? Just switch to any of the narration audio modes, and you get descriptions of what all the images you are looking at are.<P>The DVD also has a lot of different demos on it which are fun to watch.<P>If you like observing stars, nebulae, etc., then this is a good buy for you. If you are not into that type of stuff, well, it might put you to sleep...<P>Come to think of it, it is VERY relaxing, very serene, hmm.. I may go watch it right now!</span>

                    <span>This DVD is great! I expected less, but it was exactly what I was looking for! Just a bunch of great pictures and great music to go with them. The feature where you can turn on/off the audio narration and the subtitles is great! This way you can either learn a little about the pictures, or just relax. I liked it so much that I instantly bought Part 2! Good stuff!</span>

                    <span>With high expectations after watching various Discovery Channel shows, I rented this DVD to get the feel of traveling through space. Disappointed, I was when I began viewing this DVD. These are photographs that Hubble has taken that some took a camera to. The perspective is tight, so one does not understand what they are looking at nor is there any narrative. One picture after another, the camera panning the surface with a classical soundtrack. I have seen some of these pictures on www.space.com Unless you are a Cosmologist, you will most likely not find this appealing.</span>

                    <span>I expected the photos to be sharper and was hoping to hear more about what was being viewed. The DVD is strangely designed (for example, the default soundtrack mode is music only and it's not immediately obvious there is a narrated track).</span>
