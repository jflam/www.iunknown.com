                <span id="Label1"><p>The Web has developed its own set of rules and attitudes for writing hard-hitting marketing copy. Robert Bly's <i>The Online Copywriter's Handbook </i>is the first practical and authoritative guide to what exactly those rules are and how they differ from writing for print audiences. From novices just taking their first copywriting steps to veterans looking to add impact and results to their online efforts, it covers everything from general fundamentals of writing effective copy to specific Web copywriting tips and traps.</p>   </span>

                    <span>Hands down, veteran copywriter Bob Bly has written the best book I've found on how to write persuasive copy for the Web and the Internet. The sub-title "Everything You Need to Know to Write Electronic Copy That Sells" is not just a promotional blurb penned by his publisher - it's an accurate description. <P>Step by step, he covers the fundamentals of persuasive online copy, how to adapt print copy for the Web, how to illustrate Web copy with visuals, what makes an effective home page and how to structure the content of a site. Subsequent chapters focus on writing email promotional messages, email text ads and banner ads (yes, the good ones have words in them). A whole chapter is devoted to e-newsletters or e-zines: from designing and promoting one to what to write about.<P>The table of contents is detailed and well organized so you can jump around and read the sections out of order. I'm keeping this book within arm's reach!</span>

                    <span>As an established freelance copywriter, I'm getting more writing projects involving website copy. Companies want their websites to do more than just look good, they want them to SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. As in Elements of Copywriting and Secrets of a Freelance Writer, Bob Bly gives tips on online copywriting that you can grasp and use immediately. Chapters on web content as a marketing tool, internet direct mail, writing headlines that sell, and fundamentals of persuasive online copy all helped improve my writing, which translates into satisfied clients. I highly recommend this book, not only for professional writers, but for anyone who uses a website in their business. This book will help you GET RESULTS!</span>

                    <span>Every online business needs to understand how it can improve its appearance on the world wide web and Bly shows us how to do just that. This is a great book for small and home businesses who want to take their websites to the next level. And a great book for the beginning copywriter who wants to learn the ropes. My only regret is that it doesn't go as extensively into copywriting techniques as I had hoped.</span>

                    <span>Bob Bly is not a super exciting writer. He describes his own writing as down to earth. There are many gereral details and tips in this book, but if failed to grab me.<P>I have also read Net Words and Persuasive Online Copywriting. I would recommend either of those books over this, especially Persuasive Online Copywriting.<P>This book is a step in the right direction, I just think it was done better in the others.</span>
