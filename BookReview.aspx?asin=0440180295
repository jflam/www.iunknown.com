                <span id="Label1">Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden. <p>        Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, "There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters..." <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> (taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945. Like <i>Catch- 22</i>, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> boasts the same  imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy--and humor.</span>

                    <span>Kurt Vonnegut's
<br />SlaughterHouse-Five
<br />
<br />Slaughterhouse-Five is about a World War II veteran who is struggling to understand people, time, and what people think of time.  This books protagonist is Billy Pilgrim although Kurt Vonnegut wants the readers to know that he himself is part of the story.
<br />
<br />Billy Pilgrim has experienced many difficult and abnormal points in his life during and after the war.  He sees his life as a never ending timeline where he skips back and forth recounting events that made him feel a certain way.  Maybe, Vonnegut wants readers to know the feeling of emptiness and confusion that war veterans face or wants us to see life in a different way, a more happier way. Either that or Vonnegut wrote a really good anti-human/war book.  However, Vonnegut does begin the book with establishing that war on earth is inevitable. 
<br />
<br />The book starts out as Kurt Vonnegut's own account, he is in 1967 and is visiting the slaughterhouse where he was once held captive by German soldiers during World War II.  He's with a friend also from WWII.  Later, Billy Pilgrim is brought into the story and is said to be "unstuck in time", meaning Pilgrim has the ability to move from time period to time period.  For now he is in 1968 and has survived a plane crash... I think Vonnegut adds an 'alien' encounter in the story for us to further understand the timeline we live in and are not bound to.  Its always easier to explain how human life is when you look at it from the perspective of 'aliens'.  In the part where Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens, the aliens teach him how life is just many accounts of good and bad memories and people should pick out the good parts and enjoy them.  While recuperating from his plane crash, Billy's wife dies.  Billy becomes more and more obsessed with how he sees life differently and he begins to share it via the media.  His adult daughter begins to think that he's going insane.  Billy moves back and forth from when he was captured by German soldiers to post-war with his family.  In his memories of war he remembers himself feeling like 'The Three Musketeers' with his friends- this being an example of Vonnegut showing Billy only remembering the happier time in life.
<br />
<br />"So it goes"... I still have to finish the book even though I don't want to because I can't understand the point nor relate to it.
<br />All books need a point, Vonnegut goes back and forth.  'CHANGE the world' and 'changing the world is POINTLESS'.
<br />

<br />This review is in dedication to Mr. C and his fantastical job at teaching.

                    <span>This is the first Vonnegut book I read and I am quite eager to pick up another one.  The book focuses on the life of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man from the US midwest who is a soldier in WWII.  The defining moment in his life is his presence , as a prisioner of war, in Dresden during the allied firebombing that killed over 100,000 people.
<br />
<br />The novel has a matter-of-fact attitude towards terrible events, in a sense subscribing to the notion of fate being inevitable.  In a couple of different places it urges one to act on the things one can change, but then seems to say nothing can be changed.  Vonnegut blends in science fiction to get this point across, as Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens who can travel through time and see everything, but can change nothing.  What they do is choose to see only the good things in life.  
<br />
<br />There is also a deep comedic sense in it, though one is prevented from laughing by the sheer horror of the situations.  It is quite a different depiction of life, fate and war, a very innovative way of seeing the world.  This is definitely an interesting book, one that is clearly written from an experienced point of view (Vonnegut was himself in Dresden during the firebombing).  I highly recommend it, especially since it very short, one that could be read in a two to three hour flight.</span>

<br />This book is quite possibly the best I've ever read, and I've read a lot. The problem is that the book is very hard to explain because frankly, it's odd.
<br />
<br />This book is an anti-war novel that professes that it is not an anti-war novel. Written during the Vietnam War about World War Two, the book explores the atrocities of war without becoming maudlin. Vonnegut is wickedly poignant as he follows Billy Pilgrim, the main character, as be becomes "unstuck in time." 
<br />
<br />"Unstuck in time?!?" you say. Yes, the novel is not written in chronological order. It leaps around from time period to time period, and from planet to planet as well. But we'll leave some of that for you to discover. 
<br />
<br />This is not a difficult book to read. It reads like a light science fiction novel. But then, the issues it discusses are difficult. Vonnegut discusses war in a manner that gently disembowels, if you will. Like I said, it's hard to explain. Check it out. I think you'll agree that it's a "keeper." Another Amazon pick I'd quickly like to recommend is THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez, another short, fast and memorable read.

                    <span>This is a fantastic book, one of the best I have ever read (it is also by a considerable distance Vonnegut's best).
<br />
<br />As usual for Vonnegut the book is basically an exposition of his psyche. This time combining large themes WWII, the bombing of Dresden, inevitability, time travel and a non-linear existence to produce a truly compelling book.
<br />
<br />Some will dislike Vonnegut's idiosyncratic prose and his tendency towards flippancy. Personally, I find his prose engaging and entertaining - he is capable to conjuring up quite vivid imagery, and being funny and moving (often at the same time).
<br />
<br />This book contains a couple of my favourite moments - the wonderful image of the planes flying backwards over Dresden and restoring it (how I wish Martin Amis had never read it - maybe he wouldn't have written Time's Arrow) and the idea that he would keep returning to his favourite moment - sitting on the back of a hay wagon in Dresden.
<br />
<br />Read it!

                    </div>
                    <span>This was the most anti-human book that I've read since Gulliver's Travels. Vonnegut's cynicism and apathy are understandable considering the atrocities that he witnessed during the war, and I imagine writing the book was a cathartic experience for him, but other than that, there's not much to be gained from this novel. 
<br />
<br />Vonnegut's shell-shocked brain appears incapable of distinguishing between the Germans who were injecting dye into women's and children's eyes and rendering them into soap and candles and the Allied soldiers that sacrificed their lives trying to stop them. 
<br />
<br />His main points seem to be:
<br />1. War is stupid.
<br />2. People are stupid.
<br />3. Life is meaningless.
<br />4. There's nothing any of us can do about it.
<br />5. So, try not to think about the bad things in your life and just think happy thoughts.
<br />
<br />If this is your life's philosophy, you will also consider this a "brilliant" work. </span>
