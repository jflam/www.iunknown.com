                    <span>This book is for anyone. It does not force the Christian view on one if they just want to descover who the historical Jesus was.  On the other side of the coin, it will open the eyes of many Christians that only see Jesus from the Bible.  Cahill brings in the culture and history and weaves it with the narratives from the Bible.  By just knowing the stories from the Bible one only knows the Biblical Jesus.  But when Jesus is placed in his context one can learn more about who this man was.  Excellent Book!!</span>

                    <span>	Thomas Cahill, author of HOW THE IRISH SAVED CIVILIZATION and THE GIFTS OF THE JEWS, offers and inspiring exploration of Jesus Christ and his impact upon the world for these past two thousand years.  He examines Jesus' life within the context of the social, political and economic structures of the day, painting a detailed picture of Christ that is scripturally accurate, at once fully divine and fully human.
<br />
<br />	This multilayered portrait reveals Jesus as carpenter, son, teacher, friend, healer, leader, prophet, messiah and ultimately Word made flesh.  Beyond this, offers the Jesus of today - the central figure of history whose Gospel message of love, compassion and peach has brought (despite the frailties of his followers) salvation to the world.
<br />
<br />	Unlike many books of piety, DESIRE OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS, also stands as an engaging historical narrative: well-crafted, structured yet flowing, and passionate with attention to both scriptural integrity and historical detail.  Mr. Cahill's third entry in his HINGES OF HISTORY series is one that can be read with pleasure and contemplation.  It is a fine work deserving of time and attention.</span>

                    <span>I am glad I didn't buy the book - I borrowed it.  Cahill is in over his head.  For example, he states that Jesus taught us to be kind and love one another and for this he lost his life.  Earth to Cahill - Jesus lost his life because he said he was the "one who was to come" in response to the High Priest's question regarding his identity. By this he meant that he was the Messiah.   Had he said "no" he would have walked out a free man.  This is just one misrepresentation. Another is his discussion on "looking at women lustfully" - Cahill totally misses the point.  Jesus'  immense influence on history is an excellent topic and if you are interested buy Kennedy's "What if Jesus had never been born".  Don't waste your money on this book.

                    <span>The most wonderful aspect of this great book is that Cahill invites the reader to explore further with other writers who have been more 'scholarly' about this topic, in particular Raymond E. Brown's work on the New Testament.  Additionally, Mr. Cahill is a terrific wordsmith.  He knows how to engage you, move you, help you understand.  His analysis of the four gospels and their particular distinctions are very well done.  One can appreciate the differences between Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John without getting hysterical about their inconsistencies.  He addresses the tough questions of Christianity and does a nice, even handed job.  There is nothing offensive about this book at all, regardless of your denomination.  In particular, the section concerning the Apostle Paul and his life as a spreader of the "Good News" is inspiring and helps one understand the political and religious atmosphere of the first century A.D.  For that alone, this book is worth reading.  </span>

                    <span>Thomas Cahill is attempting something very difficult here.  He is trying to tell the story of the person about whom everyone else has already told the story.  He is trying to stand in the cataract of Jesus scholarship and grab out a few choice coins (not rocks), without getting drenched by a spray of technical verbiage.  He is trying to write a biography that is chatty and colloquial, but also based on clear reasoning and sound scholarship.  He is trying to write in a fair-minded manner about someone everyone either loves or claims to like in a deconstructionist manner that, finally, amounts to something resembling fear.  <p>I have read quite a few similar attempts by non-scholars, or by scholars on Sunday afternoons, to do something like this, and I feel this one comes off pretty well.  Probably the closest comparisons might be A. N. Wilson's skeptical Jesus, A Life (inferior), or Philip Yancey's mushy-evangelical The Jesus I Never Knew (not bad).   <p>As you can see from reviews below, Cahill manages to offend a lot of Christians and secularists.  Considering all the chances he is taking, both with style and substance, one might call that an accomplishment.  <p>My advice would be to read a chapter before deciding if this is your style, if possible.  I almost always found his arguments reasonable and informed, and I have read a lot of these books, on all sides.  For me, the fact that he has literary pizzazz, and is not afraid to make a joke, maybe even a pun, does not hurt.  This is not a book written by a robot.  Cahill treats the text with the respect of relating it to the world of our experience, even if he is sometimes a tad groanish in doing so.  Furthermore, while not a scholar, Cahill relies on a few fairly reasonable ones -- no, that does not include anyone in the Jesus Seminar, but unfornately, neither does it include N. T. Wright, in my view the best -- and he brings a fair amount of ecclectic background knowledge to the texts.  (I was shocked to find him referring to the Chinese philosopher Yuan Zhiming, for example, who I thought was my secret.)<p>If some disrespectful comment here on John or another Gospel bothers you, try Craig Blomberg's Historical Reliability of the Gospels.  If you ae attracted to the subtitle, "The World Before and After Jesus," but find too little about Jesus' impact on history, I might recommend Christianity on Trial, the fascinating works of Vishal Mangalwadi, or the relevent chapter of my own Jesus and the Religions of Man.  If you're offended by Cahill because he makes bad jokes, I can't help you there.  But I think he is ultimately serious about Jesus, and I'm with him there.  <p>David Marshall / christthetao@msn.com</span>
