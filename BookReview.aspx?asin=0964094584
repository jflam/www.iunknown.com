                    <span>I thought this was a good reference for someone interested in starting a software company, but with no previous background. It is written in a simple style, and touches on everything. I had found much of the information in other places, but it is very good to have it all bound together in one place.<P>I have one, major complaint. Every other page of the book, it seems, refers to forms, contact information, or further topical information that is on the companion CD. The CD does NOT come with the book, however. If you call the number listed on the back page, you will find that it is available for $29.95.<P>It is frustrating to be constantly reminded in the text that you do not have much of the available information in hand, but could if you spend another $30. It's a nice piece of marketing by the author, I guess, but it has damaged his credibility with me. I won't purchase other books by him in the future.</span>

                    <span>After 15 years doing software development for others, I had been thinking about going out on my own, and this book was exactly what I needed to get started. One of the reasons I particularly liked it was that it isn't too theoretical. The author gives specific instructions and ideas on how to actually set up your business, turn your software into an actual products, and--most importantly--get your software sold. If you're starting a software business, or just thinking or dreaming about it, I would definitely get this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book is a good common-sense guide to starting a software company. It is clearly written and contains some good information and advice. The book, however, is a little rough around the edges.<P>Although many software companies have moved away from creating a printed manual, the author (wisely) recommends bucking that trend and creating one. Another good piece of advice offered is to keep the first version (1.0) as simple as possible.<P>The physical condition of my copy of the book could be better. The print quality is poor, and some of the pages lean to one side.<P>Also, there are several references to a CD. For example, "A copy of this form is included in the Start Your Own Company CD-ROM". <P>But when I flipped to the back of the book, I did not find a CD, but instead found a page that said "to order a copy of the Start Your Own Software Company CD-ROM, call 1-800..." I was really surprised by that. I have never seen that in a book before. To make matters worse, when I called the 800 number and punched in the extension that the book listed, it was not a valid extension.</span>
