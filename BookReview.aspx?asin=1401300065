                <span id="Label1"><b>A hilarious look at what life was <i>really</i> like inside <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.</b>  <P><b>A dishy and often surprising memoir of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> by former cast member Jay Mohr.</b>  <P>When 21-year-old Jay Mohr moved from New Jersey to New York City to pursue his dream of stand-up stardom, he never thought the first real job he'd land would be on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. But, surprisingly, that's just what he did. What followed were two unbelievable, grueling, and exciting years of feverishly keeping pace with his talented cohorts, outmaneuvering the notorious vices that claimed the lives of other cast members, and struggling at all costs for the holy grail of late-night show business: airtime.  <P>In <i>Gasping for Airtime</i>, Jay offers an intimate account of the inner workings of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. He also dishes on the guest hosts (John Travolta, Shannen Doherty, Charles Barkley), the musical guests (Kurt Cobain, Steven Tyler, Eric Clapton), and of course his <i>SNL</i> castmates (Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Mike Myers, and David Spade). Refreshingly honest and laugh-out-loud funny, this book will appeal both to fans of Jay Mohr and to devotees of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.  <P><b>In a truly inside story of this counterculture institution, you get the scoop on:</b>  <P><b>Makeup</b><br> --Jeff Daniels has part of his face ripped off when his prosthetic is superglued to his cheeks.  <P><b>Working with Roseanne Barr</b><br> --Roseanne Barr refuses to stop burping during a writers' meeting.  <P><b>Humoring the Hosts</b><br> --John Travolta pitches the cast a few of his ideas for sketches -- such as playing a private detective who is a Hasidic Jew.  <P><b>Shootin' the Bull</b><br> --Adam Sandler tells the story of when Mr. Belvedere sat on his balls.  <P><b>Panic</b><br> --Jay has a panic attack and runs 40 blocks home -- in the middle of a show.  <P><b>Rock Star Vanity</b><br> --Steven Tyler carries a woman's makeup mirror in his belt to check his look after each song, while TLC arrives with an entourage of 40 people, including one person whose job is to constantly adjust the knots on the sweatshirts tied around their waists.  <P><b>Food for Thought</b><br> --Rob Schneider uses a jeweler's loupe to examine his sushi for worms; Norm MacDonald relates his bout with food poisoning from a suspicious avocado; and Jay and Michael McKean projectile vomit corn chowder that doubles as fake puke.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I never knew that Jay Mohr, the host of NBC's "The Last Comic Standing" was a performer on Saturday Night Live until I read this book. I had seen him play a jerk sports agent in the movie "Jerry McGuire" and I've also heard him on the Jim Rome Show, however.<P>This is an interesting read (a good but not great book) about the challenges he faced as a struggling comedian and writer trying to make it on Saturday Night Live. What is most interesting are the inside stories about other performers like Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Chris Farley, Norm McDonald, Mike Myers, and Phil Hartman. There are also some funny things about some of the guest hosts like Marisa Tomei, Rosanne Barr, Eric Clapton, and Christopher Walken to name a few.<P>What I never would have guessed is that Jay suffers from severe panic attacks. He has always seemed to be so totally in control of things and it makes him seem like a much more real person. To see how well he's done since the Saturday Night Live gig is a true success story.<P>For people who enjoy "The Last Comic Standing" or are "Jungle clones" from the Jim Rome Show, I think that you'll like this book and come away with a new found respect for this brilliant and dedicated entertainer.<P>Great job JJ!</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic read!<P>Jay Mohr, as we all know, is a comedy god and this book is if anything too short. I wish (and hope) Jay writes a follow up to this book on the rest of career so far... O&A, Action, the movies he made etc.. He must have more stories.<P>It's written in a very loose conversational style.. You feel like Jay is just sitting down talking to you and man you cannot put it down. <P>If you are at all interested in SNL, Jay Mohr or panic disorders get this book. It's VERY funny.<P>The thing that's so disturbing about SNL is how insane the week is before the show. They have this ridiculous self imposed BS deadlines that seem to hamper creativity and increase tension. Maybe that's the way Lorne wants it? <P>Jay has some GREAT stories about Chris Farley.. Al Franken's temper and the other cast members at the time (like Sandler). There is this great story about him and the whole cast, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger that is all at once scary, tense and funny.<P>Jay you are the man!.. and this book leaves me wanting more.<P>Great read!</span>

                    <span>With elements of "Dry" (Augusten Burroughs) and "My Fractured Life" (Rikki Travolta), "Gasping for Airtime" is a quirky disection of a small fraction of the lesser known years of a now known entertainer. If you like this nitch type writing, it's a good one.</span>

                    <span>Captivating look at show biz through the eyes of a successful actor back when he wasn't. In many ways very similar to Travolta's My Fractured Life although much more New York flavored. An excellent choice.</span>
