                    <span>As a engineer who uses many applications in his work, it was an exciting experience to read about those indivuduals who developed the codes that resulted in these applications. It's amazing how much development occurred in such a relatively short period of time (less than 50 years) and there are so many new innovative codes to look forward to. I was excited enough when I completed this book to purchase (from Amazon naturally) Bjarne Stroustrup's "The Design and Evolution of C++." Three cheers for Steve Lohr for "GO TO." </span>

                    <span>The writer, a NY Times technology correspondent, provides a 250-page chronology of computer operating systems and software languages from the early post-WWII years until 2001. A few important applications such as VisiCalc and Word are also covered. Brief mention is made of hardware trends that created the environment for software engineering.
<br />
<br />This is a "people" book. Brief biographical sketches of the key players are followed by a description of the most basic characteristics of each software item and a brief chronology of its emergence into the marketplace. There is little in the way of analysis and little personal opinion.
<br />
<br />The book reads like a long Britannica article and is a suitable overview and reference for serious students of technology but more than a little boring for the general reader.
<br />
<br />I was surprised that Gary Kildall only received half of one sentence. His Digital Research Company and its early microcomputer operating system, CP/M, was an early business success. A variant of CP/M, Seattle Computer Products 86-DOS, was the backbone of Gates' DOS for the IBM PC.

                    <span>I haven't read this book cover to cover. But, I have been flipping through a few of its pages and have been jumping in and reading what seems interesting at the moment.
<br />
<br />Overall, the book is quite well written. The stories are engaging. Some editing would help. Is the history correct? I don't know! Is the book enjoyable? Definitely! It's my favorite bed-time stories!! ;-) Fun to read. Very non-technical. So even your mom (assuming she's non-techie) can also read it and be amazed as how the software industry (mostly the languages part of the industry) has progressed over the years.

                    <span>This book could have been better edited and better organized, but it is still worth reading.  "GO TO" (which probably should have been called "goto" or "GOTO") covers the history of computing, touching on several of the famous legends.  It even tells of the work some of them did pryor to becoming legends.  All computer scientists, computer engineers, and sys-admins should have a good understanding of the history of computing and this book is a good place to get it.  This book should prove informative and enjoyable to any one else, especially people interested in history.</span>

                    <span>This book ranks among the best in the history of technology and one of the few that specifically addresses software.  Most other histories of technology or computing center on hardware, with some even focusing on a single computer such as the Eniac, the Difference Engine or Apple.  But recognize that hardware commoditizes over time, while good software largely holds its value.  Software creates fortunes but also deeply felt-opinions about quality, and as Lohr demonstrates, a constant stream of innovation.  The book showcases the creators of breakthrough operating systems and applications, and makes clear their contributions to the rise of the computer industry.  It is worthwhile for readers following technology, business, current events and even law and philosophy- the concepts have indeed become major disruptions in the history of ideas.</span>
