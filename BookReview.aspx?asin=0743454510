                <span id="Label1"><P> <B>Do we love across time? Or in spite of it?</B> <P> A developer has slated an ancient Abenaki Indian burial ground for a strip mall, and now strange happenings have the inhabitants of tiny Comtosook, Vermont, talking of supernatural forces at work. Ross Wakeman is a ghost hunter who's never seen a ghost -- all he's searching for is something to end the pain of losing his fianc&#233;e, Aimee, in a car accident. He tried suicide -- any number of times. Now Ross lives only for a way to connect with Aimee from beyond. Searching the site for signs of the paranormal, Ross meets the mysterious Lia, who sparks him to life for the first time in years. But the discoveries that await Ross are beyond anything he could dream of in this world -- or the next.</span>

                    <span>"Second Glance" is one of those books that, although minimally intriguing and ultimately standard upon first inspection, is actually an extremely well constructed, well written novel that will leave any book lover breathless with appreciation and admiration. <P> The book picks up steam quickly, introducing many characters in a short amount of time and then spends the rest of the book fleshing out those characters and tying them together. Without giving anything away, "Second Glance" is a ghost story set in the present, a portrait of horrifying historial truth set in the 1920s, and a truly unique character study that successfully brings the reader to fully know and understand the dozen or so characters introduced along the way.<P> Author Jodi Picoult should not only be praised for her polished prose and an admirably complex plot, but for shedding light on shocking facts from our country's history and taking a stance on modern-day medical practices without being overly preachy.<P> This review may sound jumbled and not coherent, but that is how the book often feels. In the end, though, it all comes together wonderfully. Read this novel if you like old-fashioned ghost stories / mysteries, historial fiction, or in depth character studies with supernatural plot twists along for the ride. The book isn't short by any means, and it doesn't feel short. The information could easily have been given (by a lesser author) in a smaller amount of pages, but the added length results in the more fully-developed characters. This novel isn't a thriller (although it contains thrills) and its supernatural premise may attract horror fans, but its really just a supernatural love story. Find your cheap thrills elsewhere. This is a much deeper, complex, and heartfelt drama about love and the ghosts that are created out of it.</span>

                    <span>I've read and enjoyed all of Jodi Picoult's books and I must say, this is one of her finest. <P>Historical fiction based on fact, moving from present to past and back again; quirky, likeable characters; elements of magical realism (reminiscent of Alice Hoffman); and the serious and controversial topics of genocide and genetic selection, are all seamlessly woven into this story about love and second chances.<P>Unlike several of her previous novels, Second Glance does not include courtroom drama, but Picoult fans will enjoy her usual plot twists and signature "wow" ending. And as expected, readers will find themselves thinking and questioning their views long after they've turned the last page.<P>Highly recommended for book discussion groups.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and I really enjoyed the way the author fleshes out each character. I do not agree with some of the comments that the structure of the story is too confusing or that the author jumps around too much. Just the opposite, I found that the way the story jumps from character to character was one of the things that kept me on my toes, and helped to tie the characters together throughout the book. This is the first book by Jodi Picoult I have read, but I will definitely be getting more.</span>

                    <span>Being a huge fan of Jodi Picoult, I give this book 3/5 stars. It took me about 200 pages into it until it got fairly exciting. This was probably one of my least favorite of her books - alot of her books I will go back and read a second time, however this will not be one of them. It was still entertaining enough to want to finish it to see how it ended.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Having read many of Jodi Picoult's books, I have to say that this book was a step outside the box for her. When I was in the first chapters of the book, I felt that I did not know if Ross was suffering from unresolved grief or undying love. I certainly felt for him and his loss of Aimee, but I do not know if he was mistaking grief for his love that crossed the boundaries between this world and the next. The final plot, twisting as it was, did not give the finale that I had hoped. I have to say that I have enjoyed Ms. Picoult's other novels much more than this one.</span>
