                <span id="Label1">It is always night in the city of Ember. But there is no moon, no stars. The only light during the regular twelve hours of "day" comes from floodlamps that cast a yellowish glow over the streets of the city. Beyond are the pitch-black Unknown Regions, which no one has ever explored because an understanding of fire and electricity has been lost, and with it the idea of a Moveable Light. "Besides," they tell each other, "there is nowhere but here" Among the many other things the people of Ember have forgotten is their past and a direction for their future. For 250 years they have lived pleasantly, because there has been plenty of everything in the vast storerooms. But now there are more and more empty shelves--and more and more times when the lights flicker and go out, leaving them in terrifying blackness for long minutes. What will happen when the generator finally fails?<p>  Twelve-year-old Doon Harrow and Lina Mayfleet seem to be the only people who are worried. They have just been assigned their life jobs--Lina as a messenger, which leads her to knowledge of some unsettling secrets, and Doon as a Pipeworker, repairing the plumbing in the tunnels under the city where a river roars through the darkness. But when Lina finds a very old paper with enigmatic "Instructions for Egress," they use the advantages of their jobs to begin to puzzle out the frightening and dangerous way to the city of light of which Lina has dreamed. As they set out on their mission, the haunting setting and breathless action of this stunning first novel will have teens clamoring for a sequel. (Ages 10 to 14) <I>--Patty Campbell</I></span>

                    <span>"The City of Ember" is - pardon me - a shining read. Jeanne DuPrau's talent at making the words come alive is unique and deciptively simple, an incredible patchwork of words and stories and unbelieveable ideas. DuPrau paints the picture of a dark city, lit only by the faulty, failing lights, which are in turn powered by a generator. The two main characters of the story, Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, are quite the oppitisites, but they attract once the story gets rolling. Both are determined to save Ember from the encroaching darkness that threatans to surround them if the power goes out forever, but their honest efforts are thwarted by a greedy mayor and his henchmen. "The City of Ember" could not be perfect, as it already is. The concept of the black city gives you the chills and the thrills, and you can't put it down: I read it in half a day. The sequel is said to be coming out in May 2004; as I write this it is April 30th. I cannot breathe with anticipation: "The People of Sparks," "City of Ember"s sequel, shall certianly hold my attention for a day: for that's as long as it'll take me to read it.</span>

                    <span>The city of Ember is in trouble, but the complacent citizens seem to ignore the food shortages and frequent blackouts. The Builders, when they created the city some 241 years ago, made provisions for its citizens in the form of a note called "The Instructions." Unfortunately, The Instructions were not handed down through the generations as they were supposed to be, and suddenly 12-year old Lina, a city Messenger, has discovered them. After trying to tell her friends and even the Mayor about the discovery of the partially destroyed Instructions, Lina turns to a one-time school friend, Doon, a worker in the underground Pipeworks, whom she believes will understand their importance. But what can two children do with such important information, and who would even believe them?<P>The City of Ember is a clever novel which tells the unique story of two unintentional heroes who fight the status quo in order to bring hope to their city. The descriptions of the world of Ember are fascinating, leaving the reader to appreciate the incredible imagination of first-time novelist Jeanne DuPrau. The narrator thoughtfully informs us of the setting-the unusual and self-contained world of Ember-slowly throughout the novel, and not all at once in the first chapter. It's only in chapter 8 that we even realize that there are no animals in Ember and the words "heaven" and "boat" have no known meaning. The characters are outstandingly original yet touchingly familiar in their pre-pubescent views of the adult world. The deaths of Lina's parents and then custodial grandmother create a sympathy for her that causes us to, all the more, wish for her triumph. It is the curiosity of Lina and Doon that drive this narrative, and it is the nice balance between primary and secondary characters that keeps the reader on his/her toes. While we expect a happy ending, it's not until the final pages of the novel that we understand what has happened and why. And, as always, we forgive a good author for the blatant suggestions of a sequel.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book was really good. COmpared to other books i've read its not superb but i am comparing it to some really good books. I think if you like books like The Thief Lord and The bartimeus Triligy: The Amulet of Samarkand then you will enjoy this book. It's a good book to take on Vacation and have a quick read. I'd truly recommend this book to people who enjoy that short and sweet read!</span>

                    <span>My 10-year-old granddaughter and I read this book together -- she for her summer reading list and I, well, I read all her books. We both found the book to be enjoyable.<P>One thing that pleased my granddaughter was the fact that the heroes were only 2 years older than she. I liked the alternating point of view between Doon and Lina, giving us an overview of events happening in two places at the same time.<P>Trying to decipher the clues in the Instructions was an added pleasure, as I enjoy word and logic puzzles.<P>We both look forward to more of Ms. DuPrau's work and hope she continues to write well into the future.</span>

                    <span>My general view of this book is that its author is trying to be the next Philip Pullman. Just as Eragon is trying to be the new Tolkien and Ardagh's books are trying to be the new Series of Unfortunate Events. However, the His Dark Materials trilogy is amazing. Expertly written with excellent flow and character development. The same cannot be said for this. I have to say that I'm disappointed not to have liked it. The original idea seemed engaging. The actual book however, was not.</span>
