                    <span>This is one of the the best .NET books I have in my collection.  The book is well orginized and easy to read.  The concepts are mixed so it is great for a beginner or some one looking for a fresh look on something they already do.  I will recommend it to any ASP.NET programmer!</span>

                    <span>I've been playing around with ASP.NET for a while now and have always been intimidated by the DataGrid.  I don't know why, I just was.  I've had this book for a while and finally picked it up to read it.  I'm about 3/4 of the way through and have already created my first application and used a DataGrid and a Repeater.  Without the book, I'd still probably be hand-hacking at this.  Great job, Scott!</span>

                    <span>Mr. Scott Mitchell's book: Asp.net Data Web Controls Kick Start is an excellent book to get the novice of Asp.net Data Web Controls up and running quickly. I had a probelem, emailed him, and he immediately responded with the solution to my problem. I was truely grateful to Mr. Mitchell. Using stored procedures in SQL Server and retreiving only the needed redcords via a stored procedure "chapter 8", proved to be indispensable.
<br />
<br />I was able to easily understand his code and apply his techniques and methods to my projects (I'm still a student). Even my classmates were amazed of my understanding of the asp.net DataGrid features. So I simply recommended Asp.net Data Web Controls Kick Start as the book to use to grasp the pertinent information needed to succeed and think.
<br />
<br />As a beginner in ASP.Net, I truely and honestly recommend this book as your Kick Start and reference to the DataGrid, DataList and the Repeater. The step-by-step hands-on examples makes this book also a great tutorial. The programming language was great (VB) and I'm sure a person that is familiar with C# will not be imtimidated with the VB.net code.  The book also offers more information on the topics by offering online resources. Thank You Mr. Scott Mitchell
<br />
<br />Buy this book and you will not be disapointed.
<br />Sincerely and honestly</span>

I used DataGrids to add, edit and delete all of the apps SQL Tables. His examples in regard to this were extremely helpful. <p>Thanks Scott.<p>I recommend this book highly!</span>
