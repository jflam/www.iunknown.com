                    <span>This is a great coffee table book, I very much enjoy looking through it (being a vintage photography/Hollywood fan myself), but I have to say, I was most dissapointed when I didn't come across some of my fav. stars.<P>Such as:<BR>-Sinatra<BR>-Marilyn<BR>-Audrey<P>So if your a fan of them, don't get this book. ^_~ <P>Otherwise, it is a good book to have, if you like Vintage Hollywood, or just looking at the glam portraits of the past.</span>

                    <span>Where to start? This is almost a wordless book filled with 145 glamour shots from the "Golden Age" of Hollywood. I would say that the book is a work of "art" and contains the work of many masters of still photography of the era. Some of the photos are truly stunning an deserve to be shown in the top Museums in world. The book uses high quality, acid-free paper and strong binding that enhances the book as a collectable. It would make a nice piece to anyone's collection of art books and you will page through it every so often. The reason that I did not give the book a higher rating is because it is quite short, it's a paperback and does contain many average works (in my opinion). <P>My personal favs were: Carole Lombard, Jean Harlow and Louise Brooks.<P>thank you for your time, David</span>

                    <span>Here is a beautiful book with some breathtaking photos of some the hottest Hollywood film stars of the golden era. The quality of the first and oldest photos are not the best, but one can see an improvement as the years go by. What makes these photos so special are the talented actors who can portray just about any emotion the photographer calls for and his ability to capture it on film. The best ones at this is Joan Crawford and Marlene Dietrich.<P>My favorite is one of Catrole Lombard on page 40. It will knock your socks off. I too wish these books came in hardcover, but then it wouldn't be as affordable. A wonderful addition to your library and for anyone who loves the old movie stars.</span>
