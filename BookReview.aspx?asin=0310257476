                    <span>This attempt at inter-faith dialog is not the Gospel of Jesus Christ proclaimed by the apostles even at the risk of death. It is a jumbled, garbled quasi-spiritual gobbledygook that appeals only to those not receptive any longer to Christ crucified, risen, ascended, returning as Judge offering repentance and remission of sins for right standing's reconciled relations with One Who is angry at renegade sinners dear to Him unless and until they turn away from falsegods and embrace the True God & his Son Jesus only and fully once for all.
<br />
<br />Think otherwise? Check out the messages recorded by Acts given by Peter & Paul. Compare to the material you read here.
<br />
<br />It's like South calling itself True North! It's comparable to Disingenuous Orthodontics without the retainer. Teeth seem realigned for a while, but soon gravitate back to even worse crookedness. Meanwhile you're out a substantial sum and your mouth is sore for nothing. Surely there are more reliable practitioners to get things straightened out than we have here!  </span>

                    <span>I will be more generous to Brian McLaren's book then many of his reviewers, who seem to be missing his point.  If we understand his work as an emerging book that is part of an emerging movement within the evangelical fold then we can better appreciate it for what it is- an invitation to dialogue. The presentation is a little sketchy. I would have appreciated a more in depth discussion at every point, but then that would be an entirely different book.  The print is small and the book lay out makes it a little unappealing to read.  For anyone interested in evangelicalism and its response to the modern world, this book is for you.     
<br />
<br />In terms of presenting the gospel in the post modern context our evangelical Christianity is starting to fall on deaf ears.  It has become frightened, defensive, and stuck in the context of a rigid response to a modernism that is vanishing.  The ground is likewise shifting under the mainline churches in their response to modernism.  McLaren is fleshing out a different way of viewing some of the polarities that exist between liberal/conservative, church/world, and the individual/community.  
<br />
<br />His book is like fresh water flowing into a stagnant pond.  He discuses most of the issues that people find troubling in evangelicalism and is asking for an open dialogue with all Christian groups, atheists and people of other faiths. If you are an evangelical, and theologically inclined you will be very familiar with the issues he raises.  He does not spend much time sharing the comparative advantage of his approach.  Since his focus is missional, I suspect he believes this approach is the best and most natural way to bring the Gospel to others.

                    <span>I finished this book yesterday. In my opinion it is a great read.
<br />
<br />Yes, it is provocative. Yes, many will find it troubling.
<br />
<br />But if we are truly generous with the author and seek to understand his intentions (which I believe are to make us think rather than answer every question we might have) then I think we can all greatly profit from this book.
<br />
<br />Coming from an evangelical background (and still making a transition to a post-evangelical understanding) many of his remarks concerning evangelicals and their relationship to the world and sinners stung particularly bad.
<br />
<br />Also helpful are McLaren's discussion of the Bible, missional/incarnational theology, and the environment.
<br />
<br />At Denver Seminary I took an excellent class from Dr. Danny Carroll called "Reading the Bible from the 2/3rds World". This class was the first time someone ripped the lenses I read the Bible with out from in front of my eyes. I found that my interpretation of Scripture and what I believed to be biblical where greatly influenced by my presuppositions, tradition, culture, gender, and so on.
<br />
<br />McLaren's book, if you will allow it, will do the same for you. It will remove the spectacles you see Christianity, Jesus, liberals, conservatives, God, the Bible, etc. from your face. And though it may seem scary or impossible now, you may actually like the view better.</span>

                    <span>Confused concepts = confusing conclusions. A little bit of everything is a whole bunch of nuthin'. Hodgepodge of unholy hash. By pouring his own unclear internal definitions into crucial Christian words, while being deliberately vague about precise usage (I mean this and not that vs. whatever you feel I mean), readers are misled about just what lexicon he's using. It makes one wonder just what Christ he has in mind? Something that he has come to his own terms with? Or Jesus of Nazareth now at God's Right Hand Who can only be taken on His terms and no others?  </span>

                    <span>i was almost in tears reading this. it started out so hopeful. as a Jesus-follower i was expecting to see Jesus worshipped. nowhere could i find brian say he was a Jesus-worshipper.
<br />
<br />he talks a lot about following the way of Jesus and respecting Him and even honoring Mary. but not once could i see brian agree to exclusive worship of Jesus as Deity as equal to glorifying His Father. what did i read instead? it's o.k. to learn and pick up valuable spiritual things from idol-religions who worship allah and other falsegods. it's o.k. to share about following Jesus with pagan idolatrous people, but no need to persuade them to abandon idolatry and turn to the Living God and worship Jesus alone. 
<br />
<br />the Scriptures command the people of the world to worship Him Who sits on the throne AND The Lamb Who frees us from our sins by His Blood. we are warned constantly and compassionately to keep ourselves from idols and false gods. what does brian do? nullify God's express command by substituting his permission to allow people to remain as false god worshippers but still follow Jesus in some way they can be comfortable with.
<br />
<br />wrong, with all due respect. anathema! as Paul says.
<br />
<br />the bible-christian mission is first and foremost a non-negotiable, not-up-for-revision message: we are bringing you pagans good news, telling you to turn away from these worthless things (allah, idols, hindu god/goddess, animism,polytheism) to the Living God Who made heaven and earth and all things.in the past God overlooked such ignorance but now He commands all people everywhere to repent. for He has set a day when He will judge the world with justice by the Man Jesus He has appointed, giving proof of this to all mankind by raising Him bodily from the dead.
<br />
<br />my tears and prayers and broken heart for brian and his followers are that they are leading souls into endorsing or condoning paganism through the door marked christianity.
<br />
<br />if people don't need to turn away from false gods to the True God Jesus Christ to be saved, they won't be saved by staying pagan vishnu or allah or you name it worshippers who are open to the teachings of the Lord but NOT the Lord of the teachings. respecting many(not ALL of them, naturally) of Jesus' teachings like thomas jefferson (deist) or mahatma gandhi (pagan hindu) claimed and selectively following His ways apart from worshipping Jesus as True God is another salvation-by-works religious cult under an assumed identity. it's an impostor-faith.
<br />
<br />if pagans can be saved by worshipping their idol false gods and optionally follow Jesus' teachings and way of life, then so can cults like jehovah witness, mormon, new agers and even agnostics and atheists who admire and respect Jesus' moral ethics as a code to live by but refuse to worship Christ as God. 
<br />
<br />you're either a Jesus-worshipper or not. if not, you're not truly saved by the True God named Jesus. that's what the Scriptures from Genesis to Revelations offer all mankind. "when God brings His Firstborn into the world, God says Let all God's angels worship Him." 
<br />
<br />true or false? JesusGod or idolgods? whoever is not with Me is against Me, Jesus said. Him inviting anyone to follow doesn't mean just embrace His way of living and moral principles or accept Him as a king or a lord or a rabbi or a master. it means WORSHIP JESUS as TRUE GOD or be forever lost in this world and the next.</span>
