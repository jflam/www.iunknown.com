                <span id="Label1">We know the shadow by many names: alter ego, lower self, the dark twin,  repressed self, id. Carl Jung once said that the shadow "is the person you would  rather not be." But even if you choose to hide your dark side, it will still  cast a shadow, according to author Debbie Ford. Rather than reject the seemingly  undesirable parts of ourselves, Ford offers advice on how to confront our  shadows. Only by owning every aspect of yourself can you achieve harmony and  "let your own light shine," she explains. "The purpose of doing shadow work, is  to become whole. To end our suffering. To stop hiding ourselves from ourselves.  Once we do this we can stop hiding ourselves from the rest of the world."<p>  As threatening as shadow work may seem, it is often very effective in creating  transformation. Ford's step-by-step guidebook is modeled on a highly successful  course she developed about embracing the shadow. Ultimately, she helps readers  illuminate the gifts and strengths that lie within the shadows. Although this  works sound vague, clouded in dark metaphors, Ford manages to make it clear and  specific. She has the writing gifts of a successful seminar                leader--inspirational, trustworthy, and able to convey murky material with grace  and ease. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>Debbie Ford has a powerhouse of a book here, addressing a dilemma with which all of us struggle.  Her theme is reconciling ourselves to the darker side of our human nature, the things we suppress, the things we deny, the things we resist that all are vital parts of who we are.  While her theology and her therapeutic approach may not be as refined as some people would desire, the point of her work strikes home in the hearts of her readers.  The goal she presents is not permissiveness, but wholeness and healing.  This title is not written from a theological or a psychological viewpoint.  It is written from a personal viewpoint by woman who has a powerful story to share.  In her sharing, she inspires struggling readers with refreshing insights and renewed hope.</span>

<br />
<br />This book was one of the biggest wastes of my time as far as 'self help' books are concerned. I would never recommend it to anyone, especially someone with low self esteem.
<br />
<br />"So when we've had it with our friend, colleague, or sibling, it's because he or she is giving voice to parts of us that we have suppressed of rejected, parts of us that don't fit the persona we've created to present to the rest of the world."
<br />
<br />Pure rubbish.</span>

                    <span>I have bought just about every self help book that ever owned shelf space.
<br />So I found this book for 50 cents in a The salvation Army bargain outlet.
<br />What a bargain.
<br />There is so much out there that realy ammounts to nothing. This book is good
<br />I have nothing to gain from this review, but if you can purchase this great book from an Amazon seller for short bucks,,,,, then all I san say is please go for it.
<br />This woman is good.</span>

                    <span>Are you someone who strives for perfection? Do you have a tendency to judge yourself and others harshly whether in silence or publicly? Do you find displays of weakness, carelessness, tardiness, laziness, pettiness, vulgarity, stubbornness, or stinginess really get under your skin and drive you crazy? Watch out, says Debbie Ford, in her slender and powerful book. The qualities we find most difficult to accept in ourselves, are the ones we see and react to most strongly in others. The message is simple and compelling: The path to wholeness and well-being is not about getting rid of our "bad" habits and creating a false identity out of "good" qualities that are easy to embrace. It's about relaxing into our humanity by creating a friendly space for the oh-so-human traits and qualities we've learned to disown as unacceptable to others. What we don't own becomes a blind spot. And we can't manage what we can't see. The premise is that we are a hologram; the entire universe is contained inside of us. After all, how can we recognize qualities we don't posses? It's not a new concept. The Dark Side of the Light Chasers offers a fresh and direct approach to working with our shadow, provides examples that are easy to relate to, and proposes a handful of powerful and transformational exercises. You may literally feel your shoulders and your anxiety level drop after doing the suggested work. You might find yourself reacting less and responding more creatively to personal and professional challenges.
