                    <span>This book remains the definitive sourcebook for those interested in modern and modern classic furniture. I still give it out as gifts to my friends. I have known the authors for over 20 years-perhaps I am biased, but I am looking forward to their upcoming revision-the third edition which should be out in Fall, 2004. It will include over 600 new pieces to bring it up-to-date and will include website information for manufacturers.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed with the book and returned it. Nothing by Robsjohn Gibbings. Nothing by Harvey Probber. Only a single piece by Wormley. Only two by Finn Juhl. Instead, the selection seems weighted heavily toward austere Italian designs of metal and glass, esp. those produced in the 1960s and later. I did not expect the editors to show such a lack of interest in wood. And given the book's definitive-sounding title, I did not expect them to adopt such an rigid and uninteresting definition of "modern."</span>

                    <span>When anything is modern, it means that it's from this era=this time=now. But also, "MODERN" things point to the design movement that grew from the 1920's Modernism movement. That is why many of the Modern pieces such as Charles and Ray Eames pieces are considered "classic", despite the tag("Modern Furniture") that follows them. So I think this book shows great examples of furniture designs from Modernism era and its following influences. I disagree with Ping Lim about not having shown all the recent great works, because I think Karim Rashid and Aeron chair are considered either post post modern or futurism, not modernism.</span>

                    <span>Undoubtedly, this is one of the best reference book re modern furniture on the market place. Having said that, the readers should be aware that this edition is 4 years old. Some of the modern furnitures listed have since become modern classics & many important pieces after 1996 are not listed in here. For example, the working chair produced by Steelcase that is comparable with Aeron chair without its high price tag, Solo sofa by Antonio Citterio for B&B Italia, Vitra & Kartell ranges by Philippe Starck, more lightings by Ingo Maurer & the list could go on & on. Moreover, the authors could include pertinent website & e-mail address for suppliers & manufacturers on top of the snail mail addresses that were provided. It also would be more attractive if the book is printed in colour. Overall, it remains a substantial book. PS: Has the author ever considered updating the book online?</span>
