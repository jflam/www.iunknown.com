                    <span>I work in a position where I train professional programmers for our client.  Most of our programmers are transferring from Legacy systems to our new Oracle system.  We have started using this book as an alternative to more expensive classroom/online training and have found it very useful.  The chapters are small enough to do in a sitting and the exercises help reinforce what was learned in the chapter.  The current users are programmers who have been doing mainframe programming for 10-20 years and are just now transitioning to Windows programming.  I'm amazed at the progress they are making through the use of this book.
<br />
<br />All of the data and sample forms are available online at a website listed in the books introduction.  It's designed to be run on a personal installation of Oracle DB, but I was able to run the provided data creation scripts in our enterprise installation without issue.  I used our developement environment and created the data without any modifications to the scripts and no DBA security rights (other than the right to create new tables).  Took about 5 minutes of setup and then all my students were able to work with it under their normal developer rights.
<br />
<br />There is only one downside I've found, and that's the binding.  For a book that's designed to be read while doing exercises on the computer, it should have a spiral bound rather than normal book binding.  The book does not want to stay open, the margins are too close to the binding, and after several times of forcing it open the bindings are wearing very badly after just a few months.  Some copies even have pages starting to fall out.  It's a minor thing in comparison to the content, but is awfully frustrating for my students.
<br />
<br />In summary, we've looked at countless resources and have found this to be one of the best (cost vs. effectiveness) training tools for our programmers.  </span>

                    <span>While this book is good for learning Oracle Forms 6i, and allows you to learn in the step-by-step as advertised, the layout of this book is horrendous. The chapters are literally 2-3 pages long. Then there are 3 pages of questions, followed by 20 pages of answers and their explanations. As another reviewer said, the questions asked are not meant to be known by the reader. Instead it's a quick way to make a point about what should be known, and then it's answered for you later. What I hate and got more and more frustrated by with each passing chapter, is that while the answers section of each chapter relist the question, it does not relist the steps you're supposed to do between each question. So while it would be nice to just skip the questions and go to the answers where the questions are anyway, you're constantly flipping back and forth to know what to do next. It's good to learn Forms 6i, but be warned that you're going to be frustrated by the format/layout.</span>

                    <span>I like this book. This book gives you a lot of execises and examples, which can be download on line. Just like the book's name Interactive Workbook. I think it is helpful.</span>

                    <span>I would say, this book is strictly not for new forms developers, because some of the reviewers have given bad reviews for this book, it is only because this book goes only with some knowledge of developing application using forms. The main objective is not to teach you how to develop an application using forms but to understand, better way of developing application using forms. So if you are new then I would recommend, read Oracle Certified Professional Application Developer Exam Guide first and then try using this book. This book has got an excellent way of explaining things in the simplest manner as well as same techniques can be applied in your day to day project requirements. Same programs which you are suppose to download and you have to work on those are excellent in nature because there are no errors as well as it works in the same manner, way it is mentioned in the book. Last 3 topics about Multi Form Application, Passing Parameters and Menu Application Role concepts, I am sure you will not find such examples in any books or even in manuals. So I would say, it is worth going through this book provided you are smart enough to work on forms.</span>

                    <span>This is the worst book ever written.  It has so many errors in it that one would wonder if they even edited it before they decided to publish it.  If you are smart you will not buy this book.  In addition to all the errors, it is extremely hard to follow.  There is almost NO text.  The "text" consists of tedious exercises that teach you very little if anything at all.  Each exercise contains very vague instructions and "Test Your Thinking" sections which rarely make any sense.<p>DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL REGRET IT!</span>
