                    <span>I was 39 years old when I read this book.  I had never been married, and had been single for several years.  By my 40th  birthday I had met the man of my dreams and was sporting a beautiful 2 carat diamond engagement ring!  I used the tools in this book to find my best friend, soul mate, partner. I have never been so happy and so in love.  Thank-you Nick Boothman for your book which taught me that I was always choosing the wrong man and how to choose the right one!!!</span>

                    <span>This is a quick read (less than two hours) but it has enough tips in it, that once you've finished it, you'll want to go back and reread parts of it again. 
<br />
<br />Don't be turned off by the title - this is not a guide to mind manipulation nor will you learn how to hypnotize people.  It's a combination between a beginners guide to NLP (neurolinguistic programming), where it breaks down techniques into easy, manageable exercises and a common sense guide to dating, reminding you that if you never leave your house, you'll never meet anyone new. 
<br />
<br />A word of warning though, simply reading this book is not enough to change your life. If you're not willing to try some of Boothman's suggested techniques, nothing will change.
<br />
<br />Target Audience: You want to be dating more, but you need a more confident and approachable vibe. This will give confidence in the dating scene, and you'll quickly see the more you practice these tips, the more confident you'll become.

                    <span>I stumbled across this book in an airport store and spontaneously bought it anticipating I would share some of it's insights with a singles group I facilitate and utilize it in my singles coaching business.  Although I'm not fond of the title, I love the book!  I found useful insights and techniques that even I, an experienced dater, will be able to apply to my dating strategies.  Two areas I found especially useful were the techniques focused around first dates and the four personality types and what each needs to feel loved.  It certainly made me ponder my own dating strategies and whether I could be even more effective given these techniques.  <p>Although I haven't yet personally used the strategies, I recommended the book to a friend who applied some of the techniques to a first date and reported a much more enjoyable experience than usual.</span>
