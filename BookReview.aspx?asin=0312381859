                    <span>Dr. Beckman was born in Czechoslovakia and lived for many years under Soviet rule. His experiences made him a particularly vehement and eloquent defender of individual freedom and that can be seen in "A History of PI".

This is not a dry recitation of the achievements made possible by the discovery of the relationship between a circle's circumference and its diameter. It contains such purely factual information but in a context which serves to show that free men can discover the truth, use it, and move all men -- free, unfree, rich, and poor -- forward; creating wealth, abundance, and leisure. The book also outlines those periods in history when freedom is crushed, the truth is lost, and men are dehumanized. 
 
 Finally, it cautions us that the struggle never ends. Indeed, in our own time a piece of legislation was submitted to the United States House of Representatives which sought to define PI as being equal to the integer value three [rather than 3.1415...].
 
 Overall, the book is well written, readable, sometimes funny and sometimes deadly serious.
 
 (The following is "as best as I can remember" and may contain some inaccuracies.)
 Dr. Beckman was professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at The University of Colorado until his death in 1994. He published a number of books on his own which dealt with Engineering, Language, and Music (most notably "The Health Hazards of NOT Going Nuclear") and translated a number of works by Soviet Engineers and Scientists (most of whom were eventually destroyed by the system to which they were bound in servitude). He also produced "Access to Energy: A Pro-Technology, Pro-Free Enterprise Newsletter." He is survived by his Wife.</span>

                    <span>The thematic dissonance Dr. Beckmann serves up in this ostensible history of science treatise starts off very amusing, grows annoying towards the middle and ends up with you shopping for some other book on pi. As I finished the first chapter, I began to wonder whether other readers had noticed the bait-and-switch: a manuscript with seemingly scholarly intentions had been shanghaied by a cranky technocrat into service for a diatribe against everything from Aristotle to fascism.<P>The real let-down came several chapters further on. I largely agree with the political and historiographical assessments Dr. Beckmann preaches in his book: yes, Aristotle was a scientific dullard now lauded by posterity; yes, the Romans were mathematical morons who didn't even understand the hydrodynamics of their own aqueducts; yes, National Socialism was bad. I'll even concede that Dr. Beckmann's sardonic prose sometimes made the ubiquitous tangents an entertaining diversion. Still and all, what about pi? This is by far the tersest mathematical presentation of difficult ideas I have ever seen in a popular science text. Some of the explanations about mathematical reasoning are positively opaque --- but by the end you're grateful when there's any explanation at all.<P>I have to entertain the uncomfortable possibility that Dr. Beckmann omitted a thorough discussion of the technical points so that he could cram the proofs as well as his ideological agenda into a fixed number of words.<P>"A History of Pi", to give due credit, does touch on the major historical events in the study of this beautiful number (as long as you're prepared to forgive the limited coverage of computational developments, given the book's age). If an ad hoc mixture of political commentary, historical revisionism and dense geometric reasoning is what you're in the mood for, you've picked a winner. Otherwise you ought to look elsewhere. I learned much more about the history and role of pi from "E: The Story of a Number", by Eli Maor, than I did from "A History of Pi".</span>

                    <span>Buy this book if you are a math lover and are also interested in its history. Although It's not an serious math book that you can learn whole lot of math from, it does contain some mathematical derivations, formulas, proofs which can be skipped without destroying the coherency of the author's presentation.</span>

                    <span>This is more than a "book on mathematics". It is an engaging work, chock full of diagrams, charts and illustration, that serve to highlight the witty, erudite text. ALong the way we touch a variety of subjects, numerology, ancient Greece and Rome, professional jealousy, explorers, the Middle Ages and last, but not least, the seeimingly infinite ways in which people have tried to calculate the value of pi.<P>We start in neolithic times and advance to the Egyptians and Babylonians where he surmises on their attemtps to derive this important number. The book is arranged chronolgically and Beckmann attempts to portray the social and scientific conditions under which a particular theory was conceived. It is also the story of the greats of science, the giants of the mind - Archimedes, Euclid, Newton, Pascal and Euler (and thers).</span>

                    <span>Ugh! Avoid this book like diseased shellfish! Never before have I encountered a more paranoid, chauvinistic, egotistical author. Forget learning anything about Pi. There is nothing in this book that you can't find on a goggle search *and you won't have to sit through at least 50 pages of unrelated, uninteresting garbage* There was plenty of opportunity for the author to discuss related (and for that matter unrelated) historical events concerning mathematics. Instead, you read at least 20-30 pages of Western Culture Bashing. Please, for the sake of all that is right in this world, don't buy this book and destroy every copy you run into at B and N!</span>
