                <span id="Label1"><I>The New Retirementality</I> outlines a cleverly named concept that should be of interest to anyone uneasy with the traditional requirement that Americans totally drop one portion of their lives--the working part--simply because they've reached a certain age. Author Mitch Anthony offers, instead, an alternative for a more balanced period of later life that's based entirely on personal desires and that ultimately could change, rather than merely buck, societal norms. Demanding a "philosophical shift in life planning" as well as a "fiscal shift in resource management," it calls for carefully reviewing individual thoughts about retirement, defining activities that would make it personally meaningful (and which will likely include continued employment of some kind), and preparing for the transition well in advance by simplifying both external and internal matters. Anecdotes about those who already have done so and inspirational suggestions from Anthony should provide motivation for readers who agree that flexible, phased retirement is preferable to the jarring lifestyle change enforced upon our parents. "Retirement as we know it today," Anthony concludes, "is a relic from a time and a world that have long since passed." --<I>Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>The New Retirement: The Ultimate Guide To The Rest Of Your Life is the most comprehensive book on the subject that I have seen. I especially recommend this book to those who are about to retire since it provides an excellent self analysis on the type of retirement that would best suit you (and your spouse if you are married). The book covers but goes beyond the typical "where to retire" and the "financial aspects" of retirement and expertly covers subjects of "readiness" for retirement, and "options" on the type of retirement that would be right for you. I have developed many strategies for retirement after having read this book that I would have never even thought of!</span>

                    <span>Mitch Anthony does a wonderful job reminding us that the common expectation of retirement is a very impractical and downright unhealthy. <p>Our concept of retirement is only about three generations old.  When Social Security retirement benefits came into being people died about the same time benefits started.  We now live decades longer.  Yet most people still feel that they are "entitled" to retire in their sixties. <p>Only about 1% of all Americans will be able to retire in their sixties and maintain their standard of living.  Why are we stressing ourselves out in jobs we hate hoping to save enough money to buy our freedom, i.e. retire?  Add to that stress the guilt we feel because we have not saved nearly a fraction of what it will take.  <p>A recent study by AARP showed that most seniors plan to have some sort of gainful employment in their retirement years - out of choice, not financial necessity.  It is human nature to be involved and productive throughout our lifetimes.  <p>The New Retire-Mentality is a very important wake-up call to help us re-think the "traditional" notion of retirement.</span>

                    <span>The New Retirementality by Mitch Anthony is one of the most remarkable books I have ever read. Not since seeing the terrifying opening scenes of The Matrix, have I had the sense of a socially induced reality collapsing so completely. In deconstructing the commonly held assumption that a non-working retirement is the best way to spend the last years of our lives, Mitch Anthony provides readers with an escape route from the Orwellian world of institutional thought control. <p>Save your retirement, read this book!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book.  It has given me a new perspective on my career.  I am glad that this wasn't just another book on how to save millions of dollars.  Anthony discusses the importance of finding your calling, so to speak.  He wants readers to look at what they enjoy most and do that for most of their lives.  Of course, there may be a time when we are unable to work or no longer want to work.  Then, it is important to have some money set aside.  Otherwise, you can retire from the typical working world at any age and begin the life you've always wanted to live.</span>
