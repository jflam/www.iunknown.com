                <span id="Label1">ESPN, the network that revolutionized the way we watch sports, has long been associated with terrific sports reporting. And no hour on ESPN is more popular than <I>SportsCenter</I>, a.k.a. "The Big Show." With their typical wise-guy flair, the celebrated tandem of cohosts, Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick, offer a comedic, behind-the-scenes look at what makes <I>SportsCenter</I> tick. Chapters titled "Bill Buckner--What Happened?," "How to Be a Sportscaster When You Grow Up," and "Put Your Baseball Cards in Your Bicycle Spokes, Now!" are widely regarded as the three most compelling and astutely researched chapters in the sportswriting canon. Learn the true origins of the expressions "en fuego," "Niedermeyer: Dead!," and "Detlef Schrempf!" in the glossary of terms, find out who makes their "Twenty-One Top Ten Athletes" list, and discover the <I>real</I> reason why Patrick held Bill Murray's hand at the ESPYs.--<i>D.G. McDonald</i> </span>

                    <span>A book about the show that revolutionized the sports tv show by the two guys who were the stars of the show. Funniest section is where they talk about those little catch-phrases everyone gets stuck in their head. You know like, "from way downtown...bang!!" and "he put the biscuit in the basket". Hilarious!!</span>

                    <span>You'll have to read the book to truly appreciate the title of my review. Dan Patrick and Keith Olberman were incredibly great together on air, and they continue this trend with The Big Show.<P>Not only is this book hilariously funny (two different fonts was pure genius), but it gives you an incredibly in-depth look at the behind-the-scenes making of the greatest sports' news show on television. Yes, today most of topics in the book are outdated, but you can still relate to the athletes they discuss.<P>The authors also share their totally different stories of their respective rises to the top, as well as discussing larger sports' stories that have been well documented in the news. In doing so, they use easy-flowing descriptive language, intertwined with their vast knowledge of sports on the whole. This funny and insightful book is a must read for all sports fans.</span>

                    <span>Keith Olberman and Dan Patrick truly speak from the heart and give their inside approach to what they think of the sports industry. I've already recomended it to some of my friends and they love it also so BUY THIS NOW!</span>

                    <span>I bought the audio version of Keith and Dan's book in addition to the printed version. While the book contains a lot more material than the tapes, it's great to listen to Keith and Dan banter back and forth for three hours. Take this one in the car with you on long trips--it will definitely make the trip more interesting. This ia a must-have for any true Olbermaniac (like myself.)</span>

                    <span>This is one of those books that, becuase of Dan and Keith's style of delivery, is better heard than read. Both were very accurate in their rebuke of the baseball hall of fame selection process. The 3rd top 10 list was a little boring. Overall the book is very entertaiing.</span>
