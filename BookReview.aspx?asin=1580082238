                <span id="Label1">"Good Web writing needs to be like soda pop or champagne," says Rachel McAlpine in <I>Web Word Wizardry</I>: "crystal clear and fizzy." But engaging prose isn't enough. Web writing needs to be straightforward ("the enigmatic, provocative, cryptic, poetic, ironic, or witty heading is wasted on the Web," she confides) but not bland. To instill trust in the reader, it must be both personal and professional. McAlpine, a trainer and consultant in online content, addresses everything here from alt-text and source code to doorway pages and link popularity. She discusses the differences between writing for the Web and writing for intranets (private Internet systems used by large organizations). She warns against long domain names, italics, and flags as language indicators. And she devotes a considerable amount of space to the fine art of customizing pages of your Web site for specific search engines. After all, who cares how brilliant your site is, if no one can find it? <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>This book helped shape my view of how to write online, and it's done wonders for the web site I manage. The site has boasted about a 50% increase in customers, and I feel a large part of that can be traced back to principles learned in this book.<P>Of special importance is the weight McAlpine places on being International-sensitive, because though it goes without saying, the Web is accessible to the entire world economy. And there are people who speak English in nearly every country in that world economy. So, of course, everyone is taking advantage of this fact, right? Don't count on it.<P>Read this book, and enlighten yourself.</span>

                    <span>If you're just starting out in the field of writing for the web, this is a good place to start. However, if you're looking for specific SEO (search engine optimization) writing, this book ain't it. It covers the SEO topic pretty well for people uninitiated into the field. I love the layout and design of the book though. It's easy to read and follows a good, coherent line of thought. <P>In conclusion, I would recommend the book to people new to SEO and copywriting but not to those who are looking to hone their skills.</span>

                    <span>I'm about half-way through the book and love it! It's filled with practical advice that those responsible for Web content or design can put to use immediately. After a few hours, I have a checklist of changes I need to make to the site I manage. I also appreciate the author's witty style, which makes the book enjoyable as well as educational.</span>

                    <span>Writing for the Internet is very different from writing a novel or an article. A reader tends to skim the page looking for words of interest and if they don't find what they want then it is easy to just click an link or hit a search engine and go to another page that might be of interest. In Web Word Wizardry the author leads the reader through the snares and pitfalls of writing for the Web in a style that demands attention and is directed towards a goal - getting the reader to actually examine the page.<P>By far the most comprehensive book that I have seen on this subject, Rachel McAlpine works through not only Web Pages but also writing and style for Ezines, writing for Search Engines, using Keywords and similar items. She ends the book with a checklist for Meta Tags, Title Tag, Description, Body Copy, Links, Optimization, Micro Content, Skim-Reading, Clarity, Adapting for the Web, Credibility, and Profitability. The checklists are well worth the price of the book by themselves. <P>With plenty of examples throughout the book it is clear and concise and a valuable reference to onyone designing a web site, Ezine or other Internet communication medium. If you want your site to be professional and user friendly then use this book as a magnifying glass to evaluate your site. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I've been writing for the Web and ezines since 1996, and thoroughly enjoyed and learned from this book. Rachel's personality and gentle humor shines through; and, although her helpful tips are often things I already knew, they're still awfully good reminders. <P>No this is not an encyclopedic guide to e-copywriting or online journalism persay. It is, however, a very good baseline guide for communications professionals (and hobbiests) who may be good writers in print and now have to take that skill online. It's also a great friendly reminder guide for those of us who've been doing this so long we've forgotten some of the rules... :-)<P>My favorite part of this book are all the examples and screenshots. Yes, some of the stuff Rachel points out is obvious. But if it's so obvious, why do so many, many Web sites and email newsletters *still* make these dumb mistakes? <P>Avoid the dumb mistakes. Enjoy the author's warm voice and jokes. Check out the useful samples. Buy the book.</span>
