                    <span>I read this book a year ago, so I do not remember much. It's the only book I've seen out there that deals with advanced queries. The book is very insightful and stimulates ideas in one to try out, but many of the examples, however complicated they might be, are trivial in nature. Examples that nobody out there in the real world would want to do unless they want to satisfy some silly curiosity. The examples that come to mind are his organizational trees. Who cares about that? That's going a bit overboard I think. Another thing I remember is how authoritative Joe Celko tries to sound in his presentation of SQL and then he down plays it when he instructs his readers to check with their specific SQL implementation. Other than that the book seems to be expensive. If you must buy it try finding a used copy.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because Henderson "TSQL for gurus" mentioned it, actually I bought all Celkos books, they are great and even if you think you can outsmart the book and the writer you wont get far. It takes time to be good in SQL since it is totaly different from standard procedural language. This books shows you lots of things you may ask why the heck do I need this? abd many would say well the SQL I used has this feature and I dont need that Ansi stuff, but the point is the book makes you think SQL and that is what its goal was not compare or choose a particular SQL implementation, I myself am attached to T-SQL so i tried to do things MS way.<P>I recomend it and if you really want to pushed the way you think SQL forward buy some miles buy it..<P>Sure anybody can write a query .....but how many ways can you do it?</span>

                    <span>If you need to sling some really nasty SQL which you probably shouldn't be writing in the first place, then this book is for you. Celko is the man. As a cover-to-cover read, you will pick up on a lot of new SQL techniques, but in general, this is a "I know where to look when I need to know that book." If you know the basics of SQL and want to start your SQL Master training, then start here. Just keep it close by when you need to remember how Celko was able to get "that" to work.</span>
