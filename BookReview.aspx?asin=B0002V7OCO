                    <span>Issues of race, class, and ambivalent sexuality permeate this strangely cluttered film by French director Robert Salis. Full of clunky dialogue and self important performances by is lead cast, Grand Ecole, tries to plot the difficult period of sexual awakening somewhere between adolescence and adulthood. 
<br />
<br />Salis charts this territory fairly successfully and the issues of bourgeoning sexuality are sensitively and thoughtfully handled, but the movie really falls apart when he tries too hard to pack the story with high-minded rhetoric about social justice, and economic inequality. What we get is a coarse and incoherent mix of human rights violations and rather pedestrian observations on class distinction and educational elitism.
<br />
<br />The setting is a prestigious private school in Paris, where the students have come to study business and international finance at the impulse their wealthy parents. The scholars are all a fresh-faced, and uniformly Aryan bunch with a penchant for wearing expensive suits and habitually sprouting intellectual opinions; their also extremely attractive, and from the outset it is obvious that there won't be much of an educational nature going on in this school. 
<br />
<br />Lust and sex is the name of the game, and gender, class, race, jealousy and pre-existing relationships go by the wayside, as it's not long before everyone in the movie is sleeping or either thinking of sleeping with everybody else. With a Machiavellian ease and skill, a young female student plots to sleep with the school swimming jock, while also encouraging her closeted lover to do the same. 
<br />
<br />At the center of the story is Paul, (Gregori Baquet) a new student who's especially uneasy because he's a country boy and very "sensitive" looking. Dropped into this elite institution he struggles to fit in with his more acceptably bourgeois classmates. Paul soon befriends Mecir a middle-class French-Arab painter (Salim Kechiouche) after he witness the boy being yelled at by his boss after dropping a can of paint. Both men are deeply closeted but there's an obvious attraction. Also, the repercussions of falling in love with someone so far below one's station spell potential disaster for the two young men.
<br />
<br />While courting Mecir, Paul tries to suppress his palpable desire for his good-looking, aristocratic roommate Louis-Arnaud. (Jocelyn Quivrin). Eventually his lust gets the better of him and he begins to act out his surreptitious desires by furtively sniffing Louis's pillow and stealing his unwashed boxer shorts. Sensing Paul's turmoil, Agn√®s Agnes (Alice Taglioni) his girlfriend challenges him to see which of them can sleep with Louis-Arnaud first. 
<br />
<br />As Paul, Baquet captures perfectly the confusing attractions of a burgeoning gay man. There's a particularly painful scene in the school's locker room, where he breaks out in a tormented sweat at the magnetic horror of seeing lots of naked men soaping themselves in the shower. 
<br />
<br />But there's just too much going on in this movie. Salis wants us to care about so many different issues - sexuality, social class, racism, human rights, education and the dignity of labor, but it fails to adequately address the most obvious subject in any depth which is the snobbery, pretentiousness, and injustice of the school's elitist policies.
<br />
<br />The film works much better, and is even quite revelatory, when it focuses on enigmatic and unapologetic sexuality, both gay and straight. There's lots of full frontal nudity, which is biased a bit toward the men for a change and a very passionate male-on-male make out scene, which is bizarrely filmed in a hall of mirrors. At least the film doesn't lack passion.
<br />
<br />Grande Ecole just doesn't work that well when it sacrifices its sexual politics and polemics for its social ones, and the social politics are much less intriguing. Watching the smug, young privileged class paying lip service to inequality and discovering that the world is bigger than themselves is hardly eye opening, even when they're French.

                    <span>This movie, LATTER DAYS and NEVERLAND (the gay-themed Peter Pan movie - not the Johnny Depp movie!) have the sexiest guys ever. I highly recommend these three movies if you are into extremely beautiful men and explicitly gay-themed independent movies. LATTER DAYS is a bit on the soap-operatic side, but this and NEVERLAND are much more sophisticated/stylish. These are my top three.</span>

                    <span>This film is ostensibly about the lives of students attending an elite business school. It is quite evident that the filmmaker doesn't know the first thing about corporate finance or business education. But that doesn't matter because, despite the title, the school is little more than a backdrop; and the characters, who supposedly were admitted because of their aptitude in business, haven't the foggiest idea what they are doing, much less evidencing interest in their education. 
<br />
<br />Instead, it centers on a provincial lad who feels out of place and takes action to rid himself of his bourgeois manners and morals.  Apparently not content with his girlfriend Agnes (played by the gorgeous Alice Taglioni), he engages in a liaison with an Arab workman (the point of which is rather obscure) and pants after his male roommate.  Several times references are made to the French philosopher and social critic Michel Foucault, all in a transparent effort to lend the film an "aura" of intellectual legitimacy. Ultimately, however, the film is beyond dull. It is dreadfully pretentious and riddled with clich√©s that would make even the most "politically correct" blush. </span>

                    <span>Grande Ecole is a beautiful, complex movie, that shines in many areas, and falters in few.  In a nutshell, this movie is about desire and unrequited love. Sounds like a lot of movies out there, but this one is unique in its flavor and appeal.
<br />
<br />The acting is superb for a such a young cast, and they all look the part, like gorgeous, wealthy, french lovers.  I wouldn't mind being in their crew if I lived in the movie, that's fo sho!  Five out of the six main characters will bare a lot of flesh, as well as two long shower scenes containing a water polo team sudsing up.  It's not so much gratuitous nude scenes, but more to reveal the character's design, maturity, and vulnerability within the context of the plot.  Believe me, you'll understand when you see it.
<br />
<br />The ending had me wanting more.  I wanted more character development, more connection between the differing subplots, and let's face it, more nude shots of Louis_arnault's body. :p 
<br />
<br />But seriously, I must give credit to the director for creating some really touching scenes.  For instance, the scenes between the Arab worker and Paul had a genuine feeling about them; I could sense the discomfort of Paul's burgeoning desires to explore the male body, and the true love the Arab had for Paul.  
<br />
<br />So if you don't like reading subtitles (I tried to read it while stoned, fahgetaboutit!), high-falutin words, or the occasional lengthy philosophical dialogue, then maybe you should skip this one.  But for all others, definitely check this dvd out. </span>

                    <span>This is really two movies for the price of one. 
<br />
<br />It's a philosophical French film about class and race differences, sexual orientation and whether it really exists, and the ways that people manipulate and deceive one another. It does an OK job of this, though the heady dialogue sounds more profound being spoken in French than it reads in the English subtitles and the characters behave in ways that often defy believability.
<br />
<br />It's also a cavalcade of nudity, as the DVD case should tell you, with both sexes coming in for their share of time under the lens. (Men are actually the winners of the full-frontal contest in this film, with multiple shots of the three male leads as well as a locker room shower scene that exposes the entire water polo team.) If you're offended by bare flesh, you will NOT enjoy this movie. If witnessing casual nudity and people unashamed of their bodies appeals to you, however, you may not care about--or notice--this film's overly-ambitious philosophical overtones or sometimes clunky but ultimately intriguing storyline.</span>
