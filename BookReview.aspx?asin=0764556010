                    <span>This book was awful!!! I bought this for the Golive section, being new to GoLive I thought that a book like this could get me up and running in no time flat. BUUZZZZZZ! I couldn't have been more wrong. The subject matter is presented in an illogical format and runs in circles without really doing anything. For a dummies book I needed a brain brace just to find the ready made templates. I ended up getting a tutorial from the web to supplemment this book. Finally, I gave up! I returned this book and bought Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a book. I accomplished more in half of the first chapter with the AGLCIB than I did with the whole section of the dummies book. I was so fustrated that if I didn't pay so much for this book I would have just thrown it in the garbage and have one less copy out there for someone else to suffer through.
<br />
<br />Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf. Seriously!</span>

                    <span>I got this book originally for the Acrobat chapters, but also knowing that I was ready to dive into Photoshop and Illustrator.  This book has been a godsend!  It has a permanent place on my desk for quick reference.  Thanks Double Jens for taking the time to share your expertise with us "dummies"!  Your book has made learning these tools very easy.  I love your writing style and your ability to explain the differences of all the various settings and how to use the tools.  Now I'm on my way to being a designer to compliment my developer side!  Selecting Five Stars was an easy choice!  Thanks!</span>

                    <span>I haven't always found the "For Dummies" books to be extremely helpful in the realm of software guides.  This book, however, proved to surpass my expectations.  <p>The language style was very beginner-friendly.  The order of presentation of the programs and features in the CS suite made sense.  The index was highly inclusive and helpful.  <p>This book is geared toward someone totally new to the Adobe programs.    It's a step-by-step approach to familiarizing the reader to the basics of the Suite's features and helping the reader recognize when the different programs can be used in conjunction with one-another for effective results.  I would not recommend it for people who already have experience with Adobe Programs and wish to brush up on the new features in CS, but for beginners to Adobe it's a comfortable place to get your feet wet.</span>
