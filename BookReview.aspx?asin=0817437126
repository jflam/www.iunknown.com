                    <span>It's more a photography primer, and less an in-depth discussion of exposure. Sure, shutter speed, aperature and film speed are discussed. But the reader will not learn how to use a camera's meter to select a *proper* exposure for a scene.
<br />
<br />There are numerous examples of exposures, like 1/125 at f/2.8, but there is never a link between the camera's suggested reading, and the final exposure values selected (hint: they're not always the same). A book with this title owes it to the reader to go the extra step - and more.
<br />
<br />John Shaw's 'Nature Photography' has an excellent chapter or two on exposure - I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to get their head around the concenpt. </span>

                    <span>Book is great for amateur photographers. It is loaded with photos and author diligently describes how each of the photos were taken (aperture, shutter speed, filters, lens....). If you want to improve your skills, this book will help you a lot. 144 pages, written in a reader friendly manner, tell you about the essence of photography - exposure. It's not only a technical manual but also a guide to greative approach to photography. Very useful and pleasant reading.
<br />Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>First let me say that this is not a bad book, it's just that in my opinion it should not be given the title "Understanding Exposure".
<br />This book is rather a more general photography book. There is good information here, just not enough to teach you how to properly use the camera's meter, or spot meter to properly expose film or take a properly exposed digital photograph.
<br />To learn about proper "exposure", please refer to: The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System by Bahman Farzad, Linda Voychehovski.
<br />Otherwise there's good information in this book with regard to selecting a shutter speed and aperture to achieve creative effects and gain creative control over your images, but there is precious little in this book to help you learn how to use your light meter to control your exposure level to correctly expose film or a digital image.</span>

                    <span>if you're either 1--non-tech inclined, or 2--just want the "quick route", then this is the book for you!
<br /> 
<br /> otherwise, like me who's 1--wanting to study photography more seriously, or 2--more tech inclined, than there's far better books to study from on the art & science of photography.</span>
