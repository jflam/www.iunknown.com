                <span id="Label1">Finally all three programs from the Emmy Award-winning <I>Walking with...</I> series--<I>Walking with Dinosaurs</I>, <I>Allosaurus: A Walking with Dinosaurs Special</I>, and <I>Walking with Prehistoric Beasts</I>--are available for the first time as a collector's set on DVD. The epic begins with a journey back 65 million years ago to a virtual lost world which has been recreated with spectacular digital effects and animatronics. The series continues as we follow the life and death struggles of "Big Al," the most complete allosaurus skeleton ever found. And finally, we explore our planet after the reign of the dinosaur and the succession of extraordinary creatures that came and went over the following millennia. The end of the dinosaur was only the beginning!  </span>

                    <span>Everyone has summed it up, this is a good as it gets in the doco world. Pure, undiluted quality. Fantastic animation, production values, narration and all around a+ performance, many of the effects in this series would not look out of place in a feature film, indeed the guys at Framestore have gotten so good at doing this they beat ILM at their own game at times IMO.<P>However, it's not really the 'complete' Walking with Collection, there have been 5 new episodes since this was released in the form of the BBC's followup new 'Chased by Dinosaurs' series (known as special episodes of Walking with Dinosaurs in the UK though still). They covered big dinosaurs like Argentionsaurus and the Gigantosaurus and lots of sea creatures like the giant shark Megadolon. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the series.</span>

                    <span>The series is, in my opinion, nothing less than outstanding. HOWEVER, what is being offered as a complete set is, in fact, missing the latest DVD, "Walking With Cavemen." Hope this information proves helpful to both the sellers and buyers.</span>

                    <span>1000 words cannot describe the incredible graphics and presentation quality of this series. I consider these stories, based on real science and a monumental effort, to change the way we have thought of the earth millions of years ago. The dinosaurs in Walking With Dinosaurs are very real, maybe too real for young viewers, but believable and memorable. This $60 purchase could be the best investment in DVDs that can be bought. I have watched select story lines from the collection over and over without disappointment. Hence the purchase keeps on giving unlike the rest of my DVD purchases.</span>

                    <span>This set is a must have for any dinosaur lover. My future paleontologists, Will (5 years) and Annelise (2 years), watched these every day for the first six months. We've had the set for a year now, and we still watch about twice a month. Whenever a playmate comes over, he or she requests watching a dvd from the Walking With collection. The kids especially like to watch in the van. They are fun to view, informative, well-organized, beautiful, timeless and interesting for all ages.</span>

                    <span>I'm not really a big fan of buying DVDs for specials or films that have already been shown on TV> Why would I want to pay $60 for a DVD of a show that I saw for free on Discovery Chanel? However the shows shown on Discovery channel are the exception to my rule. And "Walking With Dinosaurs" is one of the best.<P>This special is worth every penny of the advertised price if you can't find it airing on TV anytime soon. For a TV special, the effects were some of the best I've seen on television. The combination of computer generated and animatronic dinosaurs looked incredible, and really give you the feeling that we were able to capture these creatures on video. The great thing about this special is that, unlike traditional documentaries, they used the scientific evidence they had found to create a story, as they did with "Allosaurus." <P>Overall, while I tihnk that maybe this DVD would be a little better value around $40, the specials are, without a doubt, the best nature specials I have ever seen.</span>
