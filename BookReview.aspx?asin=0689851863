                <span id="Label1"><P> Natalie's best friend, Zoe, is sure that the novel Natalie's written is good enough to be published. But how can a twelve-year-old girl publish a book? Natalie's mother is an editor for a big children's publisher, but Natalie doesn't want to ask for any favors. <P> Then Zoe has a brilliant idea: Natalie can submit her manuscript under a pen name, with Zoe acting as her literary agent. But it's not easy for two sixth graders to put themselves over as grown-ups, even with some help from a couple of <I>real</I> grown-ups who are supportive but skeptical. The next best-selling school story may be in their hands -- but can Natalie and Zoe pull off their masquerade?</span>

                    <span>In the School Story, Andrew Clements's word choice is irresistible. His book holds you tight. It is a heartwarming story about a young girl and her friend trying to make Natalie's writing dream come true. After her father died, Natalie tries to make a real life for herself without her dad in her life. She tries to do what she loves to do. Natalie strides ahead to make a School Story but gets caught up in some problems with the publisher, Hagatha. Natalie and her close friend Zoe, are so determined to get Natalie's book published that they make up their own publishing company, and Zoe becomes Natalie's chief and her helper. Natalie's disguises herself as Cassandra Day, so no one will know her identity, especially her mom. Will Natalie (Cassandra Day) get her book published? Read this Andrew Clements wonder book that you won't put down. Your children will read it numerous times and they will love it. But you can't resist the passion and the sad times in the book. It is definitely a fun family reader. I would recommend this for everyone.</span>

                    <span>This great book is about a 12 year old average girl named Natalie Nelson. Wel it turns out to be thats shes not so average anymore. The story is about a bokk Natalie wrote vcalled "the Cheater" but of course she didnt think it was too good. She gave the story to her best friend Zoe Reisman. Zoe is so astonished at how good it was she showed it to her Launguage Arts teacher Mrs.Clayton. Zoe is so confident that her sotry is so good it could get published. Which in this case Natalie lucked out. Turns out Natalies mom is an editor for Shipley Junior Books. She could just have her mom publish it easy as pie right? Wrong, not so easy! Why would a major books company spend time editing a little girls book? Tunrs out her moms boss Letha Springfield is one harsh boss, theres no may she'll spend her companys time and money on a little girls book. But then Zoe thinks of an idea how Natalie could get her book published using a diffrent name like a disgues. Then all she needed was an agent and who better than Zoe? They now her book is good enough to get published but how could these two pull it off? With the help of there teacher and a few tricks up there selves, can the book go public?<BR>Read it to find out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>

                    <span>I like The School Story because it is about a girl that is trying to publish a book that she wrote. Her mom is a editor so she wants her mom to puplish it. her friend Zoe wants to be her agent so Natalie says yes. They finally get the book and Natalie tells her mom that she wrote it.</span>

                    <span>Natalie starts to write a book, "The Cheater." Zoe loves the book, and thinks that she can get the book published. The only problem is that Natalie's mom is the only publisher they know. So Zoe thinks up a big plan, and decides to be Natalie's agent, Sherry Clutch. Natalie and their teacher, Ms. Clayton, join in. Natalie decides to have her pen name be Cassandra Day. Will they slip past Natalie's mom, or will she find out? <P>"School Story" was a great book, almost the best book I've ever read. It has a great plot (I think), and it shows how the girls think and feel. It shows lots of excitement and creativity. The characters have totally different personalities, which makes the book fun. And it is also pretty funny. This is the kind of book that does not need a sequel because the ending finishes perfectly, and locks everything up. It is the kind of book that does not suit some people, because there's not tons of action and fighting, but some people can't stop reading it because they just have to know what happens next. I think most of Andrew Clements books are pretty good, but this is his best book yet.</span>

                    <span>_The School Story_ by Andrew Clements is a delightful book about a gifted sixth grader who writes a "great" middle school novel and gets it published by a major publisher.<P>The story is well paced, and the dialogue rings true. In Chapter 2, titled "A Portrait of the Author as a Young Girl," we learn the keys to this gifted writer's development. We get a child's perspective on reading aloud -- the security of her mother's calm voice versus the adventure of her father's embellishment. And always young Natalie imagined the author of the story and knew that someday she would be one herself.<P>_The School Story_ provides an intimate look at the agonies and ecstasies of both writing and publishing. Natalie's mother works as an editor of children's books, affording Natalie knowledge of the system she must beat. Natalie wants her book to be accepted on its own merits, however. Her best friend, Zoe, decides that Natalie should use a pseudonym and that she herself should act as Natalie's agent. A little help from the girls' English teacher lends plausibility to their scheme.<P>We receive a couple of glimpses of _The Cheater_, Natalie's novel. This introduces young readers to the literary device of a story within a story. Natalie and Zoe sometimes grapple with the ethics of their plan and wonder if they themselves are cheaters.<P>In addition to sheer enjoyment and a behind-the-scenes look at how a book gets published, _The School Story_ offers several lessons. It shows how research and persistence can lead to the realization of one's goals. It shows how revision can turn a good book into a great book. Above all, perhaps, it provides an example of encouragement. Without encouragement, Natalie wouldn't even have finished her novel, let alone pursued its publication. Moreover, each of the major characters gains courage in the course of the story so that she is a braver person at the end than she was at the beginning.<P>_The School Story_ is especially appropriate for fourth- to sixth-grade linguaphiles.</span>
