                    <span>I expect that this book will help me learn ASP.NET thru VB.NET. I am very frustrated, it didn't really help me to easily understand the simple thought of ASP.NET thru VB.NET. For beginners like me, I will not suggest this book. Much better to browse the web.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I started this book with a background in both VB and classic ASP, with the goal of upgrading my knowledge to ASP.NET.  I'll state that I think this book is just bad.
<br />
<br />It seems that half the book presupposes that you have extensive knowledge of classic ASP, and the other half assumes that you've never used any sort of scripting language before.  The examples are horribly simplistic to the point that they have absolutely no relation to modern web applications.  But, you won't understand large parts of the book unless you have a background in programming.
<br />
<br />The first two parts (six chapters) could actually be somewhat useful to a true beginner.  They start slow and build up some very basic skills.  
<br />
<br />Part 2 is a little different.  Chapter 7 on web forms is fairly decent, but could use to be longer.  Chapter 8 on server controls is just poorly written.  Chapter 9 on accessing date is AWFUL.  It presupposes you have a fairly good background in traditional database access with something like ADO, so it's definitely not for beginners.  For instance it compares the DataReader object to a read-only forward-only cursor, but if you don't have a background in data access you aren't going to understand how cursors work.  This is right next to where he explains that the password key "Specifies the password to use to log into the SQL Server database."  Yeah, DUH.  Also, a bulk of the chapter is devoted to working with XML data but the chapter sets out to work with databases.  For a 68 page chapter it conveys surprisingly little actual new information.  No time is given to explaining how databases have traditionally been accessed and used in actual working applications.  I just wanted to scream as I read it.
<br />
<br />Chapter 10 on creating custom server controls and chapter 11 on creating web services are very brief introductions to some fairly advanced and complicated topics.  They provide simplistic examples and then expect you might be able to actually use the knowledge you gained in the chapters.  Yeah right.
<br />
<br />Chapter 13 is aimed at beginners on deploying ASP.NET applications.  Chapter 14 on tracing and debugging is actually not bad.  (Not good either.)
<br />
<br />Also the book is based on using Visual Studio .NET.  I'll state that I have a bias against using IDEs for simple scripting, so I won't comment on appropriateness here.  But be forewarned that three-quarters or more of the examples involve VS.NET.</span>

                    <span>My overall impression of the book is that whilst at first glance it is organised into logical chapters (the reason I purchased the book), the contents within the chapters is presented haphazardly. <p>The author jumps from one topic to another without fully explaining whats going on and presents some confusing examples, some of which do not work. Not impressed at all</span>
