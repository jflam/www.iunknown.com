                    <span>Who would want to "work a room"?  Someone trying to sell something, maybe?  If you're not selling anything overtly, this book will not be of interest.  I say overtly because, as someone once pointed out, we're all selling something, but we need not do so overtly or manifestly.  But by our behavior.  Actions and words and all.  This book, and others like it, all have us looking outward for gratification, basically from other people, people "in the room."  "In the room" can be a metaphor for the "in crowd."  Do you want in with the in crowd?  Maybe you'll learn some tools from this book.  Then again, you might do better looking inward at yourself.  Listen to one of the great modern inward-seekers, Vernon Howard (excuse the gender specificity, it's an old book): "A man owes nothing to any other human being on earth except to be himself, but since few see this, most men stagger under the burdensome debt of artificial behavior.  It is a tragic illusion that we can do anything for others before we have done something for ourselves."  The writer of "How to work a room" is essentially focusing on how to improve your artificial behavior.  Diximus.</span>

                    <span>This is a decent book to remind us all of what we need to be doing.  Although much of it is just common sense, seeing reminders doesn't hurt.  There is nothing profound in it. <p>Unfortunately, it's not well written.  This makes it somewhat painful to read and detracts from its credibility. For example, it's "chock full" of trite phrases and the inappropriate use of quotation marks.  Both of these writing problems suggest that the author was not entirely comfortable with what she was saying.  I still gave Ms. Roane the benefit of the doubt; perhaps she's more of a verbal person than a writer, and verbal communication is the main focus of the book.</span>

                    <span>I wish I could give this book less than a star because even 1 star is too generous for this book. The first chapter is quick to cite the important points in working a room (points that you can learn from just any other book on conversation) and the rest is just nonsensical repetition of the same facts again and again. All in all, the book has too many flaws and a too little new material to be of any value.</span>

                    <span>I knew this book was not worth the paper it was printed on, when I saw in the appendix a Yiddish glossary!  I mean, ethic and religious differences aside, why would I be interested in working a room speaking Yiddish?  I did read through the book and found the content nothing but empty talk.<p>Seriously, if you want improve your social skills, read the timeless classics by Dale Carnegie.</span>

                    <span>I suggest not wasting your time with this thin-on-substance guide.  Beyond some poorly written musings of common sense, not much is offered aside from the occasional jab at persons Ms. RoAne apparently has issues with. (This is quite hypocritical considering that her basic message is to make friends and play nice.)  <p>Attempts at addressing online networking are rather pathetic, uninformed, and blatantly appended to text from previous editions.  (...) <p>One must also wonder about the need for, and her constant references to, the Yiddish glossary she has so painstakingly included.  Call me slow, but I just didn't get the connection between it and a better understanding of "working a room".<p>As recommended to me, and I to you, "Power Networking" by Donna Fisher and Sandy Vilas is more comprehensive, directed, and references RoAne's few meaningful insights briefly and concisely.</span>
