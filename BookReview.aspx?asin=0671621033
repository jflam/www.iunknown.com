                <span id="Label1">As a boy, all Ted Williams wanted was to be the best hitter there ever was. Through his storied tenure with the Red Sox, he pretty much got his wish. He not only hit, he <i>knew</i> how to hit; there was no keener, more devoted, more articulate student of the art. <i>The Science of Hitting</i> is his comprehensive book of wisdom and anecdote, a baseball bible that offers clear, concise, well-illustrated, fundamental information on how to hit a baseball and, just as important, how to <i>think</i> about hitting a baseball. Williams's first commandment is "Get a good pitch to hit," and, in one of baseball's most dramatic teaching tools--a photograph that divides his strike zone into 77 baseballs, seven wide by 11 high--Williams projects what he would hit at each pitch location, from .230 on the low-outside strike to .400 in what he called his "happy zone," the heart of the plate belt high. In 1941, that happy zone was obviously ecstatic; Williams hit .406 that year, the last to break the magic .400 barrier. </span>

                    <span>This book really helps. Ted Williams is 
<br />my sencond favorite player Manny Ramirez is 
<br />my first. The people who thought of making this 
<br />book are great [Ted Williams and John Underwood 
<br />made this book].This book has great pictures in it.
<br />I also put this in my so you'd like to at the bottom of the 
<br />page. This book is long but good. It has a surprise at the
<br />end of this book that I loved. You should really get this book
<br />because it helps you to hit the baseball better. So go get this book because as the greatist baseball player ever said," The hardest thing to do is hit a baseball" and he is true you can learn anything else easy but it will take you a while to hit a baseball. So you should go get this book it is good with hitting and it is good to just pick up a book and go read.</span>

                    <span>When your son or daughter asks you how to hit better --- don't just make stuff up as if you really were a good hitter (and you weren't) --- buy this book, instead. Read it yourself so you can help give truly practical advice, instead of guessing.<p>Ted Williams really shows the true science of hitting and anyone who wants to develop good hitting skills should read this book.<p>I gave this to my son to read when he was 13 and by the end of the season he was hitting 400 points higher and with more power. Would he have developed that way without reading the book? I'll never know, but I'm sure the book made a difference in how he "aproaches" seeing a baseball. <p>It certainly helped me to know what to "look for" in his swing so I could give him constructive feedback based on what I learned from Ted Williams.<p>Get this book!</span>

                    <span>A MLB scout of 40yrs...and current college hitting instructor...told me to "get Ted's book and throw the rest away."  I got the book, but kept the others (Today i'd toss em out except Mike Epstein's book on hitting...it's worthwhile.)  At first reading the Williams' book appears disappointing...too many old-time stories from Ted's days as a ballplayer and coach.  Yet like a the game of checkers, the more you analyze (and read) the book, the deeper your understanding of hitting becomes.  The most amazing concept is that Mr. Williams "discovered" his hitting mechanics by trial and error...without the use of high speed video, etc.  His concepts are rather simple...1) get a good pitch to hit (study the pitchers and their tendencies), 2) use a lighter bat for quickness, 3) hips initiate the swing, 4) swing up (slightly) to increase your chances of hitting the ball "on plane" and 5) practice, practice, practice.<p>My daughters play softball and its mindboggling how poor the hitting instruction is at nearly all levels...including high school.  The forward weight shift, "hands thrown to the ball," and early wrist roll are wonderful ways to hit soft groundballs to second base. (And unless your daughter has amazing speed...mine don't...she'll hit about .180.)  Many players and coaches are amazed that my average-sized daughters possess such "power."  I'd love to think it's talent, but alas it's technique...proper hip rotation leading the hands...just as described by Williams, and an upward swing plane.  <p>The next time you're at a ballgame, see how many kids are actually swinging "upward"...pick those kids out and you'll immediately know the good hitters that have gotten good instruction.  <p>Get the book, study the drawings & photos...it makes so much sense.</span>

                    <span>I truly pity the pitchers who had to face this man. Ted Williams went about the craft of hitting a baseball in the same way that artillerymen go about finding a target. This book is a wonderful (and wonderfully readable) synthesis by a man whose considerable mental and physical capabilities were focused utterly on the idea of Getting A Hit. It almost turns hitting a baseball into a philosophical position. One of the premiere "How-to" sports books of all time.</span>
