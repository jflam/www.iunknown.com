                    <span>I live in Western Colorado and reading this book clued me into lots of beautiful back country routes that I didn't know about. If you're coming to Colorado on vacation (which I recommend higly) grab a copy and lay out your plans in advance. The detailed information on how difficult the various routes are is extremely useful, especially if you're not a competition 4 wheeler.</span>

                    <span>This is the book that set the standard for the plethora of guidebooks that have appeared in the past few years. I reviewed this book for a magazine shortly after it debuted in 1998 and was impressed by it's intuitive, easy-to-navigate layout, crisp detail and value for dollar. The big question became accuracy. I began using it in my many travels over Colorado backroads, some familiar, some not. In the end, I had to admit that Wells had hit the target every time. My only lament at the time was that the entire state wasn't covered. He answered this in '99 with Volume 2, which rounds up the remainder of the state. If you are headed for Colorado to 'wheel, I suppose you could buy whichever of the two books covers the area where you are going, but that's like heading for the OK Corral with a six-shooter that has only three bullets in it. Better pony up for both books if you are going to hit the Colorado backwoods. Bottom line is that you can count on Wells' trail guide to deliver to goods, and do it at a great price.</span>

                    <span>My wife and I were extremely skeptical we would be able to take our stock Ford Explorer on anything other than pavement or hard-packed dirt roads. This book changed that for us very quickly.<P>The book is divided into regions and gives details and descriptions of each trail. Each trail has been very accurately rated for difficulty level from novice to expert. We started out on a novice trail and from the first 5 minutes, we were hooked. The first trail took us to a great secluded hiking area and beautiful highland meadow and stream. The road was just difficult enough to provide appropriate challenges to a novice 4WD-er.<P>After this trip we ventured to the intermediate trails which were definitely more difficult, but well worth the effort. I would never have guessed that our stock SUV would have been able to tackle the terrain it did. It really makes you feel good about your purchase.<P>Overall, a very good book for beginners to advanced. I would recommend to anyone interested in taking up 4WD in Colorado or anyone who wants to get off the beaten path!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book before travelling from Ohio with ATVs. The book was extremely helpful in finding good trails to ride and to know what to expect. It is actually written for Jeeps and SUVs but since I could not find anything on ATV's this was the next best thing. If you are going to use ATV's or motorcycles you can adjust the difficulty levels accordingly. ie. Difficult for an SUV is Moderate for an ATV and so on. I am planning another trip out next summer and will probably buy Vol. 2.</span>

                    <span>Over the years, I think I've read most of the books on Colorado four-wheel drive roads, and probably have driven something like 25% of the roads described in this book. All things considered, Wells's book is the best of the bunch by a considerable margin. Errors are inevitable in books like these, but Wells seems to me to have made very few. In addition, the introductory how-to material was useful for tourist clods like myself.</span>
