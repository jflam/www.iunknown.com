                <span id="Label1">Flash MX offers the interactive Web designer a suite of powerful features, and <I>Flash MX Magic</I> describes how to use them in a solid, tutorial-based approach. Fourteen topnotch designers penned this compilation, covering a variety of intermediate and advanced features.<p>To make the most of this inspiring book, the reader should have Flash MX installed. The opening chapter covers Components, an important new feature in Flash MX that allows a designer to create modules that can be dropped onto the Flash stage. Components is an important new feature that changes how Flash movies are designed, making it much easier to build, integrate, and reuse parts, and the fact that they are featured in chapter 1 signifies this. Components are used in almost every subsequent chapter, covering such subjects as preloading movies, building interactivity using ActionScript, and adding database interactivity.<p>All the data and project files needed for each chapter are included on the CD-ROM, along with finished versions of each project. Also included are demo versions of Flash MX, Director, Dreamweaver, and FreeHand. Like other books in New Riders' Magic series, <I>Flash MX Magic</I> is rich with color screen shots, concise language, and clear explanations. These are not books for the casual Web coder, but for the serious Flash designer who intends to make the most of the medium.  <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>on the outside and when you browse through it looks to be pretty concise, the problem lies in the fact the book and cd don't match, I've seen other reviews that say they received no .fla files I have the .fla files but the work files are actually the same as the finished files except for the small fact that they don't work (code is exactly the same from what I can tell actionscripting wise but the examples never work and I spend more time deciphering the mistakes to double check my work than I do learning the ideas.  Maybe they should have made this a bug testing book at least you would have a chance to learn something.</span>

                    <span>i had tryied this book for about 2 weeks, i do agree that a lot of codes are not really working, poorly explain the reason why should we du that, and the code itself is very hard to follow even just trying to copy it from the book to the action window bcoz there is no line indecator there.<p>i am not really sure if this book is for begenner, intermidate, or advance flash user, since some workshop are just as simple as the tutorials that come with the software, but some are very long and hard to understand<p>this book is not to teach readers how to use the shoftware(or it just fails to teach), and also is not a book of creative idea that will help us out when we run out of idea while designing <p>that's why i said " i couldin't really see the point of the book"</span>

                    <span>Throughout the years I have read many goob and bad technical books. What I can say about Flash MX Magic is simple, do not purchase this book if you realy want to learn or master Flash. I'm still looking for a book that teaches in an easy and clear way. I have wasted my money on this book.<p>In overall don't fall in the trap by purchasing Macromedia Flash MX Magic.</span>

                    <span>First I give two huge thumbs up for the two previous books Flash 5 and 4 Magic. I will not say the same for Flash MX Magic. Unfortunately I wasted a weekend trying to understand chapter 14 in this book. The files on the CD and the updates didn't match the files in the book. This book ONLY teaches through example and poorly explains the thought process on why and how things work. The mistakes are so often and so irritating you wonder if the book was ever proofed before publishing. The best metaphore I can come up with is a cook book where the ingredients are mixed and matched from different recipes and  you have to guess whether or not you mix, stir or even cook the ingredients to come up with your final product. I lost a weekend of my life to this book. I want my weekend back!</span>

                    <span>DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Where's the magic?? I should have read the reviews before I bought this book. Instead I was lured in by the step by step projects, some of which matches what I want to do with my current project. The CD that came with the book doesn't contain any .fla files or project files in the "projects" folder. Just useless .swf files. The same damn files are repeated in the sample "movies" folder. So as you read the chapter and attempt to follow the instructions to recreate the project, you can't! You don't have any of the files the chapters refer to. You don't have anything to work with except your imagination.<p>I called the publisher and got the run around. Got transferred to five different numbers each with their own automated menu or message. Shame on you New Riders/Pearson Education. Never again will I buy another New Riders book!!!</span>
