                    <span>With this book and the Beyond Shyness self-help audio program, I pulled myself up out of a world of shame and guilt and frustration into a world of logic, compassion and clarity at a level I've never knew existed. I have a totally new understanding of my fellow man and have virtually rid myself of the critical, judgmental mindset that used to isolate me from anyone knew.</span>

                    <span>i have read this book some months ago and its impression is still on me.when i have to make a decisuion i also think what this book will advice me.i had been a SP/SAD many years and read a lot of books and this is ,i think ,one of the 3 best . its style isnt too clinicaly . it also help me to understand things that related to other problem of mine which i didnt knew that i suffer from (dependent personality). when you read it doesnt make you to fill that you have a defect in your brain but that you have some wrong behavior that you have to change(for your own good). it also have good advices for parents of shy people-something that i didnt see in other books.<p>very recommende.buy it yesterday !</span>

                    <span>I high recommend this book. Author notes the underlying causes of the problem. Then list all of the fears one can face(very authoritive exprience). And finally steps you through to overcome the problem. Very  practicable. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Being a senior in college, I decided to write a thesis that dealt with my major of Behavioral Psychology.  Indeed, I began work on the subject of shyness and social depression and started to read all of the books that I  could find on the topic.  In terms of pure information this book was the  not the best, but in terms of helping to lift the spirits of the reader, I  give this book full honors.  I am not shy, but I believe this book can help  people who are.</span>

                    <span>I was desperate for anything that could help with the social disorder that was destroying my son's life.  No book, no therapist, no method seemed to help my son.  Finally, Beyond Shyness was recommended to me by a friend  whose child had suffered from the same crippling disorder.  First I read  the book with the hope that I could aid my son in his process.  Then I let  my son read it.  But the book managed to take on a life of it's own and  managed to bring my son to a place where he began to have the desire to  deal with his problem.  Eventually, he started to see a local therapist and  he is now on his way to curing his problem.  Even though the reading of the  book took place well over a year ago, it was in truth the catalyst that  jumpstarted my son's recovery.</span>
