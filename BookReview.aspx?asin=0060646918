                    <span>I've studied the works of Dr. King since I was 7 years old, and now my 7 year old is studying him with great interest.  I figured this book (a gift) would be a good summation of his career instead of the other half dozen individual books I have in my library.  Well, as with his other work, there are many, many typographical errors.  I feel that a man of his education would be offended to see his works corroded by half-assed spell checking.</span>

                    <span>At a time when national leadership is scarce, trust is shallow, and American liberties are threatened by our own government, Dr. King's words again call for our active and essential advancement of freedom and goodness.  Read each entry, and when the spirit moves you read your favorite passages aloud.  Dr. King and his teachings embody and continue to celebrate the most noble and vital aspects of the real American Spirit.</span>

                    <span>I learned more about Dr. King and his philosophies by reading his actual words than I could have learned reading a history or biography. <p>I was surprised to learn that Dr King's journey was a long one even before civil rights movement, that he studied many schools of philosophical and religious thought. I was deeply impressed by his gifts with language, the ability to convey ideas in ways anyone can understand, and to inspire. Any writer could learn by studying his work.<p>If you are interested in human rights questions, I recommend  reading this piece by piece, though it is a large volume. So much of what King said isn't limited to the movements of 50 years ago, but to the ongoing struggle for human dignity and equality.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful resource.  I am particularly thrilled that it contains one of his best speeches (personally speaking): The Drum Major Instinct.  What a thorough work this is... mega thanks to the author for compiling this work.</span>

                    <span>"A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr.," edited by James M. Washington, is an impressive volume. This book brings together essays, speeches, sermons, interviews, and excerpts from King's books. Together, these many documents offer insights into the life and philosophy of a giant of the civil rights movement in the United States.<p>The book includes the "I Have a Dream" speech, the letter from Birmingham jail, the "Playboy" interview, and more. There are even fascinating transcripts from two television appearances.<p>This is a thought-provoking collection. I was fascinated by King's strong critique of that part of the white Christian establishment which opposed his movement. It is also intriguing to read that, apart from the Bible, King would choose Plato's "Republic" if he were to be marooned on the proverbial desert island with only one book. Also noteworthy is the emergence of King's multi-faith, global vision of humanity.<p>This is an important volume for those interested in African-American studies, 20th century U.S. history, or progressive currents in Christian theology. But more than that, "A Testament of Hope" is truly a testament for all people.</span>
