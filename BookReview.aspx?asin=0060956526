                <span id="Label1">Lucinda Bassett is one of those self-help professionals who deserve admiration. Severely agoraphobic through her mid-20s, she gradually overcame this and other personal hurdles to become the founder and president of the Midwest Center for Stress & Anxiety, as well as a bestselling author (<I>From Panic to Power</I>). Envious? Good! In <I>Life Without Limits</I>, Bassett helps readers take a more objective look at their feelings of envy--and other "success sabotage syndromes" (like fear of failure or success), the goal being to discover the positive, motivational properties of such "negative" feelings and to tap these properties to reach personal and professional goals. Bassett also does a bang-up job of guiding her readers through a dream-clarification process, so as to provide a clear road map for the journey.<p> While many of her suggestions sound familiar (accept feelings of fear; ask whether the fear is just an excuse for avoiding something else; stop the thought process and use self-talk to feel empowered), steps for creating a life-changing action plan and plenty of sample dialogue for healthy self-talk make this book quite practical. Two final chapters swing the focus from pure psychology to spirituality. Bassett describes how intuition, divine signs, miracles, prayer, and faith can enhance the many other, more proactive steps outlined in the book. Never preachy and often a bit humbled by her life experiences (she feels past business failures were the result of her asking God to save her mother's life after a stroke), Bassett handles these final topics with the same insight and sensitivity that she demonstrates throughout the earlier chapters. <I>--Liane Thomas</I> </span>

                    <span>This book has helped me to gain hope and courage to cope with all my fears and worries. Lucinda writes with such a great understanding and compassion. She herself had problems with panic and worry. Her positive thinking  tips are easy to follow, I don't get lost in alot of psycho babble. It's as if she's holding your hand sitting right beside you cheering you on! I believe I can do anything I set my mind to after reading this book. I plan to buy copies for all my friends. God bless Lucinda for writing this book!</span>

                    <span>Ms. Bassett has some great advice for anyone who is really interested in over-coming an anxiety disorder and/or depression. She's a true believer in the idea that these disorders can be cured, or managed even with some good guidance and coaching in facing your fears and achieving your goals. The chapter on listening to your intuition is astounding! Read this book purly for that chapter. I have applied those techniques and they work so fabulously well, I'm truly amazed. Her own intuition is always in overdrive, so be prepared to be wowed by her. I would consider her to be the expert in following your "God" voice, as she describes it. She has saved peoples lives and her own business from total ruination by listening to her intuition, so she's a proven expert on that subject. Also, her real-life stories will bring you to tears and teach you a thing or two about how to handle life situations. I recommend further reading of Rhonda Britten's books to really tackle all the issues of fear and living out your dreams. But, Lucinda's book is a must-read!</span>

                    <span>If I were to choose a book that influenced my life most significantly, I would pick this book and ¡°Total Self-Confidence¡± by Dr. Robert Anthony. Last Friday, I went on a six hour trip on a train in search of some answers to this question, ¡°How should I live my life?¡± During the six hours with this book I went though a most amazing experience; after the trip I realized that this book had given me clear goals and dreams and the courage to conquer my fears; I was no longer afraid of trivial things, and I stated to believe in myself. <p>Accompanying this book me to the trip was the one of the best things happened in my life, and I sincerely hope same happen to you too.</span>
