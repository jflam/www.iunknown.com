                    <span>If you're not a disciplined person, this is a must read. If you consider yourself disciplined, as I do myself, it helps you affirm your methodology of attaining your goals through the discipline model you incorporate in your daily personal and professional life. <P>For those of you who know Harris, I'm sure that you all will agree that he is by far the most disciplined person you have ever met. This book tells it like Harris lives it. Karen Willi contributes great insights to family disciplines and brings a balance that many of us forget when we are so focused on our careers. This stuff really works, and if you haven't discovered how to set and attain goals by managing your time and efforts then you need to read this book. One of my favorite quotes from the book is where Harris tells his readers to live their lives as if this is your last year on earth.</span>

                    <span>Page 161, Kerns 16th common phrase for the unprimed.<P>My humblest apologies for the delay in providing feedback on the book and in adding my rating to Amazon.com. (4 stars), taking it to 4.5 or just under.<P>Despite having started to read this the day we last spoke, I lacked the discipline to finish it earlier, however had time yesterday when I flew to Melbourne and Canberra. No excuses on my part. Too much time wasted in the interim, too many minutes lost. I noted down some of my thoughts last evening on the flight back from Canberra and I will just put these down as feedback as is and then summarise my thoughts.<P>Thought provoking, self affirmation, lessons from the heart, lift the self esteem, reinforcement, a recipe for worth, guilt trip, shared experiences, get me back on track, pathway of the future, not for luddites, easy to get lost upon the way, not for the feint of heart, born or made? can mere words succeed in transforming the masses, a lifelong journey.<P>A thoroughly enjoyable read. One that I will be getting the wife and two daughters to start on. Discipline, we all have it in some form or other, however many loose sight of it along the way (the easy path). Competing priorities and personal circumstance all influence us and detract our thoughts.<P>So much self affirmation of my life to date and the accomplishments made. Maybe after reading the book my wife will understand why I cant sleep in, get up at 05:00 to go for a run, am at work at 07:00 to beat the traffic and get early bird parking, refuse to let myself get sick, or when I am refuse to slow down and still go to work. Have to complete things in the one day and work to achieve this. Create the vision and help others live it. Provide empathy and walk the talk with staff. Honour my commitments where humanly possible. Never say die. Become bored when the challenging becomes the norm. Am always looking for new challenges and opportunities. Groan and moan in my sleep as my brain is still engaged in dialogue.<P>I once attended a presentation called the "Adrenalin Junkie" and saw significant reflection. Even to the point of flushing the toilet before you have finished peeing. The mind continuing to race. Finishing the sentence for others because they are too slow at completing it.<P>Your book (compliments to both you and Karen) is a work of self reflection, shared to bring about realisation and create aspiration. Also to bring a few lost sheep such as me back to the fold. We all get lost along the way as Karen eluded to and your book has helped me see the light once again and reinforce the discipline of mind that others see as a weakness. Peer pressure to conform to the norm, to fit in. Very influential in youth, but as you become more disciplined less important. Doing things for ones self, the key. Being able to lead by example and not caring if others disapprove. We are what we are and will be what we will be. The influence is within us.<P>Looking forward to getting back into making every minute more valuable.<P>Hoping we may one day get the opportunity to spend some time in reflection, face to face. I know we have a lot in common and followed similar paths, however I do not feel I have yet reached a comparable level of personal attainment and strive to make the rest of my life more challenging than the past almost 48 years.<P>Best wishes and kindest regards <P>Brian Kissell</span>

                    <span>Changing careers in my mid 40's was not only a bit intimidating, but demanded from me a committment to discipline in order to excell in my new field. In reading "Discipline: Training the Mind to Manage Your Life" by Harris Kern and Karen Willi, I realized that so many of us spend more time avoiding change, fearing the challenge of learning new things/ideas that we become stagnant. We don't grow as individuals and not only hold ourselves back, but miss the rewards when we truly give 150%. After reading the book, I felt refreshed and challenged to become the best I could be. Thanks Harris and Karen!</span>

                    <span>This is the worst self-help book I have ever read. It is written by two self-righteous, self-important people whose qualifications are questionable. It is written in the first and second person; either the author is patting himself on the back, or patting his co-author. It's great that they apply a discipline in their lives, but preaching it is different from giving those of us without self discipline the knowledge and "how-to's" to break the laziness habit. "Just do it" doesn't cut it. There are better books on the market for this subject.</span>
