                    <span>Seems like a book with ".NET Bible" in the title should cover the .NET framework. As mentioned previously it is stated in the preface that this is not a .NET book, but I don't see the preface printed above. This is a well written book for someone who wants to write MFC applications using Visual Studio.Net, but it devotes less than 100 pages to writing managed C++. Some features/screens in Visual Studio.NET have changed since the book was written. The author does a good job of digging into the details of how MFC works. If you are interested in the .NET Framework and Managed C++ I would recommend "Managed C++ and .NET Development".</span>

                    <span>This book is exactly as advertised - a great MFC book. I'm dumbfounded at some of the other reviewers who couldn't read the very first sentence of the "Who Is This Book For" page that clearly states that this book is an MFC book and *NOT* a .NET book. But that's they're problem. The bottom line is that I own about 10 MFC books - everything from Kruglinski to Prosise to Archer and this book is by far the best. You will absolutely not find better material on integrating COM/ATL with MFC or database chapters and he's the only VC++ author I know of who actually activately supports the book on his site. Well done, Mr. Archer!!</span>

                    <span>Several months ago, I was faced with a daunting challenge -- to develop a state of the art, user-friendly Windows application despite the fact that I had never written any Windows code. Armed with this book and a knoweldge of C++, I quickly mastered enough MFC, COM, and ATL to deliver a great product to a happy client. I couldn't have done it without this book. It will quickly give you the foundation to learn more advanced topics or move in whatever direction your work requires. If you supplement this book with the examples and www.codeproject.com or www.codeguru.com, you will be up to speed in no time.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book expecting the best as Tom Archer is an original CodeGuru founder and I was definitely not disappointed. As another reviewer noted the ATL and COM chapters are worth the price of the book by themselves. Add to that, Archer's unparralled database chapters and some great content on DLLs, custom drawn controls, dialogs, document/view, etc. etc. and you hdefinitely have a great book.</span>

                    <span>This is not for a beginner as stated in the forward. I was hesitant to buy a "Bible" book, but this one is great, covering all the important aspects of programming C++ on a Windows platform. My favorite thing is the coverage of C++, including Win32, MFC, ATL, WTL, .NET (MC++). If your looking to write more than "Hello World!", then grab this excellent book and let the well renowned author, Tom Archer, take you for an adventure.<BR> I read Tom's other book "Inside C#" and it was excellent as well.<BR>His books are to the point without fluff.</span>
