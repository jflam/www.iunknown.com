                <span id="Label1">Internationally acclaimed photographer Art Wolfe turns his lens to the colorful state of Colorado. From mountains to mesas, red rock to prairie, Art Wolfes mastery of light and pattern translates into intimate landscapes unlike any previously captured by camera.  <P>Art Wolfe has photographed many of the wild places of Colorado. As a climber and hiker, he is willing to search out special and remote views that arent accessible by vehicles or airplanes. That dedication to getting the shot is fully reflected in this magnificent book of landscape and wildlife photography. Wolfes aesthetic eye makes his compositions wholly unique; this is Colorado from a fresh perspective. Organized around mountains, forests, canyons and mesas, rivers and lakes, and valley, prairie and plain, Art Wolfes photography is paired with the probing essays of naturalist author Craig Childs.</span>

                    <span>Art Wolfe is a very good photographer, but I have to agree with the person who wrote the first review and say that this book was a bit of a disappointment. Wolfe didn't seem to spend a whole lot of time in Colorado, as most of the photos were taken from only a handful of locations. Also, about half of the photos were taken by Wolfe's assistant. That being said, there are definitely some nice photos, especially if you are looking for photos of Colorado wildlife.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I am in the process of photographing a Colorado  photography book myself, and I wanted to see what else was out there.   Although there are about 10 very impressive "close-up" photos in  this book, the rest of the images, especially the landscapes, are fairly  marginal.  In addition, most of the images were taken from just 4 or 5  locations throughout the state.  So it doesn't really give a thorough  representation of the variety of scenery in Colorado.  I do believe that  Art Wolfe is one of the nation's best nature photographers, but I think he  puts out a few too many books, thereby sacrificing quality.  I would  recommend this book over any of John Fielder's books, but David Muench's  Colorado II is still the best Colorado photography book I have seen.</span>
