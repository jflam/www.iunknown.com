                    <span>"The Millionaire Mind" is a great book about the lives of actually millionaires, not the people who look like millionaires but have nothing in the bank account.  The questionnaires that are returned from these millionaires reveal that they in fact did not do fantastic in school, they don't spend excessively, they spend their time shopping for investments and getting investment advice, and they work excessively hard at a job that they love to do.
<br />
<br />"The Millionaire Mind" takes a very mathematical approach, just like "The Millionaire Next Door".  However I found "The Millionaire Mind" to be much more readable as Thomas Stanley does a better job of writing up the correlations and summaries.  The amount of data included with the book is quite impressive and very useful.
<br />
<br />I really enjoyed learning about how millionaires overcome their fears lead frugal lifestyles.  I was equally impressed by the spouse chapter which talked about what factors are important in spouses.  Plus the overall theme of the book was that millionaires work very hard at their job, but they absolutely love their job.
<br />
<br />Despite being a great book, I found Stanley to be very repetitive.  I really thought this 400 page book could have easily been 300 pages if you cut out of the repetition.  Additionally I would have liked a glossary of definitions in the back of the book as some of the statistical jargon can be confusing at times.
<br />
<br />Overall, the book is fantastic.  The summaries that come out of the book are incredibly useful and anyone wanting to learn how to build wealth should pick up this book.  4 out of 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>This work is a Charter Member of my Self-Help Collection. 
<br />If you haven't read or heard it yet, then you are probably 
<br />still in the process of getting to where you want to be, rather than 
<br />WHERE you actually want to be. 
<br />
<br />The wisdom is profound, not just as it relates to money, but 
<br />in the way it clues you into the lifestyle choices that help 
<br />people get ahead instead of getting tied down or held down. 
<br />In my personal life, I considered the information in these CD's 
<br />very carefully while making my decision of who to marry -- and it's working out just great! 
<br />
<br />There are a number of KEY books that helped me to develop 
<br />the best aspects of myself as a man and as a person. This 
<br />book is a classic member of that collection. It is timeless, 
<br />universal, and very entertaining. 
<br />
<br />Other books and self-help products which are on par with this book are: 
<br />
<br />NEW SEX NOW: Life's Ultimate Pleasure 
<br />Giant Steps 
<br />RICH DAD, POOR DAD 
<br />How to Win Friends and Influence People 
<br />Self Matters 
<br />7 Spiritual Laws of Success 
<br />Ageless Mind, Timeless Body 
<br />THE 4 AGREEMENTS 
<br />The Power of Concentration 
<br />GODDESS WORSHIP 
<br />
<br />I believe that anyone who wants to be a great person would do well to study all of the above very sincerely.</span>

                    <span>Basically more of the millionaire next door with more statistics and better stories.  Stanley breaks down the millionaires along racial groups, occupations, types of businesses, the vehicles they drive, how most married well, and their stablility, etc.  There is also a forumula for determining if you are on your way to being a millionaire...basically you don't have to have a lot of expensive looking assets to be considered rich.  The formula can determine if you're well on your way to making the most of what you got.  No hype here, just practical research on the small few, who are easy to spot and easy to emulate once you know what to look for.... </span>

                    <span>This book is almost three times as thick as the original classic "The Millionaire Next Door", is full of statistics and numbers, not well cohesively written and a disroganized layout.  I would read the classic first and check this book out at your local library.
<br />
<br />My impression after reading and finally finishing this book was that Stanley wanted to create another bestseller, but this one was a mere compilation of facts and was not as well received by the critics as his classic.  I imagine if you're a statistician or actuarian you're going to love this, but if you want a fast, easy, and conclusive read this is not for you.
<br />
<br />In retrospect, I could have spent my time better than reading this book.  What a disspointment .... especially after reading "The Millionaire Next Door."</span>

                    <span>This book is fantastic. When it was over, I wished there was more. The author very rarely gives his opinion, instead it's always "The majority of millionaires polled __blank__" or "73% of millionaires polled __blank___". The "blanks" are things like: "live well within their means", "only invest in houses that are close to excellent public schools, and thus don't find need to send their kids to private schools", "invest when the economy is not booming", "have been married to the same person for 20+ years", etc. What I like about this book is that the author stuck to his topic of relaying his findings on the millionaires he surveyed/met with. It's not a book of "I think this is what you Should Do", its a book of "this is what thousands of successful millionaires Did Do, and Continue To Do." This book is pure gold to anyone who has a mind open enough to listen to its teachings. I will be purchasing a copy of this book, and will read it countless times over the course of my life time.
