                <span id="Label1"><p><i>MCSD Analyzing Requirements and Defining .NET Solution Architectures Exam Cram 2 (Exam 70-300)</i> helps you pass the 70-300 exam, which is a core exam in the MCSD .NET track and measures the ability to analyze requirements and define Microsoft .NET solution architectures. This exam is extremely tricky, widely considered the most difficult of any MCSD exams because of its emphasis on case studies as well as its demand that candidates have at least two years of hands-on experience. This book is not intended to teach new material. Instead, it assumes that you have a solid foundation of knowledge but could use a refresher on important concepts, as well as a guide to exam topics and objectives. The book features test-taking strategies, time-saving study tips, and a special Cram Sheet that includes tips, acronyms, and memory joggers not available anywhere else! The Cram Sheet is especially useful for last-minute review before the test begins.</p><p>The CD features PrepLogic&trade; Practice Tests, Preview Edition. This product includes one complete PrepLogic Practice Test with approximately the same number of questions found on the actual vendor exam. Each question contains full, detailed explanations of the correct and incorrect answers. The engine offers two study modes, Practice Test and Flash Review, full exam customization, and a detailed score report.</p><p>The best-selling Exam Cram 2 series is supported online at examcram.com, offering industry news, study tips, practice questions, and discussion forums. Each book is published under the direction of Series Editor Ed Tittel, the leading authority on IT certification. This book has been subjected to rigorous technical review by a team of industry experts, ensuring content is superior in both coverage and technical accuracy, and has earned the distinction of Cramsession&trade; Approved Study Material.</p></span>

                    <span>I used this book as my primary study guide for the 70-300 exam and passed last week. Like the earlier versions for the 70-100, this book gives you a great overview of everything that can show up on the exam. The writing style is friendly and conversational, really a pleasure to read. I also recommend supplementing this with the Transcender practice tests.</span>

                    <span>I just got out of my 70-300 exam, which I passed after a half a day of studying. But that's after passing 70-100 a couple of years ago, and it probably doesn't hurt to have 20 years in the business, more of which was spent in MS technologies than any other. This book made a big difference. My half-day was very well spent, and the information contained in the book was mostly very pertinent. The exam's more about reading comprehension and the details of the case studies than anything else, but you need to be solid on ER and data modeling, and also very clear about which steps are part of which project phase. Also, bone up on your ORM notation. You may never use it in real life, but it will show up on the test.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was one of the best Exam Cram books I've ever read. I truly felt that the author had written the exam and was providing me with a targeted overview of what needed to be covered. I would highly recommend this book with another exam prep resource such as Transcender and you should be fine for the exam. I should say though that I have both of the previous versions of the MCSD too so given the fact that I have already passed 70-100 this was more of a refresher for me.</span>

                    <span>I did not find this book helpful in studying for the test. While the information may be good, it did not accurately represent the material covered by the test.<P>The reason I am rating this book so low is because of the numerous errors I found in the practice questions. (One was a simple mathmatical conversion that an editor should have caught.) Most of the other errors were typographical and fairly easy to catch, but it made me wonder how many errors I did not find. If I bought the book to ensure I could pass the test, then I may not have the knowledge to know when the book was leading me astray.<P>As an added negative the preview of the PrepLogic practice exam on the CD was laughably poor. The questions and answers appeared to have been cut & pasted together multiple times. (One sentance embedded in another, the first 10 words of the sentance repeated, etc. etc.) Another problem is that the test only had multiple choice questions; there are other question types that test takers might want to practice before the test. If you want a practice test, pay the money for the Transcender one.</span>
