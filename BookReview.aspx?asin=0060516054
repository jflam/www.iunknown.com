                <span id="Label1"><p> For centuries, the world of Islam was in the forefront of human achievement -- the foremost military and economic power in the world, the leader in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed. The West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and then in the marketplace. </p> <p> In this elegantly written volume, Bernard Lewis, a renowned authority an Islamic affairs, examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to make sense of how it had been overtaken, overshadowed, and dominated by the West. In a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil, Lewis shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry, industry, government, education, and culture. He also describes how some Middle Easterners fastened blame on a series of scapegoats, while others asked not "Who did this to us?" but rather "Where did we go wrong?" </p> <p> With a new Afterword that addresses September 11 and its aftermath, <i>What Went Wrong?</i> is an urgent, accessible book that no one who is concerned with contemporary affairs will want to miss. </p></span>

                    <span>Bernard Lewis's "What Went Wrong?" gives readers a concise account of the decline of Arab society over the last five hundred years, primarily by looking at different areas of competition between East and West. Lewis begins with the Treaty of Carlowitz where, for the first time, the Turks were forced to come to terms with the Austrians. Throughout the ensuing decades the Ottomans gained and lost ground, but by the nineteenth century the various populations of the empire were in revolt. "The Ottoman state and armed forces were as effective as they had ever been...it was European invention and experiment that changed the balance of power." In commerce the Arabs also lagged behind Europe. As the Industrial Revolution swept through Europe, various countries of the Middle East attempted to catch up by building factories. These efforts failed and the factories soon became derelict. Science provides another example of Arab decline. The Medieval Arabs inherited a vast corpus of knowledge from the Greeks, Egyptians, and Babylonians and they added their own insights to that received wisdom; but by the end of the Middle Ages this came to an end. "In the Muslim world,"Lewis writes,"science was reduced to the veneration of approved knowledge." It is difficult to generalize about the causes of imperial decline but one reason is stagnation. When societies are no longer able to take advantage of new information, technology, or ideas they are doomed to be left behind. "What Went Wrong?" also benefits from its unflinching moral tone. Lewis makes clear that the Arabs have no one but themselves to blame for their current problems. Among more and more Middle Easterners the question: "Who did this to us?" is giving way to "What did we do wrong?" and subsequently "How do we put it right?" "In that question," Lewis concludes, and in the various answers that are being found, lie the best hopews for the future."</span>

                    <span>The name Bernard Lewis, Cleveland E. Dodge professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, evokes different responses in different places. In the West he is celebrated as "the doyen of Middle Eastern studies". In the Middle East, he is viewed with a mixture of admiration and skepticism. His new book What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response, much praised in the Western press, attracted some pretty bad reviews from Middle Eastern newspapers.<P>Lewis is accused of trumpeting Western superiority over other civilizations and of "either accidentally or deliberately overlooking or ignoring well-known facts about the Middle Eastern culture". But despite all his flaws and biases it must be acknowledged that Lewis is not one of your run of the mill Orientalist. He has spent decades studying and analyzing the Muslim world and provides unique insights into the Muslim world through the eyes of a Westerner.<P>In What Went Wrong? Lewis attempts to understand what led to the decline of Islamic civilization after a remarkable period of unparalleled dominance. For many centuries, the Islamic world was at the forefront of all human achievement in fields as varied as militarism, economics, arts and sciences. At the same time, Christian Europe was considered a land of the barbarians from which there was nothing to learn or fear.<P>Generally, the book obviously is written by someone who has enouugh background on the matter, and is fairly neutral in his analysis.</span>

                    <span>Don't read this book if you want a pat answer to the question posed in the title. What Lewis provides is an introduction to how difficult the question really is. He starts with a brief history of the interaction between Muslim countries and the West since the middle ages when the Middle East was home to the most advanced cultures on every front, from art to commerce and from science to human rights. While he proffers many anecdotes that highlight the attitudes that produced the decline of the Middle East, he settles on no clear answer. Why, for example, did it take several centuries for the printing press to become generally used in Islamic countries, even though it was well known?<P>Clearly, the initial arrogance and insularity of the Muslim countries gave the West a running head start once the Renaissance began, but that cannot be the complete explanation. Further, the suppression of women that leaves half the population as non-contributors also plays a role. One of the most promising lines of inquiry turns on the lack of an Islamic concept of separation of church and state such as that engendered in Christianity by the "render unto Caesar" text in the New Testament. By the end however, we are left with the conviction that there is no easy answer, and that the conflict between Islamic fundamentalists hell-bent on a return to the past and western societies intent on increasing, not decreasing, connectivity throughout the world will likely be with us for the rest of this century.</span>

                    <span>I have been busilly reading a book I bought at the airport in Korea (for only 19000 korean won) called "What went wrong?", by a (quote) "towering figure among experts of the Muslim world". I don't think they realised the pun ("twin towers - tower-ing figure"). His thesis is basically that the Muslims hate the West because the supremacy of Islamic culture was eclipsed by the West in the 14th to 18th centuries, and they can't come to terms with being overtaken by infidel. Maybe so, but this Prrinceton Prroffessor (excuse the spit) neglects to mention that U.S. Occupation of the Middle East might also be pissing them off. In fact, the word "oil" appears nowhere in this book, even though it talks of events up to and after Sept 11 2001. He mentions Usama Bin Laden (and to his credit he spells the name correctly), but not the fact that Usama objects to U.S. military forces stationed in the Muslim holy land. U.S.A is not mentioned in any context other than being the victim of unreasoning psycopathic hatred by a bunch of cultural has-beens who can't accept the fact.<P>But to give the book it's due, it IS an interesting account of the Moslem World from the 14th to 18th centuries.</span>
