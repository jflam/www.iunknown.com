                    <span>This book is a lifesaver for anybody with children. When I bought this book, I just had my first baby. Lack of organization has thrown our household back with tons of chores piling up every week. This book has given me a lot of good ideas about the way to run a house smoothly. The best thing about it - you do not have to do it all in one day. The author stresses out that you can do it bit by bit and you will eventually get to a clean well-organised home.<P>The most valuable thing for me was the idea of a monthly planner. It does not matter if you are a busy professional or a housewife. To catch the bull by the horns you ought to have one.<P>One more thing, after reading the book you will understand that there no picture-perfect homes (of course, if somebody lives there). If your house is, and you are a clean-it-all slave of it, read this book. It will help you ease your cleaning passion and start enjoying life instead.<P>I am planning to stock up on a few copies of the book. Next time I am invited to a wedding, I will have an exellent addition to a present.</span>

                    <span>Wonderful. This book was what encouraged me to begin my quest of organizing my life. This book covers all aspects of organizing your life- organizing time, cooking and meal planning, cleaning house, etc. Although it covers just about every part of a home, it is not overwhelming. <P>If you are interested in organizing your home and want a starter book, I would suggest you consider this book. In this book she discusses the whys, how tos, and what fors of organizing every aspect of your life. <P>If you are already on the road to organizing and want a book that will give you cheap and easy hints and solutions to storage, I would put forth that Confessions of a Happily Organized Family is more about the how to of organizing. She provides a wealth of suggestions for storage and organizing solutions that are not very expensive and easy to make and/or buy. <P>Either way, both are good. Both are full of ideas. And for me, most importantly, both are encouragine and realistic.</span>

                    <span>by the price, the look, the description, and most of all by the advertisements listed on the cover and elsewhere for numerous ~1001 hints~ types of books that this would be a waste of money. time to rack another one up as a learning experience.<P>this book can be summed up in a few words, and many less pages than the 212 you would end up paying for: kitty litter trays, dishpans in "designer" colors, ice cube bins, drawer dividers, cup hooks, shelving units made of boards'n'bricks, and a calendar-style planner.<P>ponder deeply the implications of using those items in your life, and save the $10.00 you would have spent to learn "the secrets of uncluttering your home" from this book. it may sound as if i'm spoiling the ending for you, but as far as i can tell none of those items has been a secret for the last half-a-century.</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for several years (probably about 5) and it has served me quite well. Although there are very few 'new' ideas for organizing the home, this book is an excellent reminder of everything I know but keep forgetting about.<P>I enjoy the tone of this book and go back to it everytime I feel like things are getting a little disorganized and I need to remember how to get them back under control.<P>I would definately suggest this book to friends. <P>P.S. Her system for organzing bills has worked so well for me that I started it the first time I read the book and have used it unfailingly every month for the last 5 years...I never stick with anything that long unless it's really good.</span>

                    <span>Deneice could have cut the size of this book in half, but she likes to give twenty examples for each scenario. Yes, I understood the running list idea. The first example clarified it further. The sixteenth, however is boring.<P>Most of her writing is directed toward families with children, so DINKS and singles can skip this book. I wish I would have. Why didn't I buy "Organizing Plain and Simple"? Also, either she has a 1950s mentality or this book hasn't been updated since it was published in 1952, er I mean 1982. Ever heard of a computer, Deniece?<P>And one more thing ... saving up to buy a trash can for a son's room? Look, if you can't afford to buy a trash can for little Timmy's room, you have failed miserably as a person and should not even have children.</span>
