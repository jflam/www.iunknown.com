                <span id="Label1">As a young boy, Tiger Woods dominated the junior ranks, winning a record three U.S. Junior Championships in a row. As an amateur, he triumphed again, winning three consecutive U.S. Amateur Championships. And as a pro, he continues to dominate the world of golf, recently becoming the only man in the history of the game to hold four major championship trophies at one time: the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA. <br><br> With insightful and intelligent analysis, golf writer John Andrisani reveals for the first time the secrets that Tiger Woods has learned from family, fellow competitors, and teachers about the all-important mental game of golf. Andrisani shows how Earl Woods's lessons on course-management skills and the art of mental toughness have given his son an important edge over more experienced competitors time and time again; how Tida Woods taught her son the Buddhist values of patience, tenacity, and self-reliance. As well, Andrisani offers insights into the roles of former teachers Rudy Duran and John Anselmo in helping Tiger make the vital connection between mental awareness and good scoring, and how his present teacher, Butch Harmon, is passing on what he learned about the mental side of golf from legends such as Ben Hogan. Additionally, Andrisani shows how Dr. Jay Brunza, a clinical psychologist, has shown Tiger how to enter an intense "cocoon of concentration" while playing competitive golf. <br><br> <i>Think Like Tiger</i> gives golf fans a deeper appreciation of Woods's remarkable mastery of the inner game and shows how these same techniques can be applied to anyone's game for lasting improvement.</span>

                    <span>This one is one with which you have to read between the lines. Think like Tiger? Sure. Why not? Because there is to much more to the game than thinking through the game. Nicklaus, Watson, Palmer--even Tiger--have all spoken of the intuitive aspects of the game and how too much thinking can be the death of your next round.<P>John Andrisani, in his book THINK LIKE TIGER: AN ANALYSIS OF TIGER'S MENTAL GAME, wants us to believe that Tiger is a golf-a-matic, an android that has been programmed by thought and is constantly on autopilot. Yes, Tiger is one of the greatest thinkers in the game but he is still human as evidenced by his mediocre 2003 season. His strategies during that season were no different than in previous seasons but the results were.<P>So what happened? Golf, that's what happened. Golf is a streaky game. Think about David Duvall. He finally won a major and everyone said he was back. Then all of a sudden it was over. For now. That's golf and no one, not even Tiger, is above it.<P>Andrisani in THINK LIKE TIGER... seems to preach that somehow Tiger is above the game. Reading the book one would think that Andrisani is telling all the competition that they might as well accept second place because there is no way, really, to think like Tiger. So what does that say for the rest of us and why should we buy and read this book?<P>All is not lost with THINK LIKE TIGER... but you must be careful to see past Andrisani's all too apparent and excessive hero worship.<P>The book delineates some very good things about the mind game of golf. I would recommend that you read it. But don't expect a book that will shave strokes appreciably from your game.<P>THE HORSEMAN</span>

                    <span>In his analysis of Tiger Woods's mental game, Andrisani points out the methods by which Tiger manages to keep focused on his game and block out distractions and negative thoughts. Visually programmed by his father so that his mental image of the perfect golf swing became part of his psyche as an infant, he doesn't have to think about what he's doing right or wrong with his own swing. Introduced to Buddhism by his mother when he was a small child, he knows how to meditate and relax. Taught by coaches how to focus on where he wants his shots to go, rather than what's going on with his swing or his score, he knows how to get into "the zone." And he may, according to Andrisani, employ a post-hypnotic code (through very slow eye-blinks) to keep himself from being distracted.<P>The book does not, however, give the reader a way to "learn the secrets of Tiger Woods's mental game and think your way to lower scores," as the jacket suggests. While Tiger's methods work for him, it's probably too late for the rest of us to learn and apply these methods, and the pointers about imagining where you want your shots to go and trying to relax are not new. Andrisani's admiration for Tiger and his "handlers" is overwhelming, and it's hard to take seriously the statement of his first teacher (after his father) that he felt "a little like a house painter being asked to redo the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel" when he was asked to help the eleven-year-old Tiger to improve. While the development of Tiger's mental game may, indeed, resemble "the forming of a diamond," and "the making of fine wine," some of us would be happy with cubic zirconia and plonk.

                    <span>Okay, let's think about this one. Is Tiger Woods the golfing machine that John Andrisani wants us to believe he is? Or is he human, at the pinnacle of his game and cruising? Golf is all about streaks. Think about Johnny Miller. At the top of his game everyone was saying that HE was the next Nicklaus. Then all of a sudden it was as though he had been abducted by aliens. Go, Tiger, go! But I won't be the least bit surprised when the streak ends and Tiger ends up stumping Mizuno or Maxfli or Golfsmith instead of Nike.<P>Well...maybe. <P>The book does bring to the table some very good things about the mind game of golf. Tiger aside, this book could have been just as good without Andrisani's overt Tiger Woods hero worship that literally drips from every page.<P>Go ahead and read it. Not too bad, really. Not too deep. Definitely not earth shattering.</span>

                    <span>As anyone who is serious about golf knows, the game is 90% mental. Renowned teaching professional John Andrisani draws on interviews with Tiger's Mom, Dad, ex-coaches, and current one Butch Harmon to piece together what tips have made him into perhaps the greatest player the game will ever know. That being said, anyone who wants to improve at golf NEEDS to read this book. Lessons with pros are fine, IF you have unlimited time and money to pursue them. Save yourself both strokes on the course, grief, and money by getting a hold of this book! One of the most impressive aspects of 'Think Like Tiger' is the tips Butch Harmon learned from one of golf's other all-time legends--- Ben Hogan which are passed on here. Additionally, it is interesting to learn that Tiger's mother Tida introduced him to Buddism which he uses to relax, calm his mind, and meditate. His father Earl also tells how he prepped Tiger on the need for ignoring all distractions etc by rattling golf clubs during his back swing and other tricks to build his total focus. There is even a claim made that Tiger saw a hypno-therapist named Dr. Jay Brunza, a former navy man to help him with his pre-shot routine. This may be speculation, but then again, it may not. After all, who could possibly completely explain Tiger's total domination of a game so fickle and capricious? In short, it's fair to warn the reader that 'The Man' himself DID NOT collaborate with Andrisani on the writing of this book. However, Adrisani's keen insigts into all aspects of the game and his other reliable sources, more than make up for this short-coming. I found this to be a short, and incredibly insightful read. If you really want to play better golf, do yourself a favor and get your hands on a copy of this book A.S.A.P!</span>

                    <span>All you need to know about this book is that there is a disclaimer on the back cover which tells you that Tiger Woods had nothing whatsoever to do with the creation of this book. I bought and read the book before I saw the disclaimer. Stupid me. Shame on me; much more shame on John Andrisani. You won't learn anything, or at least anything useful. Look into Manuel De La Torre or Dede Owens (especially "Smart Golf") to really improve your golf game.</span>
