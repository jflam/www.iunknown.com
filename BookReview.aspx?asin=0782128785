                    <span>I have been programming in VB for about 9 years now - 4 years in VB.Net. Whether you are biginner or intermediate, you really need this book if you want to master the concept and skills of programming in vb.net. Even advanced programmers will discover things they have never thought about using this book. I am really impressed. This is the book that covers rearly all aspects of VB.Net and .Net framework en general that you as programmer will need to develop a professional programme. If you get this book, I sueggest that you read all chapters. Even the chapters that you think you are familiar with the topic; you will be surprised what you will discover that you did not know. If you are familar with the topic, just scan it and see. 
<br />This is a great book

                    <span>This is not the book for a light superficial reader. This is a book for a serious learner. I have been dancing around the idea of database programming in VB.net for several months now. But this is the book that has really got me started.<p>    I admit I threw away this book after reading 6 pages in the first chapter. It has got me confused and overwhelmed by all the new glossary and high detail level. But a couple of weeks later I have decided to give it another try. And I thank God I did so.<p>    Skipping the first two (basic science) chapters you can start rightaway by the third (visual database tools) chapter and still keep up. Beleive me if I said that each single word from there on is an essential piece of information.<p>    Although I haven't finished reading it but I thought it's quite fair to clarify the above points about this great and serious book.<p>    I am really enjoying reading it, I take it with me everywhere. And I have started already practically verifying examples to help me through the course of learning which is by the way "Amazing"...</span>

                    <span>This is the worst VB book I've read in all of my life, I needed to get to speed with ADO .Net, and as this book's title says "Mastering" I thought this could be the one I needed, especially after reading some of the other reviews.<p>If you are an absolute and complete beginner in database programming this book might help you, but if you already know your basics, step away from it and get David Sceppa's book instead. Half of this book is about the basics of Transact-SQL, but the really basics, not the advanced stuff, and after that you get a bunch of really dumb examples of the database objects that will rise too much doubts in your head, instead of helping you, you'll just get more confused.<p>I gave it two stars, because I was able to use a couple of examples in one of my applications, but that was after I had read Sceppa's book.<p>What a dissapointment.</span>

                    <span>I think that a book for computer programming can only be evaluated by the manner how we use it.<br>Almost a year passed since I bought the Mastering Visual Basic .NET Database Programming and this book is still on my desk and is used regularly for advice.<br>The book covers nearly all areas of .Net Framework technology and it is exceptionally useful for people who like me do not have a programming, but rather an engineering background.<br>As marine engineer I can say that this book helped me a lot in my job.<br>I am sure that a lot of my colleagues are a little bit upset about the continuous changes of the software environment.<br>The people who write the software for the marine industry did not completely understand the marine terminology and engineering logic on board.<br>As customers we still cannot find a `ready product' that is suitable for our purpose.<br>I presume that a lot of my colleagues try to write their own applications as is requested on board. Therefore I would say without hesitation that this book is exactly written for people with a similar background to mine in an exceptionally simple and comprehensible language.<br>Of course the technology is changing by hour, but the basic knowledge one should know can be found in this book.</span>
