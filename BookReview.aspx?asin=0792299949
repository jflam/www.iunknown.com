                    <span>With 30 years of some of the best documentaries around to choose material from, it scarcely matters that there is no new footage. The narration seamlessly bridges the gaps between the various shorts from National Geographic specials of the past. I wasn't sure what to expect, since it is essentially teasers of other films, but this is a great film in its own right.<P>We got the film for our little boys, and they've loved it from day one. My older son is learning a lot about the differing relationships of the natural world, and the broad expanse of this film is perfect for him. It never gets bogged down in the mundane, but it also panders to a long attention span. This is a big difference from the National Geographic videos intended specifically for kids. They tend to be the same basic idea...cut footage from older films, but cut so that there is no footage of animals eating each other, no mating, and it is interspersed with unneccesary music videos and cutesy animation. Even with Dudley Moore's narration, it can't compete. Skip the kid stuff and give your kids the real thing.</span>

                    <span>This video definitely holds up to repeat viewing. It offers a wealth of information on a wide variety of subjects and could easily have been an hour longer.<P>National Geographic really hit the mark with this video. Although it's a promotional tool, it stands on its own merits as an educational, entertaining, family video.</span>

                    <span>If you buy this DVD, you'll end up owning a lot more National Geographic Videos. And that's a good thing!<P>Sure, it a teaser. And there is no new material. It's a compilation made out of the best of their other movies. All their movies are good, so this one is the creme de la creme!<P>One new thing that this film does do...is drive home the point what an incredible organization they have been over the years...and how wonderful their films have been. As I watchd the movies, the voices of the narrators, particularly Jaques Cousteau, brings back memories of watching these films as a child. <P>And there are some crazy and totally memorable scenes...the little lizard running across the water...the spider and the tarantula...the lions...the elepahants....I could go on and on.<P>You'll love it...go ahead, buy it...you'll cherish it!</span>

                    <span>This movie will be one of the cults of natural geographic's. The subjects differ from dancers to insects. I think everybody can find something about himself in this dvd. Sound quality and scenes are perfect. Extra features (pictures, cameramen dared movie)are good. This movie must be in all documentary lovers' library.</span>
