                    <span>I'm a gay white male and I loved this book! Collins does an amazing job presenting her compelling thesis, and I continue to thank Sociology in general for being the most daring, critical-thinking academic discipline ever. It's no surprise sociologists like Collins dare to speak out on gay rights issues (see her section on homophobia/heterosexism) - sociology is the only area of thought that consistently questions the status quo. In a day in age where so many (though by no means all!) African-American (heterosexuals) are horribly anti-gay and increasingly pro-greed/pro-capitalism, Collins stands out as a heroine for all peoples. I am still waiting for an openly gay hip-hop artist!! How cool would that be? I recommend this book to absolutely anyone. Five stars!</span>

                    <span>about how society conspire to restrain black women from realizing their potential as citizens in America.  The racially skewed beauty standards is one.  The relentless stereotyping of black women is another.  Both tried to keep down the spirits of a group of women Americans trained to despise.  I hope Ms. Collins comes out with another book about us.</span>

                    <span>Patricia Hill Collins exemplifies a practitioner's and theorist's point of view on black feminism as it relates to Africa American and our African sisters. She references critical and inspiring data and quotes from a varied repetoire of authors, historians, and philosophers.   The author explains the context and format of her subject upon initial reading.  This book also draws commonalities among the issues and concerns among African American women and our international sisterhood (i.e., African, Carribean, etc.,)  It illustrates the social and cultural values among all groups, the commonalities among the values while focusing on the African American feminist aspect.  This is a must read for any person, be it woman or not, African American or other.  It brings about a social and cultural understanding that is pertinent to the "holonomy" of understanding and appreciating varied cultural, social and historical values and experiences while commencing to the building of community. Please add this title to your collection of literature.  You won't be disappointed; if for nothing more than to open your world to receive another perspective.</span>

                    <span>Collins'analysis of black feminism is an enlightening piece of literature that forces its readers to chanllenge main stream assumptions and discover the underlying mechanisms of racism and sexism in America. To create this  effect, she uses a range of feminist perspectives form the calm subtleties  of Angela Davis to the slightly boisterous philosopy of Bell Hooks.  Nevertheless, by displaying these perspectives equally Collins shows that  the struggle for equally is not an individual struggle but one that  requires collectively.  This book is intensely thought provoking and it is  guaranteed to give its readers profound insight into black feminism.</span>
