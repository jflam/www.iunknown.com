                    <span>This book written by an IBM technician does not convey useful information. Every other page or so, the author re-informs us as to how clever he is and how his theories have revolutionized the world. This book does not support his contentions. He discusses various statistical data that he has studied and concludes that stock prices are very hard to predict. Nothing new there! When he talks about his pioneering work in Economics one is reminded of the recent disclosure that several Nobel-winning economists utilize a run of the mill money market fund to build their retirement nest egg - not an impressive choice of investment vehicle. This is a book that did not deserve to be written.</span>

                    <span>There is an old joke that if you asked three economists for their opinions, you'd get four different answers.  The point, of course, is that there is a high amount of ambiguity in the field of economics; for predictive ability, it is not quite as bad as consulting tarot cards, but it does lack the typically clean rules of a science like physics.  The money (quite literally) is in the economic model that can best predict the future and let investors know what and when to buy and sell.  
<br />
<br />The laws of physics works well in virtually all situations, getting only tricky in isolated circumstances (such as black holes).  Economics, on the other hand, has much fuzzier rules in almost all circumstances.  To put it in physics terms, Mandelbrot's contention would be that the science of economics is Newtonian (or maybe even pre-Newtonian) in an Einstein world.  And with medieval rigidity, the powers-that-be will stay with their basic dogma (refining only as necessary) and will dismiss more modern ideas as heresy.
<br />
<br />In particular, Mandelbrot points to the fact that economists, by relying on bell-curve models, are failing to plan for extreme swings in the market.  Aberrations in market activity are much more common than these models predict, which points out their flaws.   Mandelbrot's alternative - based on his own work in fractals - is based on something called power laws, which better take into account the "natural" turbulence of the market.
<br />
<br />Mandelbrot is clear that his ideas will not make people richer, but it may keep them from getting poorer by understanding how markets work better.  His writing (or that of his collaborator) is entertaining and informative without getting too technical (these details are saved for the notes).  On the other hand, he is too close to this subject to be truly objective, and I was often left wondering if his ideas were truly better or if he merely did a good job of making them seem like they were.  Even Mandelbrot admits that his ideas may seem heretical, but that in themselves doesn't make them right or wrong.  While good and thought-provoking, this book should be taken more as a well-supported opinion piece than scientific truth. </span>

                    <span>At the beginning of the book the author discusses modern theory of finance. In the following chapters he very systematically takes it apart. Efficient markets, modern portfolio theory, efficient frontiers, random walk, value at risk and other nonsense - all this just does not work. There is much more randomness, chance, unpredictability in the markets than is taught by current academia. The tails are much fatter than we would expect. Than again, this probably is the reason why most market professionals make their living by offering advisory service rather than trading. 
<br />
<br />This book does not contain recipes or trading systems that will make you rich and are able to buy that yacht (for that you should rather become a fund manager, then you can do worse than the market and still enjoy the rewards). This book gives a deep insight on how the markets actually work. Or at least how they don't. Fun to read too.</span>

                    <span>If you only buy books in the series "For when you only have time for answers", then this book is not for you.
<br />
<br />Mandelbrot's book gives you strong hints about a possible financial model of the markets, but doesn't claim anything beyond providing you with an intellectual framework to start attacking the problem from an entirely different perspective to the "Efficient Markets" or the "Black-Sholes" current theology.
<br />
<br />If you feel stuck in your current market practice, or find that what you do every day doesn't reconcile with the current theory, then this book might be a first attempt at reconciling your daily exerience with a strong theoretical model. 
<br />
<br />If your current practice is that you do it "because it works" but you feel uncomfortable with doing things for which you have no rational explanation, then Mandelbrot's book will set you on a path of deeper understanding. By the end of the book, you still won't know the answer, but you will have learnt a tremendous amount on the way actual price series might work.
<br />
<br />Definitely not for casual reading.</span>

                    <span>While this book may be an interesting read from a purely intellectual point of view, it offers no practical advice in terms of investment decisions, other than to point out that  financial markets can be volotile and risky - something which is obvious to any investor. 
<br />
<br />A much more useful theory of fractals in the financial markets is "The Elliott Wave Principle" by Frost and Prechter (1978).  For "The Elliott Wave Principle" actually posits a theory with predictive value and, hence, practical value to investors.  </span>
