                    <span>As is usually the case when I see a movie before I read the book, I couldn't help but picture Jack Nicholson when I read about Randle Patrick McMurphy. Considering how good the movie is, though, this isn't a bad thing. My only complaint about this book is that I didn't read it sooner. Hilarious, touching, infuriating, and haunting, this is the complete novel. Although the story is told from the point of view of Chief Bromden, a supposedly deaf and dumb half-Native America mental patient at an asylum in Oregon, this is really the story about McMurphy and how he changes the lives of the patients around him as he competes in a game of wit and will with Nurse Ratched. It's a classic clash between authority and rebellion, structure and whimsy, and mindless traditionalism and common sense. What's most amazing is that Kesey has created a handful of unforgettable characters in this one story, but has balanced them so well that they serve as perfect complements for each other's idiosyncrasies, and none of them overshadows the others. I loved every page of this book. It makes my top ten. I'd give it seven stars out of five if I could.</span>

                    <span>In the beginning, I didn't like this book.It made the work of psychiatrists look like horror, rather than help. However, once I was able to get passed the miscalcuations of what psychiatrists did in the book, I really enjoyed it. I especially liked the end, but I won't give anything away! It is a delightful commentary on some different philosophies of life. It also made me want to make a difference in the world, the way McMurphy made a difference for those men. </span>

                    <span>It truly stands out and stays in your mind long after the final page is turned. -One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest- is told with a graveyard-ish humor and a realistic irony that makes one think of how society treats the mentally ill and how we define normal and sane.
<br />
<br />It depicts the fight between the Big Nurse and McMurphy, a patient at the mental-ward who may be faking his condition and is set through the eyes of Chief Bromden, a seeming deaf-mute. There isn't really anything I can add that wouldn't cover what was already said about this glorious novel. It is wonderfully crafted, the ambrosia of the literary world, and is the type of book that makes you think, and then think some more. It really snowballs in the end, and you will race through the final pages even if the beginning is slightly long-winded.</span>

<br />In his attempt to convey what he believed to be "the essentially schizophrenic nature of mankind," Kesey, rather than telling the tale from the perspective of an uninvolved "God-Narrator," or from that of R. P. McMurphy, who might have been too involved in the main action, opted to present the story from the point of view of one of the psycho ward's bystanding schizophrenic inmates; "the Big Chief."
<br />
<br />By telling the tale through the Chief's schizophrenic eyes, Kesey was able to, not merely "tell" the tale from an "eye witness perspective," but actually "show" the tale in a sort of "poetic-sensurround;" the reader would come to understand and appreciate the healing effect provided by McMurphy's inspiring individualism as the Chief's narration became progressively less "schizophrenic," and more concrete and objective as the story moved forward.
<br />
<br />Additionally, it gave Kesey a viable way to provide the story with a mystical, supernatural quality. This, in turn, enabled him to give full force and effect, through the Chief's altered perception, to his allegoric and metaphoric symbolism; allowed him to have the Chief see and hear impressionistic and imaginary stimuli as though they were solid objects and real actions and occurrences, allowed him to turn the verbal and mental sparring between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched into epic battles waged between mythical, larger-than-life titans, between the very forces of good and evil itself. In sum, it enabled Kesey to convey a deeper, more personal and more spiritual reality in his story, on a variety of psychological levels, and in a manner that allows the reader to experience events 1st hand, as a bystanding schizophrenic, rather than merely collect story-related data like a detached observer. This is certainly one novel you simply don't want to miss! Unforgettable in every way. Along with ONE FLEW, I'd like to recommend another Amazon quick-pick: THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez

                    <span>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of a man, R. P. McMurphy. He has the choice of going to jail, or an asylum. He chooses the asylum. While inside he sees the horror of the institution, and it's leader Nurse Rached.  
<br />I was originally apprehensive about reading this book, because I had seen the movie before. The reason I made the decision to go forward and read this novel, was due to the change of prospective from the movie to the book. The movie is told  from the third person, while the book is told from the perspective of the Indian Chief. This difference adds a great amount of depth to the novel, that the movie doesn't have.
<br />   While the movie is a classic, so is the book. What makes it worth reading for fans of the movie, is the elements of the plot that Ken Kasey put in the book, that unfortunately are not in the movie. due to these differences, I highly recommend reading this book for the changed perspective that it casts on the movie. It makes the movie so much better.</span>
