                <span id="Label1">Whether by nature or by nurture, Ma and Pa Sedaris certainly knew something about raising funny kids. Amy Sedaris has built a cult following for her Comedy Central character Jerri Blank, and David, the more famous of the two siblings, continues to spin his personal history into comedic gold. A good chunk of the material in <I>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</I> debuted in other media outlets, such as <I>The New Yorker</I>, but Sedaris's brilliantly written essays deserve repeat reads. <p>  Based on the author's descriptions, nearly every member of his family is funny, although some (like sister Tiffany, perhaps) in a tragic way. In "The Change in Me," Sedaris remembers that his mother was good at imitating people when it helped drive home her point. High-voiced, lovably plain-spoken brother Paul (aka The Rooster, Silly P) has long been a favorite character for Sedaris readers, though Paul's story takes on a serious note when his wife has a difficult pregnancy. The author doesn't shy away from embarrassing moments in his own life, either, including a childhood poker game that strays into strange, psychological territory.  <I>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</I> provides more evidence that he is a great humorist, memoirist, and raconteur, and readers are lucky to have the opportunity to know him (and his clan) so well. His funny family feels like our own. Perhaps they are luckier still not to know him personally. <I>--Leah Weathersby</I></span>

                    <span>This is another fabulous collection of David Sedaris's inspired tales of the grotesqueries of his family and personal life. The tales touch on truly creepy moments of life -- trying to deal with an obsessive sister; befriending the lonely child next door whose behavior borders on the demonic; the ghoulishness of writing about the process of writing  about one's own family; being kicked out of the house for being gay; being "Uncle Faggot" to the children of one's yahoo younger brother; the macabre turn of giving directions to lost travelers while one is trying to drown a mouse. As always, there is as much pain as there is laughter in Sedaris's writing; as much freakishness as frankness. Always, you often recognize your own story in the excesses of Sedaris's.
<br />
<br />Most of the stories on the CD were read in Sedaris's sad and tremulous  voice. But several stories were taped before audiences. Sedaris perks ups when reading to others, giving his writing a hilarious, naughty edge that does not come across when he reads alone. 
<br />
<br />A caution of sorts: Sedaris's homosexuality is a prominent and vital feature of his personality and his writing. If you don't appreciate that in people, you won't appreciate this book.</span>

<br />The theme behind David Sedaris's latest collection is brilliantly simple: everybody's family is wacked-out...but only he is ruthless/unfeeling/blunt enough to drag his family into the limelight, revealing their private weirdness for anyone to see (even when they beg, plead, and command him not to - and he writes about that, too). "Oh, the stories I could tell," you say, rolling your eyes knowingly, in reference to a quirky family member - but you don't. David Sedaris does; that's why he's rich and famous, and you are not. It should be noted, however, that the author enjoys a hefty natural advantage: as it turns out, his family really is weirder than most. 
<br />
<br />In "The Ship Shape," Sedaris skewers his family's pretensions to summerhouse splendor - and how his father's legendary cheapness destroys their dream. After years of sun-worshiping vacations in rental houses, Sedaris's father proposes buying a beach house of their own. Though they should know better, the family believes him, and gets caught up in the whirlwind of beach house excitement. They practice nonchalantly dropping "my home - well, one of my homes" into conversation, and compile a list of whimsical, nautical beach house names. Ultimately, of course, they're crushed with disappointment, as their father rethinks the expense, and the imaginary summer home gets shaved down to a bar in the basement. (This is where my father would have said, "Don't get your hopes up, and you won't be disappointed.") 
<br />
<br />"Full House" follows a young David Sedaris forced into attending his first all-boys sleepover. Well aware that traditional male pastimes (cars, sports, girls) are of no interest to him, the author correctly predicts that he's in for a night of misery. For hours, the host's dorky parents dominate the party, trying with pathetic enthusiasm to be cool. But once they retire, the evening takes on an even darker aspect, as cards are brought out and strip poker proposed. Terrified of, ahem, exposure in a roomful of handsome, scantily-clad teens, Sedaris is forced to take desperate measures to avoid a lifetime of persecution. Can he successfully masquerade as a regular guy for the duration of the sleepover? Well, of course not. But it's funny to watch him fail. 
<br />
<br />"Six to Eight Black Men" starts off as a cursory examination of cultural differences, but quickly gets down to its real subject matter: the fact that in the Netherlands, Santa is accompanied, not by elves, but by a team of, yes, six to eight black men. This piece contains my favorite passage of the entire book: "The six to eight black men were characterized as personal slaves until the mid-1950s, when the political climate changed and it was decided that instead of being slaves they were just good friends. I think history has proved that something usually comes between slavery and friendship, a period of time marked not by cookies and quiet hours beside the fire but by bloodshed and mutual hostility." Ho, ho, ho! 
<br />
<br />"Blood Work" involves a situation we've all found ourselves in: unknowingly being summoned to perform erotic housecleaning in a stranger's apartment for money. As the homeowner's behavior becomes progressively weirder, Sedaris struggles to retain an air of normality (and finish cleaning the apartment); because the author is who he is, it doesn't even occur to him to either punch the guy in the face or simply walk out. Instead, he keeps his eyes on the countertop, and silently wishes for the inner strength of his family's stern-faced housekeeper. The explanation, when it comes, is one of those stranger-than-fiction things that defies probability - but also makes for one hell of a story. 
<br />
<br />Many of the pieces have to do with the author's family: either humorous childhood tales or present-day musings on the siblings's often tense and awkward relationships. There are, however, a few stories about Sedaris's exploits in rural France with his partner Hugh. Although the title, as far as I can tell, is never explained, it's probably along the lines of a similar horrors-of-childhood story from fellow memoirist Augusten Burroughs. Perhaps, by leaving it to our imaginations, Sedaris is implying that there are even worse stories about his family - stories so terrible that even he can't bring himself to tell them. So let's not try. It's enough to be glad that the author survived both his childhood and the 1970s, and lived to tell the laugh-out-loud funny tale. Bottom line: it's certainly worth picking up, right along with another recent Amazon pick I recommend: THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez.

                    <span>This book was a big disappointment.  I became a huge fan of Sedaris' work after reading "Naked" and "Me Talk Pretty One Day."  Both those books were hilarious and, sometimes, even touching.  After thoroughly enjoying his prior work, I anxiously awaited his next.  Unfortunately, "Dress Your Family" does not even come close to the standard set by his earlier books.
<br />
<br />In this book, instead coming across as the witty, insightful goof that often says what most of us wish we could 1) actually think of to say; and 2) have the nerve to say, he now comes across as just negative, petty, and bitter.  Unlike his prior books, I did not find myself agreeing with Sedaris' insights, but instead feeling more like I just wanted to shake him and tell him to stop being negative and such a jerk.  In his earlier books Sedaris came across as a man who loves his family but is able to point out there various quirks.  In this book, he is so negative about everything regarding his family, it really does not appear he likes them very much and that they do not like him.
<br />
<br />Moreover, whereas Sedaris previous gave us humorous insights into his family -- to such a degree the reader could actually feel as though he was a part of Sedaris' family or at least that he likes Sedaris' family -- in "Dress Your Family" Sedaris' focus on the negative becomes just depressing and provides none of the warm, fuzzy feelings about his family.  When Sedaris writes about his mother's dying, his sister-in-law's inability to have additional children, his sister's inability to hold a job, the reader does not laugh along with his family, but instead just gets bummed out.
<br />
<br />A couple of the stories in the book are still quite funny -- "Six to Eight Black Men" for example -- but as a whole, the book was not funny.  I did actually laugh out loud several times while reading "Naked" and "Me Talk Pretty."  Such was not the case with "Dress Your Family."  Perhaps Sedaris has already used up all his amusing life stories in his earlier works and all that are left are the downers.
<br />
<br />My advice, read his earlier work.  THAT work you will enjoy.  I doubt you will enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>At lunch today as I was finishing this book, my eyes were streaming tears of laughter, my body was shaking, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from whooping out loud.  I wasn't entirely successful, and I was a little embarrassed when I literally had to put the book down I was laughing so much, to notice that my fellow diners in the Hong Kong McDonalds were getting almost as much amusement out of me as I got out of Sedaris's tales.  I really don't want to give anything away--suffice it to say that although all of the book isn't this outrageously funny, every story has a moment that made me smile.  Many of them had moments that made me sad, as well--Sedaris is a master of that little twist right at the end that makes you remember just how frail, how flawed, we all are.  And Sedaris is the first to admit, he and his family are more flawed than most.  He's willing to be truthful about his flaws, even when he is uncomfortably honest.  The message is that none of us are perfect, but we're all worthy of a little attention, a little respect, at the minimum.  There are definitely people who won't like this book--homophobes have already proven that with some of the reviews here, as have a few slightly less intellectually gifted people who haven't yet, after three other of Sedaris's books which are collections from other, earlier sources, realised that he doesn't present much if any new material in these books.  But if you haven't read The New Yorker scrupulously, and you acknowledge that adults ought to have the right to love other consenting adults, you'll truly enjoy Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.</span>
