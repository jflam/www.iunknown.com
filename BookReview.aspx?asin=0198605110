                <span id="Label1">Now fully updated to 2001, this is an authoritative and highly readable introduction to a thousand years of Russian history. From the formation of the Russian state in the 14th century to the political power struggles of the 1990s and the uncertainties of the new millennium, this new history offers a fresh and systematic account of Russian history across six tumultuous centuries. Drawing on the best contemporary scholarship, thirteen international experts reassess and reinterpret the history of one of the world's great powers. For too long Russian history has been dominated by myths and counter-myths, concocted by those seeking either to legitimize the existing order or to destroy it. New insights into areas previously cloaked in secrecy and an extraordinarily rich array of illustrations, make this book essential reading for anyone interested in Russia and its place in the world. "[A] brisk, exciting tour of Russia's long journey from its Kievan origins to the early Yeltsin years...stunningly beautiful illustrations and transparent prose."--The Los Angeles Times</span>

                    <span>As somewhat of a history buff, I bought this book for superficial reasons: neat cover and the bold ambitious title. In hindsight, I should have read more reviews. This book covers Russia from early Czarist times of Ivan the Terrible through the Sickle-and-Hammer days of the Russian Revolution. It features a number of short essay chapters from various contributors. Like a previous reviewer indicated, this book focuses more on the leaders and leadership than anything else. While this might be an easy way to approach an historically authoritarian country's history, it's not the best way. At times, certain chapters make for a totally dry and boring read. However, there were some interesting insights by a few writers, but marginal in number.<P>Considering the horrific revelations of Soviet Russia's totalitarian past, the revisonist interpertation on Stalinism is a real crime. Especially since this book was so ambitious with it's 'in-depth' probing the Stalinist era. Yet, it only glosses over the surface, while downplaying and denying communist crimes all the way. Also it is full of pictures, but mostly those Stalinist-era propaganda variety that hails ambitious production and public works projects. <P>At best, this book serves as an amateurish survey of Russian history. You'll need the Black Book of Communism to temper the revisionism if you get this book. I'd like to unbuy this book.</span>

                    <span>Gregory Freeze is an erudite scholar, and it shows with the current volume. This is not a popular book. It is written for those with some knowledge of the subject, who will appreciate the possibilities and limitations of serious historical reviews of events most of us find difficult to understand. However, understand these events we must, as Russia is not the only country to thrive on misinformation and misunderstanding of its place in the world.</span>

                    <span>A couple other reviews do a good job of stating the problems with this book (Setliff and an unnamed reviewer). It is academic and dry. When it gets to the Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin's role and character is minimalized and there is not even a mention of the murder of Nicholas II. Considering it blatant propganda at that point, I didn't read on past that. The comments about Stalinism in other reviews go in line with what I read about Bolshevism.</span>

                    <span>This book isn't so much a history of Russia, but a history of Russia's leaders and leadership. It delves into the machinations of the czars, rulers, bolshiveks, and all their minions with monotonous detail, but misses the importance of the significant EVENTS that shaped Russian history. Napoleon's invasion of Russia, why he failed, why the Russians triumphed, is barely analyzed. Discussion of the Russo-Japanese war doesn't even rate an entire paragraph! (Now, if the author ever wanted to delve into the mind of a Russian czar, here was a great place to do it. What prompted Nicolas II to provoke a war with Japan? What made him so confident that he sailed his navy halfway around the world to battle with the Japanese, only to suffer a near-total defeat? Who was in charge of the Russian navy, and what mistakes were made?)<P>Skip this book. Maybe someone will find a better history of Russia out there, and write a review so we can find it.</span>

                    <span>Gregory Freeze's Russian History is a wonderful collection of facts and templates, names and places, charts and graphs, written in a very dry academical style. Partly this is due to the publishers who have shown a penchant for drab Western historiograpy, partly this is due to the book being a collection of various academical "specialists" in Russian history. For instance, almost all the contributors are from American universities, and it being a fact well known that no one knows Russia better than Americans, it is no wonder that the book lacks passion. One is reminded of why Marxist ideological alienation and suffering triumphed in Russia whereas the tediums of Western tenured universities have without fail failed of impact. When this book does verge on enthusiasm, it is more for the arisocratic exploits of Peter the Great, not for the peasants who got an apartment flat and a warm meal just this century. This is a great book for the when and where, for the why try fasting.</span>
