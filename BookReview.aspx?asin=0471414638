                    <span>This book seems to have been written primarily because the author learned about the existence of boxes of Thomas Watson's papers that had never been read by any biographer or journalist. In some cases, the author's access to these new materials does help fill in some minor gaps in the existing accounts of Watson's life. And cumulatively, they take some of the shine off the legend, impressing upon one how humdrum the daily life of even a business titan must be. This book is reasonably well written and packed with memorable anecdotes. While it doesn't offer stunning new insights, we commend it as a readable, accessible and balanced introduction to one of the greatest executives of the twentieth century.</span>

                    <span>All great stories have a good guy and a bad guy.  In this story, it's the same guy.  Thomas Watson, Sr., by sheer force of personality, created IBM.<p>The best part of this book is the IBM songs at the end of every chapter.  They are hillarious, but probably no more so than some of the silly cheers dot.coms used to pump up their employees.<p>But back to the story:  Mr. Watson created the first tech growth company of the 20th century.  Mr. Maney had unbelievable access to Mr. Watson's personal notes and correspondence as the primary resource to tell how he created IBM.  Some of the details about meetings, drawn from the transcribed minutes, give an eerie "you are there" quality to the book.  One feels almost as terrorized as the executives in those meetings.<p>In reading the book, one gets the clear message that Mr. Maney would have really liked to have met Mr. Watson.  He truly admires his subject while at the same time showing warts and all.  This is not a soft treatment of Mr. Watson.  Yet, you can almost hear Mr. Maney saying between the lines, "I just wish I could have met that old S.O.B."<p>This book holds great detail but is an easy read.  Mr. Maney's style covers the point without belaboring it.  The book is often funny, sometimes sad but never disappointing.</span>

                    <span>If IBM and computers are synonymous, so are Watson and IBM. Whatever the criticisms and the controversies surrounding the 3 magical alphabets in blue, IBM is IBM. To build such a company from ground up, offering solutions to business and scientific computing and thereby acting as the catalyst for the process of economic progress during the most part of the twentieth century is by no means an ordinary feat. That was exactly the material Thomas Watson Sr was made of. Watson has done his job and done it well and now Kevin Maney completes the rest by bringing this story in a truly remarkable manner to our bookshelves. <p>It is difficult not to fall in love with Watson Sr and his beloved company even half way through the book. From his humble beginnings to the misfortune at NCR, for nearly forty years Watson Sr is just another story of struggles, ups and downs. But to him, life just begins at forty with his job at CTR and of course the birth of Tom Watson Jr. The birth of IBM and its growth under the paternalistic care of Watson Sr through depressions, wars, booms and uncertainties gets a lion's share of coverage in this book. Watson Sr took big business risks bordering on a propensity to gamble, pushing IBM into higher orbits. Luck is the word the author takes recourse to while describing these successes. <p>The next logical part of the book deals with the succession plan at IBM that is a story by itself. Father, Son and Co by Tom Jr is widely quoted in these pages. The father's affection for his sons Tom Jr and Dick, his struggle to reconcile their differences and the frequent fights with Tom Jr are very close to what Tom Jr himself has described in his book.<p>The chapters on transformation of IBM into the era of electronics under Tom Jr and the trust suit that had a severe personal impact on Watson Sr deserve commendation.<p>While reading the pages where the old man bids goodbye to IBM and to this world, I stood up in salute to this great man.</span>

                    <span>I agree with previous reviewers that Watson's story is amazing, but I do not believe that Maney execution of this book is that good.<p>I think that this book would have been a much better read if it was 250 pages. One of the reasons for the extra length is that the author decided to deviate from simple chronological order. Instead, Maney attempted analytical/descriptive biography, but, in my view, did not fully succeed. <p>I came away from this 400 page book with mixed understanding of what sort of person Watson was and what, besides the IBM culture, were his business methods and innovations. <p>Overall, the book did not flow, the organization of some of the chapters was not intuitive and the chapters on Watson's sons were short. I can not quite call the book disapointing, but I can not say that it was a great experience.</span>

                    <span>This biography is sure to keep you staying up late turning the pages.  The life of Tom Watson is crafted as a fantastic journey from defeat to absolute success.  The early lessons on constructing a corporate culture, business organization, advancing women in business, and creating revolutionary technological innovations are very interesting.  In this book you not only get a lot of great busineess advice, but you also get to feel that you really know one of the greatest CEO's, Tom Watson, Sr.  You learn to love his humor, his stern business practices, his big gambles, and even his unwiley temper.  It is a biography full of history, life lessons, and enthralling moments.</span>
