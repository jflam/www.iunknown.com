                <span id="Label1">Failing the Mary Poppins' snap-the-fingers approach to cleaning, here's the next best thing: an utterly practical handbook that offers lasting results for anyone looking to banish clutter from every room in the house. Home organizer par excellence Meryl Starr offers up her hardworking organizing solutions in The Home Organizing Workbook, a straightforward guide to getting organized. The room chapters begin with targeted questionnaires that help the reader identify specific organizational problems, followed by hundreds of hardworking solutions and strategic maintenance tips. Those itching to get started can dive right in with step-by-step organizing projects ranging from quick-and-easy weeknight jobs, like overhauling the spice cabinet, to more intensive endeavors such as reorganizing the bedroom closet. Accessory lists at the end of each chapter feature dozens of the best products available, from lazy susans to shelf dividers, and explain exactly how they can be used to optimum effect in each room, while the extensive resource list shows where to get them. It's a package as tidy as its solutions: concealed Wire-O lay-flat binding, tabbed chapters to take readers straight to their problem area du jour, and full-color, solution-oriented photographs sure to inspire action. Ready to clear that clutter and keep it that way? The Home Organizing Workbook is the ultimate guide to preserving open spaces.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. I tend to be disorganized. I have piles of magazines, books, my babies things, clothing and anything else I can stack around my apartment. I live with my 18 month old daughter and my husband. My husband and I both own our own buisnesses so there is not a lot of time to clean and organize. My husband bought this book for me as a gift, hoping to inspire me. At first I was sceptical. I barley had time to organize, little less read a book about organization! Fortunately, he bought the perfect book. Meryl Starr's book is very easy to read and absorb. She offered so many helpful tips that I have easily used and to my surprise my apartment does look and feel much more orderly. Every section is broken down into a different part of the house. I started in my kitchen. Ms. Starr begins with questions, which I kind of skipped over, because I wanted to get to the solution part. This was perfect for me. Bullet pointed suggestions!!! Fast, easy and practical. now I love going into my kitchen. I implemented her idea for installing a pegboard with hooks so I could hang pots and pans and now I have more storage space. The author really opens your mind and gets very creative and practical with her suggestions. I also really loved that she had a section on a variety of different storage problems. I read the ones that applied to me and my home and then the book gave me several different solutions.<P>I really felt this book was user friendly, practical, pretty, sincere, helpful, and motivating. I highly recommend it. I just bought two more as gifts. One is for a friend of mine that is pregnant. I thought it would be a great gift for someone who needs to create room and that will have A LOT of new items coming into her home. The other book I bought was for a friend that is already very organized. She just moved. I am sure her new apartment is perfectly organized, but I know she will greatly appreciate it and she will surly get some new tips.</span>

                    <span>When you come across the "Home Organizing Workbook" by Meryl Starr you would think what a pretty looking book must be great. But seriouly it's only a nice book, but that all it has going for. There not a lot substance to it. There are not many ideas to the book and it does cost a bit of money. So this is one those book that you want take a close look at before you buy.</span>

                    <span>"The Home Organizing Workbook" by Meryl Starr is the type of book that is design to catch the reader attention of the shelve. But, once the reader takes a close look at it. The reader begins to realize that while it has some useful information there are better organizing books on the market. If you are interesting reading it, just check it out, and save your money.</span>

                    <span>As a grad student who spends a lot of time studying at home, organization is a must. A well organized home not only saves time (how much time do you waste looking for keys or searching for an overdue bill?) but it serves as a calming influence -- and aren't we all looking for one of those? Although I have read books like Julie Morgenstern's "Organizing From the Inside Out" I actually like Meryl Starr's approach better. The book's design and photography are gorgeous -- this is a how-to book you won't be ashamed to have on your coffee table.</span>

                    <span>"Clearing your Clutter" as Meryl Starr so wonderfully says, is a great step by step method that enables a person to take the right approach without getting overwelmed by the task in sight. My husband and I decided to make our lives more organized so things would run a little more smoothly in our home. The book allows you to go to a chapter and empower you with great ideas and solutions. By having chapters at your fingertips this is making our task alot easier. I would highly recomend buying this well thought out and easy to read book.</span>
