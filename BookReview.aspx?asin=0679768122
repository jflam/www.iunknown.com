                <span id="Label1">Albert Speer was not only Hitler's architect and armaments minister, but the Fuhrer's closest friend--his "unhappy love." Speer was one of the few defendants at the Nuremberg Trials to take responsibility for Nazi war crimes, even as he denied knowledge of the Holocaust. Now this enigma of a man is unveiled in a monumental biography by a writer who came to know Speer intimately in his final years. Out of hundreds of hours of interviews, Sereny unravels the threads of Speer's personality: the genius that made him indispensable to the German war machine, the conscience that drove him to repent, and the emotional wounds that made him susceptible to Hitler's lethal magnetism. Read as an inside account of the Third Reich, or as a revelatory unsparing yet compassionate study of the human capacity for evil, <b>Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth</b> is a triumph.<br><p><br>"Fascinating...Not only a major addition to our knowledge of the Third Reich, but a stunning attempt to understand the nature of good and evil."--Newsday<br><br><br>"More than a biography...It also constitutes a perceptive re-examination of the mysterious appeal of Adolf Hitler."--San Francisco Chronicle</span>

                    <span>One of the best combination history and biography books ever written, and done in a very readible style. I could hardly put the book down. The research is thorough and comprehensive. The author has interviewed almost every living person who knew Herr Speer, including extensive interviews with Speer himself. The story never drags inspite of its more than 700 pages. This book challenges the reader to look beyond the simple historical facts. Speer was truly a remarkable personality. The world is better off that he was not executed after his Nuremberg trial. His intimate knowledge, organizational skills, and willingness to document and talk about it, has enabled us to understand and learn valuable lessons about this period in history that would have otherwise been lost forever. This book helps explain how an entire nation and many good people were seduced and strung along on the tide of Hitler's leadership. The lesson for all citizens of every nation is to be aware of government actions, and to not permit the government to control the media.</span>

                    <span>Gitta Sereny's monumental work 'Abert Speer: His Battle with Truth,' is a book of major importance about a man and an era that the world must never forget. Albert Speer, first Hitler's architect and later his Minister for Armaments and War Production, will remain forever an enigma. Did he know about the Holocaust? To what extent was his involvment? Should he have been hanged at Nuremburg? Was his apologetic manner in later years sincere? These are the questions that Sereny asks and attempts to answer, often arriving at conclusions that make even the reader uncomfortable, forcing him or her to realize that the Nazi system, at the time, could have held as much appeal for them as it did for Speer and for all of Germany. Sereny's intervews with Speer, her numerous interviews, and her exhaustive research all contribute to this masterful book. Of particular interest are the people whose lives were affected most by the madess of Hitler. Sereny's talks with the son of Martin Bormann are both chilling and incredibly moving. I do feel as though this book, along with Speer's own works, 'Inside the Third Reich,' and 'Spandau: the Secret Diaries,' (his thrid book, 'Infiltrator,' is one to be missed,) are essential reading for any serious student of Nazi Germany.</span>

                    <span>Historians and WWII seem to only paint Nazis, especially high ranking ones, with a few brushes. Sereny does a very good job of assembling a picture of Albert Speer from a variety of sources. These include personal interviews with Speer, his notes from Spandau, interviews with colleagues/friends/aquaintances and other historical sources. <P>Where Inside The Third Reich is very much what Speer wants to tell you, Sereny's book often is not. I believe she liked Speer and in fact does not paint him as an evil man. Rather you get a picture of a man whoose morals were not strong enough to cast aside his ambition, Hitler's cult of personality and friendship, war, perspective and duty to country. It also shows many fo Speers good qualities, which many WWII historians like to forget.<P>It is as complete a picture of Albert Speer as you are to find, save for perhaps reading his Spandau diary. A definite must for people seriously interested in WWII and who are prepared not to find ALL (save for Hitler, Goebbels, Himler and the like) Nazi's heroic or demonic, but simply people not unlike ourselves or people we might know.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book so much that I find it difficult even to review it. There is little I can add to what previous reviewers have said--Sereny's biography is meticulous, always intriguing, and sometimes breathtaking. <P>The two most outstanding aspects of the book were Sereny's close contact with the older Speer and the completely fascinating subject, Speer himself. Sereny manages to do the impossible--get close enough to the subject to occasionally shock the reader, while retaining a sort of neutrality. Sereny, who actually lived in Speer's home over a period of several weeks and maintained a friendship with him for the last few years of his life, readily acknowledges that she liked Speer, and her vivid portrayal of Speer's charming, elusive personality and profoud intellect shows why. At the same time, she is utterly honest about confronting the darkest aspects of Speer's life and his involvement in the Holocaust. This is a biography that almost reads like a novel, particularly the scenes of interaction between Sereny and Speer, in which she gradually and tantalizingly brings him closer to admitting the truth. <P>While it is true that Sereny occasionally goes off on tangents, I did not find this aspect of the book to be a negative, and certainly not enough to warrant anything less than a five star rating. While I primarily read the book to learn about Albert Speer, Sereny's writing and analysis are so good that I didn't mind seeing them applied to other aspects of a very compelling period of history. In many ways, this biography is something of a history of the Third Reich from the perspective of Albert Speer, particularly highlighting his important role. <P>Sereny ultimately presents a portrait of a man whom the reader cannot help but empathize with; however, she is honest enough that the reader also cannot help but disapprove of him. She maintains a careful balance between these two aspects, and avoids falling into the same unfortunate trap as many Nazi biographers of glorifying the subject matter. At the same time, she avoids the temptation to take the easy way out and present an outright condemnation of one of the highest ranking Nazis in Germany. Sereny's Speer is neither godlike nor demonic; he is profoundly human, and her portrayal of his humanity is a magnificent achievement.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately, Sereny has failed to enlighten us as to how <BR>Speer finally discovered what was going on in the concentration<BR>camps. It was near the end of the war when a staff officer took Speer aside and asked him if he knew about Auschwitz. Speer said<BR>"Yes, it's a work camp. Why?" "Don't ever go there" the officer<BR>replied. That drove Speer to investigate and find out about the<BR>camp and the human exterminations. Later he showed up at Gen. Henrici's command post and showed him the pistol he planned to use to kill Hitler, having decided that poison gas into the intakes of the bunker wouldn't work - they had repositioned them too high in the air. He finally realized that he wasn't a killer and never carried out the plan. The Nuremberg trials could only convict Speer for using slave labor in the factories that he oversaw, but those laborers fared better under Speer than they would have elsewhere. He should never have been convicted of anything, along with several other defendents who were tried for <BR>the "crime" of disliking Jews. A prosecutor might well try to convince a jury that Speer is not to be believed, but their are plenty of historical facts that contradict Sereny's claims. A history should be investigative in its orientation, not prosecutorial. Let the facts speak for themselves. This was Sereny's greatest blunder and unfortunately it infects all of the text. The author simply isn't an historian here; she remains the prosecutor, but without a defense attorney to check her more outlandish statements.</span>
