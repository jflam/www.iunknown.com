                    <span>I bought this book for my 5-year-old nephew, and already I can hear him laughing at the illustrations of Edison sitting on goose eggs in his father's barn, causing a chemical fire in a baggage car, and courting  teacherly reprisals for his apprarent boredom in a conventional classroom.   These all-too-human mishaps from the great inventor's life mix well and  bring interest to the charmingly illustrated discussion of his  accomplishments: lighting up New York City, inventing the phonograph,  inventing the first movie camera and making the first movies with a story.  More than just providing a laundry list of his accomplishments, though,  this little book explains in simple terms how he worked his way up to  owning his own laboratories in Menlo Park, first as a candy butcher turned  telegrapher, and finally coming into some money with his invention of the  stock ticker.  Thomas Edison's accomplishments are something to admire, and  I'm definitely happy to start my nephew off learning about him with this  book.</span>

                    <span>Have you ever needed a short and sweet biography for younger students yet could only find books for independent readers? Adler has solved the problem.   This book is a wonderful introduction for K-3 graders who need information but cant handle those lengthy chapter books. Abundantly  illustrated to keep little eyes busy while listening to the story. Loaded  with biographical information and includes a timeline of important dates.      Other titles in the series include; Thomas Jefferson, Abe Lincoln,  Christopher Colombus, George Washington, Martin Luter King Jr. and others.</span>
