                <span id="Label1"><I>Ugly Americans</I> documents the "Wild East" of the mid-1990s, where young, brilliant, and hypercompetitive traders became "hedge fund cowboys," manipulating loopholes in an outdated and inefficient Asian financial system to rake in millions. Using a concept called arbitrage, they made their fortunes mainly on minute shifts in stocks being sold on the Nikkei, the Japanese stock market, collapsing banks and nearly bankrupting the Japanese economy in the process. Other schemes were also concocted, most of which were technically legal, though certainly unethical. This true story revolves around "John Malcolm," who, in exchange for anonymity, agreed to give Ben Mezrich all the access and information he needed to write this book. As a recent Princeton graduate in the mid-1990s, Malcolm accepted an undefined job offer from an American expatriate in Japan to work in the investments field. Though he had no prior experience, he facilitated 25 million dollars worth of trades on his first day on the job, and it just got more exciting from there. He soon joined a small group of expatriates, all in their twenties and mostly Ivy League graduates, who lived like rock stars, thriving on the stress and excitement of their jobs to create their own steroid versions of the American Dream half a world away. Mezrich tells this riveting story well, incorporating elements of the culture into his narrative, including the infamous and pervasive Japanese "Water Trade," or sex business, romantic intrigue, and even run-ins with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Though there is little real analysis of their financial dealings and how they ultimately changed the rules of finance in Asia, this entertaining page turner does offer a glimpse into a world little explored in print until now. --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>Having lived and worked across Asia within multiple industries (including finance), I eagerly awaited this read.  Unfortunately, I found the same old clich√©s on Japan and Capital markets. It takes years to really understand the region so fault to the author, but for something less glammed up and exoticised, (yet also based on a true story), I might suggest Clissold's, "Mr. China." Better yet, spend some serious time in Asia. It will pay off for you in the next century.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was excited to read this book: 1) the same author as the compelling Bringing Down the House, and 2) a plot about hedge funds -- a topic of personal and professional interest to me.  The excitement dwindled fast.
<br />Ben Mezrich is a very average writer.  He tries too hard at times to describe a different world, only to lose all crediblity in the eyes of those actually familiar with that world.  He doesn't trust the imagination (or intelligence) of his reader, whom he constantly talks down -- perhaps a Harvard-learned trait.
<br />Mezrich needs to get over his lovefest for Ivy league schools and their students.  People who attend the Ivies are smart, but so too are the students of another 50 or so US institutions.  It gets sickening after a while to read his constant, self-congratulatory fawning over the Ivies.  (For the record, I have met far fewer people in the hedge fund world from the Ivies than I have from schools like UVA, Michigan, and Chicago.)
<br />The plot of Ugly Americans seems very forced.  If someone had told me this story over dinner, I certainly wouldn't have felt compelled to turn it into a book or a movie.  The details don't hold together at all, and even if they did, they wouldn't be fascinating either to those versed or unversed with hedge fund strategies.
<br />Overall, this book didn't disappoint me strictly because of Mezrich's superficial understanding or explanation of hedge fund strategies.  It disappointed me because it is poorly written and weakly characterized.  It disappointed me because it wasted my scarcest resource, free time.  It disappointed me because I really did enjoy BDTH, but now my view of that compelling read is tarnished too.  </span>

                    <span>Although Mezrich embellishes the characters enough to make an exciting semi-fiction story, I was very interested when the actual topics of hedge funds and arbitrage were breached. Yet, Mezrich seemed to make little effort to explain these in anything more than basic terms. Considering that the book is based on the exploits of high finance, I wish there was more in-depth analysis. Still, it is an intriguing book and a fast-paced read.</span>
