                    <span>I just purchased this book because i am planning to build a darkroom in my basement, and it has provided me with alot of information. And if you have a really small bathroom and you think it's impossible to turn it into a darkroom and use it at the same time, then you better get this book. There are floorplans/layouts & elevation provided, as well as pictures to give you an idea of how your darkroom will turn out. There are so many alternatives given that you can't go wrong in builiding the perfect darkroom of your own and save money as well.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very practical and direct. What impressed me most was that the authors took into account the fact that not everyone has the ideal accomodations for a darkroom. Each section goes into the how-to of every phase of setting up a simple, basic to the sophisticated darkroom. Everything is spelled out in detail allowing you to "opt out" of any part of the process that you feel may be "over your head" (call the plummer) and to deal with those that are within your reach. In between, the book allows you to peek at how others have set up their facilities. Over all a great book for anyone looking to set up a dark room the "right way".</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book that follows you through the process of determning a room, making modifications if neccesary and creating the physical space for a darkroom.<P>In addition creating the room, it will take you through the equipment requirements and general layout and design for a good working darkroom.<P>I used the layout and general design sections to create my own darkroom, and found all the lists, worksheets and diagrams invaluable.<P>There is even a small section in the beginning that takes you through some famous photographers darkrooms.<P>All the information you would need, and well organized.</span>
