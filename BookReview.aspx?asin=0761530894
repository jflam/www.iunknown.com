                    <span>Great book! Everything you need to write the next Civ! (Dinged a star for being over $...)<P>Starts off with lots of DirectX Basics - important reference material, but not specific to ISO games. I suggest skimming this the first time you read the book and then studying it in detail when you are actually programming your game.<P>Middle chapters build on each other to carefully create an entire isometric engine and game framework. Attention is paid to design considerations like coordinate systems, scrolling issues and image management.<P>Book closes with lots of "must haves" and bonus additions like mini-map, fog of war and world generation.<P>I enjoyed the author's writing style and his insight into the knowledge required for building ISO games as well as pointing out the "gotchas" you will want to avoid. I was also impressed by the way the book moves from the lowest level DirectX functions step-by-step up to a fully functional generic game.<P>The author is also genuinely excited about the subject and can be found discussing ISO issues out on the internet.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because LaMothe was the editor, and i thought he actually made at least some suggestions to the writer.<P>I won't take your time, so here it is:<BR>Good:<BR>-Covers everything needed for a basic game, for beginners.<BR>-Couple good ideas, like mouse-mapping, path-finding<BR>Not Good:<BR>-Part I:First 230 pages are about windows programming, an ISO book should not cover 'my first windows program' topics...<BR>-Part II and III:This supposed to cover the ISO stuff, from basic to hardcore (only the basic is there)<BR>-Part IV:World generation and Path finding (the only good stuff in the book)<P>Recap: The author handles the subject as Civilization II was the ONLY ISO TYPE GAME, and Fallout, Diablo does not exist, however the introduction states you will learn the secrets of creating games like NOX (Diablo clone). Explanation of seamless tile generation is lame (not the real deal), does not cover any of the 'interesting' topics, like: wall transparency, rendering of large objects, different types of scrolling (character centered, character framed), and so on...<P>Suggestion:<BR>-If you want to write a small, turn based strategy game (definetly with flat tiles), and you are a beginner with programming and windows, buy it. <BR>-If you want to write a Fallout or Diablo-like ISO game, do not buy this book, you can get all the basic info this book cover from the net...<P>I think i will write a similar 'book', and put it to my webpage, only that will cover all the stuff this one left out...<P>Edocecrous<BR>System/Game programmer,<BR>Mynergy</span>

                    <span>This is a good buy if you need to know the basics of tile plotting, drawing, world coordinate systems, map coordinate systems, and moving about a map. The code is laid out in such a way that if you follow along closely you'll be able to understand what's going on fairly easily. Earnest does a good job explaining what his code is doing and why it is doing it. However, once you get a good understanding of exactly what needs to be accomplished and the steps to making a tile-based game (like a RPG or a RTS), then I would recommend scrapping his code and replacing it with your own, more optimized code. Granted, his code is very easy to understand and that's the main purpose of this book, to let the reader (you) understand exactly what's going on and leave further optimizations up to you once you understand it. If you were to make a large game project, however, his code would not be useable. It seems to be bulky and slower than it should be.<BR>The Tile engine that you construct throughout the book is suppose to be mainly geared towards making isometric maps and it covers three different types of Isometric maps: Diamond (like in Age Of Empires), Staggered (like in Command & Conquer), and Slide maps (I have no clue who uses this type of map). The book also talks a little about making a Hex map, and a rectangular map (like WarCraft II & StarCraft) but not enough to base a whole game upon what this book talks about. In the end, the book explains how to use Direct3D to render a map. This information on 3D is almost useless. First he uses Direct3D7 instead of DirectXGraphics and he had time to use DirectXGraphics because it had already been released by the time this book was written. He simply neglected to use it. And also, it seem the code is only geared toward rendering a map in Direct3D, and nothing else. Well, my friends, rendering a map is only a small peice of the puzzle when making 3D games. <BR>This book is also full of the useless n00b stuff that seems to waist pages in all the prima tech books like setting up windows, understanding simple Win32 API basics, windows message loop, buttons, menus, dialog boxes, understanding COM architecture, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc. <BR>I recommend this book for all of those who need to get a good understanding of tile-based games. However, if you already know the basics of rectangular and isometric games, then don't buy this book!</span>

                    <span>If you have never done any C/C++ for WIN32, don't expect to know just what the heck Mr Pazera is talking about. Although, if you haven't any other books in your library related to _C/C++_Game_programming_, and are die-hard to learn ISO-HEX; start here - and STUDY LIKE CRAZY! By this I mean memorize the first few chapters. It is detrimental to the rest of the book. Although it's still best to start with some knowlege of C/C++; it's not imperative in this book if you are diligent. Have fun, enjoy, and Good Luck!:></span>
