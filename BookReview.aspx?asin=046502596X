                <span id="Label1">Danny Hillis offers a clear, easy-to-understand explanation of how computers perform their amazing feats.  <P>"Highly recommended."  -Library Journal  <P>"When Daniel Hillis tells you computers are simple, he's quite persuasive."  -Industry Standard  <P>"A helpful and succinct volume."  -Publishers Weekly  <P>"Clear and down-to-earth; even hopeless technophobes should find it entertaining."  -Kirkus Reviews  <P>Most people are baffled by how computers work. What they don't realize is that the computer's complex operations can be broken down into a few simple parts performing simple procedures over and over. In this welcome volume, W. Daniel Hillis makes a computer seem as basic as a bicycle. Hillis begins with a rundown of basic logic to clear descriptions of what programming languages, algorithms, and memory are. He then takes readers in easy steps up to the most exciting development in computing today-quantum computing, parallel computing, neural networks, and self-organizing systems.</span>

                    <span>I took a one-year intensive detour into computer programming with the idea of becoming a programmer. The single best thing I got out of it was an acquaintance with this book. It is very short and perfectly clear, yet it is also the deepest reflection on computers I know of. I'm not alone in thinking this--writing in the eminent magazine New Scientist, the reviewer Peter Thomas called it "The best book on computers I have ever read." It seems quite fitting that in looking through others' reviews of this book I found it pressed eagerly both on complete novices and on computer science majors; it's that kind of book, profoundly simple.<P>The idea of the last chapter, Beyond Engineering, is one of the most exciting ones I've ever heard: let me summarize it briefly to entice you. Hillis thinks that we may not be able to design a true artificial intelligence because we may not ever be able to understand how our own decentralized brains work. (An artificial intelligence is a computer with a consciousness like a person's, like HAL in "2001".) Yet he thinks we can still create an artificial intelligence by simulating evolution--by imitating the same process that created us! We may be able to "breed" computers as smart as human beings without ever having to understand how we, or they, achieve the miracle of consciousness.<P>In the computer world, that's the kind of idea they call "sexy".</span>

                    <span>Reading Hillis' book is full of joy. His insights inspired many thoughts I never had during those computer and logic design courses. The examples he gave are illustrative and illuminating. People interested in or fascinated by the "mysterious" power of computers should grasp the central ideas of computation after finishing this book.<P>Very easy to read. A truly nice piece.</span>

                    <span>I am not a computer expert but I have been immersed in computer books for the past couple of years in order to jump-start a new career. I can say without hesitation that in my reading experience Daniel Hillis has no peer in writing about computers. I suspect he has no peer in his field of research as well, but I'm not qualified to comment on that. This book is a joy to read. So rare that a great technical mind can communicate as brilliantly as this.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. Mr. Hillis has a way of writing that is both educational and entertaining. I had taken this book out of the library at least a half-dozen times, so many in fact that my wife suggested I just buy the darned thing (I had a enough late charges to pay for it at least once!) It is easy to read, engaging, and really does get to the heart of what a computer is and how it works in a manner that even my eight year old daughter could work with. Good work Mr. Hillis!</span>

                    <span>I believe the title is a bit misleading. If you want to buy this book to learn how computers work, STOP! and buy "Code: Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" By Charles Petzold. (Because of the title/quotes on the book which suggested that this book will teach you "How Computers Work"... I gave it 4 stars--I almost made it 3! :) This book will cover how computers work only in the first two chapters.. and it covers the subject so abstractly and briefly--with a lot of gaps--that if you don't already know how it works, you probably will have a VERY hard time understanding...<P>Now, to the good stuff... this book is a GREAT intro for someone who has some fundamentals in CS, but would like to explore it a bit more.. or get interesting ideas--especially in the department of Artificial Intelligence.<P>Remmember one thing... althought it's meant to be a book for "newbies"... it really isn't... some of the concepts/terminology is complex... but as a whole it's a simple short book. To me it seems VERY simple because I already read a lot of books dealing with all this stuff beforehand... but I would imagine someone who hasn't had a lot of exposure may want to at the very least read CODE (as I've already stated). You will learn a lot from CODE! (BTW, I just read this book in about two days, after finishing CODE... so that can attest to it's simplicity... not too much depth.. but a nice intro to CS with a concentration on AI).</span>
