                    <span>I found this book to be very limited in regard to content.  I was looking for more advanced techniques, or at least a more detailed study of actual methods for accomplishing what the title advertises.   The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material.  Just about any book you pick up about public speaking or personal communication contains the advice found here.  "Repeat the question - It gives you a few more seconds to think about your answer" is about as advanced as the info in this book gets.</span>

                    <span>This book contains all tip and tactics you need to keep conversations and presentations from getting out of hand. If someone is heckling you during an important presentation or asks you a question that you do not know the  answer to, this book gives you advice on responding tactfully so you do not  look irresponsible, weak, etc. <p>In essence, this book helps convey the  art of BSing. Everyone has known someone in their life who can talk their  way out of any situation. This book can help you become someone like that.  Very highly recommended!</span>
