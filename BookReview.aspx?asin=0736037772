                <span id="Label1">In Breakthrough Swimming, legendary swimming coach and historian Cecil Colwin describes how competitive swimmers of the modern era&#151;such as swimming giants Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett&#151;apply innovative training methods and stroke techniques to set new standards of performance.  <P>All four strokes as well as starts and turns are presented in thorough detail in Colwin&#146;s easy-to-grasp instructional style. Not only will you gain a greater understanding of competitive swimming through its origins and evolution, but you&#146;ll also learn these skills:  <P>&#149; Improve stroke technique, starts, and turns.  <P>&#149; Develop a better training program and understand the principles of training.   <P>&#149; Apply the latest research in hydrodynamics and the propulsive mechanisms of speed swimming to create ultimate speed through the water.  <P>&#149; Coach the &#147;feel&#148; of the water to help swimmers detect and manipulate the water flow with ever-increasing dexterity.   <P>Internationally acclaimed sport physiologist Dr. David Pyne, recipient of the Australian Sports Medal for his work with that country&#146;s Olympic swimming team, contributed a special chapter to the book. Pyne covers all phases of modern training, from physiological testing and monitoring to race preparation and post competition analysis.   <P>The engaging book also offers an inside look at how the sport has evolved, especially in recent years, with the advent of professional swimming and the growing specter of performance-enhancing drugs. Combining the latest technical innovations with a revealing historical context, Breakthrough Swimming is the definitive work on the past, present, and future of competitive swimming.</span>

                    <span>I am one of those swimmers Mr Colwin talks about; natural, skilled, elite. Call it what you will, I swim easily and fast. Fast enough to win the Olympics (Tokyo, 1964, 400 IM) <p>This book is astounding in its breadth and depth of knowledge. If you are at all serious about swimming for speed or enjoyment you need to read this work. The first and second chapters on stroke development and recent breakthroughs would be enough to make this book a classic,<p>The fluid dynamics section is excellent, a good thing to know in your mind. But far more valuable to me is the chapter about feeling the water. Here we dive into the heart of the matter. The more talented swimmers feel the water more. You can swim most efficiently when you can tell when the water is most ready to pull against. I stand in awe of Colvin's ability to explain an intuitive process that leaves me blubbering for words.<p>All of us who love the water owe Cecil Colwin a deep and sincere thank you.</span>

                    <span>In "Breakthrough Swimming", Cecil Colwin has done a fantastic job in bringing together the thoughts, techniques and advice of many famous and successful coaches and their swimmers from all over the world.  Of particular interest are the changes in techniques over the years and the preparation of today's star swimmers.  Also of great interest was the comparison and use of scientific principles in assisting in streamlining the body and optimising the use of energy and strength to gain more speed.<br>As a past competitive swimmer, this book is a "must" for anyone with an interest in this great sport.  It is a book where you need to have your own copy so you can read and re-read it from time to time as well as use it as a reference guide.<br>A real "winner" from Cecil Colwin !</span>

                    <span>The average swimming book prescribes stroke techniques, then offers a sample training routine.  In 'Breakthrough Swimming', Cecil Colwin sets his stroke and training advice amid much firm background and some speculative discussion.  Coach Colwin covers three subjects: History, Hydrodynamics and Training.<p>The history is broken into two parts which begin and end the book. The first is a history of swim technique (sidestroke, trudgen, overarm, etc.) which leads to a description of the four current strokes.  As in Swimming Dynamics, he illustrates a "typical" way of swimming each stroke even though he admits a wide range of technique possibilities.  (Colwin is an excellent draughtsman, but there seems to be a drawing error:  In the text and in his side view drawings of the crawl, he describes a full body rotation of 35 - 45 degrees each way as desirable.  His front view, however, shows the swimmer almost dead flat throughout the crawl.) <p>Continuing the exploration of hydrodynamics that he began in Swimming Dynamics, Colwin discusses the bow wave, lift, his vortex-shedding theories of propulsion, strategies of streamlining, using the hands to direct the water and many other ideas.<p>In covering training, Colwin (and Pyne) offer the usual ideas of aerobic vs anaerobic, interval vs distance, etc.  I find myself thinking of his section, "Development of the Will to Overcome Fatigue," as I swim.  I realize that I have rarely reached Hurt, much less Agony or Pain since high school (at least not in the pool).<p>The book ends with a history of competition that discusses rule changes, better pools, the World Cup tour (he's not impressed), national team vs club-based coaching, a chronicle of doping, fistgloves, the problems with bodysuits, a ranking of the stars of the 20th century and a look forward.<p>I definitely found the book worth reading.</span>

Not only is this an excellent read, but it is a book to be kept and re-read from time to time by anyone interested in swimming. As a former competitive swimmer, this is certainly the best ever book I have read on a great sport. You definitely need your own copy !</span>
