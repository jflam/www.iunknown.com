                    <span>Sun Tzu collected his teachings into the ancient Chinese  treatise on military strategy known as "The Art of War" about twenty-five hundred years ago. Afterward his teachings were passed down through the Sun family, or a group of disciples, who edited or expounded upon the original writings until they assumed their current form. Sun Pin was the great-grandson of Sun Tzu, and he used the teachings of his brilliant ancestor to develop his Treatise "Military Methods". This wonderful translation by Ralph D. Sawyer includes both of these ancient texts.<p>  "The Art of War" has been studied the world over by military, political and business leaders seeking to understand the nature of human conflict in all it's forms. Although thousands of years old, the teachings of Sun Tzu remain relevant even today. The maxims of Sun Tzu have been applied by students of "The Art of War" to such modern conflicts as the Korean and Vietnam Wars.<p>  Sun Tzu's teachings range from the seemingly simple, such as "Someone unfamiliar with the mountains and forests cannot advance the army", to the more complex and thought provoking, such as "In order await the disordered. In tranquility await the clamorous. This is the way to control the mind." The manual covers such diverse topics as training, supplies, terrain, the seasons and the use of spys, and includes detailed commentary by China's greatest military leaders through the centuries.<p>  "The Art of War" should be read by anyone who studies military history or strategy, and is part of the curriculum of many of the world's military academies. Studying the teachings of Sun Tzu can help you to form strategies for conflict resolution or negotiating in business, political or social endeavors through a greater understanding of human interaction.</span>

                    <span>The Art of War is the oldest and best military treatise this world has seen.  It is amazing how Sun Tzu can talk about strategy and warfare in thirteen short chapters.  His book is just the best about competition and strategy. And now we get to Sun Pin, the military strategist.  I have awesome respect for him.  He was betrayed and mutilated by his best friend, and still, he survived.  He defeated his nemesis in a great strategic way that Sun Tzu would have mostly likely done.  These two are the best and if they were in this world today, they would won every war that we fight, by their ability to adapt.  If you want to get Ancient Strategy and Chinese Culture, get this book.</span>

                    <span>The publishing of both Sun Tzu's and Sun Pin's works together makes for a valuable purchase. I've found that this translation is also quite easy to follow, and the comments assist with interpretation. These works represent awesome insights into the nature of warfare.</span>

                    <span>The text does not remotely fill the entire page to lengthen the book and suggest a happier price. Sun Pin's addition is severely garbled because the original text was damaged and it's contadictory. The most likely reason that Sun Pin's methods were forgotten and preserved only in a tomb was because (GEE GOLLY) people believed it wasn't worth reading. The commentary uses the word obvious extremely often among various other uneeded lengthening exercises.The author describes himself as an imaginative entrepenuer.(Sun Tzu flirts with perfection)</span>

                    <span>Sun Tzu is simplily the greatest military genius of all time. Dispite the book being written centuries ago it still provides wisdom for present warfare. Even more then that it also provides wisdom for everyday use. This  book should be requirred reading in schools. Adding The Military Methods to  the Art of War to create one book was a great idea. Sun pin picks up were  is grandfather leaves off and he goes into a little more detail. The book  provides history of China when the books were written. I usually do not  like commentaries but these were not that bad. Personally I like to take my  own meaning out of the context of this book which I believe gives it more  meaning to your own life in this present time.</span>
