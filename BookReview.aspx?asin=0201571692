                <span id="Label1">A <I>software process</I> defines the steps required to create software successfully. Written by the same authors who brought you the Unified Modeling Language (UML), <I>The Unified Software Development Process</I> introduces a new standard for creating today's software that will certainly be useful for any software developer or manager who is acquainted with UML.<p> Early sections introduce four basic principles of the unified process: that software should stress <I>use cases</I> (which show how it interacts with users), that the process is <I>architecture-centric</I>, and that it is <I>iterative</I> and <I>incremental</I>. The authors then apply these principles to their software process, which involves everything from gathering system requirements to analysis, design, implementation, and testing. The use-case examples are excellent and include concrete examples drawn from such areas as banking and inventory control.<p> The authors point out the connection between UML document types (like use cases, class diagrams, and state transition diagrams) with various models used throughout the software process. They provide very short, real-world examples that illustrate how their ideas have been successfully applied. The straightforward tour of the new unified software process gets extra elaboration--along with some advice--in later chapters that further describe the author's ideas on design. With the weight of these three expert authors behind it, readers can expect <I>The Unified Software Development Process</I> to be an important book and one that will be valuable to any working designer or manager. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I suppose that students at our school are representative for the worldwide population of cs students. This book is not at all an easy introduction to the unified process. Having been introduced to the principles of ooad in an earlier semester, and thus already knowing something about ooad, we were introduced to Jacobsons RUP. Their book contains a lot of knowledge, but unfortunately the authors are a) either not very good at explaining their knowledge b) hiding the knowledge to make it seem more intelligent than it really is or c) have written the book for people who already knows, at least something, about the unified process, or the objectory process that preceeded RUP. If you are looking for good illustrations and examples on how to model a system with uml and the added classifiers using the the RUP, then I suggest that you don't start with this book. You'll be disappointed. Working on our first project using the RUP, hearing complaints from nearly all students over the lack of understandable examples, I bought Jacobsons's earlier book - Object Oriented Software Engineering. In that book I found much better and concrete examples, which were very helpfull in understanding their latest book (but that shouldn't be necessary!). If you are looking for an easy introduction to the unified process, conveniently having things explained for you in an easy to understand way, then this is definitely not the book for you. Very poor examples - or should I say lack of good and understandable examples. On the other hand, if you don't know so much about ooad, has lots of time, likes to crack nuts, read between the lines and guess about this and that, then this book is for you. - I admit that after having gone through the hard process, gaining experience in RUP through a practical project, I have come to like the process and has found it very usefull. The principles of the RUP are sound and good. Now that I have gone through the struggle, and knows it better, I'm glad that I have it on my shelf. It contains a lot of usefull, but unfortunately poorly explained, and illustrated, information.</span>

                    <span>I had to buy this book for coursework. Now, I can't imagine authors with more knowledge of UML, etc. than these three guys. However, every chapter reads like a student paper in which the main intention is filling up space for credit. Don't get me wrong here. I read programming books for fun. I'm not one of those people who doesn't enjoy reading technical material. They just managed to take an already dry subject and dry it further. As you read through there are various references to other books, articles, whatever. It seems as though no original material was written for this book. So, here's my advice. Read those books. Don't read this one unless you need to catch up on some sleep.</span>

                    <span>Like many software developers with good ideas, the trio of Jacobson/Booch/Rumbaugh can't write to save their souls. There's good material in here if you can filter out the tedious repetitions, redundancies, and points of misplaced emphasis. The book completely fails to communicate the authors' important methodological insights. Sigh. I'm disappointed. But I'm keeping the book; it's good enough to stay in my library for a while.</span>

                    <span>There is not much more to add beyond the title of my review. Jacobson, Booch and Rumbaugh may be the fathers of UP but their writing style is far too academic for the average reader. Keep this book on your top shelf as reference material when you need to clarify a point on UP. But if you need a more manageable understanding of the unified process, buy Philippe Kruchten's "The Rational Unified Process, An Introduction". It's RUP for the common programmer. Another book to buy is Craig Larman's "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to OOAD and the Unified Process". Larman does an excellent job at demonstrating how UP can be used on a real project.</span>
