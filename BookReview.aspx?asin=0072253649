                    <span>This book will help you understand many important concepts before you get serious about studying and designing relational databases. This author knows how to teach and I wish he would consider writing a book about mySQL database so that I would only have to read 1 book. </span>

                    <span>This is perhaps the best written guide to anything to do with computers that I have ever read! I'm a rank beginner with databases, and after studying with this book I feel perfectly comfortable with the larger more technical books that I've found. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book is billed as a self teaching guide to understanding databases. That's true. It is also billed as a good place for the beginner to start. I don't find that to be as true as the other. 
<br />
<br />Specifically, I think this authors approach to teaching SQL is very well done, quite possibly the best I've seen. The overwhelming percentage of books for beginners, and particularly for Microsoft Access users never mention SQL at all. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, the first chapter starts off talking about the 'Properties of a Database' including the Physical Layer, the Logical Layer, the External Layer. Then, still in the first chapter, there's hierarchical models, network models, relational models, object-oriented models, and object-relational models. This is chapter one and at the end of the chapter he says: "The remainder of this book will focus on the relational model...." Why bother going through all this mess just to be told that we aren't going to use them in the rest of the book. He promised, well the marketing people promised, on the back cover: "No unnecessary technical jargon." In my mind 'hierarchical models' is unnecessary technical jargon. 
<br />
<br />I guess that what I'm saying is that this book is not a beginners book, it is more suited for an intermediate user. For an intermediate user, ready to go beyond Microsoft Access's Query By Example (QBE), then I rate the book highly.</span>

                    <span>Very, very good introduction to databases. I'm mostly self-taught in the DB field, and felt that although I knew and understood most concepts at a reasonable level, there were a few bits and pieces missing. I bought this book in the hope that it would help me find those bits and pieces, and wasn't disappointed. This book would be excellent value if it cost more; at it's current price it's mindbogglingly good value.</span>

                    <span>I've been reading technical books for the last 20 years and this is one of my favorites! The information is clean and accurate, you can plow through the book relatively quickly, and the concepts are presented very clearly. I highly recommend it - the "arm and a leg" you save may be your own. 
<br />
<br />The subtitle says, "A Self-Teaching Guide", and that is exactly what you get. I found the prose approachable and the chapters very well organized. Other books sometimes offer an esoteric quiz at the end of the chapter, but this quiz actually helps focus the reader on the main points. Nobody leaves wondering what matters most. 
<br />
<br />The book targets the novice. However, it doesn't skimp on the critical, classic database issues such as the outer join, choosing primary and alternate keys, data normalization, good data modeling, and the differences between physical and logical design. Don't dismiss the book if you think that you are already pretty knowledgeable -- I guarantee you'll learn something new. I know that I did. 
<br />
<br />I was surprised at the treatment given to Security. Instead of limiting the discussion entirely to database security, the book expanded briefly into some adjacent areas. Anyone that works with a database should know this information, but it's hard to find it so well ordered. Great coverage. 
<br />
<br />I do have one objection. After reading it, I thought it would be great to sit down and interview the author to learn more. It's not that anything is missing, but this complex topic was made very approachable...it left me looking for more. Sometimes the audience hates you at the end of the show, but this refreshingly straightforward leaves you ready for more. 
<br />
<br />I look forward to the next book, where I expect the author explains how to "kick it up a notch" and become a Database Jedi Master. With a foundation like this, I know I'll be ready!
