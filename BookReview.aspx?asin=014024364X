                <span id="Label1">It is history on an epic yet human scale. Vast in scope, exhaustive in original research, written with passion, narrative skill, and human sympathy, A People's Tragedy is a profound account of the Russian Revolution for a new generation.  Many consider the Russian Revolution to be the most significant event of the twentieth century. Distinguished scholar Orlando Figes presents a panorama of Russian society on the eve of that revolution, and then narrates the story of how these social forces were violently erased. Within the broad stokes of war and revolution are miniature histories of individuals, in which Figes follows the main players' fortunes as they saw their hopes die and their world crash into ruins.  Unlike previous accounts that trace the origins of the revolution to overreaching political forces and ideals, Figes argues that the failure of democracy in 1917 was deeply rooted in Russian culture and social history and that what had started as a people's revolution contained the seeds of its degeneration into violence and dictatorship.  A People's Tragedy is a masterful and original synthesis by a mature scholar, presented in a compelling and accessibly human narrative.</span>

                    <span>The American Civil War,the French Revolution,the Holocaust,and the Russian Revolution will always tempt writers to re-examine them, from a new generation's perspective. <P>Certainly, idealogues and scholars will never tire of refuting the claims of their opponents, and dismissing attempts at writing a "readable" history of the Russian Revolution as dangerously simplistic. <P>Figes' post-Cold War era history of the Russian Revolution is a good introduction to the topic. The definative "version" of 20th C Russian history is yet to be written, and it will ultimately be the task of a Russian historian free from the taint of Soviet "historiography" to produce such a work.<P>BUT.. while waiting... this book is adequate. I believe it is impossible to read a single work on the Russian Revolution and form an objective opinion. However, objectivity is of more concern to the scholar than the lay-reader. Few scholars on this subject care to rise above sectarian arguments, and they share much in common with the irritating obscurantism of the Menshevik/Bolshevik polemicists. <P>Personally I have always felt that Trotsky's "History of the Russian Revolution" was a readable, if partisan account of the social and economic conditions which led to the Revolution, and that Roy Medvedev's "Let History Judge", was a suitable sequel. Certainly Leninism contained the seeds of Stalinism, if it was not the actual root stock and green-house of Stalinism. Trotsky, although a "hero" of my youth, also lacked " clean hands" after the suppression of the Kronstadt Uprising. It will be worth waiting to see if any definate and readable history of Bukharin waits in the wings.<P>There are dozens of wretched books sitting in community libraries which purport to tell the story of the Russian revolution. Of the post Cold War writers, this is my favotite.<P>Figes has an editorial slant, as do all popular historians. He does arrange his narrative in a readable format.. that is, in "digestible hunks". His use of personal narratives sheds light on complex issues,and his development of certain historical characters help move his narrative forward. His far ranging opinions include observations on post-Soviet political life. The photographs chosen for this book are good,and some are quite disturbing. They are well-arranged, to support ideas developed in the text.<P>Opinions and belief shape our thinking, oft times more than actual facts. I think, that this book is a breath of fresh air. However,if the historical period is of interest to you, keep on breathing, and keep on reading. If this is the ONLY book you read about the Russian Revolution, you will certainly be no more mis-informed than generations of policy makers in the US government OR the Soviet government.</span>

                    <span>"A People's Tragedy" is a rather detailed account of the Russian Revolution which maintains an excellent balance of erudition and lucidity. Figes convincingly presents the revolution as a 33-year process involving many contending interests without ever losing his focus on the eventual replacement of Tsarism with Communism.<P>The first few chapters address the state of the Romanov regime in the decades preceding its overthrow, various parliamentary and cultural movements at the turn of the century, and the organization of the peasantry following the abolition of serfdom. This background information later proves essential. One can see, for example, how the land management and village self-governance of the peasants led to the soviet structure used by the victorious Reds. Figes revisits these themes throughout the book, depicting a Romanov dynasty that was more bumbling autocracy than cruel tyranny and raising the peasants from their usual role as a haplessly oppressed mass to a significant political force.<P>I found the treatment of the Bolsheviks to be relatively sympathetic, and the book does not suffer because of it. They are depicted as a ruthless and especially fortunate revolutionary faction, a group ready to use any means necessary to obtain power but, in the end, given a gift with the success of their unlikely coup. Some readers may find this insufficiently damning but, while I would have liked a little more about how the nature of the revolution affected later developments, the abominable governance which followed is not Figes's topic.</span>

                    <span>One of the difficulties in selecting books on Russia, is that so many come with a built-in perspective and ideology. Facts which support a thesis are included, those which do not are conveniently ignored.<BR>Of all the histories of Russia for the period prior to and during the Revolution, in my view this is the finest. From Figes we certainly get the big picture, and not only the key events, but also insight into Russian culture and the personality of its people, from the peasant through the professionals and the nobility. <BR>But Figes has an eye for telling detail. The book spans a half-century, and as the text develops, he follows the lives of ordinary and extraordinary Russians during this time, in little insets within text body. As the major events unfold, we see the lives of individual humans unfold, and their thoughts and feelings evolve. <BR>If I could only read one book on the Russian Revolution, this would be the one.</span>

                    <span>Figes' mammoth volume is a welcome addition to the already vast literature on the October Revolution. Not only is his narration factually sound, he provides a staggering amount of detail and anecdotal material. He also lays to rest a number of myths (not least the Communists' version of the heroic storming of the Winter Palace, and the anti-Communists' insistence that the Bolsheviks led the masses by the nose over the precipice). My only complaint -- and it is a significant one -- is the rather aristocratic and conservative tone of the book -- so intent is Figes on demythologizing the Russian left, especially the Bolsheviks, and the "noble masses" that halfway through the book I began to feel as though I were reading the reminiscences of an exiled nobleman or bourgeois. His depiction of the masses is shot through with the finicky squeamishness of an aristocratic aesthete, and soon becomes quite irksome. The Revolution may well have degenerated into the counterrevolutionary attack on the Kronstadt insurgents and the rise of the Stalinist monstrosity that has deformed all subsequent "Marxist" states -- for which Lenin and his comrades bear much of the blame -- but Figes seems all too willing to throw the baby of October out with the bathwater of its betrayal. Still, when read with a critical eye, this is one of the best books in English on 1917 next to Rabinowitch's _The Bolsheviks Come to Power_ and Lincoln's _Passage through Armageddon_.</span>
