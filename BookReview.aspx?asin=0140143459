                    <span>I picked up a copy of this book after reading Moneyball - Michael Lewis's book on the business of baseball (an excellent book that I have now read several times).  Although Wall Street does not hold the interest to me that baseball does, this is an entertaining and informative book on big money trading in the 80's.  I was engaged from start to finish with the personalities of the folks at Salomon Brothers (the firm which Lewis trained and worked for).  Although I am not familiar with the details of bond trading, this was a facinating journey and well told.  Fun to read about Milken, Perelman, Icahn from the days when they were only known by readers of the Wall Street Journal and not household names.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys finding out about corporate culture and how the personalities of the individual can shape and effect the whole.  Then pick-up Moneyball and see how a maverick personality has started to effect change in baseball.

                    <span>I had long heard nothing but great things about "Liar's Poker" but it was not until I found myself in an airport bookstore before a cross-country "red eye" that I decided to read it.  It was no disappointment--the book reads like a novel, and Mr. Lewis blends a perfect mixture of sardonic irreverence with a traders' "greed" to land the bull's eye.  As someone familiar with bond trading, "Liar's Poker" was still informative and an enjoyable read; and quick too--the entire book was finished by the time my flight landed in LA! </span>

                    <span>Sell your soul and buy this book with the change! I read this book -several times- a good few years back and having just picked up a new copy and finished it in one go, it is still a classic read after all these years. Michael Lewis's behind the scenes peek at Wall Street's 'Greed is Good' mentality of Salomon's bond dealers in the 1980's, is a book that gets a hook in you from the very start. People still talk about this book after a decade, it's that  good. Read it and believe it.</span>

                    <span>          This is a superb ,blow by blow, in the trenches,account of how the capital markets of the USA are organized and function on a day to day basis.In chapter 12 of the General Theory(GT},Keynes correctly categorized the financial markets as a game of Old Maid or Musical Chairs,where the goal is "...foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public"(Keynes,1936,p.154).Wall Street speculators" are concerned,not with what an investment is really worth to a man who buys it "for keeps",but with what the market will value it at,under the influence of mass psychology,three months or a year hence"(Keynes would have said three minutes or three hours if he were writing the GT today)(Keynes,pp.154-155).The capital,financial and stock markets are not organized to maximize long run net present value,but very short run net present value.The markets are essentially based on a short run ,short sighted,pennywise poundfoolish approach that does not maximize long run economic growth and welfare.Keynes's views were the direct result of his extensive hands on experience in operating in such markets himself over a forty year period.The potential bookbuyer is urged to read this book simultaneously with chapter 12 of the GT.</span>
