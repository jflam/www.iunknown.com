                <span id="Label1"><P><B>David Freeman</B> brings you the inside scoop on how to apply the Emotioneering&#153; techniques he's so well known for.  These powerful techniques create a breadth and depth of emotion in a game, and induce a player to identify with the role he or she is playing.  Mr. Freeman's techniques are so highly sought after because they're the key to mass market success in today's competitive game market.  The over 300 distinct Emotioneering techniques in this book include (to name but a few): ways to give emotional depth to an NPC (non-player character), even if the NPC has just one line of dialogue; techniques to bond a player to a game's NPCs; and techniques to transform a game into an intense emotional journey.  In a warm and crystal-clear style, Mr. Freeman provides examples which demonstrate exactly how to apply the techniques.  He also shows how some of these techniques were utilized in, and contributed greatly to the success of such games as "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"; "Deus Ex"; and "Thief" I & II, among others.  The book is packed with striking art by some of today's top concept artists and illustrators, including an eight-page color section and a four-color, fold-out cover.  When you've finished this book, you'll be equipped to apply Mr. Freeman's powerful Emotioneering techniques to artfully create emotion in the games you design, build, or produce.</P></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>If books had a dressing contest, this one would surely take first place. It applies every imaginable gimmick for the sole purpose of impressing the reader. There are many pictures in it, all of which are sensational adolescent fantasy material, many filling a full page and sometimes in color. The text is broken up in various ways, with intervening boxes and sidebars in incosistent shapes and sizes, as if designed specifically to distract you. Its "techniques" are trademarked under the bombastic name "Emotioneering", and worst of all, the author makes a point of repeatedly flaunting his screen(game)writing prowess.
<br />
<br />But what are these "Emotioneering" techniques? has freeman actually invented a set of technical rules which applies to drama? No, that would be Aristotle. If you're really interested in the rules of drama, that's who you should read. What Freeman refers to as "Emotioneering" are nothing more than a pile of bad screenwrting practices you can pick up in any second rate screenwriting book - except for two differences; first, in this sorry book they are given mind-blowing names like "technique stacking" and "Emotionally Complex Moments and Situations Techniques", and second, the examples used are said to be taken "from games" instead of from films, but, of course, all of these "games" have been imagined by Freeman for the purpose of the book (which he expressly admits), because there IS no real world game that would serve his purpose - he is really talking about films. 
<br />
<br />But when it comes to films, Freeman seems to think the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about the best you can get. Ask any amateur screenwriter and they'll tell you that the one award these films honestly deserve is Worst Screenplay. The Lord of the Rings, like Freeman's book, is all spectacle and no content.
<br />
<br />What kept me trudging through the morass of simpleton notions and overflowing filler text was the hope that, as a man who has some experience with writing for games, Freeman would have a few words to say about the intersection of stories with interactivity - the most alluring aspect of combining games with stories. Although he doesn't take up the subject directly, he does mention at some point that writing for games is complicated by the need to accommodate for the actions of the player. He says that he uses branching statements in his scripts for this, and that this is a very tough problem. Other than that, there are some minor points like how to allow the player to experience the events of your computerized screenplay in several different orders (which is made possible only by the ridicules simplicity of the story proposed as an example), but nothing which actually deals with letting a human have a meaningful interaction with a story. 
<br />
<br />To summarize, except for the pictures (if that's your cup of tea) I really can't see any reason to buy this book over any other random heap of text. If you want spectacle, you got it. If you want knowledge, you do yourself a favor and read three books: The Poetics by Aristotle, for the real "Emotioneering" techniques, Chris Crawford on Game Design, for an understanding of why the problem is not nearly as simple as Freeman pretends it to be, and Chris Crawford on Interactive Storytelling for the best solutions to the problem currently available.

                    <span>This book has about 10 anonymous, 5 star reviews that all sound the same.  I'm VERY suspicious that these are fake reviews.
<br />
<br />I've read parts of this book and I understand why most of the non-anonymous reviewers have problems with it.  While it has some interesting aspects, it doesn't go very in depth and the amount of ridiculous buzzwords (like Emotioneering) make it hard to swallow.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I first bought this book after reading all the great reviews of it here on Amazon.  I passed it around at my company, and by now the game designers I work with and I (at a large Los Angeles developer) have worn our copies of this book ragged with use.  With its 300 specific techniques, "Creating Emotion in Games" moves emotional game design ahead by decades.  
<br />
<br />It's quite generous of Mr. Freeman to share so many secrets.  It's clear why Will Wright (The Sims) chose to write the forward, and why gamasutra said it was the best book ever written on the subject.
<br />
<br />The book is helped by the fact that Freeman is such an expert on gameplay.  He has been hired to help design and write games for Sony, Electronic Arts, Activision, Microsoft, Atari, Midway, 3D Realms, and others. 
<br />
<br />In the book (which, by the way, is packed with beautiful art), Freeman divides all the ways of making games emotionally engaging into 32 categories.  He then gives about 7 or 8 examples of techniques from each category, and shows exactly how to apply every one, without exception.
<br />
<br />For instance, one category involves techniques to get a player to identify with the character he/she plays.  Another category is techniques to make the player bond emotionally with the NPCs (non-player characters).  Another involves ways to make the world of the game emotionally rich and inviting -- be it a military game, science fiction, or something else.  
<br />
<br />Freeman's clear and warm style, and his off-beat sense of humor make the book a fun and easy read.  
<br />
<br />After buying the book, I got curious about the author and did a little research on Emotioneering on the web. I learned that Freeman is an in-demand speaker game conferences in the U.S. and around the world.  
<br />
<br />He has sold a bunch of scripts to Hollywood studios, and is writing a pair of big fantasy films which are being shot in the summer of 2005.  He also teaches the largest screenwriting workshop in Los Angeles (based at Universal Pictures) -- no small feat in a city with hundreds of such teachers.
<br />
<br />My goal as a designer is to enhance gameplay by moving players emotionally, and to leave them changed by my games.  If you share these goals, your creativity is in for a rocket ride when you apply the techniques in this book.

                    <span>The book has some good ideas -- but they are incomplete. If you want The Rest of the Story you will need to pay Freeman for his services. Example: Freeman says he has a list of over a thousand character traits for creating characters. If he has such a list, it wasn't included with the book. The pages in the book are beautiful; it is a well-crafted book -- just like a fancy brochure. Caveat emptor.</span>

                    <span>This book feels like a big PR piece for the writer who sounds like an egomanic. He does not even seem to understand the whole idea of game play! Some sort of washed up screenwriting teachier trying to apply his ideas to game development. I found this book almost unreadable - the ego and references to his life really get in the way. You have to really sift through so much attitude and filler to get to any points that are generally covered in most screenwriting books - but far better.
<br />
<br /> Buy this book if you want an expensive ad for David Freeman.</span>
