                    <span>This book was the first biography I read on Eisenhower, and being an Ambrose fan I knew he worked with Ike on editing his memoirs back in the 60's.  What better historian to tell the tale of Ike's life than the one who spent countless hours with the man himself?
<br />
<br />The real value of this book is on the study of the man himself, and less about the facts, figures, and personalities Ike experienced in a truly remarkable life.  Events and people are examined only in light of Ike's relationship to them.  What you end up getting is an understanding of the man, his motives, and what turned out to be an excellent study on leadership.
<br />
<br />I am looking forward to reading and exploring more about Ike, and using this book as an excellent introduction to his life and the man himself.
<br />
<br />One item of particular concern were the captions in the photo section of the book, many of which are clearly wrong.  It was hard to imagine that Ambrose wrote these captions, and if he did not, certainly did not review them before they were published.  One photo is of Ike greeting US soldiers in Le Havre, France and it incorrectly states that the date of the photo was February, 1944.  If that was true, Ike and all of the soldiers in the picture were POW's because the Allies did not land in France until June, 1944.  I suspect that the date should have read 1945.
<br />
<br />There are other troubling errors in the photos which can only be described as careless.  Don't let it detract from the excellent content of the book, which were written by the historian most recognize as the authority on Ike.</span>

                    <span>If you are only going to read one biography about Eisenhower, this one-volume version by Stephen Ambrose is the one to choose. Ambrose exhibits his deep and comprehensive knowledge of his subject and in the process provides the reader with with a real sense of Eisenhower.<p>While Ambrose does highlight Ike's shortcomings where appropriate, there is no doubt that he had a deep admiration for his subject. This admiration leads him to write the book from a certain perspective - not necessarily biased, but certainly favorably disposed. If you are looking for a different take on Ike (albeit narrowly focused on his relationship with Truman) read David McCullough's Truman. <p>Overall, this a solid book from a great author.</span>

                    <span>I very much enjoyed this book. Ambrose went over Ike's life in good detail. I learned alot about the man and also about his military career and his political background.<br>I was most interested about his presidency and I feel like Ambrose did give me a very good idea of how Ike came to his decisions and also how Ike formed his beliefs.<br>I do think that this was a very favorable bio of Ike.<br>Ambrose seemed to not want to really find fault with Ike on any of the issues except for his stance on civil rights.<br>I also do not agree that Ike is one of the greatest presidents of the 20th century along with Wilson and the two Roosevelts as Ambose said.<br>I would say that the best presidents of the 20th century were the two Roosevelts, Truman,and Reagan. <br>I would rank Ike as a good president but not a great president.<br> Thus I feel this biography of Ike is the best out there and will teach you alot about the man and his policies but that I would not agree with the positive assessment of Ambrose of Ike in many areas.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book, easy to read and very inspiring.  Ike was a qunitesential american from the midwest who rose to the pinnacle of american power.  Among the excellent insights in this book you will find:<br>1)  Details of Ike's creation of the Highway system, he had learned first hand that americas roads were unexceptable in the 20s.<br>2)  Ikes decision at Nromandy, where he penned a note in case of disaster.<br>3)  Ike's simple manners and soldierly conduct.  The quiet demeanor that held the alliance together.<br>4)  Ike's term as president where he ended the Korean war, and created a policy of intervening to stop communism(Eisenhower doctrin).  <p>The BEST book on Ike, a wonderful account.  Clearly the best book on Ike ever written.  Ambrose brings his superior prose to this volume.</span>

                    <span>But he was ok as president  realizing than in his own sphere of influence you have more power as general than president. Steve Ambrose has done a skillful job condensing two volumes into one. I'm not sure what he left out. Having read "At Ease"  written by Ike just before the presidency & "At War" written by his grandson this book dwelt on his presidency. Although it is a whole life biography there is not  a lot of attention spent on his greatest accomplishment in life: Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe.   <br>   The image of Ike as a do nothing golfer is changing. While there was relative calm at home he was in his element dealing with international affairs. This required a disipline & organized mind, so in that sense his military background served him well. His political instincts were good & he did not rush to judgement.  Stevenson looked foolish running against him but how could have anyone have beaten him? He virtually ignored McCarthy & he eventually self destructed.<br>   In race relations he was lost & did a poor job. He could have done more to advance civil rights but he merely enforced the law.  Ambrose goes into some detail on how he basically managed the "cold war". That it did not become hot is an accomplishment. You don"t get credit for bad things that never happen. The most unfortunate event of his administration was the U-2 that was shot down over the Soviet Union. Ike was striving for a nuclear test ban treaty that was to be the capstone of his career. Ambrose was a well known cheer-leader for Eisenhower but takes the reader through the painful cover-up that ensued. A sorry chapter in the saddest year of his presidency & the last. Ike wasn't comfortable with Nixon as the Republican canidate for president in 1960 but except for Rockefeller there wasn"t anyone else. He disliked JFK but his less than whole hearted support for Nixon may have cost him the election. This was a surprise admission of the author near the end of the book.<br> That he ranks in the top third of all out presidents is probably a fair accessment.</span>
