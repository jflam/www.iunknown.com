                    <span>This textbook takes microeconomics which can be explained in a technical, exact manner and makes it abstract and foreign.
<br />
<br />This textbook's sentences run-on and lose their direction, confusing the reader...If a reader had a firm understanding of economics prior to this textbook, after reading it, it is certain that they will no longer have the understanding of economics, that they did previously.
<br />
<br />It is a travestly when a textbook designed to teach the reader about a certain subject, actually makes them less knowledgeable of the subject.
<br />
<br />I must also ask why it is being used to teach university students in different years and programs, when it should not be, for example in my university it is being taught in the following programs
<br />
<br />IBBA - Year 1
<br />BBA - Year 2
<br />BAS - Year 3
<br />MBA - Year 1</span>

                    <span>Organization of the books is good. Topics are discussed with enough clarity and graphs and illustrations are describing enough. The level of algebra and math is at an intermediate undergraduate level (economics major). I think it is a complete book for anybody who wants to have an understanding of microeconomics. I am a Ph.D. student of economics now and if I am going to teach an undergrad micro course, I will certainly choose this textbook.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book is clearly written, however, I found that it is to simple and somewhat weak as a intermediate level text. I agree with most of the other comments that it would be more suitable as an entry level Economics text. This book would probably be better suited for students who are buisness or non-economics majors taking the intermediate course.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps one of the worst written textbooks of all time.  The convoluted sentences contain multiple sub clauses and prepositional phrases.  The graphs are inadequately labeled and do more to confuse than clarify.  Couldn't the publisher at least have hired a Wall Street Journal editor to give it a rewrite?  They might as well have printed this in ancient Sumerian.  The accompanying study guide reiterates the key topics in plain English, but contains typos.  Politically speaking, the book displays a strong libertarian, anti-regulation, anti-worker bias.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to have clarity in the major topics of microeconomics which could help you to understand the basics. However this should only be used as basis reading and other books should be used to cover the various topics in more depth, such as Koutsoyanis and others which give more insight on specific topics. All in all it is a good solid core text book which can give you the basic knowledge needed in microeconomics.</span>
