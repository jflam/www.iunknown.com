                    <span>Everyone procrastinates. Some of us are more prone to putting things off than others, but procrastination is a common human behavior. So, why a book for procrastinators? Who will read it? The people who really need such a handbook will put off reading it anyway, so what's the point? I began this book with a skeptical attitude.<P>I read introductions. I often find some interesting gems in those opening pages. It happened with The Procrastinator's Handbook. Did you know that procrastination is a habit? And habits can be broken, changed? Hmmm. Procrastination thinking can significantly alter my performance and get in the way of my success without my even realizing it. I had never thought about procrastination that deeply. <P>Part One was fascinating. The author explores a variety of types of procrastination. On almost every page I found myself nodding with an attitude of "yes, I can see that." And I'm starting to collect some tips about how to conquer the tendency to put things off. The vignettes are supporting my learning. This book is comfortable, easy to read. It's sort of like a friend telling you things you sort of know, but never really examined. New, acceptable information and insight. <P>Learning. That's what this book is about. Yeah. And that sense is reinforced by the "extra credit" assignments at the close of each chapter. I remember extra credit work from school; most of the time the tasks were fun and more educational than I would want to admit. Same thing here. I like the quotes at the end of each chapter, too. They sort of underline the message of the chapter.<P>Author Rita Emmett gives seminars on procrastination and the productive use of time. I felt like I was sitting in one of her seminars-gaining knowledge, insight, and inspiration in every chapter. She was talking to me. The tone of the writing gave me the warm, included feeling of sitting in a small seminar with Rita (see, I'm already talking as if the author is a personal friend who cares about me and my procrastination problem.<P>Uh, oh. Folding down pages. And I feel myself making commitments to complete some of those unfinished tasks that I conveniently add to my to-do list so I can get them out of my face. Oops. She caught me. How does Rita know so much about what I do? Gotta keep this book at arm's length or this stuff will affect my thinking and even behavior.<P>Too late. I'm into Part Two: Why We Procrastinate. Boy, does this sound familiar! By the time I get to the chapter entitled, "Help! I'm overwhelmed!", I'm eager for answers. I feel like I've joined Procrastinators Anonymous. I need answers. Solutions. Ideas for changing my behavior.<P>Part Three: Proven Strategies for Conquering Procrastination. Hungrily, I move through 75 pages of techniques, highlighting, turning pages, making a few notes. Some of this material is not new, though maybe packaged differently. Most of what I'm reading, though, is fresh, focused ideas. This information and advice will help improve my life. I can feel it. <P>The last paragraph of text in the book tells the story. "You can change your old procrastinating ways. Don't forget Emmett's Law: The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself. So go ahead and get started creating the life you want. You deserve a great one!" Works for me! It's time to make a difference in my life.</span>

                    <span>Rita Emmett when you die you will get your angel wings because this book is a gift from God and I am so thankful. See... I am a well meaning person who has goals. The problem is I get sidetracked and that means I am a procrastinator. Personally I think the higher the IQ the more a person will fit this label.<P>The book is small and just over 200 pages long and it is the only book I have ever read that deals with learning as the sub-title says "Mastering the Art of DOing It Now" that I have found really works. The book is in a three part Play layout. The First part is about Getting a Grip on Procrastination 1. Tacking the Dread 2 What's Your Excuse 3 The Games People Play<P>Part Two is Why We procrastinate 4. The Fears That Stop You Cold 5. I Wanna Do It All 6 Help! I'm Overwhelmed <P>Part Three is Proven Strategies for Conquering Procrastination 7. Plan Time to Plan 8. Clutter Busting 9. Dollars and Sense 10 What Dreams Are Made Of<P>At the end of each section you get questions and a place to write down what she asks you to answer. She also has a website at www.ritaemmett.com The part on Clutter Busting will prove to be a help to every reader. The Plan Time to Plan points out that you have to have a basic plan, because people who just jump into a task, can find they lack the proper tools or that the task requires more time than they thought which in turn can end up being a discouragement and simply another task set aside that never gets done yet adds to ones depression.</span>

                    <span>As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is more a pep talk than a program of action. Its proposals for action won't be any surprise (make a list, set a timer and commit to doing a specific thing for an hour) and the little quotes at the end of every chapter run the gamut from truly inspirational to trite. However, everyone knows what they should be doing; the book aims to make you feel that you can actually do it. To that extent, it's very successful. You finish it feeling energized and capable of doing anything. Time will tell whether the feeling lasts, but at the moment I feel empowered and ready to take on a host of new things. Thanks, Rita Emmett!</span>

                    <span>If you are serious about ending your procrastination then do not waste MORE of your time reading this book. The author gives plenty of tips, common sense advice, and even famous quotes but in a very disorganized and unstructured manner. The whole book is like a long pep talk, full of good intentions but failing to solve the problem: your procrastination. I'm sure that you've tried most of the tips in this book (writing a To Do List, planning your work, scheduling, etc.) so it does not make sense to buy a book that basically tells you to try them again. Oh, you'll try them for a week or two (again, for the n'th time), and then go back to procrastinating, because that's what we procrastinators do! We start something and then never finish it! In the back cover, Frank McCourt (author of Angela's Ashes) calls it a "light-hearted book", proving that even the editor knows this is not a serious book on procrastination, and uses McCourt's comment to sell the book as easy reading, but definitely not serious content. I recommend Neil Fiore's NOW HABIT. It's deeper, structured and a serious read. Not a "light-hearted handbook".</span>
