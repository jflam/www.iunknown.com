                <span id="Label1">Mark Grand's <I>Patterns in Java, Volume 2</I> offers a grab bag of 50 reusable patterns for Java developers. Together, these patterns can improve your graphical user interface (GUI) design, testing, and the overall robustness of your next Java project.<p> After a short introduction to patterns and UML (unified modeling language) basics, the author looks at the software engineering life cycle, then moves on to describe the first group of object-oriented design patterns, including Creator, Polymorphism, and Law of Demeter.<p> Less theoretical, the next group of GUI patterns can let you create more responsive and intuitive interfaces. (Experienced programmers will already know several of these, such as the Form pattern for dialog boxes and the Disabled Irrelevant Things pattern, which grays out unused items.) The following sections on organizational coding and coding optimization patterns are the most practical as they offer ways to write better Java code, including conditional compilation, exception handling, and socket programming.<p> Next, the author includes a group of code robustness patterns, including assertions. The book closes with more theoretical material on testing. (Patterns such as White/Black Box or Regression Testing will be familiar turf to anyone who knows a little software engineering.)<p> A good many of the patterns cataloged here probably call attention to the obvious. (For instance, is using a Java <I>switch</I> statement really a true "pattern," as the authors argue?) But with a total of 50 patterns, this guide provides a helpful group of reusable strategies. Many of these patterns will be absolutely essential to any working Java developer. <I>--Richard Dragan</I> </span>

                    <span>My impressions:<BR>The introduction (UML short and SW Life Cycle) is excellent. I especially liked the collaboration diagrams.<P>The 'GRASP' (patterns) present good guidelines that can improve your overall class design. (Which classes to introduce, how to distribute the tasks to be performed ...). To get the idea, it is of advantage, when you have previously designed a larger project yourself (seeing that there are many solutions that will result in different gains and tradeoffs). The GRASP help you to explain why.<P>'GUI Design' improves your sensitiveness in creating user-friendly GUIs (choosing the appropriate interface design, presenting not more than 7 chunks, how and when to deliver feedback, ...).<P>The chapters 'Organizational Coding' and 'Code Robustness Patterns' explain techniques how to write clean and maintainable code (like the usage of adapter classes, constants in interfaces, finally statements ...). Those will already be known by todays more experienced programmers. But only because of this, they will neither harm anyone nor will they be trash anytime! (Sorry, this refers to very rude other reviews - but it really has to be told.)<P>From the 'Coding Optimization Patterns' i liked double-checked locking and the (maybe already known) lookup table technique.<P>The last chapter 'Testing Patterns' is the best general introduction into testing i've seen so far (black, white box, unit, integration , system, regression, acceptance and clean room testing).<P>Conclusion:<BR>When you come from the GoF book searching for further explanations buy 'Patterns in Java Volume 1' (notice the much improved 2nd Edition!), otherwise you'll be disappointed, here.<BR>The problem that Volume 2 has, is probably the (missed) target group. But it is not a bad book and Mr Grand knows what he writes, believe me.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, code examples are just as important as the text that explains it. Unfortunately, the author didn't think so. Going through the book and visiting the companion website to get the source code to run was a waste of time.<P>For the most part, the code didn't work at all! It didn't matter what compiler version you make use of; I used 4 different versions of the JDK. A book is supposed to save you time when you are trying to learn. This book doesn't fit the bill. I still had to go to the web in order to get working examples of the patterns mentioned in the book. <P>I'm sure the author know's what he talking about. I just think that he should prove it by writing programs that are tested and that compile before shipping it off in a book.</span>

                    <span>After reading the GOF patterns book I felt I was ready to tackle on more patterns and bought this book. This book made me feel dumb for a while for after repeated readings I still couldn't understand what the author is talking about. Finally decided to research on what other people thought about this book. Glad to find mostly negative comments in this review section for it proves i'm not dumb.</span>

                    <span>Around three years ago, I joked with a collegue of mine that a sure way to make a fortune would be to write a book which included the words "Java" and "Patterns" in the title. It would matter little, I argued, what the book contained. Just the title and a half-decent graphic on the front page would suffice.<P>It seems to me that both Mr Grand and his publishers Wiley are attempting to cash in on this very idea. The problem is that the joke was a bad one in the first place, and that it is now being made far too late in the day. <P>I hope that the software development community is sufficiently aware that it won't be taken in by this outrage.</span>
