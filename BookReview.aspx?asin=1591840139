                    <span>The past fifteen years have been witness to both negative and positive shifts in the American economy.  With the ever shrinking middle class, creating a larger gap between the rich and the poor, American industries are faced with either adapting to the consumer change or becoming extinct.  A fairly new trend, which can trace its roots back as early as the 1930's, is the "trading up" phenomenon.  
<br />
<br />Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske illustrate the American consumer's ever increasing need to create their individuality from the products they purchase, which creates a greater need for companies to specialize their product within their general market.  
<br />
<br />American consumerism has little to nothing to do with purchasing what one needs but focuses solely on what one wants.  Trading Up is rife with stories from Callaway Golf to Victoria Secret and how each person had to take a risk in order to achieve the monumental success.  "Trading up" utilizes emotional engagement as an essential factor in creating and advertising a product.  The product must instill a sense of desire within the consumer enabling them to pay a high premium.  Yet, emotional engagement is only the beginning.  
<br />Silverstein and Fiske refer to a "ladder of benefits", which are key factors in the "trading up" phenomenon.  The "ladder of benefits" reshape and provide new meaning to an product already on the market.  Through technical differences, superior functional performance and emotional engagement a company would be able to recreate an already existing product and sell it for a premium price.  Trading Up is an excellent book to lay the groundwork for a motivated, creative, and business savvy individual, who is ready to take their industry to the next level.  The middle class consumer is "trading up," will you?

                    <span>As the next generation in a family business rooted in luxury, I bought this book to expand my knowledge of the 'new luxury', middle-market consumer. The book was brilliantly written and well executed in terms of the combination of research, data, interviews and testimony complied. The authors made intelligent choices in the companies they profiled and the success tories they told were not only informative and helpful, but were inspiring. The language of the book was very straightforward and succinct. I have made this a mandatory read for anyone that works for me. I also bought and read Living It Up: America's Affair with Luxury by James B Twitchell which I also found to be an excellent read. I began my self-tutelage with Twitchell's book and in my having now read both, think I should have read this book first. This book laid a great foundation for what I met in Twitchell's book. My only complaint was that is was not longer, which is why I rated with 4 out of 5 stars, but I suspect that is just my brain being the sponge that it is and wanting more input.</span>

                    <span>The trading up proposition is interesting, but the readers can grab the gist of the book by just reading chapter 1 which summarizes the entire book, and chapter 14 which covers the way forward. The other chapters are like exhibits to support the executive summary.</span>

                    <span>NOTE: This review of  the Revised and Updated edition may also be featured in combination with other reviews of the earlier edition.
<br />
<br />This is a revised and updated edition of the highly-praised and award-winning bestseller which first appeared in October of 2003. Obviously, Silverstein and Fiske have since learned a great deal from responses to their analysis of "New Luxury": a rapidly developing socio-economic trend as America's middle-market consumers are trading up to "products and services which possess higher levels of quality, taste, and [key word] aspiration than [other] goods in the [same] category but are not so expensive as to be out of reach...[trading up to products and services which] sell at much higher prices than conventional goods and in much higher volumes than traditional luxury goods and, as a result, have soared into previously uncharted territory high above the familiar price-volume demand curve." 
<br />
<br />The significance of this paradigm shift continues to have profound implications for literally anyone who competes each day for consumers' attention, consideration, and (most important of all) business. Hence the importance of this revised and updated edition. For decision-makers in most local chambers which do not offer luxury products and services, the challenge is to convince prospects (e.g. for membership, sponsorships, and for placement of advertising) that the total value far exceeds the given cost. (I agree with Warren Buffett that cost is what is charged but value is what a buyer think it's worth.) For example, many people will join a local chamber to "trade up" IF they perceive that, by doing so, they will then have access to better as well as more extensive networks of business contacts. In this instance, prestige and luxury are synonymous.
<br />
<br />Think about it. How to explain the spectacular success of diverse companies such as Starbucks, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Lexus and BMW, Williams-Sonoma and Bed, Bath & Beyond, Restoration Hardware, Victoria's Secret, Prada, Coach, Panera Bread, and Callaway? Granted, most consumers cannot afford to purchase everything from companies such as these but an astonishing number of consumers are not only willing but eager to pay a premium for at least a few of the products offered. 
<br />
<br />Why? Silverstein and Fiske offer several reasons. New Luxury merchants never underestimate their customer; they shatter the price-volume demand curve; they create a ladder of genuine benefits (i.e. technical, functional, and emotional benefits); they escalate innovation, elevate quality, and deliver a flawless experience; they extend the price range and positioning of the brand; they customize the customer's value chain to deliver on the benefit ladder; they use influence marketing to "seed" success through brand apostles (i.e. "evangelism"); and finally, they continually attack the category like an outsider. What Silverstein and Fiske offer is this volume is a rigorous analysis of those companies which continue to be most successful in the New Luxury economy. They also explain in detail precisely HOW they achieve such success.

                    <span>Good case studies. Interesting if you haven't read other books on the sociology of shopping.  I think Twitchell's Living it Up: Our Love Affair With Luxury is a more thorough and engaging read that explores the same issues. I'll put it this way: I got both books from the library to read. The Twitchell book I decided to actually buy because I knew I would be re-reading it again and again over the years.</span>
