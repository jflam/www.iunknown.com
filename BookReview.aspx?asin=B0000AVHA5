                    <span>This is a tasteful videography of the New York Yankees history from 1903 - 2003. Is it complete? Not even close. But at five hours running time, it contains enough game footage and interviews to keep fans seriously entertained. My favorite part of the two-disc set is the collection of original televised footage and play-by-play. They really brought back some great memories. These include Chris Chambliss' 1976 pennant-winning homer, the pine-tar incident, Bobby Murcer's emotional game-winner on the day of Thurman Munson's funeral, Jim Leyritz' 3-run homer in the 1996 series, and pitching heroics by Larson, Righetti, Wells, and Cone. One gripe - some of the footage repeats itself on a bonus disc mini-documentary. I would have preferred less Bob Costas and David Halberstam and more magical moments, like the complete play-by-play of Bucky Dent's famous home run against the Bosox in 1978, or Reggie's 3-homer game in the 1977 World Series, or Ron Guidry's 18-strikeout performance. These were all covered in the documentary, but it would have been nice to have more of the original play-by-play.</span>

                    <span>To someone who grew up a Yankee fan in New York, it seems that the team somehow dates back to when the Dutch bought Manhattan from the Indians; that when the patriots and the Redcoats fought the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776, the Yankees and Dodgers were playing a World Series game in a field owned by a guy named Ebbitt, not far away. This DVD almost seems to prove that theory.<P>The story presented on this DVD is nothing really new; I was hoping for something a little different. And the fuzzy sepia tone old footage is as dated as the slurpy strings that accompany them. Still, there is a dignity about this film. For me, there is a sense of security and pride that can only come from Babe Ruth's roguish wink and Lou Gehrig's self-conscious smile. The statistics aren't as impressive as the anecdotes but the interviews are great fun. This is a terrific reminder of the great Yankee tradition and dynasty. And a great reminder that New York and the New York Yankees are inseparable.</span>

                    <span>I got this for Christmas and have watched it 3 times since! If you are a Yankees fan this is a must have DVD. It goes through each stage and era in detail with great interviews and highlights. The YES network always does a good job on Yankee documentaries. John Sterling is great as a host. If you enjoy sports history and what made things today posible then this is the greatest Yankees documentary for you. It truly shows the way things progressed and set up future yanks for their success in pinstripes! If you don't already have this you should get it!</span>

                    <span>a GREAT docoumentary. Tons of awesome footage, and interviews and reminiscences by the actual participants (Yankee and foe), allowing you to relive the greatest moments in Yankee (and by extension, baseball) history. I'm a huge Yankee fan, and while i thought i'd probably enjoy this anyway, i was amazed how into it I was. The next thing I knew, I had almost watched the whole thing straight thru, which would've been a feat: it has a generous running time - over 5 hours. This would make an ideal present for any Yankee fan who hasn't already seen this material on YES network. The only people who wouldn't enjoy this are Red Sox fans, as so many of the great moments in Yankee history came at Boston's expense.</span>
