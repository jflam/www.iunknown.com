                <span id="Label1">Despite popular belief, <i>anyone</i> can learn to program a computer. Computer programming doesn't require a high IQ and an innate proficiency in advanced mathematics. All that's required is a desire to learn and the patience to never give up.   <p>   If you've ever dreamed of writing your own programs, rest assured that you can. Programming can be a lot of fun, but it can also be frustrating, annoying, and time-consuming. And that's why you need <i>Beginning Programming For Dummies, 2nd Edition</i>&#160;&#8211;&#160;to help you discover how to program a computer with the minimum amount of inconvenience and the maximum amount of enjoyment.   <p>   Now, enjoyment can go only so far. In fact, not many people program just for the fun of it; usually, they want to create a program to do something unique to their lives, or perhaps they'd like to make a little cash on the side by selling their programs as shareware. If you've always wondered how you could do what so many others have done, all you have to do is plug into <i>Beginning Programming For Dummies, 2nd Edition,</i> to find out how. Here's just a sample of the topics you'll find covered:    <ul>    <li>Deciphering the mystery of the various programming languages    <li>Assembling and working with programming tools    <li>Getting inside a programming language: Liberty BASIC    <li>Programming basics: From variables, constants, and comments to strings, control statements, and loops    <li>Creating user interfaces for your programs    <li>Dealing with data structures    <li>Playing with object-oriented programming    <li>Debugging and optimizing your code    <li>Top Ten lists on the top programming careers and additional resources    </ul>   <p>   So no matter what operating system platform you use&#160;&#8211;&#160;whether it's Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Palm OS, or Pocket PC&#160;&#8211;&#160;<i>Beginning Programming For Dummies, 2nd Edition,</i> can walk you through the basics of programming and get you well on your way to becoming a programming wizard!</span>

                    <span>I have to agree with the prior reviewers exhaustion at the pedestrian political commentary included in the text. But unlike that prior reviewer, I will extol the value to be had here in this book. I approached as a tool to understand the basics of how the various parts of a program are constructed. The book focuses on Qbasic with passing references to C++ (my ultimate goal is to use C++) and Java. Since I plan to progress rapidly to this other language I did not run afoul of the errors reported by the other reviewers because I did not input them.<p>I feel that I have more than adequately met my goal of learning about the "nuts and bolts" of a computer program. There is adequate depth about functions, subroutines, variables and arrays to start you on your way. There are also many tips and danger areas highlighted for the budding programmer.<p>I don't feel that this book is lacking with regard to the structure of programming, and I will not rate this lower because of the coding errors others have reported, but I can not give this a higher ranking because of the inane attempts at humor. Mr. Wang, a comedian you are not, keep to your day job.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I quickly tired of the authors extreme left political statements. Programming and technology should be free from politics but WANG uses almost every opportunity in his code examples to make some comment against politicans, conservatives, lawyers, wealthy people etc. Perhaps this is why there are so many syntax errors in the sample code.  Keep your feelings and agenda to yourself.<p>Another thing that kind of got on my nerves is everytime a new concept is introduced, we scrap the previous code example and start over. I like books where we keep building on the same program, adding new buttons / menus and stuff. This way we dont start over every other page and we learn how different code and objects work together. <p>When I tried to use Libery Basic under XP and it didnt work, I downloaded the latest version from Liberty's website. While poking around in LB v4 I saw that they have some 6+ extensive tutorials included with the demo version. I almost feel like i could have gone through these LB tutorials and learned just as much and save the $25 I spent on this book. <p>This book is decent and I dont regret buying it but I can only give it 2 stars.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the book that I first learned computer programming off of.  I always wanted to know how people made games so I asked my mom, who works with computers.  She said people wrote software.  I said I wanted to learn how to write software and she took me to the book store and "Beginning Programming For Dummies" is what we bought.  This book laid down an excellent foundation for the skills I developed in the future.  Some people didn't like it, some did.  Every book is going to have some errors in it somewhere; humans aren't perfect.  The things I like about this book is that it stresses clean structure of code, something VERY important when it comes to programming.  It also stresses more on concepts rather than technical details with the programming language, which is more important.  Even though this book uses Liberty Basic, all of the concepts taught are useful with all other programming languages, even C, C++, and assembly.  You can't go wrong with this book.</span>

                    <span>I have purchased maybe half a dozen "Dummies" books and have been very happy with them.  This one I am not happy with.  Beware, the book says that the included CD is compatible with the XP operating system, but it is not.  I contacted the company about it and they suggested I download Liberty Basic from their website, for an extra $30.  No thanks.  That's one of the reasons I bought the book - for a working CD.  They ought to either adjust the disk so it is compatible, or not claim that it is.</span>

                    <span>I am a 53-year-old male with no previous experience of programming, and I found the book (the second edition based on the Liberty Basic language) to be worth every cent. It is a fantastic, clear, user-friendly, no-nonsense and humorous introduction to the subject and has really opened my eyes to the world of programming. The Liberty Basic language to which Wang introduces you is tops and really makes sense, compared to some other languages. Beware of a lot of errors, though. I suspect that the book was written or published with undue haste, and as a result some of the examples have not been tested and contain errors. But this can be forgiven, having regard to the overall quality. Since then I have gone on to studying Liberty Basic in more detail. I can heartily recommend both book and language.</span>
