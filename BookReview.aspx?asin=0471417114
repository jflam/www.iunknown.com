                <span id="Label1">Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) has proven to be wildly successful and is fast becoming the dominant technology for building server-side applications, including most Web applications. In this much-anticipated new edition, bestselling author Ed Roman teams up with noted software development experts Scott Ambler and Tyler Jewell to once again deliver the definitive guide to all things EJB. Geared toward Web site developers, enterprise application developers, and developers of software components for resale, this book has been updated to cover the latest features of version 2.0--including container services, transactions, design strategies, complex persistence, clustering, project management, and choosing an EJB server--as well as to add new, more advanced programming tips and techniques.</span>

                    <span>If you want to master EJB, then the Mastering Enterprise JavaBeans is the right book for you! It covers everything from basics of the EJB to the more advanced topics like transactions, performance and clustering. You will also learn how to choose the most suitable EJB server for your project.<P>Thanks to Ed Roman, et al for the most comprehensive book about EJB technology. I would strongly recommend this book to the community.<P>P.S. Don't forget to download the source code from TheServerSide.com and enjoy testing what you have learnt!</span>

                    <span>One thing is that you won't become a master of EJB after you read this book. But you won't become a master of anything just after reading a book. :-)<P>The book provides in-depth introduction on EJB and related topics, such as different types of enterprise beans (Session/Entity/MessageDrivenBean), how EJBObject (EJB container) interacts with the actual bean object (strategies of intercepting the request and delegation), CMP and BMP, etc. The author did excellent job on these topics.<P>The author also tries to cover some advanced topics and best practices, sadly, this is where the book lost its shine. Except chapter 10 about transaction is good, the rest of the chapters are either too basic (e.g. lazy loading, aggregation vs. composition, wrap entity beans with session beans etc.) or too shallow (e.g. clustering) to provide any practical values. Some chapters, in my opinion, even are unnecessary (e.g. chapter 15 "Starting Your EJB Project on the Right Foot" and chapter 16 "Choosing an EJB Server") They are more or less related to the develop process instead of EJB.<P>One particular pitfall is that bean inheritance topic is not touched at all. Though EJB specs does not specify on this area, any serious EJB projects would inevitably touch/involve it. At least, the author should shed some lights on the best practices related to this topic.<P>Overall, as an introductory level book, it serves its purpose.</span>

                    <span>This is definitely the best EJB book. I wish this were the only EJB book out there on the market so I could have avoid wasting time reading other EJB books before reading this one. For those who came from C background, you may find Ed Roman has the class of K&R and W. Richard Stevens (assume you have read <C Programming Language> (from K&R) and <Unix Network Programming> from Stevens), except the strong commercial flavor.<P>Although it is true that, as one of the review pointed out, some terminology is not used or explained accurately, they are not EJB specific terms but rather more general computer science terminology. So this is definitely a 5 star book of EJB, if not for overall computer science.<P>People may think this book does not provide deep enough view about Transaction. Actually, this book provides enough concise information about Transaction, as an EJB book. I had the experience of searching through pile of Oracle junks and did not find much helpful information that provided better or deeper view about Transaction than this book did.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for an EJB 2.0 book. I was planning to buy either this one or Enterprise JavaBeans, 3rd Edition. So, I went to bookstore and read this one. (Explanation is ok, but it didn't cover the very simple and basic things, e.g. for CMP 2.0 about primary key stuff...this book has just assumed you've known what is cmp primary key before you read this book... If I don't remember it wrong, it didn't even mention about the primary key has to be either Object or String... So, I guess if you are familiar with EJB 1.1, (like myself) you are gonna get confused... or may be just me.<BR>But I did find the appendix was useful. So, I rate it "OK" with three stars... I guess I'm just a tough rate-er, I've never rated a book with 5 stars. I'm going to buy the O'Reilly one, cuz I didn't find it in bookstore. I hope it will be a good book...)</span>
