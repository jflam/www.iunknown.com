                    <span>This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read.  Dray has done a magnificent job of exploring a very painful subject. Often times, while reading the book, I shook my head in disbelief, saying to myself: "This happened in America?"  Too often the incidents described in the book smack of something one would expect to find in the Middle Ages.<br>    Dray explains "what" happened.  But more important he explains "why" it happened. This book is a tremendous contribution to American history.  <br>   Lynching is a subject most people know very little about.  Dray raises the curtain and shows the world the shocking and <br>devastating legacy of lynching.  The impact was not just lost lives, but a message of fear and intimidation toward African-Americans.<br>     This book should be read by anyone interested in American history.  You will find yourself in disbelief that these incidents happened in the United States of America.  It's time to talk about slavery, lynching, Jim Crow, etc. How did this happen in the USA?  It's mind-boggling.</span>

                    <span>This book is easily the best book I have read so far this year.  Dray explains how otherwise model citizens could murder, in the most brutal manners imaginable, Black (usually) Americans for imagined to minor transgressions (True, doubtless some of the lynched were guilty of the crimes they were accused of....Readers will be tempted to justify mob justice this way.  Dray won't let you do this...the retribution is always excessive and driven by hate and fear, and completely devoid of anything resembling civilized justice).  Coming from the South, I have taken classes on lynching before, so the pages Dray dedicated to explaining the origins of lynching were not nearly as compelling as his historical and legal analyses.  Often one reads history books and still has trouble putting the events into context.  Not so with this book.  Dray captures the mood and hysteria of the times perfectly.  <p>Dray also does a wonderful job of showing that lynching was not merely an aberration of Southern justice inflicted on Black men.  Instead, lynching is described as a national sickness, with Black men, women, and children, White civil rights sympathizers, and Jewish people being the victims of the mob violence, both in the North and the South.  Dray shows how the international image of the United States was tarnished during a time when it was supposed to be the vangaurd of democracy, opposed to a German facism that was cruelly mimicked on its own soil.  He also pays tribute to the men and women of the NAACP and other like-minded organizations who had the gall to oppose mob murder.  The ultimate failure of any federal anti-lynching law is a startling example of how ingrained lynching was in the national (especially the Southern) psyche.  <p>This narration forced me to reexamine my own education about lynching.  Before college (I'm from Georgia), I had never heard of Leo Frank, the 1906 Atlanta race riots, or Sam Hose.  But I certainly had heard more than enough about the Salem witch trials.  For these reasons it is required reading for Americans in general, and especially Southerners.<p>(warning:  obviously, some of this book is difficult to read, as recountings of the lynchings are appropriately graphic and monstrous)</span>

                    <span>Philip Dray provides us with a vivid picture of a world that has been buried deep in society.  The racial hate, the accusations, the feeling that the taking of an African Americans' life could mean so little, and yet so acceptable for the Afro American to live with on a day to day basis that they could be lynched at any time for no good reason.<p>This unspeakable horror of lynching is clearly documented and will more than likely leave you searching, searching for reasons why this has happenned and what kind of world was this alien place that it would put such little value on the human life.<p>You will be on the internet for hours trying to find answers as to WHY or How could this happen.<p>Could Hate be that deep?  How could you sleep at night?  How did the victims family feel?  <p>This book is shocking, read it and weep.</span>

                    <span>AT THE HANDS OF PERSONS UNKNOWN will change your view of American history and race relations. <p>Mr. Dray's book is awesome. I have read more books on African-American history (Jim Crow, civil rights etc.) than I can count. Mr. Dray's book is simply the best.<p>Be prepared to be shocked and have your emotions touched. Mr. Dray describes the most horrible shameful acts in graphic details. He destroys the all the popular myths such as:lynchings were isolated acts by fringe elements such as the KKK, lynchings were the result of rapes or murders and that guilty "men" were simply "hanged".<p>The reality is much more gruesome, to the point that it makes one sick with shame. (Imagine the movie ROSEWOOD, intensified by 10X) Thousands of African-Americans (men, women and children) were tortured, mutilated, burned to death in the most sadistic ways a normal person in 2003 could not imagine. For many decades these lynchings did take place in the shadows by the KKK, but in picnic-like style in town squares in front of men, women and children!<p>Southern politians defended lynching as a way to "protect the southern way of life" against the "black brutes". AT THE HANDS OF PERSONS UNKNOWN leaves know doubt as to who the real brutes were. <p>Mr. Dray also includes the stories of many heroes such as Walter White, Ida B Wells and others who fought to expose lynching.<p>One closing comment- if you are a non-African-American, PLEASE read this book.</span>
