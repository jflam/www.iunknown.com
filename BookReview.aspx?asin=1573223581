                    <span>I thought I had read everything Suze had to say.  This book goes even deeper.  It's laid out in a concise Q&A format that helps you quickly find the answers you're looking for.  I've used this book as a tool while online picking my mutual funds.  This is one book I would purchase instead of check out at the library.  The information is everywhere.  Truly a book with having.  </span>

                    <span>At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only
<br />
<br />So is her book for entertainment only???????????
<br />
<br />I like Personal Finance for Dummies.
<br />Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes
<br />but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.

                    <span>The Road to Wealth by Suze Orman was extremely informational. Being 18 and very new to the world of finance I learned a lot from reading it. The way the book is set up in a question and answer format makes it easy to read on specific subjects. It would be a good idea to keep a copy in your house. That way you could read the different chapters as they apply to your life. I liked the section about paying for college best because I have to pay my own way through college, so it gave me some helpful tips. The Road to Wealth covers a wide variety of finance subjects all of which could be helpful at many different points in one's life. It covers everything from how to prepare yourself financially for when you retire to making out a will. I would recommend this book especially for people who haven't experienced much financially. It is a great way to learn about many different aspects of the financial world.</span>
