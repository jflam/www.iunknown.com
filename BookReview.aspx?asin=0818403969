                    <span>This is probably my favorite book on maneuvering in the stock market. If you read William O'neill's "How to make Money in Stocks", which is also excellent, you will find he uses and expands upon many of Darvas' principles. O'neill also lists it as one of his top ten must reads on the stock market. Darvas' rules for cutting losses have helped me to limit my losses from 2 to 5 percent on average. I have avoided some serious losses from time to time(some up to 75 percent) by using Darvas' principles and cutting my losses quickly and have avoided avery market downturn in the last two years. While everyone was in distress about the '98 bear market, I was comfortably on the sidelines with my funds in cash thanks to this wonderful book. If more stars were available to rate this book, I surely would have given them. By the way, they're out of print, but if you can get Darvas' other books, "Wall Street-The Other Las Vegas" and "You Can Still Make it the Market", these are other followups that are just as good as "How I Made $2,000,000" and will really drive the points of his methods home.</span>

                    <span>If one looks at the biggest winners of the past several decades, one finds that practically all show the same "chart behavior" that he writes about in his book. Learn from the past. A word of caution to value-oriented investors: This will probably be a waste of your time. But for the person who naturally gravitates to growth stocks, and who doesn't shy away from a stock due to its high valuation, this is second only to William J. O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks" as the best book written on how to use charts to limit risk, yet expose yourself to each year's big winners.</span>

                    <span>While I did not read or know about this book until after I tuned $10,775 into $42 million in the stock market in 23 months (see articles and audit at Chartpattern.com), I heard about the book from one of my first subscribers at Chartpattern.com who sent me the book around 2001. This book clearly defines a breakout strategy that is widely used and followed today by the best traders in the world, and still this breakout method is little understood by most readers as I can see by the critics here. It is this method and the method of "Canslim" by William O'Neil in his book "How to make Money in Stocks" that works so well when correctly applied by those willing to study long hours and apply this method. Applying this method and a little bit of PI in a strong Bull Market will yield fortunes beyond the reader's wildest dreams. This is a must read for any one with a yearning to become vastly wealthy and those who have the determination to put forth the effort to study and learn.</span>
