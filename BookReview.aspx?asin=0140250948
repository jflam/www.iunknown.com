                <span id="Label1">Tim O'Brien has been writing about Vietnam in one way or  another ever since he served there as an infantryman in the late 1960s. His earliest work  on the subject, <I>If I Die in a Combat Zone</I>, was an intensely personal memoir of his own tour of duty; his books since then have  featured many of the same elements of fear, boredom, and moral ambiguity but in a fictional setting. In 1994 O'Brien wrote <I>In the Lake of the  Woods</I>, a novel that, while imbued with the troubled spirit of Vietnam, takes  place entirely after the war and in the United States. The main character,  John Wade, is a man in crisis: after spending years building a successful political career, he finds his future derailed during a bid for the U.S. Senate by revelations about his past as a soldier in Vietnam. The  election lost by a landslide, John and his wife, Kathy, retreat to a small cabin  on the shores of a Minnesota lake--from which Kathy mysteriously  disappears. <p> Was she murdered? Did she run away? Instead of answering these  questions, O'Brien raises even more as he slowly reveals past lives and  long-hidden secrets. Included in this third-person narrative are "interviews" with the couple's friends and family as well as footnoted excerpts from a mix  of fictionalized newspaper reports on the case and real reports pertaining  to historical events--a m&eacute;lange that lends the novel an eerie sense of verisimilitude. If Kathy's disappearance is at the heart of this work, then John's involvement in a My Lai-type massacre in Vietnam is its  core, and O'Brien uses it to demonstrate how wars don't necessarily end when governments say they do. <I>In the Lake of the Woods</I> may not  <I>be</I> true, but it <I>feels</I> true--and for Tim O'Brien, that's true enough. <I>--Alix Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>There are a number of things I loved about this novel.  I liked the format of the book with alternating chapters of story, evidence, and hypothesis.  I also enjoy a book that does not give a clear ending, but leaves it to the reader to fill in the blanks.  In "In the Lake of the Woods", "O'Brien revisits the familiar theme of Vietnam using it as a metaphor for politics.  Both of these themes took an evident toll on the lives on the main character, John Wade and his wife.
<br />
<br />When the wife of Minnesota Senatorial race looser John Wade disappears, the world turned their attention toward the former candidate.  Tortured by his memories of Vietnam, it seems possible that Wade disposed of his wife.  The evidence presented throughout the book adds to that suggestion.  In reality, there is so much more to the picture.  Unlike the searchers, Wade holds a keen sense that his wife is alive and well among the lakes. When Wade himself disappears at the end of the book, we are left to wonder whether he found his wife or suffered a misfortunate event as was suspected of his wife.
<br />
<br />O'Brien's storytelling is impressive throughout this book as he walks the line of evidence for and against Wade causing his wife's disappearance.  It is a compelling read for anybody who has dreamed of running away and starting over. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I wouldn't hesitate to put this book in O'Brien's top 3, along with The Things they Carried and Going After Cacciato. The story revolves around Minnesota Lieutenant Governor and Senate Candidate John Wade, who loses a brutal race in which it is divulged that he participated in the infamous My Lai massacre 30 years earlier. His political career over and future stalled, he decides to spend a little time with his wife in a small lodge in the wilderness. Before long, she goes missing, and a cloud of suspicion descends over him.
<br />
<br />Everything to like about O'Brien is here: his mastery of language and knowledge of humanity. Here, he looks at how secrets can affect us and how devastating denial can be. We all have loose threads in the tapestry of our lives, but if we ignore them, the entire thing can unravel. Plus, this functions as a closer look at the kinds of people you find in government: hopelessly insecure, traumatized, power-hungry. This is not to say that Wade was a bad man, but he did have problems.
<br />
<br />As for Wade himself, I found him pitiable. He certainly was not an angel--he spied on his wife, lied to her, lied to everyone, and hurt a lot of people. He didn't want to get into politics to help people, but rather to indulge his own tastes. However, the humiliation heaped upon him is more than anyone should have to bear. I am of the opinion that Wade did not have anything to do with the disappearance, although it is a trick worthy of his magician self--make the lady disappear.
<br />
<br />Overall, I found the book very enlightening and enjoyable, far better than The Nuclear Age, the last O'Brien book I read. This marks a return to form for the incomparable Tim O'Brien. </span>

                    <span>I don't read novels about war.  If I am attracted to a book by an interesting cover design and I see the words, "Vietnam War," anywhere on the back cover, I immediately put it down.  I found this book at a Goodwill and, despite its subject matter, was intrigued by the plethora of glowing reviews.  I am thrilled that I ignored my initial instincts and would gladly read any book written by Tim O'Brien, no matter the topic.  
<br />
<br />From the opening lines, Mr. O'Brien creates an atmosphere of foreboding, of impending horror. His language is spare, yet remarkably poetic.  The story of a popular politician who has lost a big election due to the revelation of his involvement in the My Lai massacre plays out slowly, like a mystery.  His almost complete denial of his role in the horror illustrates the utter mutability of truth in memory.  How we can choose to revise history - our own personal history or the history of a nation.  Like the boyhood magician seeking his father's approval, he cultivates a talent for making things conveniently disappear.  Even his disillusioned wife -who has either been murdered or, if one chooses to believe the alternative version of her final hours that is presented, has merely drifted away, despairing, into the ether.  
<br />
<br />This book is, at once, disturbing, heartfelt, beautifully written and deeply moving.  Truly rates a full five stars.</span>

                    <span>        Where is she? What is his state of mind? Has he gone crazy? Would he really do it? Is she dead or alive...these are questions that go through your mind when reading this novel written by Tim O'Brien. 
<br />	On a lake deep in the woods, John and Kathy Wade are trying to rekindle their marriage.  After a downfall election that John had lost for U.S. Senate, John's life has not been the best. Kathy suffers with him. She always tries to alleviate him or to make him feel confident about himself. He just seems to ignore her. When going more into the story, you find out there is something horribly wrong between them. One night, John got up, somewhat in a sleepwalk, and does various things...he says "Kill Jesus" and he boils water and scorches plants with the water and gets back in his bed, like if nothing happened.
<br />	The next morning, he gets up and finds Kathy to be gone, thinking that she has gone for a walk, and he ignores the fact for a few hours. After hours, he gets worried and starts looking for her, not finding her, he goes to his boarders and reports her missing. They find out that the boat is gone. Questions start to arise... did she drown? Is she lost? A massive search starts for Kathy and possibilities get higher and higher. Throughout the book, the reader uncovers many things about John Wade's past. We progressively see that the life of John Wade, " The Sorcerer", has many secrets, and that he is lost inside his own magic.
<br />	This book is very suspenseful and it just makes you want to read it more and more. This book has various chapters called Evidence and Hypothesis, which makes this book very unique, compared to other books. Evidence is various chapters which have interviews, articles, and items explained. They go deep into John's life and his past. They talk about how he got into politics, his childhood, his father, and how he met and fell in love with Kathy. Hypothesis is various chapters that go into what could have happened to Kathy. They bring out the different situations that she could be in, why she could have left, and her memories involving John.
<br />	I recommend this book to anyone! This is a great book for a mystery lover or someone who likes suspense. Tim O'Brien is a great writer and I would also like to recommend "The Things They Carried" by him. </span>
