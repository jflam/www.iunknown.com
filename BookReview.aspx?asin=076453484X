                    <span>I loved Dave Taylor's book, "Creating COOL Html 4 Web Pages"!<P>I had absolutely no clue about making web pages but looking at different types inspired me to start making a website. Page builders were just not my style, so I went and ordered Dave's book. It was incredible! <P>Books with nothing confusing in it just like this one really impress me. I started reading a couple pages and was already hooked into it! I was creating web pages in no time, this book inspired me to try out new things with web pages. In my opinion, this book taught me all HTML in a nutshell.</span>

                    <span>In this volume, HTML is taught from scratch in an easy to understand way, to give anyone with a keen interest in learning the building blocks that create web pages, the ability to quickly master the techniques. Ample screen shots describing the use of each HTML tag and what the end result should look like when the page is viewed in a browser are printed throughout the book. It is attractively written with each procedure broken down into stages and grouped with other related codes, forming a structured sequence that won't overwhelm you with too much information at once, but will safely take you from the basic stage to an advanced level. A summary of all the HTML tags used in the book is located near the back as a quick reference guide.<P>This training guide covers many areas such as text styles, creating forms, tables, frames, links and java script, in addition to a list of sites for hosting your completed page. Other enhancing features that will attract visitors to your site include the use of animated gifs, active X control, audio and video.<P>The CD that accompanies the book contains many useful utilities for the PC and Mac like Paint Shop Pro for example, which will come in handy in making the final production aesthetically pleasing to everyone.</span>

                    <span>I just finished working through this book, which took me from no knowledge to effecient web site building in no time. Do not think publishing in 2000 dates this book as old for learning HTML: the topics covered were advanced and forward thinking enough that they are still not completely supported by all browsers. It is an excellent leap into web site design.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book and used it to set up my redesigned web site pages. Dave talks to you, not at you, and I found his informal and down-to-earth approach helpful in understanding a complex subject. Now I can graduate to the next level, and start adding things to my pages, like IFRAMES, Navbars (instead of buttons) using javascript, etc. etc. The possibilities are endless!</span>

                    <span>I have been making websites for many years and I always end up looking up HTML code I forgot. I decided to get a book on it for quick reference. This book not only served as a quick reference it taught me some new pointers as well. I got my book used for $7.00 and it was the best seven dollars I have ever spent.</span>
