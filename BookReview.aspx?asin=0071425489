                    <span>With a title like "make a fortune....." I expected the book to be written by a guy who says "hey, I have been doing this for years, this is my primary income, I am a power seller, and here are some things that are helpful."
<br /> 
<br /> The book started out as "i don't want to waste my time or yours..." but that is exactly what he did. It was the most drwan out book on eBay ever. It was gearded towards people that :
<br /> 1. Have never seen a computer
<br /> 2. have never turned on a comupter
<br /> 3. Have no clue what an auction is
<br /> 4. Can't read a computer screen.
<br /> 5. Can't navigate websites logically.
<br /> 6. Don't have a clue on the very basic tools needed to operate a business or a P&L report.
<br /> 
<br /> I gave it two stars becuse there were a COUPLE of things that some poeple might find helpful, and it has an extensive index for a quick reference. 
<br /> 
<br /> A COUPLE of the "tips" were mildly helpful.
<br /> 
<br /> I have only bought and sold about 10 things on eBay, so i am no expert on it, but 99% of the things in this book can be firgured out by any monkey with a 90 I.Q.
<br /> 
<br /> When I read an Ebay book, Here is what I want to read:
<br /> 
<br /> 1. I want an author that has sold extensively on Ebay and makes a living at it.
<br /> 2. Several Biographies of other people and the products they sell and why. not just "hey rare and antique items sell well!"...we know that already.
<br /> 3. common mistakes that people make in key words and what key words are statistically more prone to "hits".
<br /> 4. information on drop-shipping. is it realistic, who does it?
<br /> 5. Real-life examples of things that consistently sell (new and used)and why.
<br /> 7. The biggest mistakes that rookies make.
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> I will sum up this book
<br /> 
<br /> 1. Experiment with key words
<br /> 2. research what sells online
<br /> 3. try to price it right
<br /> 4. take care of your customers
<br /> 5. If you want to make money..be serious about it.
<br /> 
<br /> DUH!

<br /> i found better material free online.</span>

                    <span> I read this book cover to cover in 3 days. I picked it up and could not put it down.It takes you through the ins and outs of a very complex website.  
 We are going to start selling Jewelry and Gems on the web site. When we tried yo make our way through the site by ourselves before we read the book we were lost and did not know what to do to present our goods in the best way possible to increase our chances of selling them for a fair price.  
 The book will take you through the sign up process to how many pixels you need for the best pictures for the site. I highly recommend it. You will not regret buyig this book if you are serious about multiple items on e-bay. 
 We also bought The Dummies Book for E-bay. While I read one book my husband read the other. After we finished the book we were reading we switched and read each others book. By doing this the two books support each other and we feel very well prepared to start showing our items on e-bay.</span>

                    <span>I have read several books on "ebaying" and this is my hands down favorite ... From start to finish, the author tells you everything you need to know about ebaying in a clear, straightforward way ... no wasted pages on the history and philosophy of ebaying ... just informed and solid information and advice.  For those of us whose lives are jam-packed with demands and responsibilities, this book doesn't waste our time ... it just gets right down to it and tells you what you need to know and what you need to do. It also tells you what things are a waste of time!  If you're an ebayer [or want to be!], it's a steady reference to keep by your computer!!</span>
