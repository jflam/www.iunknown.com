                    <span>This book is definately for the novice crowd.  I was expecting some more advanced concepts or examples, but found very basic info.  I didn't learn a single new thing about .NET by using this book, and especially when you compare it to other books.
<br />
<br />The book really just goes into some basic examples in each chapter followed by some code to go with it, but there are no real tips or tricks of value.  Everything in here is a rehash of what's on MSDN, the web or in other books.

                    <span>I liked the book for the format but my copy is missing many pages!  It jumps from page 190 directly to page 239! No they were not taken out of the book, the book binding is perfect - no tears, no rips - just missing!  I'm returning it and looking elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>If you've been seriously programming for a while in ASP.NET, don't waste your time with this book. Having spent a lot of time searching and reading on msdn.microsoft.com and other sites to enhance my skill set, I bought this book thinking I would find some advanced concepts that I haven't already picked up on my own. There are no advanced concepts, just a bunch of very simple examples, some of which do not even work. I was very disappointed with this book and sent it back the same day it arrived.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great reference for doing various tasks in ASP.NET. It however is not written from a perspective of using Visual Studio .NET for Development, so some of the code is not needed if using VS IDE, but for someone who programs in ASP.NET all examples are completely understandable!</span>
