                <span id="Label1">Based on American rather than British English, this is among the first Russian dictionaries revised for the post-Soviet era. Includes new political terminology, new Russian institutions, new countries and republics and new city names. Contains 26,000 entries in the English-Russian section and 40,000 words in the Russian-English section. Irregularities in Russian declensions and conjugations appear at the beginning of each entry.</span>

                    <span>An indispensable resource for Russian language learners. Highly useful and detailed grammatical information, extensive vocabulary and accompanying-necessary-information on usage as well as irregularities in form or usage (declensions or conjugations). Having compared many Russian and English dictionaries this is by far the most comprehensive resource you can get in a user-friendly and compact format at a reasonable price. This is one of the best foreign language dictionaries I have used in my extensive foreign language studies. The dictionary is touted as a first of its kind geared to American English rather than British. I don't know how true this is, but as an American, I know it was useful to me either way. This book eased my days as a student considerably... I loved my old one so much I passed it on to a friend and got a new one last time I was in the States.</span>

                    <span>As an ESL instructor, I find it important for my students to learn to use a dictionary. I have always recommended the Random House R-E/E-R Dictionary because of its price....it was a good deal. The Katzner dictionary is much better however, and Amazon's price is exceptional. The dictionary has easy to read references starting from either language ... which my Russian speaking students find indispensible. Non-Russian speakers, like myself, can even use the English section to look up Russian words. </span>

                    <span>This is the dictionary the US military issued to its Russian language-studying soldiers at DLI in Monterey. It has excellent coverage of most basic and general vocabularies, and goes into depth on many other subjects (including military jargon). It is far easier to use than the Oxford Dictionary, as it lists each verb (glogol) with the prefix and/or suffix as an individual entry. Words are extremely easy to find here--unlike in many dictionaries of this type. Of course, there are some very specific Russian-English dictionaries out there that specialize in specific categories of the language. (Such as dictionaries of slang, or of obscenities) If you're a a generalist OR specialist who doesn't have a copy of this book, it is recommended. My copy is dog-eared and I did have to tape the cover (the paperback), due to frequent use.<BR> Many of my Russian friends have used it to find the "right" word in English, and it has proven to be an exceptional resource in both directions. A must have for any student of Russian.</span>

                    <span>This is a marvelous dictionary!!!! I teach Russian to High School graduates and I have investigated many different dictionaries to find the best. Kenneth Katzner's dictionary is head and shoulders above any other dictionary I have seen. The entries are not as vast as, say, the Oxford Russian-English, but it is very user-friendly and the author does a very good job of making exceptions and irregularities very clear. He also makes particular effort to differentiate between homonyms (something that other dictionaries frequently lack). The binding is a little fragile and requires some TLC (especially at first. I recommend storing the dictionary open on a table when not in use to train the binding to stay open. Never push hard to keep it open to the page you need; it can break).<P>Another review complains that this dictionary lacks a pronunciation guide. He clearly has not understood that Russian pronunciation is absolutely consistent almost without exception. The alphabet is phonetic and there are no pronunciation dilemmas as in English, e.g. though, through, rough. The student is much better off learning the rules and not relying on any extraneous pronunciation guide.<P>This is not a good translator's dictionary because it is incomplete. But for the student, even into the fifth or sixth year, this dictionary is not only a reference, but an outstanding learning tool. I recommend it to any student of Russian. You won't find better!</span>

                    <span>This dictionary is very comprehensive but it has no guide whatsoever to pronunciation. It utilizes the IPA after each English entry without any explanation of the IPA symbols and their sounds. There is nothing at all on the Russian side. This may be a great dictionary for those who already speak Russian but it is unhelpful for those of us just starting out. I was very disappointed with it and am now back to using my Collins Gem Russian dictionary which has little vocab but a pronunciation guide at least.</span>
