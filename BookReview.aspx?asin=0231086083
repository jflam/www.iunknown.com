                    <span>Mo Tzu was a really extraordinary fellow.  He was deeply concered with human welfare, and preached a doctrine of universal love.  Mo Tzu wwas the kind of guy who would really be against anything that wasted resources that would be better used to meet people's needs.  For instance, he would have hated the expensive and elaborate George W. Bush inaguration ceremnoy, and would have probably said that the money should have instead been used to support people affected by the tsunami.  
<br />
<br />In the Mo Tzu, we read of Mo Tzu's ideas on universal love, and his attack on things like elaborate burial ceremonies.
<br />
<br />It is intersting to note how Mo Tzu's philosophy was increidbly popular in Acinet China for a while, and along with Concfucianims formed the two "orthodox" schools of philosophy.  (Taoism was really in a category of its own).
<br />
<br />Burton Watson is an outstanding translator.  However, my qualm with his translation is that it is by no means the complete text--which is really dispaointing.  
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I still recomend thius book. </span>

                    <span>In fact, according to the translator's notes, the voice is so distinct from other Chinese tradition that some claimed Mo Tzu was not Chinese at all.
<br />
<br />Mo Tzu's philosophy was based on universal love, treating everyone with the respect due to one's family. In Confucian China, this was a radical and subversive notion. It undermined the traditional notions of filial piety, even social hierarchy, since it eliminated the special status of one's own parents in the web of personal relationships. 
<br />
<br />He compounded the breach of filial piety by insisting on small, inexpensive funerals and brief mourning periods, also in the name of universal love. Mo Tzu believed completely in the spirits of the dead and in honoring them properly. He believed even more strongly in supporting "the people," usually meaning the farming classes. Confucian funeral garb, coffins, and rituals inflicted staggering costs, and harsh mourning practices literally endangered the mourner's health. Mo's utilitarian philosophy required that wealth be used to meet the needs of the living, since the dead could not use it. Utilitarianism also argued that mourners should return to normal, productive life as soon as possible, without risking the strength needed for their livelihood.
<br />
<br />Most surprisingly, Mo Tzu's universal love justified the militia composed of his followers. Mo Tzu held that the small and weak were of equal standing with the large and strong, and that bullying (or invading) of the weak was unjust. He backed his notion of justice with arms, coming to the defense to small states when unjustly attacked by the larger.
<br />
<br />Historically, Mo taught after Confucius (who is treated to special excoration in Mo's text) but before Mencius (who in turn attacks Mo). Mo appears to have been well known down to the current time, even if his actual influence on Chinese history was minor. I wonder, though - his drab utilitarian outlook may eventually have been informed Maoist policy.
<br />
<br />This is a brief and enjoyable addition to any set of Eastern classics. It's divergence from the main stream of Chinese philospohical history makes it especially interesting, since it provides contrast to the better-known thinkers. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps Mo Tzu isn't for every reader, but the serious student is sure to enjoy it.

<br />PS: This appears to be the same material as Watson's "Mozi" (ISBN 0231130015). The only difference seems to be the romanization, the convention for English spellings, used in the two books.
