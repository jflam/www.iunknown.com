                    <span>This book was really good. I read it in about 2 days. There is nothing but drama and I like that in a good read. I would recommend this book and I am waiting for Never Say Never to come out.</span>

                    <span>Mike, super cop/smooth operator married his high school sweetheart Mya. Mike is what he is "A DOG!" Mya knew exactly which breed she was getting! Yet she was determined that she was the one who would change him! Arrogance/Ignorance what a blissful marriage! Mike's arrogance about "his abilities" seem to cause frenzy for Mya. Mike is busy out serving and protecting all the pus out in the streets. History has proven that Mya won't leave! Instead of dialing 9-1-1 the damsel uses smoke signals to get out her distress call. Now the question is whose been sleeping with who? Is there hope when Mya turns the tables? 
<br />
<br />Max, producer on the rise/family man married well! An overachiever for a wife. Max, has a great life, a great wife who believes in his visions, and doesn't mind that she has the J-O-B! He's a bad boy, just how Trina likes, and he's domesticated. Sure he may not be the affectionate guy he once was, but he's all I need! Max seems to be lost by GP! And of all the people to be mixing with it had to be the one person Trina hates! If he could concentrate on getting his acts signed then he wouldn't have time to dedicate to Sharon! Unworthy/Miss Prissy what a blissful marriage! In order to get to the good part, you seem to have to travel on rocky roads. Once all of the secrets, and hurt are revealed can this duo rekindle what they had?
<br />
<br />Ahmad, teacher/committed man with a beautiful little baby girl. Ahmad treasure the women in his life! Yet Shay doesn't seem to share his same "LOVE" as of lately. Shay is in a battle with herself and the last thing she wants to do is push her good man off. BUT she's not ready to share, and Ahmad is tired of suffering! Stingy/Selfish what a blissful marriage! Preaching about the power of commitments and Ahmad finds that being a friend these days maybe hazardous to his way of life! Shay's fluency in the differences between women and girls seem to clear some of the obstruction in their marriage. Will that help or hinder things? 
<br />
<br />How much disloyalty, covetousness, and fabrications can these relationships/friendships take?
<br />
<br />Dwayne, which guy are you?  Inquiring minds want to know.  I think it's a good story, but it seemed to drag on too long in certain areas.  Yes I see why you and LaJill call yourselves TWINS!    </span>

                    <span>Ok this book was off the hook! Took me about three days to read. The character Mike was just a dirty dog! Instead of being a police officer he should have been the k-9 on the police force. I don't understand why his wife Mya did not leave him long time ago before she caught some deadly disease! He got what he deserved! Every dog has its day! Then there was Max he was married to a woman who accepted him for what he was absolutely nothing! This man was sleeping with his mother-in-law! It does not get any dirtier than that. If it was my book it would not be much to say about this Max character because he and my mother would have had a double funeral in the second chapter. Then there was Ahmed a good man gone badly by the power of an evil woman (MYA). Ok it wasn't all her fought but Mya where was the sisterhood at how could you do Shay (Ahmed wife) like that! You want to mess up another halfway happy home because yours is not right. It figures! Shay how could you cause so much confusion in your marriage because of your insecurities! You almost lost a good man. He is your husband for better or worst this character should have got over I am not having sex with my husband because I am fat attitude! If I was Ahmed I would have tried to divorce her. With holding sex for six months is against the law in my book! Then there is Trina (Max's wife) I have one question for this character what woman in her right mind would accept her husband back after sleeping with her mother? A desperate one maybe?????? Like I said Sharon (Trina's mom) & Max either a double funeral or buried in a position they were familiar with on top of each other!
<br />
<br />Overall this book was a nice read but I really think that this author kind of draged it on for a while with unnecessary chapters. To much beating around the bush. Get straight to the dirt.

                    <span>...then you will absolutely LOVE this book! There was so much drama I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days.
<br />The storyline is ala Carl Weber's "Married Men" and revolves around Mike, Max and Ahmad. Mike being the married player, Max sexin' his ghetto-fabulous mother-in-law and Ahmad can't seem to get some lovin' from his wife.
<br />Their drama filled story intertwines each relationship.
<br />Kudos to Dwayne Joseph on a great tale set in the suburbs or Maryland!!!</span>
