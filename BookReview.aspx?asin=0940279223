                    <span>This book is a classic. I can not believe that there are not more reviews giving this book the priase it deserves. If you want to become better at basketball you must not only practice consistantly, but you must know the  correct techniques and moves to practice. This book is basically a complete  reference of drills for every position that have been used at the nations  premire basketball camp - five star. When Trajon Langdon started out as a  freshman at duke this book recieved a lot of attention because Trajon,  being from Alaska, did not have great exposure to a wide variety of  basketball camps. Trajon bought this book and used the drills in it to make  him the player he became. Every highschool player and coach should own a  copy of this book if they are serious about improvement.</span>

                    <span>I used this book, after being placed on the J.V. team at my high School my junior year.  I had very little skill at all, but wanted desperately to become a better ball player.  After purchasing this book, I used the drills in it for only 2 months and improved my game to a whole new level.  I not only made the varsity team that next year, but was a starter and had a very good senior year.  Since graduating, I have coached at the high school level, and this book worked wonders for the team.  I have also used this book to work with younger individuals, and seen drastic improvement in their abilities.  I would recommend this book to any young person who wants to better his/her skills, and to any coach to strengthen their teams fundamental abilities</span>
