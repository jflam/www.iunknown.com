                <span id="Label1"><p>Although Java is incredibly popular, the standard edition of Java is way too big and bulky to build applications for wireless devices such as PDAs and phones. Thus, Sun has released Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME). J2ME has the potential to be as revolutionary in the wireless space as Java has been in the server space.</p>  <p><i>Wireless Java: Developing with J2ME, Second Edition</i> is updated to include coverage of the next version of programs for mobile Java devices. MIDP 2.0 contains many exciting new features, such as sound HTTPS support, lots of user interface API enhancements, a Game API, and much more. Also, author Jonathan Knudsen makes clear what material is new so readers can still use the book for MIDP 1.0/CLDC 1.0.</p></span>

                    <span>Like many programming authors with not much to say, Knudsen pads his book with entire programs.  Better books elide out all but the relevant fragments, but poor books include the whole program to flesh out their page count.  This is really a 100-page book in disguise.
<br />
<br />To give you an idea of what level the author is targetting, on page 155 he helpfully explains, "You are probably familiar with the try-catch blocks...  The finally clause is not as well known, but it is very useful."
<br />
<br />If you already know what a finally clause is, you probably won't be well-served by this book.  If you don't, then please buy my copy: I won't be needing it.</span>

                    <span>I am commenting on the First Edition of this book.<p>I own two books on introductory J2ME development in a CLDC/MIDP environment:  this is the better of the two.  Mr. Knudsen writes well (no silly jokes or other distracting nonsense), and covers the core material one needs to begin programming MIDlets.<p>Chapter 12 in the first edition is extremely useful, wherein the practical use of message digests on the client side are illustrated.<p>All in all, a good book for the bookshelf, and one I recommend to friends interested in J2ME CLDC/MIDP programming.</span>

                    <span>This book is really, really daft, because to date there is only a minute number of mobile phones available on the planet which implement MIDP 2.0. You can't imagine how painful that is, because chances are you won't be able to run Knudsen's code on your device. Not only that, you won't even be able to compile it with your version 1 tools. It's a shame really, it's otherwise a good intro to J2ME with plenty of code and an appendix which serves as a reference. Pity that we'll all have to wait at least for another year to use this book while the mobile device manufacturers get up to speed. I for one am a bitterly disappointed programmer, I can tell you that, and wish I hadn't spend my last bucks on this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is a pleasure to read. The style is concise but clear,<br>the code clean and simple, and compile and works perfectly.<br>Besides you will have clear, detailed explanation (not only directives or instructions)  on how to compile and run it.<br>As and added bonus, the books uses mainly Ant for building the examples so you can integrated this new knowledge nicely using the tools you should be using for your usual development projects in Java. I give it only 4 stars because the book title should be INTRO to J2ME development as the coverage is broad (forms, networking, persistent storage, evena  nice chapter on games!) but not terribly deep in any area. But if you are new to J2ME and hate wading through the docs buy this book and you will not regret it!<br>The price is reasonable, too.</span>
