                <span id="Label1">For the several million developers using "traditional" Visual Basic 6, <I>Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Step by Step</I> will put the new VB .NET within reach with a very approachable tour of the new version's features used to build traditional client-side software. If you've been put off by the newfangled books on .NET that spin the new VB as Internet-focused and unrelated to your existing expertise, this title shows you how to leverage your knowledge to get going with Microsoft's newest platform.<p>The salient feature of this text is the author's patient presentation style, which stresses "traditional" VB programming. (While VB 6 did technically support Web programming, the unarguable reality is that most developers have built form-based programs for years.) This volume shows you how to use the same techniques for the new VB .NET. The author begins his presentation here with a clever slot-machine application to get you started. Other early sections cover the basics of VB .NET from a language perspective, including basics like variables, data types, and flow control statements. This handsomely printed volume makes use of two-toned color (in blue) to highlight differences between VB 6 in VB .NET, making it an invaluable resource for programmers making this transition.<p>Other essential technologies get their due here as well, from basic control programming with Windows Forms, integrating with ActiveX controls, to a very approachable guide to the new ADO.NET APIs for databases. Coverage of how to bind data to a variety of controls, plus using the new VB .NET <I>DataGrid</I> control, will show you how to do all you did in VB 6 in the new .NET. Instead of getting bogged down in details, the author does a good job of presenting what working programmers need to know. Later chapters delve into .NET APIs for working with files, strings, and collections. This title doesn't pretend to cover ASP.NET in any detail, though there is a useful introduction to the subject, as well as how to use the Microsoft Internet Explorer Object to build VB applications that display HTML and other Internet content.<p>The reality is that most VB 6 programmers will have to learn a lot when it comes to .NET. Before launching into a whole new paradigm of Web development, this book shows that today's VB has a lot to do with the older VB 6 standard. This text will be nearly indispensable for any VB 6 programmers making the leap to .NET. It even suggests that rumors of the death of the traditional client-side VB application may be somewhat exaggerated. This title shows you that the new easier deployment and productivity features of VB .NET may extend the life of such applications in one of the best-available tutorials for learning VB .NET, bar none. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Although for the average novice this book seems like a good one. It is not. It is just encouraging the programming perception of the novice programmer.
<br />It doesn't go into detail of real .NET programming and is really focused on showing off simple things that any novice could have worked out in a few hours.
<br />Visual Basic 6 programmers shouldn't read this book it will make you think VB.NET is the same thing. But in fact it is nothing like VB 6. The author decides to not discuss the what the importance of object oriented programming is.
<br />He also decides to hide some of the most important information of the .NET framework and the Visual Basic.NET language from the novice who wouldn't know anything about .NET or Visual Basic.NET. Nearly everything in this book could be accomplished in Visual Basic 4-6. And everything within it is very easy to learn and the novice programmer would feel like he is repeating himself.
<br />And for all the people who are saying that this is a good book. You are wrong. This book has got nothing to do with .NET! If you expect to be a proffessional after learning this book you are gonna have one bad career if you don't pickup now and get the basics of Object Oriented Programming and the .NET framework into your head. If you look up on any proper coding site you will know that the code in this book is nothing like real life code for real life situations and I can't believe Microsoft published this.
<br />That review comes from 13 year old as well! And believe me I know a some real life developers who have to employ people and have to be irratated by this kind of stuff each and every day.
<br />It's code that teaches people how to not get a job. Or how to make your open source programs not be downloaded.</span>

                    <span>This book is listed first when you search for it, but it is an old issue and out of print. Amazon wants 2 weeks to find this old edition for you. Look for a later edition of the same book further down the list. It usually ships in 1 day.

                    <span>Finally I found a book where they not only lead you through the code but actually explain what the code is doing.  Definitely a beginner book, but thats exactly what I needed since I have no VB background.  This book gives you the option to type in all the code yourself, or the finished programs are all included on the CD.  Thanks for making it possible for me to understand the subject.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for the novice developer. It's more a beginners VB guide than a .NET tutorial. I am taking a.NET class and this is the required book. I was hoping for more. Not enough discussion about .NET. A better book would have been VB .NET The Tutorials by Karl Moore which I have also. The ultimate .NET book in my opinion is Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .NET (Core Reference) by Franseco Balena.</span>
