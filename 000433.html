<h3 class="title">Chase the Swan</h3>

<p>While teaching my <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> class in Little Rock, <span class="caps">AR I</span> had an opportunity to make the acquaintance of a swan named Chase. He was one mean swan! He was named Chase by the locals because that was his favorite activity: chasing people away from "his" pond. </p>

<p>The first two shots shown below were shot from a bridge at the far end of the pond. I decided to go to the bridge because I figured that it would be hard for him the "get me" if I was standing on the bridge looking down at him. Sure enough, as I walked around the pond he followed me. You could see him pick up the pace as he saw me approach his pond. </p>

<p>Once I got to the bridge, he took up position under the bridge to make sure that I couldn't get away. This gave me all the time in the world to shoot some photos of him. To get the exposure I wanted, I metered off the swan using my spot meter. I applied +1EV to the meter reading and shot. When I checked my exposure using the histogram, it looked like I nailed it, so I shot the rest of my pictures of him using that setting. Here are my favorite shots of him:</p>

<p><img src="Images/Chase-Close-Up-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="Images/Chase-Close-Up-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="Images/Chase-Close-Up-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>These were all shot as <span class="caps">NEF</span> shots, and I applied a further +0.3EV correction when I imported the images into Photoshop <span class="caps">CS. </span>The only adjustments that I had to make in Photoshop was a bit of unsharp mask since the images were already tack-sharp out of the camera.</p>

<p>This final shot happened when I walked back around to the other side of the pond. I crouched on the grass and Chase (and Lily - his girlfriend) decided to come out of the water to kick my ass. This picture was the last one in a sequence that I shot using the <span class="caps">JPG</span> burst mode in my camera. He was about 3 feet away when I decided to turn and run :) </p>

<p><img src="Images/Do-Not-Feed-The-Swans.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I didn't get a chance to spot meter in this case, so I shot using the matrix metering mode of the camera. I had to do a lot more post processing to get this shot the way I wanted: some shadows and highlights in <span class="caps">PS,</span> some levels adjustment, and some unsharp mask. I'm not sure whether it is better to shoot using the AF-S (single shot autofocus) vs. the AF-C (continuous autofocus) mode during a burst sequence. I have to admit that I didn't know how to turn on AF-C when I shot that photo :)</p>

<p>Funny story! I enjoyed looking at the photos. Pin sharp alright!!! Brilliant. I'm waiting for the D70 to come down a few dollars here in NZ before purchasing mine (I'm only a hobbyist and have low budget!), but am madly keen on viewing photos taken with them. They are definitely good cameras by th elook of these!!!</p>
