                <span id="Label1">In 1917, Sylvia Beach walked into a Paris bookshop, where she met Adrienne Monnier, the woman who would become her life companion. In 1919, Beach opened her own English-language bookshop and lending library, Shakespeare and Company, which would become the cynosure of an entire literary movement. Literary expatriates were drawn to her shop, and Ernest Hemingway declared of Sylvia, "No one that I ever knew was nicer to me." But her most celebrated literary efforts are those she made on behalf of her literary idol, James Joyce, undertaking the publication of <I>Ulysses</I>. Noel Riley Fitch uses Beach as the focal point for a fascinating portrait of an artistic community filled with anecdote after anecdote. From the intellectual salons at Natalie Barney's residence--of which "William Carlos Williams would recall only the lesbian women dancing together"--to the seemingly constant presence of Ezra Pound, Fitch's account solidifies the importance of the time and place he so vividly re-creates. <I>--Ron Hogan</I> </span>

                    <span>This one has been around for some time now and it is not the worse for wear.  For those interested in our literature and literary Paris during the 1920s and 1930s, then this is one of those "must reads" (I truely hate that term, but know of no better to describe the improtance of this work at this time).  The author's research is absolutely miticulous and fills in many gaps in the story of this remarkable woman.  Do be warned though.  Many of the names of people mentioned here are rather obscure (at this day and time) for those not immersed in the literary world.  This can make the work a bit difficult to follow at times.  That being said, this is a wonderful work to read to cause many of these names to become less obscure than they are now...one more of the many reasons to read this work!  The book covers some of the intimate details of Beach's relationship with friends and lovers that she so well side steps in her own account of this time.  Recommend this one highly.  Actually, you probably should purchase this one as it is one that is a good book for reference and one you will probably want to reread.   </span>

                    <span>This is one of those books where you care about the characters. Their past and future becomes important and that the characters are real people make this book all the more fasinating.  A book one does want to end. But end it does with style.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books that I've ever read about the 'lost generation' of Americans literary refugees in Paris. The writing is excellent, the research exhaustive and thorough with unparalleled access to Ms. Beach's 'surpressed' portions of her autobiography "Shakespeare and Company". It is readily apparent from this book that without Ms. Beach and her unflinching support, there would have been no "Ulysses" (and maybe no James Joyce). But there was so many other authors she supported and nurtured as well, as the quote from Ernest Hemingway cited above illustrates as well. This book is almost a 'must read' for those persons interested in American literature of the mid 20th century.</span>

                    <span>This book has been in print for many years because it is the definitive history of literary Paris for the expatriates of the 1920s and 1930s.  It is now happily used as a text book in universities, but is intented as a good read for any general reader interested in Hemingway, Stein, Joyce, Pound, and company.</span>
