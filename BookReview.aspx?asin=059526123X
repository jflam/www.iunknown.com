                    <span>This book would make a great trivia board game. The style and execution is simple and easy to read. The questions are interesting and, although I knew some of the answers beforehand, there are hundreds that I didn't know. It's a fun read and can really perk up a party! I think it would make a great coffee table book, too.</span>

                    <span>How could anyone not enjoy this book? The first page had me hooked. As some of the others have already stated, it's fun to use these questions on other people as well as yourself. The cover on my copy is worn out from people borrowing it. Sure, there are some publishing mistakes, but the joy these people had while making this book comes across like gangbusters. If you're looking for in-depth analysis of your favorite oldies, forget it. If you're looking for interesting tidbits, off-the-wall trivia and fun, then you'll enjoy it! The title says it all: jukebox TRIVIA...not jukebox analysis. You got a problem with that? Look up "trivia" in the dictionary.</span>

                    <span>This unprofessionally put together book (just look at the table of contents) is nothing new, and the questions are certainly not "fantastic." The format is the same old same old multiple choice and the supposed trivia is stuff we already know or worse, don't care about. The author's foil answers are supposed to be funny, but they're rather goofy. What a waste of money.</span>
