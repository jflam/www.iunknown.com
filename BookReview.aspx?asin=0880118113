                    <span>This was the first book on Triathlon racing and training that I bought - several years ago.  Its a well-written introduction to the sport and to training.  An easy read, it covers all the basics - swim technique, biking mileage and the ever popular run.  
<br />
<br />I think any beginner should start with this book for the sections on nutrition, staying healthy and race preparation.  Some of the best advice you can get - aside from fellow triathletes - is in this book about race day prep, things to know and do, etc.

                    <span>I really can't recommend this book.  I'm training for my first triathlon so consider myself a newbie -- but this book did ~not~ gve me the info I need.  Advice like "wear a helmet", "drink lots of fluids"... duh!!! - my 8 year old son knows that.  The author recommends to get help elsewhere on swimming and cycling techniques because the details are beyond the scope of the book.  I don't need a book for this kind of advice!  I read another older book (can't remember the name at the moment) which gave good solid advice -- even for a newbie like myself.  The mechanics of the freestyle stroke ~can~ be explained in simple terms by someone who understands and knows how to write.  In short: too much filler, not enough meat.  That said, it was not a total waste -- I was able to glean some facts obliquely referenced in the text.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as I was starting to train for my first triathlon.  Overall, the book was well written and covered the "essentials" of triathlon training.  However, it appears that major emphasis was placed on buying gear and a little bit of training tips for each discipline.  As far as actual training regimens are concerned, they were decent, but certainly not as comprehensive and explanatory as some other references (which may not necessarily be the focus for beginners).  The one thing I was most disappointed in, is that even after I had read this book 2 or 3 times, I still did not have a firm grasp of what to expect at my first triathlon (regarding transition set up, body markings, sighting techniques for open water, etc).  I had essentially hoped that from reading a beginning triathlon book, that I would have a working understanding of the days events, and ultimately I still was clueless come race day.  However, it is a decent book if you are looking for basic training tips and gear talk.  </span>

                    <span>I've been running and biking for years, but I wasn't sure I was up to a tri.  This book gave me just what I needed to get started.  I even picked up some useful tips on biking, which is genereally my strong suit.  This is a book I'll go back to again and again.  I highly recommend it for the beginning triathlete.</span>

                    <span>As the title suggests, this is a great book for getting a comprehensive review of what it takes to run your first triathlon. If you are looking for one book that will cover all three areas of training and describe what it is really like to compete in a triathlon, this is it.<p> Although the author is an experienced triathlete, he avoids the tendency to digress too much into personal reflections, which many of the biography-style guides to triathlon do. The practical advice about equipment is very helpful and not tied to specific products. I found the section that talked about "the frugal triathlete" to be very refreshing. <p>The information on workouts is definitely enough to get anyone started, no matter what your background. I'm a swimmer who has never run before, and I am so pleased to be able to follow the "initiation" workouts for non-runners. The blank templates for workout schedules are also very handy. <p>This is a perfect book to get started with and is likely to remain relevant for years to come.</span>
