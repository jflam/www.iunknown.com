                <span id="Label1">As his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry approaches, 15-year-old Harry Potter is in full-blown adolescence, complete with regular outbursts of rage, a nearly debilitating crush, and the blooming of a powerful sense of rebellion. It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?<p>  The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the <I>Daily Prophet</I>) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering ("<I>hem, hem</I>") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.<p>  <I>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</I>, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed  black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of <I>Sorcerer's Stone</I>. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series. (Ages 9 and older) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>Originally my favorite book was the Prisoner of Azkaban but after reading this the changed! While most people may not like it being dark, and violent I love it. If you think it is to violent for kids who sould of seen it coming with a charater like Voldemort. Being a teenager myself I think J.K. made Harry act just just like a normal teenager, it's great!</span>

                    <span>I was a big harry potter fan until I read this book. Well The number one reason is that it is too dark and personally I think it is not appropriate for younger kids because it involves violence. Please note that although I am giving this book a bad review I am going to continue reading the books. I just wanted to warn any parents out there. Thanks. :-)</span>

<br />
<br />To adress some of the cons, 
<br />
<br />First of all, this book is NOT satanic. If you seriously think that a lighthearted fantasy with good morals and CHRISTIAN symbolism is anti-christian, you might actually want to read the books-see for yourself. One review mentioned that "the movies are ok [not the books] because everyone knows movies aren't real." Hello!!! Books aren't real either, wise guy! 
<br />
<br />Secondly, Harry isn't that much of a jerk. Come on, EVERY teenager has mood swings and uncontrollable feelings--you did too! Just because Harry is mad a few times throughout the book doesn't mean that he's a terrible character with trashy morals. He shouldn't have done everything that he did, but who's perfect? Besides, do you really want Rowling to write about a saint? Come on, a character with a temper doesn't ruin a book. (Scrooge, anyone???)
<br />
<br />Third, the length of a book does not affect the "goodness" of it. Think about LotR - it's not exactly a brisk walk in the park, but it's still considered to be good! Hey, if you don't want to read that much, don't start the book!
<br />
<br />Finally, JKR didn't 'steal' her book from every other myth, legend, folktalke, and fable ( ;)if you know what i'm talking about - go MLFF! ) out there. Sure, like every good novel, there were plenty of similarites between OotP and other fantasy novels. However, the book was orighinal, and Harry isn't "the 1,000 faced boy." Give JKR some credit for her awesome book. 
<br />
<br />In conclusion, I think that many of you "1 star" people should either read the book again more carefully - and with an open mind, or read it for the first time! I, for one, thought it was great!!</span>
