                    <span>When I picked up She's Got Issues, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not.  But once I got into it, I began to understand the hidden message in it.  The message of letting your hurt feelings go so that you can move on and the lesson of forgiveness made this book worth buying.  There were some graphic words in the book but to me the author was just keeping it real and not sugar coating anything about what Sinclair and Aliette were about and dealing with.  Good read in my opinion.</span>

                    <span>I couldn't stomach this book. By page 15, I had read about a girl fight, a woman rolling her hips wondering whether a man can "eat good p----" and a guy referring to himself as "Big Daddy". Way too tacky a book for me to read. Glad I got it at the library.</span>

                    <span>The cover of this book is misleading. I thought I would be reading about a lady or man with issues in the bedroom or something to that affect, not about a lady obsessed with another lady for cheating with her man. This book was written poorly. The characters were just thrown together. I can't tell you what ONE of the characters looked like. I had no favorites, which is what killed it for me. Every book read should leave some time of thought with the reader. This one just didn't do anything for me. Sorry Miss Johnson.</span>

                    <span>"Revenge is sweet, but even sweeter when served by the hands of another," is what Sinclair Welch was told by her mother while growing up.  After receiving evidence of her husband's indiscretions with not one, but two women, she disregards her mother's words and takes matters into her own hands.
<br /> 
<br />As chance would have it, Aliette Pearly walks into Sinclair's life at a vulnerable moment.  Sinclair recognizes her as one of the women who ruined her marriage and sets her plan for revenge in motion.  Sinclair befriends her with the ulterior motive of ruining her, but with Aliette's destructive behavior and troubled past, she may self-destruct.
<br /> 
<br />Stephanie Johnson has penned a drama-filled novel that could put any daytime soap opera to shame.  SHE'S GOT ISSUES is a sexually charged, over-the-edge mix of drama and romance, and I could not get enough.  There is also an underlying message of forgiveness, which was a key factor in the characters overcoming their issues.  There were a few editorial issues, but aside from that I enjoyed the novel and have recommended it to friends and family.

                    <span>I loved this book!!  Just when you thought you had everything figured out, another twist was thrown your way.  Chapter after chapter of drama and issues beyond compare!  Go out and get it.
