                    <span>I have the old version of this book.  I guess TCP decided to take the author off the cover of her own book huh?  Damn.
<br />Anyway this book was alright in the urban fiction department.  But there's a new broad on the block, Stacy Nelson, and her book Don't Knock The Hustle to me is as realistic in its situations that it can get.  These writers need to get together and put out a 1000 page book.</span>

                    <span>I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THIS LIFESTYLE SO READING THIS BOOK NOW HAS ME EVEN MORE INTRIGUED.I FELL IN LOVE WITH VEGAS JUST READING THIS BOOK . I FEEL SHE WAS A STRONG CHICK FOR PUTTING UP WITH HIS CRAP. ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT CEAZIA WAS A LITTLE TOO QUICK TO ON THE TRIGGER, THIS IS THE ONLY PART OF THE BOOK THAT LET ME DOWN. I FEEL A REAL FEMALE WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH IT DIFFERENTLY,BUT NONETHELESS I LOVED IT AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEQUEL.</span>

                    <span>Too much Gucci and designer talk and too many scenes that just didn't make sense. Now with that said, I would still recommend this book because it's if nothing else entertaining, which I thougt was great. The ending will literally blow you away. I didn't expect that at all. Last I will say I'm more likely to buy an Urban book than a Tripple Crown book, but both companies need to find better editors. Don't hate me these are just my thoughts.

                    <span>Meet Ceazia in A Gangster's Girl by Chunichi.  Ceazia is a girl that is determined to live the good life at any cost, even if it means being the girlfriend of Vegas, one of Virginia's most notorious drug dealers. Together, Ceazia and Vegas build a solid relationship made out of love, mutual respect, and trust which serve as the foundation.  But, just when they think they have put all of the pieces of their lives together, a course of events threaten to tear them apart.  The question then becomes can they withstand the gusting winds of murder and deceit that threaten to tear them up, or will their house of love crumble in the storm?  
<br />
<br />I found this book to be a fast-paced read with a lot of twists and turns which were underdeveloped and did not make a lot of sense. The characters were a bit over the top with their desires to achieve material things, thus making them a bit unbelievable on occasion, especially when taking their upper middle-class upbringing into consideration.  The main plot, however, was believable and the end contained an awesome twist. Chunichi definitely has a talent for bringing the streets right off the pages and into your living room, and I definitely look forward to reading more of her work as she develops her talent in the future.  
<br />
<br />If you are into urban fiction and have an appetite for Gucci, guns and lust, A Gangster's Girl, by Chunichi may prove to be an interesting read.
