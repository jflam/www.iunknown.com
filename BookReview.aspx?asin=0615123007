                    <span>This is exactly what Joe and Jane Average need.  It has been known for many years that blackjack can be beaten by very good players.  Becoming that "very good" player is what has always been the obstacle.  Bluebook II cut through the gobbleygook and presented the most straightaway methods to bonafide winning play that I have seen.  IMHO, it brings legitimate advantage play within the reach of the common player.  The Ace/10 Front Count is poetic in its sheer simplicity and the "expandable" KISS Count (which stands for "Keep It Simple Stupid") makes older plus/minus count systems appear superfluous and archaic by comparison.  I don't think gaining the edge at blackjack can be made much simpler.  My two cents worth.  </span>

                    <span>This is the first technical book on blackjack I was able to understand.  Other books were either too basic to be helpful, or too complex to grasp.  I feel I got a lot of new understanding from this book.  It was very sensible and convincing in its effective writing style and examples.  The author has a way with words.  It got me to change the way I play.</span>

                    <span>For someone who is looking to progress beyond plain basic strategy, I thought the book was very helpful.  Lots of "murky" so-called blackjack axioms that were just mental "sticky points" got clearly explained.  The Ace/10 Front Count is just the kind of casual thing I was looking for to take my game up a level, without getting too serious.  It is truly easy to use at the table, unlike the technical counting systems I have seen.  Great book for polishing up one's game.         </span>

                    <span>I purchased this and another book called Knock-out Blackjack in preparation for a Vegas trip.  My main goal is to play socially and try to make my money last as long as possible.  The first part of this book gave me a bunch of history of the game which is really not necessary.  The section on strategy started about a third of the way into the book.  Compare to K-O, the techniques were much more complex and why does it matter if a card is red or black??  The only that matters in blackjack is numbers, not the colors of the cards.  I'd recommend K-O over this book for the average player.</span>

                    <span>I thought I knew what blackjack was all about and that everybody else was the dummy.  I played with that attitude for years, but still didn't win.  I had skimmed thru other blackjack books before, but none caught my attention with such clear and sensible facts like this one did.  It opened up my mind to thinking and playing in a way I didn't do before, and made a positive difference in my results since then.  
<br />
<br />Will I still be a winner next year and the year after?  Time will tell, but I play with much more confidence now, realizing that I'm thinking and doing the right things.  After a while you can actually see how that helps.    </span>
