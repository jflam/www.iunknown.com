                    <span>To date, this remains by far the best available English translation of Plato's _Euthyphro_, _Apology_, and _Crito_, and certainly the best English translation of Aristophanes' _Clouds_.<p>The major flaw in West & West's translation is their rendering of "phronimos" at _Apology_ 22a, 29e, and 36c as "prudent" (see their note 33 on p. 70).  Insignificant though it may seem, West & West are really forcing upon the reader an interpretation that is not required by Plato's Greek; their translation of these passages has the practical effect of entirely begging the question of what it is that Socrates has in mind when he speaks of virtue in the _Apology_.  Presumably, they assume that it is sufficiently clear that Socrates has in mind specifically *practical* wisdom in these passages.  The Greek word, however, does not particularly connote prudence except in Aristotle, who obviously uses it as a technical term.  It is worth noting that at Apology 25c, 28d, and 29e "to give thought to" is the rendering West & West give to "phrontizein".  What would otherwise be an obvious connection is obscured by their translation of these two crucial words in Plato's text.  To maintain consistency and to avoid begging important questions, West & West could perhaps have translated "phronimos" as "thoughtful" instead of "prudent".  At least "thoughtful" in English has enough ambiguity to leave open the question of what Socrates is exhorting when he exhorts everyone to be as "phronimos" as possible (29e and 36c; compare 30b, 31b, 39d, 41e).  This, I take it, is the paramount interpretative problem facing readers of Plato's _Apology_, whatever translation they use.<p>This flaw in West & West's translation shouldn't keep English readers from using their translation, since the alternatives offer even greater impediments to interpreting Plato.</span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding translation of these Greek texts.  These are texts that many of us regularly teach in introductory classes, and it is a great help to have such a reliable translation: the translation is clear and accessible, but maintains an unusually strict adherence to the form of the original Greek.  This makes it useful for advanced study as well.  The running footnotes to the text are especially helpful for giving students the relevant points of historical and legal context for understanding Socrates's position, but they are sparse enough that they do not intrude in the interpretation of the text.  This is the only translation of these texts that I will use in my courses.</span>

                    <span>This is a real rarity in Platonic scholarship--a synoptic translation of four important works on the life of Socrates; in other words, the translators use the same English words to convey the same important Greek  terms in each of their translations in order to aid the reader in  recognizing how those terms evolve in meaning and shape the drama of each  of the works, or in short, in recognizing the dialogue which exists between  the works rather than merely within them.  A former reviewer seems to have  missed the point of this work:  if you want someone to TELL YOU WHAT PLATO  MEANS, you can read a two line summary in an encyclopedia, but if you want  to find out why Plato went and wrote an entire dialogue rather than a two  line summary, you have to pay close attention to what he actually says.   These translations are about as close as you can get without having  advanced knowledge of Greek, and even then, the Wests note specific usages  of key terms which even a native speaker of ancient Greek might not have  noticed on a first reading, and which are largely ignored by the scholarly  community.  This is an ideal translation for students of politics, history,  philosophy, and classical literature who want to know why the most profound  and poetic civilization of antiquity put the first philosopher to death,  and why he let them.</span>

The useful background information and clear footnotes help make this an important book to have if  you want to read about Socrates. This book is a "must have" for  any Socrates fan indeed!</span>
