                    <span>This book is essentially a user's guide to the following programs (included on the CD that comes with the book except as noted): <P>VirtualDub - Video capture. Freeware.<BR>MovieXone - Video Editor. Freeware. <BR>SmartRipper - DVD Ripper. Freeware (not included).<BR>FlasK - File Format Transcoder. Freeware.<BR>TEMPGEnc - MPEG-2 Encoder. Freeware.<BR>DVTool - Video file analyzer. Freeware<BR>Roxio CD Creator - CD Burner. Commercial program (not included).<P>As a user's guide, this book isn't bad. There are lots of screen-shots and step-by step instructions. In fact, it's much better than the typical thin-pamphlet that comes with most modern commercial software. However, it is not a complete manual covering all of the program options. And of course, updated versions of the programs are available since the book was printed in 2001.<P>For the most part, the author jumps-in to using the programs without much overview or explanation of when or why to use them. I would have liked more of an overview of the process. Most people will be using some different software, and understanding the process is at least as important as understanding the steps.<P>I bought this book because I'm planning to get a system with a video capture card and DVD burner, and use it for copying VHS to DVD as well as some other video tasks. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT DVD AUTHORING OR PRODUCTION IN THIS BOOK!!! There is nothing about AC3 or 5.1 surround sound. There is quite a bit of information about how to compress and re-encode the video for copying video to a CD. The book needs to be updated. I'm writing this in June 2004, and DVD burners are available for less than $100 (assuming you already have a computer). Nobody should be burning video to a CD!<P>I did find the book somewhat useful, but I'm continuing my research.</span>
