                    <span>I trained for my first triathlon completely out of this book. Before I started, I was in so-so shape but didn't know how to do the crawl and could not swim a single lap without stopping. I memorized the breakdown of the swim stroke in the book, practiced for a couple of months, and then six weeks before my race (sprint at Pacific Grove 2004), I started his training plan and followed it to the letter. I lost weight, got in great condition, and ended up finishing 13th in my division! I had a fantastic race, smiling most of the way, and crossed the finish line feeling like a rock star. 
<br />
<br />Just a few months ago I never thought I would ever do something like this, and now I've joined a triathlon training team and am preparing for my second race in November. I'm in the best shape of my adult life, I love cross-training, and I am very, very grateful for this book. Believe me, if I can do it, *anyone* can. Get this book, finish a triathlon, and amaze yourself at what you can accomplish! </span>

                    <span>I picked up this book after reading Eric's articles in Shape magazine. I just finished my first triathlon, thanks to this book! I would have never crossed that finish line without it. I can't wait for my next race!
<br /> 
<br /> I wish I could give this book 5 stars, but it is just short of perfect. I'll highlight my problems with it, just to warn other potential readers. These are suggestions I would hope the author keep in mind if he chooses to write a new edition.
<br /> 
<br /> First, the basis of the training breaks you into 1 of 4 categories. This is great! This allows you to graduate into higher levels of training in the future. The problem is the way you are directed to your training level. There is a 10 question quiz that will identify your training level. With all due respect to Mr. Harr, he either needs to toss out this test, or he needs to work with a psychologist to tune it to something a little more meaningful. Despite his best effort, this test does nothing but measure your motivations. I came into this working out 6 days a week for the past 18 months. While I had never done a triathlon before, I considered myself to be in excellent shape. I took the test and scored a level I, which is what he refers to as a Slice above Couch Potato. Luckily, I looked at what was involved in the training plan and realized I am more closely in tune right in between a level II or level III. Even more dangerously, I gave this quiz to a friend of mine who was terribly out of shape. She scored a Level III. If she had attempted to work out at the intensity outlined for a Level III, it would have derailed her quickly. That's too much for someone who isn't in shape! If you are racing in a triathlon for enjoyment rather than competition, this by no means makes you out of shape. As far as Eric and the quiz are concerned, however, it does. I'd strongly recommend anyone reading this to consider this for themselves. Basically, you should know what level of shape you are in. If you don't, read the descriptions of a level and the exercise routine. Last thing you want to do is put yourself in a situation where you commit 2 months to training for the triathlon and end up under or over training because of a score on a flawed quiz.
<br /> 
<br /> The second thing that got to me with this book was the product recommendations. It was great to see the whole chapter devoted to what I need and what to look for. But some of the "can't go wrong with Speedo" was frustrating. Rather than tell you what it is that he likes with certain items, he just directs you to a brand name with little to no explanation. In some cases, Eric really outlined why he was recommending the brand (Giant bicycles, for instance). It would be nice to see this outlined for all products on the list. 
<br /> 
<br /> Sorry if this sounds nit picky, because this book is AWESOME! There are just a lot of things in the book that could mislead someone with limited knowledge. The book is so close to perfect - just be prepared to identify your own fitness level and ignore some of the blatant advertising, and you will be well on your way to being a triathlete!</span>

                    <span>I just finished my first triathlon this month, used this book to get me started and keep me motivated. It has different training levels for different people, great workouts and stretches, even advice for what to eat while training.  There's also a bunch of inspirational stories and reminders which are very helpful for novices. Great raceday tips and checklists too! Like some of the other readers, I used this book to get me started and now i'm searching for more triathlons!</span>

                    <span>I was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes, after being overweight and eating too much sugar for years.  This was a devastating blow to me, emotionally and physically.  <p>My doctor actually suggested I pick up a copy of Eric Harr's book -- to work my way slowly back to exercise. I began with the basic, Level I program in the book and it was a nice, gradual process.  I am feeling so good these days.  My doctor says my "good cholesterol" is up and "bad" is down.  I've lost 14 pounds and I am aiming for my first triathlon in 3 weeks.<p>I feel like Eric Harr's book has saved my life, because I used to hate exercise and I always ate poorly. Now, I'm on a new track because of this book.  I can feel myself LIVING again.<p>If you want to change your life -- and have fun learning how to be healthy again -- buy this book. It is a lifesaver.</span>

                    <span>This is the perfect book for the beginning triathlete or even the recreational/working triathlete.  The book focuses more on using your head for training instead of joining your local running club for sprint sessions, and I can claim to that.  A clydesdale swimmer for 12 years, I was suddenly lapping everyone by the 'chest push' advice and felt like I was cruising in the water with little effort.  The book focuses on spiritual efficiency, and building on what you can do with your god given abilities rather than a mentality of tendon crunching, muscle wrenching, lung bloating and crying god training.</span>
