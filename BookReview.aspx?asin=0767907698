                <span id="Label1">If your company&#8217;s goal is to become fast, responsive, and agile, more efficiency is not the answer--you need more slack.<br><br>Why is it that today&#8217;s superefficient organizations are ailing? Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, reveals a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency efforts can slow a company down.  That principle is the value of slack, the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change.  Implementing slack could be as simple as adding an assistant to a department and letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photocopier and more time making key decisions, or it could mean designing workloads that allow people room to think, innovate, and reinvent themselves. It means embracing risk, eliminating fear, and knowing when to go slow. Slack allows for change, fosters creativity, promotes quality, and, above all, produces growth. <br><br>With an approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook debunks commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and gives you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading Slack by Tom DeMarco, and it's not usual for me to agree with consultants. However, DeMarco hits the mark on a lot of points with me, particularly the issue of burnout. The book's major premise is that companies are so preoccupied with making themselves "lean" that they are overworking the middle management layer that is left to pick up the pieces. I think everyone knows that Wall Street loves the restructuring charges and the layoffs that come with it, but DeMarco illustrates effectively how overworking your "knowledge" base can actually decrease productivity in the long haul. Along with the overworking theme is the basic fact that middle management in an office environment is not like an employee in the factory - if you want to maximize the knowledge base, you need to provide enough support for them. Otherwise, without "slack", management is not able to institute change and a positive work environment. I would recommend this book for anyone who works 12 hour days, weekends and/or can't take a vacation because a day away from the office = two days of work when you get back. It is a quick read - the chapters are brief and it is tailored for those who only want the facts. And when your done, give this to your boss right before you ask for additional employees in your department.</span>

                    <span>What can be said about slack that has not already been said?<BR>Tom DeMarco certainly brings a new dimension to the term slack in his book. He explains the difference between slack and busywork and re-affirms the necessity for slack in every successful organization. "Slack is the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change." DeMraco has conveniently divided his book into four easy reading sections with their own <BR>"mini-themes." I personally found Part Four on "Leadership and Growth" a thought provoking and inspirational "how to guide." SLACK is directed toward management at all levels. It is especially a "wake-up call" to bad management and poor managers.</span>

                    <span>If you've read _The Goal_ or similar TOC books about discrete manufacturing, you know the hypothesis that at a facility where each step is maximally efficient, the factory as a whole will be minimally efficient. This book makes a similar argument for knowledge organizations: an organization where each employee is 100% utilized will tend to be highly inefficient overall. It's a quick, easy read and gets you thinking, but it lacks enough hard data or case studies to make the needed case. From personal experience I'm convinced, and I plan to read _Peopleware_ next.</span>

                    <span>This is certainly not the greatest management book ever written. It pales compared to stuff like "Good to Great" or even "Peopleware". Nothing is supported by data, and some of the stuff especially toward the back you've already heard a dozen times before. But it makes a fun, quick, read, and it will make you think. Check it out. It's worth investing a few hours of reading.</span>

                    <span>Slack blows the doors off the myths of total efficiency by breaking down the many fallacies that efficiency experts have been trying to sell us for years. Slack is not a book that is trying to "sell" you anything; but a book that advises you "don't buy it"!<P>Downsizing, busyness, aggressive schedules, overtime, the culture of fear, and the obsession we have with process improvement are just a few of the total efficiency crazes that DeMarco addresses. He lays down a convincing foundation for busting these myths beginning in the first chapter. He explains that knowledge workers are not fungible resources, that is that they can not easily and freely exchange their work from a variety of tasks or projects, basically challenging the biggest myth out there, that of multi-tasking knowledge workers.<P>The book is not all doom and gloom, but provides solid strategies for any manager willing to set aside the current corporate trends and enter a brave, new world of Slack. I have a few managers I'd like to share this book with!</span>
