                <span id="Label1">Non-cat people frequently describe cats as selfish, unfriendly, and frustratingly independent, while a true cat lover can see these same traits and wax poetic. <I>The Nine Emotional Lives of Cats</I> is truly an ode to the wonderful and mysterious behavior of our furry friends--even when the behavior at hand is narcissism or jealousy. Author Jeffery Moussaieff Masson (<I>Dogs Never Lie About Love</I>) explores the lives of his five cats as they relate to his family, each other, and the world around them, filled as it is with such interesting creatures as butterflies, automobiles, and visiting humans. <p> Each chapter is devoted to a study of a particular emotion, ranging from love to playfulness to anger. While there are interesting tidbits of animal science, such as "cats look away or blink when feeling friendly," the majority of the book revolves around the author's observations of his own pets. When he suggests answers for mysterious behavior like the grooming that instantly turns into a bloodthirsty brawl, he is never absolute, but merely offers one among many possible explanations. Kind and thoughtful, Masson's entertaining tales and wise musings will be appreciated by any cat fancier. <I>--Jill Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>If you are picking up this book, you are bound to be a cat lover, just like Jerffey Moussaieff Masson. He writes with a heart felt style when discussing the emotions that cats have. He has written many books about animals, and seems to have great insight as to what goes on inside their brains and hearts.<P>You can quickly tell he is an avid cat lover, as he has many cats himself. Through years of observations of animals and through his own experiences he sums cats emotions into nine categories: narcissism, love, contentment, attachment, jealousy, fear, anger, curiosity, and playfulness. These nine emotions seem to work well in explaining why cats are they way they are.<P>The book does not offer a bunch of scientific explanation behind his theories, but offers his hypothesis from his personal experience. A cat lover will enjoy his tales and stories, as some are quite entertaining. After reading this book you will certainly look at your cat through different eyes.</span>

                    <span>"I've read all of Jeffrey Masson's animal books in almost one week -and I loved them all,<BR>but when the "Pig who Sang to the Moon" came out last fall - it became my very favorite!<P>Every animal is different, true, but it's so much more prevalent in cats then any other species.<P>My cat, which had been abused, slowly gained my trust over the years and is becoming sweeter and sweeter as he gets older.<P>The discussion seems to be evolved around "should or shouldn't cats venture outside" - well, I have no heart to keep mine locked up.<P>He is very careful crossing the street of my suburb, loves to take the walks with me trotting beside or behind me - and love him!<P>Yes, the passage about the misbehaving cat being returned to the first owner didn't escape me, as well as the pleading of Ilan, the author's 3 years old son.<P>The father's main priority seemed to be keeping the order in his big, extended family, but for the little boy with a soft heart -the cat is all that matters.<P>It is something very touching in Ilan's plea, if only because he was so very young at the time - are we still more children of Heaven then Earth at that age? - I sometimes wonder..<P>I love little Ilan for his tenderness for animals, and the fact that he won over his father's heart in this case - testify for Jeffrey Masson being not only a great animal lover, but also a great Father to Ilan and Manu.<P>Again - thanks Jeff for all the books you've written and thank you for such an extensive bibliography you've included.<P>It led to "Dominion" by Matthew Scully, the book that everyone should read, to wonderful, so touching books of Kristin von Kreisler, and I'm sure, it will lead to many more in the future.<BR>And as always - can't thank enough Louis Dorfman from whom all my Journey to the Animals World begun."</span>

                    <span>This is an interesting subject but the author did not take this to it's full potential. At times a difficult & confusing read and the author consistently contradicts himself regarding the subject matter and seems to not be able to make even his own mind up regarding even his own theories. Most of the narrative of the text is over-psychologised and preachy (possibly PETA sympathies & bias), and the author jumps from one subject to another without completing his previous thoughts & analysis on the emotion he's talking about at that particular time. The stories of the author's cats are amusing and interesting but the analysis is contradictory. At times, the emotions his cats clearly exhibit the author ends up discrediting the proof and then in the next sentence he changes his mind. This is a study & observation of the author's own cats, not a study of many over a long period. Just as human beings are of a same species,all are different & have different personalities, so too I believe animals have unique personalities and traits that are unique to them, in addition to the emotions that are universal to them.<P>I'm a licensed veterinary technician, specializing in emergency and critical care and have 6 cats of my own, along with a German Shepherd dog, and a lot of the emotional traits the author states cats do not have, I have observed that they do have, both in my own feline companions and also in the ones I care for. This book seems more of a thesis collection of data and amusing observations instead of information regarding this great creation of God, the cat, and the feelings & emotions of genuine love that this living being truly has. I was so excited about this topic in animals finally being written about but was disappointed in that this wasn't further expounded upon in this book.</span>

                    <span>This book was written in an interesting, almost philosophical way, asking more questions and not giving a whole lot of answers. That isn't a criticism, just an observation. The author will give an example of an emotion in cats, tell a story, then give his own opinion of what it means. Then he'll question it, and say, well, maybe it could also mean this. It's an interesting style because he doesn't just feed you information, rather he forces you to think about it on your own. It's quite enjoyable. <P>Plus the anecdotes are hilarious, and any cat owner can relate to them. Yossie with the strategically-placed sponges, Minna and her banana leaf prey... a book any cat-fancier will enjoy.</span>

                    <span>An informative and interesting book about 9 emotions that are common in cats. (This review refers to the audio cassette version.) Mr. Masson, a psychoanalyst, discusses cat emotions such as narcissism, love, jealousy and aloofness. He uses an academic tone, but provides helpful insights to the cat owner. I learned more about my cat and what makes him tick through this book! Did you know that a cat who holds his tail straight up is very confident? Or a cat who holds his tail in the shape of a question mark is friendly, but not confident? You will learn insights such as these and more...</span>
