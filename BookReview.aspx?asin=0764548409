                    <span>This book ideal for:
<br />1)	Those who do not know SQL at all.
<br />2)	Those who knows SQL little but want to learn more but quick and easy way.
<br />3)	Those who do want to know what SQL can do can not do.
<br />
<br />This book is highly recommended. It teaches you quickly and easily. This book do not claim that they will make you mater in two days but they do teach you everything they can and quick and easy way. This book does provide some good references and covers all the quick points about SQL. I have really read this book in weekend and I learn myself from the point where this books ends.</span>

                    <span>Lives up to its promise: introduction ito MSSQL Server, no less, no more. 
<br />I moved from Oracle and was somehow confused by the "database", "filegroups" etc.
<br />I've got my answers here (and from couple more titles, to be sure)
<br />I neither had problems with instalation, nor with running the examples (save for one: the
<br />chapter on cursor sports keyword DEALLOCATED, has to be - DEALLOCATE; had to check BOL on that)
<br />The Transact-SQL examples could be better (I know PL/SQL, so I had some base here), but again
<br />the book does not claim to teach T-SQL..
<br />The code snippets sometime seem to be taken out of the contexts of bigger procedures, and
<br />I had to figure out how to fit them in; the usp_FindFactorial example seems too complex for
<br />the task it solves (it uses intermediate table to accumulate results 
<br />instead of calling itself recursively; should it then be a function?), 
<br />but my understanding is that the elegancy was sacrificed to cram in more techniques than requred. 
<br />My examples did run correctly, though
<br />After I was through with the book, I had to buy an additional one on Transact-SQL 
<br />(IMHO: O'Reily's book Transact-SQL Programming did NOT live up to my expectattions 
<br />and the publisher's reputation; I used Sam's T-SQl in 21 days, and then Ken Henderson's book)
<br />To sum up: if you are new to SQL server, and find yourself 
<br />somewhat overwhelmed by the Books-On-line style 
<br />(comes free with every MSSQL Server installation), get this book
<br />NB: better download new installation from microsoft site; the one included with the book does not have latest security patches)

                    <span>The book offers to show you all sorts of querys, stored procedures, rules, and in general the T-SQL language. However, No one ever proof read the book to see if the formulas worked. I've spent so much time "De-bugging the examples" I tossed the book out. Makes you wonder what the other reviewers were looking at. What a waste!</span>

                    <span>Highly recommended. The book goes easy on you,and it does not assume any previous knowledge on your part.It will not make you an accomplished DBA over a weekend, but I recommend it as a olid introduction.Material is well organized and presented, with a fair portion of typos and slips :)I did not encounter any installation problems reported from Colorado:  no key was ever required (maybe they print special edition for Boulder, CO?). Nevertheless, I do recommend downloading trial version from Microsoft, as it contains the latest fixes (the book was published in 2001, after all).</span>

The book also contains numerous, and I mean numerous, typos, mistakes and incorrect code that will not work.</span>
