                <span id="Label1">Paul Johnson says that writing <I>A History of the Jews</I> was like writing a history of the world "seen from the viewpoint of a learned and intelligent victim." Johnson's history begins with the Bible and ends with the establishment of the State of Israel. Throughout, Johnson's history is driven by a philosophical interest: "The Jews," he writes, "stand right at the centre of the perennial attempt to give human life the dignity of a purpose. Does their own history suggest that such attempts are worth making? Or does it reveal their essential futility?" Johnson's history is lucid, thorough, and--as one would expect of almost any project with such a broad scope--a little wrong-headed. By the end of the book, readers will be grateful for Johnson's questioning of the Jews' confidence in their cosmic significance. However, readers may also be a little annoyed by his energetic inquiries as to whether this significance was man-made or providentially provided. Either way, it's a given: for a historian of Israel, this should adequately settle the question. Johnson's 600-page history is probably the best we've got by a living gentile--which is no small accomplishment at all. --<I>Michael Joseph Gross</I> </span>

                    <span>This is probably the most comprehensive history of the Jewish people out there contained in a single book.  It contains an overview of the biblical record and covers the diaspora, medieval period, foundings of Zionism, the Holocaust as well as a decent description of the events leading up to problems in the Middle East that endure to this day.  It is definitely not light reading, however, and events are not always described in chronological order.  For these reasins I only gave it 4 stars, but it deserves a strong 4.5.</span>

                    <span>Paul Johnson's books always offer vivid portraits of diverse peoples, places, and events. The breadth and variety is what makes his books such great reads. One of his best achievements is "A History of the Jews." Although Johnson is a practicing Christian, this has not prevented him from writing a very interesting, worthwhile, engaging and fair history of the Jewish people. The book covers very well the early history of the Jews, beginning with the Israelites of biblical times through developments in Jewish thought and migration in medieval times. He also covers well how the Jewish people and Jewish traditions evolved in the modern era, culminating in one of civilization's greatest evils, the Holocaust, followed by one of the greatest achievements of any people in our time: the creation of the modern state of Israel. Johnson's book is a very important survey that everyone should have the privilege of reading. But one area where Johnson writes far too little is about what happened to the Jewish people who remained in Poland following the Second World War only to become scapegoats of a desperate Communist government. An excellent book on this topic is Arthur Wolak's "Forced Out: The Fate of Polish Jewry in Communist Poland."</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. One of the things i loved was the way the author connected everything together. Plus their was so many new things I learnt in this book. 
<br />On the other hand, this book had so much information to offer it made it a little bit hard to read for  long periods of time. This book is a great reference book.  But it was definitely one of the most interesting books on Jewish History. For any person who wants to know what to read for his first book on Jewish History I would advise him this book. After you will finish this book you will a broad knowledge on almost every aspect on Jewish History. </span>

                    <span>I probably would not have become aware of this excellent book, had not some Jewish friends recommended the AISH.com website to me, thinking no doubt that I needed a more balanced view about Jewish history.  I am grateful to them for so doing! One of the most interesting items on that website was ?Crash Course in Jewish History? by Rabbi Ken Spiro in which he recommended many books including this one.  I ended up buying not only his book, ?World Perfect ? The Jewish Impact on Civilization?  - (ISBN 0-7573-0056-1), but several others including this book.  Up to this point in time, my knowledge of Jewish History ended with the first Jewish revolt against the Romans, and I was almost completely ignorant about their history after that. I read   Rabbi Spiro?s book first, mainly because it was shorter, and I am glad I did, because it prepared me very well for reading this very detailed book on Jewish history. <p>I particularly like the structure of the book which is in seven nicely delineated parts ? Israelites, Judaism, Cathedocracy, Ghetto, Emancipation, Holocaust, and Zion.  It was not until midway through the section on Judaism, that I realised that I would have to be a little more rigorous  in my reading of the book, because not only was there a wealth  of detail about Jewish scholars and notables, but there was also considerable explanation of their basic philosophy which I needed to properly understand in order to avoid being overwhelmed. <p>So I set up my own dictionary of people in a PC workfiles, as well as looking up what websites there were about them.  This was an interesting exercise, and I found a lot of useful supplementary information to fill in some details about the lives of these individuals. The task became even greater when I reached the middle of the Emancipation on because the number of names seemed to be increasing on every page!  This is not a criticism of the book, because it quite convincingly demonstrated the enormous contribution that the Jewish people have made to our civilisation, particularly since the beginning of the 18th century.<p>I found this book to be balanced, sympathetic, and thorough.  Johnson describes in detail the sorry catalog of horrors that the Jews have suffered over the last 2500 years in Europe and Asia, as well as the beliefs and philosophy of their leading scholars from the time of the first Jewish revolt against the Romans to the modern era.   How the various Jewish communities responded to the many difficult predicaments they faced firstly with the Roman Empire, then with the Christian Church, then with Islam, and finally with the Christian States of Europe which have emerged during the last 800 years or so, is told with great sympathy and understanding. <p>Johnson provides ample detail on the contribution of the Jew and Judaism to the philosophy, the culture, and the development of democratic ideals of the modern democracies (which is also the main theme of Rabbi Spiro?s book).  His theme is that time and time again, Jewish communities, even though there were usually major restrictions on their activities, would find ways to make a living and to be useful to the monarchy and the nobility, who then would use them as scapegoats when major economic and social disasters struck. In particular, he shows how the basic arguments and slanders used by the Medieval Church  were used and embellished by later anti-Semites.  While anti-Semitism is not the major theme of this book, it does, in my view, deal with the problem fairly and squarely, and particularly well for the past 200 years or so, when eastern Jews  began to emerge from their ghettos in increasing numbers. His description and explanation of the rising anti-Semitism during the 19th century, and its sudden emergence in Germany culminating in the Holocaust was particularly careful and thoughtful.<p>His account of the roots of the seemingly never ending Middle East crisis and the creation of the State of Israel was even handed and sensitive, and I think it extremely important to be as well informed as possible about the root causes of this struggle in order to determine what should be done about it today.   He makes the point that the rise of Arab nationalism after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire took place a little later than that of Jewish nationalism, but that it was nevertheless latent during the early 20th century when Theodor Herzl and his successors were making great efforts to push for the creation of a Jewish state in ?Eretz Israel?.    I was not aware of many of the events of the 30 years leading up to the creation of the state of Israel, and while I was generally familiar with the first 25 years of its existence, I was certainly not well informed of all the details.   I found Johnson?s description of the wars of survival, the religious parties, and population growth, a useful reminder of the internal as well as external issues which Israel currently faces.  <p>I very much enjoyed reading this book.  It was interesting, it provided the depth of detail I was looking for, and it met my expectations completely.  I am sure there are many other books on Jewish history which I would find equally absorbing, but this is the one I happened to choose first.  I am happy to have read it and would thoroughly recommend it to all  potential readers, whatever their religious beliefs or upbringing.</span>
