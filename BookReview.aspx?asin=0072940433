                    <span>This book is very difficult to understand even with a basic background in finance and economics.  There is no structure, no clear definitions or definitions at all. I do not understand why the majority of instructors chose this text.  There even are errors in the solutions for the practice questions.  </span>

                    <span>I think that this book is an excellent corporate finance book. If one person has difficulties understanding such a book written in a very clear language, then he or she better doesn't study finance or economics.The fact that the book is used as the required text for the corporate finance courses in the majority of the best business schools proves its importance.At the end of chapter problems are very useful too.Therefore one should also buy the solutions manual to check her own solutions. However I think that it would be perfect if these solutions were available in the book's website. </span>

                    <span>This book is good, but only for people who know at least some Finance before they read it.  Believe me, I have taken Corporate Finance at the MBA level before, it's not an easy book to read.</span>

                    <span>I am an MBA student with no financial background (having received my BS in a completely different field), this was the required text for my Corporate Finance class and it left me so confused I had to withdraw from the class so as not to ruin my GPA.  The text is of no value to students like myself that need to learn the basics in order to understand what the authors are talking about. Surely there's a better book out there somewhere for Professors to select for their students.</span>

                    <span>Let's just say this book is one reason I graduated with a degree in history rather than economics. 
<br />
<br />If I were an economics professor this book would make me worry about my job security, since the use of this book tends to scare students away from what truly is a beautiful, captivating discipline.</span>
