                <span id="Label1">For the first time EVER released on video - classic NFL Films footage and behind-the-scenes action, straight from the Vaults of NFL Films. The Archives Volumes 1-3, based on the successful series aired on ESPN Classic -- The Lost Treasures of NFL Films -- features rarely seen footage of the early days of pro football in America, from the unique perspective of NFL Films. * Volume 1: Creation (1962-65). Go back in time to witness how it all began - beginning with the 1962 NFL Championship. Also featured in this classic time-capsule are interviews with Vince Lombardi, on and off-field outtakes from Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, and Johnny Unitas, and the 1965 Pro Bowl, which will be remembered forever as Jim Brown's last game. * Volume 2: Renegades (1960-69). This volume takes a look back at the colorful players, loyal fans and outlaw image of the American Football League (AFL). Witness the evolution of one of the greatest experiments in American sports, from its humble beginnings to the juggernaut that forced a merger with the mighty NFL. * Volume 3: Merger (1970). This volume focuses on the merger between the National Football League and the American Football League. Based on nearly 400 hours of lost footage re-creates the rocky honeymoon and successful marriage of the two Leagues.</span>

                    <span>I felt compelled to write a review on this because I sorta feel conned. I bought this 3-disc set hoping for a little more than about 50 minutes on each disc. Film companies can fit hours and hours of footage on one DVD, why did NFL Films decide to stick less than an hour of footage on each disc? It doesn't make sense other than to be able to charge more for it. It's fascinating to watch and I love NFL Films but all this footage could have easily fit on one DVD. It's not like theres directors commentary or any real special features. One every disc they have little snipsets of individual players and the Sabol comments on them (Jim Brown is one example). Even with this, you're not getting any more than a little over an hour of material on each DVD. It's a great set but it's not worth the price at all</span>

                    <span>I really, really wanted to get this DVD...been waiting for NFL films to put together footage of the 1950's & 60's. But I was less then satisfied, anything on this DVD can be seen on TV, ESPN and now on the NFL channel. It's over produced with lots of talking which is OK if back up with video that last more then 30 seconds....each volume lasts 41 minutes, so you get only about two hours, but with lots of repetition. Bottom line- this is not for the serious fan...watch it on TV and not waste your money like I did.</span>

                    <span>The Sabol Family were ahead of their time with the creation of NFL Films:The incredible game footage (a ton of it shot in slow motion) that was artistic, the legendary music of Sam Spence, the "Voice of God", John Facenda's narration; It was a heady brew that worked and continues to work. This 3 disc set is the ESPN Classic Lost Treasures series and it plays better here than on the original (cable) network run. Like with the CD THE POWER & THE GLORY: THE MUSIC OF NFL FILMS, bring on the next volume.</span>

                    <span>Given that this is a dvd produced by NFL Films, there is a certain amount of quality to this dvd that is to be expected, and it is evident here. Steve Sabol and John Facenda, along with all those slo-mo close-ups, are always enjoyable viewing, especially on DVD. <P>My one beef with the dvd was that it does focus a lot on NFL Films, and their struggle to film games, as opposed to what happened on the field. There are a lot of scenes of missed shots, out of focus, or too shadowy to use in the productions. You can see why many of these scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. So why bring them back here? Just to show how hard it is to focus on the ball. <P>There are previously excluded scenes that we are grateful to see now, but basically this dvd serves as a nice supplement to an NFL dvd library, but does not serve as the Standard Work.</span>
