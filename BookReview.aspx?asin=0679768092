                    <span>This is a pretty typical Michael Lewis read: exceptionally descriptive, hilarious and insightful.  He does great work seeing the various campaigns for what they are; and is able to stay objective throughout the experience, though obviously he forms a special connection to Morry Taylor.<p>This is an entertaining book from a skilled writer.</span>

                    <span>I have read the authors other two books and found them average at best.  I tried this book because of the good customer reviews here and that it was very inexpensive used.   What a side splitting, could not put down book this turned out to be.  His wit hit high form with this book, I really fell in love with his descriptions of the race and candidates.  Funny and smart comments kept coming at the reader almost if a comedy team were working on the book instead of one writer.   OK the book is not the dry step by step look at the campaign that you would get with some other authors but that is part of the fun.    If you read this book with say The Choice by Woodward, you get a great look at the election process and the probably would gain a better understanding of American politics.<p>My only gripe would be that he did not spend as much time on the Democrats as he did on the Republicans, but I understand that the Republicans really had the race and the characters for the book.  I guess I just wanted more being the greedy person I am.    This was a funny book and just keeps moving the whole time you are reading it.  A great lighter book to read if you are interested in politics.</span>

                    <span>This Michael Lewis work got buried, but I think it's his finest writing.  Yes, "Liar's Poker" will be called upon 50 years from now (along with 'Bonfire of the Vanities' and 'Den of Thieves') as one of the seminal works of the 80s.  And 'The New New Thing' captured a lot of the flavor of the 90s (although revisionist history re. Jim Clark's 'success' is eating away at the book's premise).  But in terms of insight, humor, cynicism, getting to the essence of people's characters...I think Lewis surpasses himself here.<p>I read the hardback version of this book, which was called 'Trail Fever."  I never liked that title, but I think I like 'Losers' even less.  Yes, it was a chapter title in hardback version, but the real losers in Lewis's book are the so-called winners, Clinton and Dole.  By contrast, Lewis shows the strength of character of the putative losers, especially in compelling profiles of Morry Taylor, Alan Keyes, and even Pat Buchanan.   <p>What I especially liked about the book was Lewis' fight not to get totally taken over by what seems to be his naturally skeptical and cycnical view of the world.  In fact, the best writing in the entire book deals with John McCain (Lewis is an unabashed McCain fan here, four years before that sentiment became in vogue) and - in particular - McCain's relationship with Clinton advisor David Ifshin.  This chapter is very far removed from a skeptic's view.  In fact, the emotion of the McCain/Ifshin relationship brought me to tears, as I think it would anyone.<p>Lewis is also affected by the stark honesty and un-political-ness of Morry Taylor, who is a real revelation here.  And despite being on an entirely different plane politically than Alan Keyes, Lewis never ceases to be amazed at Keyes' blindingly brilliant oratorical flights of fancy.  <p>Here's another neat thing about the book (well, the hardcover version at least)...elliptical asides about Tabitha Soren (of MTV 'Choose or Lose' fame), a later reference to 'my houseguest at the time,' and an acknowledgement to the help of one 'Tabitha Sornberger' (Soren's real name).  She became Mrs. Michael Lewis not long after the publication of this book.</span>

                    <span>This is probably Michael Lewis' least popular book, but it is also my favorite. Though it is now a little dated (it was about the '96 election) and focuses a little too much on the unlikely third party candidate Morry Taylor, it is a very honest portrayal of the mess that is presidential campaigning. Lewis was obviously not very experienced with the campaign trail and uses his sharp wit to highlight its unique and baffling characteristics (waving to no one from a plane stair case, having debates in front of now studio audience). It has great characters and Lewis does an excellent job of describing them, nd showing why it is so easy to fall for third party candidates and why they will never win. It is great political commentary and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes politics, Michael Lewis books, or just an interesting, easy book about current events.</span>

                    <span><p><br>Available at stores that sell everything for a dollar or less, this book is a hard-copy bargain.  Even for those who have read other campaign trail books, this book offers a combination of unvarnished sad truths (Presidential candidates speaking to empty rooms, waving to empty runways, all to create the "virtual reality" of having something to say and someone to listen to it) together with a sense of lost opportunities.<p>As campaign reform looms on the horizon, I found this book especially appealing for its detailed look at "the people's candidate," Morry Taylor, the "Grizz"--a person I never heard of during the actual campaign.  The book really drives home how flawed our existing electoral system is today, as well as all the campaign contributions, "rented strangers," and other anomalies that make good Presidents an accident rather than a choice.<p>I read the book shortly after reading Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, "The Radical Center", on citizen-centered politics of choice, and there could be no better book for appreciating just how radical Halstead and Michael are, than this book.</span>
