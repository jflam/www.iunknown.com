                    <span>I have rarely enjoyed a book so much.  It is thoroughly engrossing, illuminating us to so many aspects of the European Theater, many of the great men of the war, and general command principles. 
<br />
<br />Bradley recounts, in some detail, battle by battle the move through Africa, Sicily, France and Germany.  His account seems straightforward and humble, tackling failures of Monty (including Market Garden) Patton, and even himself in his failure to anticipate the Ardennes Offensive that led to the Battle of the Bulge.  
<br />
<br />His accounts of interactions with great men of the era such as Eisenhower, Monty, and Patton are worthwhile, but what I found fascinating were the figures new to me such as Hodges, Middleton, Ridgeway, Heubner, Gerow, Devers, and even Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.  The hard-charging, do your duty feeling that was evident in this book makes me proud to be an American.  It is simply amazing to see that men such as Eisenhower and Bradley moved from relative obscurity as colonels to leaders of enormous armies in some of the most important battles of history in a period of only 5 or 6 years.   
<br />
<br />An added plus are the motivational and management lessons learned from Bradley.  
<br />
<br />One suggestion:  While the book is filled with helpful maps, search for WW2 Battlefield maps online and print them for reference.  Keep them with you when you read Bradley's accounts.  They will make following the detail of movement much easier.</span>

                    <span>"A Soldier's Story" by Gen. of the Army Omar Bradley is a impressively engaging book dealing with his experiences in Europe and Africa during World War II. Being in every major engagement from Algeria to the Elbe, Bradley retraces the steps of the American and British armies from TORCH and the thrust in North Afica through Sicily and finally into mainland Europe in OVERLORD and subsequent battles.
<br />
<br />General Bradley offers excellent advice on command and his views and Allied views on the war. Throughout the book, frequent maps illustrate the battle plans and make for a better situational awareness.
<br />
<br />As a valuable war book, "A Soldier's Story" is an excellent choice to learn about WWII in detail. It offers excellent command advice and allows the reader to form his personal viewpoints on our role in the fight. An excellent read.</span>

                    <span>Although I read this book a number of years ago, I still remember the value of reading his perspective on the war. Like most war veterans, my uncle (who was part of the D-Day invasion) and my father who fought in Guadacanal, refused to discuss the war with their children. Bradley's book gave me some of the information that I had been seeking. And, from the tone of the book, it gave me the feeling that Bradley, unlike Patton, was not only a soldier. He was a sensitive, caring individual who had simply chosen to be a career officer. Furthermore, like MacArthur, he didn't expect his men to make sacrifices that he was not prepared to make.</span>

                    <span>A Soldier's Story is easily the best of the memoirs of the major Allied leaders of WWII. From D-Day to the German surrender, Bradley was in the middle of the European action and "tells it like it was", far more so than Eisenhower did in "Crusade in Europe". While Ike glosses over controversial situations and personality clashes, Bradley honestly discusses the failure to close the Falais Gap, the failure of "Market- Garden" in Holland,and the failure to detect the Ardennes offensive. In addition, Bradley graphically describes his antagonistic relationship with Montgomery and his, at times, difficulty in dealing with his subordinate, George Patton. Bradley's writing is not that of a man whose real purpose is to make friends and run for office; he writes like a man who wants to tell people his version of the momentous events of 1944-5. His story flows seamlessly and never seems self-serving, a fault of nearly every military memoir I've ever read. If you could only read 2 books on WWII, I'd recommend Shirer's "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" and this book, "A Soldier's Story".</span>

                    <span>This book is the story of WWII as General Omar Bradley saw it.<p>His unassuming and straight forward style underscores how he is portrayed by contemporary accounts.  The man known as the "G.I. General" comes across as an island of equanimity in a sea of incredible egos like Patton, Montgomery et al.<p>This book is Bradley's take on events.  I am sure that some involved in controversies he covered (Patton's slapping incident, Montgomery at Caen, Falaise and Arnhem) would defend their actions (or inactions) vigorously.  Yet this account has an aura of authenticity due to the author's lack of need to tout his own accomplishments (which were many).  This inner peacefulness, along with command ability, probably explains Bradley's rise to the level of senior American ground commander in Europe.<p>For an insider's account of the American effort and strategic management in the European Theater of Operations, this book is superb.  It is well written, clear and largely devoid of the bombast that can weigh down some combat and command accounts.  Although a big book, it reads quickly.</span>
