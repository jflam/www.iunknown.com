                <span id="Label1">The power of pictures is celebrated in this portfolio of the most forceful still images of all time.  Robert Capa's dispatches from the beach at Normandy and Joe Rosenthal's photographic report of Iwo Jima stirred a nation, as did-in quite an opposite way-Eddie Adams' and Larry Burrows' searing imagery from Vietnam.  LIFE thinks outside the box in this book: Did Marilyn Monroe's pinup change the world?  Did Harry Benson's photography of the Beatles deplaning in New York in 1964 alter our cultural focus?  The pictures in this book are sometimes beautiful, often striking-and undeniably powerful.</span>

                    <span>None of these covers "changed the world". Whether they will admit it or not, the American media don't rule the world. Least of all Life Magazine. If they're so important, why did they go out of business?</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most fabulous photo books I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to anoyone with even the slightest interest of the world they live in. The pictures are poignant, and each picture is also described allowing for a more in-depth knowledge to be gained. An absolutely wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>This publication is an important addition to anyone's library who loves to read about history and see them in photographs. As mentioned before above, a lot of these photographs you've seen before. Images included are of children being poor and starving for food, an embryo in the womb, The World Trade Centers, the effects of war, and so on. The photographs will take your breath away, make you wonder how could people do such things, bring tears to your eyes, and maybe even make you feel there is still hope for the world.<BR> <BR>These photographs are amazing. I am so glad to have this publication. One picture that grabbed my attention and moved me to tears: Biafra 1969. <P>All of the pictures were alive and vivid so much so that you will never forget what you see and read. I recommend this publication to enthusiast of photography and history. It deserves well over five stars.<P>Joy.</span>

This book describes their background and in a few lines presents a look back at the World since the invention of photography.</span>
