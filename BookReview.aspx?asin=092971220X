                    <span>2PAC...was,is,and will be forever in our hearts.<br>I really don't know what to believe:is he death or not...because here,in romania a lot of magazines keep saying that he is not death...why?Just becaue they wanna be close to him,or what?<br>suspicious events:13th is a day which usually doesn't bring us good news.Interesting is that there weren't any pictures with PAC bleeding.In his song "Life Goes On"he is talking about his own death . The driver of the car,SUGE KNIGHT hasn't been present at the inquiry of the event."i'm not paid to solve murders"said him<br>The white cadillac in which where the assasins,just after the murder ,passed near PAC's car,but nobody tdyed to stop theme.<br>His video,"I Ain't Mad At Cha"was released rigt after the shoots.<br>in that video,2pac was an angel in Heaven...and there are a lot of theories like these...anyway,his lucky number seems to be 7...<br>Even if they say yhat he isn't death,I think that we should respect him,even in his death!<br>Keep ya head up and folllow your dreams!<br>Peace,love and respect for this ANGEL!</span>

                    <span>With so much controversy about his death, I decided to get the facts from this shocking, yet very informative book from acclaimed journalist Cathy Scott.<p>While also telling you about the man himself, Scott reveals the many flaws in the investigation of the shooting that took place on the night of September 7th, 1996 - the scene of the crime not being secured quick enough, the fatal release of key witness Yafeu Fula, Suge Knight's attorney playing hard to get with Les Vegas Police and the confusion of other witnesses Frank Alexander and Malcolm Greenridge - which makes you wonder just how much effort did police put into this case?<p>Not just providing the facts, Scott also presents the many possible motives and turns heads to several known suspects. An interesting read, showing you not only a violent, but tragic story about a young man who lived hard and fast all the way to the end. With information on Tupac's background and other events related to him and his murder, you get to know about the man as well as the musician, with additional comments made by various writers - Kevin Powell, Michael Eric Dyson - and those who knew him well - Jasmine Guy, Suge Knight, a moving letter from his Godfather and a final comment from his mother, Afeni Shakur. The book even uncovers the rapper's mystique - his obsession with death, the alive theories and many other strange coincidences.<p>'The Killing Of Tupac Shakur' is a revelation that will both shock and fascinate you in more ways then one. A must have for Tupac fans.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I place this book beside another three books on Tupac which I feel are must reads: [1] "Back in the Day" by Darrin Keith Bastfield, [2] "Holler if you hear me" by Michael Eric Dyson, and [3] "Got your back" by Frank Alexander. These three plus Cathy Scott's book paint a complete picture of his life and death. Cathy Scott's book is thoroughly researched but some facts that are commonly excepted as fact are expressed differently by her. It is evident in this book that she wishes she could talk about the investigation into Pac's death but the sad fact is that there is no investigation. Witness's refuse to cooperate and the incidents on the night of his death make the whole situation difficult for the police. Scott tries to circumvent this very hard but in the end she fails. The book also deals with the murders of Biggie, Orlando Anderson, Yafeu Fula and discusses how moronic the "he is alive" theories are as well. Very good book overall and a very quick read.</span>

                    <span>This book took me a short time to read cover to cover, while quite engrossing, it is also a very sad story.  I was very impressed with the simple, flowing way that this book unfolded the incidents around the killing of Tupac.  From his early days to his last, this book, touches on many aspects of his life as well as the detailed information surrounding his assassination.  Although a police reporter, Cathy Scott's information on this subject is quite detailed, I would of liked to have heard from more eye witness accounts.  Her investigation into the speculation of Tupac being alive is quite thorough, i am still not totally convinced that he is not.  But's that's another story!</span>

                    <span>I've read many books on Tupac. Cathy Scott accounts several things that contradict what everyone else has already stated as fact. The only new thing, that everyone already didn't know, she brought to the table was the autopsy photo. Which being a big Tupac fan, I could have lived my entire life without seeing. It took me two hours to read this book. I want those two hours of my life back!!!!!!</span>
