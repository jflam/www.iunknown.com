                    <span>As a high school student with only a rudimentary understanding of economics, if even that, I found Adam Smith's book to be very informative. Having read it with great ignorance on the subject was able to learn a great deal about economic principles with more depth than "supply and demand dictate price". I found the ideas behind taxing to be simple but effective given their presentation as well as Smith's arguements for a free market economy. Reading this historical text has also helped placed into context his arguemnts against the mercantile system and the taxing of the American colonies because the depth that he goes into about said subjects is more than any history class that I have taken has allotted. For some the wording may seem dated or old or borring but for those who enjoy a more analytical style or writing, such as the style used in the translations of Roman philosophy texts, the writing style should not be a problem. The most intimidating aspect of this book is its size, an aspect which can easily be overcome if the reader finds the text engaging for the above reason. While I cannot say that it is a "must read" or a "required read" for an understanding of economics simply because of the ignorance which I still possess on the subject, I can say that it is an informative read that explains in depth, using cited examples, areas of economics that are easy to grasp if the reader enjoys the text. To conclude this, from my strictly ignorant (although less ignorant after reading this book) point of view, The Wealth of Nations is an informative and engaging book.</span>

                    <span>"The Wealth of Nations" is written in the manner of one fact following another.  It is in this way very much like "The Origin of Species".  It is sometimes said that Adam Smith invented the free market economy and capitalism.  This notion is absurd.  He no more invented capitalism than Newton invented gravity.  To people interested in economics the book will be 
<br />enjoyable, in part because it does not have all the graphs and 
<br />math.  I think many people simply interested in Human Nature will find "The Wealth of Nations" a key work.  As the Old Testament says "Money answers all things."  The understanding of money is necessary to undersatanding the world of today or of the past or of the future.  "The Wealth of Nations" gives a 
<br />fundamental look into a key part of the nature of man in the world.</span>

                    <span>The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.
<br />  
<br />  Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand). 
<br />  
<br />  It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.

                    <span>Adam Smith is considered a founding father of economic theory.<br>In the Wealth of Nations, he laid a foundation for the free market while at the same time explaining some of the problems<br>encountered by workers. He explained that all work had to be<br>highly organized in order to be productive. In addition, he<br>recognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion serves<br>as an important foundation for more modern patent practice.<br>He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of new<p>machinery. The author spoke of increased production as a<br>condition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From this<br>precept, he explained that the size of a market would dictate<br>the division of its constituent labor. For instance, a small<br>community in the suburbs might be serviced by a local <br>"General Store"; whereas, a county in a large city would be<br>serviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employees<br>and a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith's<br>time, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.<br>Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arriving<br>at a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing was<br>a function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,<br>the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labor<br>necessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.<br>For instance, the price of linen was a function of the labor<br>of the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overall<br>employer. The natural price varied with the price of component<br>parts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronic<br>appliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a function<br>of national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earn<br>more than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.<br>He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland who<br>had to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,<br>18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.<br>The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rates<br>hovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The government<br>could borrow at 2% in Holland.<p>Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:<br>o the ease or hardship to do work<p>Consider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting a<br>diamond is a precise process which requires extensive training<br>and expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was a<br>function of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanship <br>involved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.<p>o the difficulty and expense of learning a trade<br>A skilled surgeon required years of medical training and a<br>long apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.<p>o the constancy of employment<br>o the trust reposed in the workpeople<br>Consider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacation<br>to the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run the<br>entire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trust<br>reposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.<p>o probability of success or failure of the venture<br>Consider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The trip<br>was lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagaries<br>of nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,<br>a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take these<br>factors into consideration.<p>o the danger inherent in doing the work<br>Consider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.<br>The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,<br>workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.<p>Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the taking<br>of risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.<br>In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.<br>In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a single<br>cutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in length<p>Adam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to the<br>landowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the price<br>in the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased the<br>fertility of the land increased its value by implication.<br>Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigeration<br>did not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.<br>Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until the<br>famous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineering<br>sciences.<p>Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to the<br>country of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;<br>however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.<br>The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.<br>Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised the<br>value of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted business<br>and discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annual<p>produce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.<br>High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treaties<br>between countries helped local merchants to craft meaningful<br>trade sequences. Exports were encouraged .  The expense of<br>erecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on the<br>land and the proportion of yield from the crops.<br>Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to sell<br>overseas in order to assist them in making a profit and<br>defraying costs/risks.  This work is a classic in theoretical<br>and practical economics. It is a "must read" for economists,<br>historians, majors in government, financiers, investors,<br>literary buffs and a large constituency of academicians.</span>
