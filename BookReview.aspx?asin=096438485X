                    <span>Mr. Herman has accomplished what many strive and fail to achieve: An accurate and user friendly history of Videogames. From the abacus to the early X Box, the third edition of this masterwork covers important developements in videogame history, from the abacus to the X Box. Herman includes Focus-on areas which "focus on" important figures in the industry. The chapters are brilliantly laid out in years, all things organized. You never once feel lost! <br>I find myself refering to Phoenix daily, and it is probably the most often used book on my desk. <br>And the author himself is a very nice, sociable and intelligent man. I myself held correspondence with him in 2000, awaiting my copy of the third edition. Mine's autographed, and the autograph is in the style that only champions possess!</span>

                    <span>It's not everyday that you come across a book that tells the history of video games, truely starting at the begining. I have read other books on the video game history that pull a ton of information from Leonard Herman's "Phoenix". Some people might consider this book dry and iritating especially since they couldn't find any information to directy copy from it and paste into their point and click thesis. <br><br> I'll tell you one thing, this book might be a bit rough on the edges and untrimmed for the person who is used to buying top dollar... sellout books but this book covers more of the video game history than any you'll be digging up riding the coatails of the Nintendo/Sega/Playstation wave. "Phoenix" and "The First Quarter" have been the most insightful books about this topic anyone is ever going to find. They take slightly different approaches to the topic but cover an enourmous amount of ground in, what I consider, too short of a book. This thing could have gone on forever and I would have never put it down. <br><br> The best thing about Leonard Herman is that he will never finish this book. Right now on his websight you can pre-order your copy of the latest edition of this book and get the new included chapters, pictures and more. The man is a machine who will never end his quest for perfection and a total completion of the history of the video game. I even ordered his book "the ABC's to the VCS" a comrehensive and complete, albeit very unedited, book describing every game on the atari 2600, it goes way in depth regarding every game that any normal person could possible get their hands on and play, and that's a lot of games. Overall this book and it's author deserve a hundred stars for effort and incredible insight and the guts to attempt to piece the entire history together.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book for my thesis (about cost structures of the video game console industry) and did find quite a bit of useful information in terms of what systems were produced when, historical prices, etc.  However it was not a very entertaining read.  Also, the organizationm of the book, which is broken down by year, makes it hard to follow events that lasted multiple years. (lawsuits, product development cycles, etc.)  It's a decent book if you're doing research, or if you're a hard core video game history fanatic, but otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it.  A much better book is David Sheff's Game Over, although that only focuses on Nintendo.</span>

                    <span>This book is written repetitively in this pattern: which company has  released what model of a videogame at what price on which date.  In this  way, each chapter is composed of the events happened in one particular  year.  Then year after year, making up the whole book.  The author has not  bothered to hypothesize or made up his own viewpoint about the industry,  such as seldom attempt was made to explain the story behind how a company  came up with such and such a marketing strategy.  But, on the contrary, you  can sometimes find in the book, part of a story without an ending.  For  example, somewhere mentions a new company trying to get into the market  with a new product.  But then no mention of the company can be found later  in the book.  Whether the company has succeeded or failed?  No one knows.   All in all, the whole book was organized into such a collection of  fragmented and not cohesive facts that I have gained little insight about  the videogame industry from it.  You may not find it enjoyable if you are  looking for a book with a plot or storyline.  But if you are really  seriously about videogame, to consider it as a reference book, the book is  an informative data source.</span>

                    <span>Let me set the record straight. This is not an engaging story about the rise and fall of videogames. This is more a historical account of the rise and fall of videogames. Which is a good thing. Chock full of good, reliable  information, and broken down by year. This is a fast and enjoyable read,  with a great balance of wit and facts. If you can get your hands on a copy,  I highly suggest picking one up.</span>
