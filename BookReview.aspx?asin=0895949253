                    <span>Color Zone Therapy is a combination of two very powerful healing techniques: Zone Therapy and Color Therapy. Joseph Corvo, a master practitioner of Zone Therapy, has been a healer for more than thirty-seven years. Lilian Verner-Bonds is an internationally respected practitioner of Color Therapy. They combined their healing techniques into a powerful new therapy, which they present in Healing With Color Zone Therapy. Color Zone Therapy is a unique and simple system of treatment that can eliminate illness, pain and tiredness; help you look and feel younger; and enable you to meet life with energy, vigor and vitality." It treats the whole person, including emotional and spiritual aspects. Color Zone Therapy can be used with any conventional medical treatments that readers may already be using. The authors first explain each technique and how it works. They also provide detailed instructions so that readers can use each method for self-healing. The bulk of the book is devoted to "An A to Z of illnesses and their treatment" that enables readers to apply Zone Therapy and Color Therapy in combination to alleviate specific ailments. Readers are first advised to become aware of the causes of their ailment. This involves understanding how negative thoughts and attitudes affect health. They are then taught affirmations that will help them replace negativity with "positive permanent thinking replacement." Each disease has its own healing color and its own particular zone pressure points. "Zone Therapy uses physical stimulus, while Color Therapy works through more intangible stimuli, ie the emotions." The essence of the combined therapies is to tune into the healing color, repeat the affirmations, and apply pressure to the appropriate zones. The treatment is repeated daily for ten minutes each day. The final section of the book deals with the special problems of children, aging adults, and people dealing with grief. Healing With Color Zone Therapy is an essential reference for all those desiring to help their bodies heal in a natural and non-invasive way. Paper, 169 pp. -- Sandra I.
