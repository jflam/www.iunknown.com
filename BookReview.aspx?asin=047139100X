                    <span>I had to get this book because of college. It is a great book for anyone trying to understand basic concepts. It is very easy reading and keeps you interested. I would not recommend it for anyone who has a good understanding of communcations and networking.</span>

                    <span>It is rather surprising that this textbook is in iths 6th edition and that it is so full of misstatements and contradictions in almost every chapter. Chapter 6 is probably the worst. I am teaching from this text at a community college as an adjunct, and hence I had no input into the choice of this book. I am constantly having to type up lists of corrections to hand out to my students! Some of the errors are frankly laughable. Also, the authors do not provide an "errata" list on the Web page for this book (at Wiley Publishers), like so many authors do nowadays, recognizing the probability of errors in a textbook like this on a complicated subject.<P>Now, upon very close reading, I can see how so much contradictory information got into this book: There were two authors who worked on different chapters and/or sections, but they did not work closely with each other to keep from contradicting each other. The editors did a poor job in recognizing contraditions. And it seems that no one worked on providing continuity in the textbook. In the Preface, the authors thank their reviewers for their assistance, but they openly admit that this was done "often under short deadlines".<P>The worst mistake in the entire textbook is Chapter Eight (page 237), where they state: "Second, unlike bridges, switches don't learn addresses; switches need to have addresses defined explicitly." (They are speaking of switches that are used in LANs.) As we should well know, this kind of switch learns its address table, just as a bridge does. Could it be that the authors have confused a regular (Layer 2) switch with a Layer 3 switch?<P>Here is a key concept that it not presented well: There is poor coverage in this textbook about how data packets are sent from one protocol layer to the next by adding/removing headers and trailers to the data packet, and leaving what was given to them otherwise unchanged. <P>There are frequently concepts that are used without being clearly defined or explained. For example, it is very difficult to find out about packets or packet-switching. Shouldn't this important topic be explained in Chapter 1 or Chapter 2?<P>Anyway, I do not recommend this textbook at all, and I have selected a better one for the next semester. Interesting thing is that this is a textbook that was poor in the second edition, but the new third edition is an Order of Magnitude improvement over the previous one.</span>

                    <span>The layout of this book could have used some work, and I understand the later editions do a better job, but it nevertheless provided a foundation of networking and datacomm principles. The material is out of date, so since there is a newer edition out, I would recommend it over this edition.</span>

                    <span>Well, I must confess... I wrote my first review BEFORE reading any other reviews. Wow - after reading the others, I started thinking "I MUST HAVE BEEN READING A DIFFERENT BOOK!" Well, that is exactly the story. My review is of the 7th edition and I specifically went looking for the grammatical errors and the packet-switching complaints and all the other complaints, one-by-one. You know what? HOOEY!! All the problems others speak of in the 6th edition have been corrected and improved upon! This is a good book! I liked Mr. Nagle's review and the only negatives he mentions were mere weaknesses that have been beefed up. So, I still say this is a book that you'll find useful if you read it. If you want to peruse it, looking for tips and tricks on setting up your own network, then I say this is NOT the book for you - I'd look for the networking for dummies. (I'm not trying to be flipant, either. Those books only have the tips of the icebergs and are great for perusing - kinda like a cliff's notes.)<P>I say you will like the improvements over whatever the 6th edition missed (or messed up).</span>

                    <span>I just finished a graduate course using this book as the textbook. At first I thought "Hmmmph - another OSI Layer book." What I learned is that it is very current, going into Blue tooth, Internet II, and all the latest Wireless protocols, too. Like consider the multiple Gigabit networking architectures, including optical and copper. This is "one for the shelf" of every do it your selfer wanting to learn and it reads like a "how to" manual that you'll use. Whether you want to learn, bone up, or be the one who has all the right vocabulary at the drinking fountain - this is a book you should give a chance to. It surprised me and I manage a significant IS dept. I think you will consider it a value-added addition to your library!</span>
