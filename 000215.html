<h3 class="title">I really like the guys at WholeTomato</h3>

<p><P>In my previous entry, <A href="Weblog/Ireallywishmoredevswouldm.html">I complained about some apps</A> that assumed that I would be running using a local administrator account. One of those apps was <A href="http://www.wholetomato.com">Visual Assist .NET</A>; fortunately, this story has a happy ending.</P><br />
<P>When I repaved my dev box, I installed the latest version of Visual Assist .NET (build 1081 at the time), an intellisense enhancement that I really can't live without. The folks at WholeTomato made quite a lot of improvements between that version and the previous version that I had installed on my computer (I believe it was build 1035). One of their improvements was caching their C++ parse results. Unfortunately, they wrote the cache to ... you guessed it ... \Program Files\Visual Assist .Net\...&nbsp; My workaround was to grant myself write access to the \Program Files\Visual Assist .Net\ directory, which let me continue with my work. </P><br />
<P>I emailed the folks at WholeTomato about this problem, and within <EM>less than two weeks</EM>, they had incorporated a fix into their latest build (currently 1085). That's great support, guys. Thanks!</P></p>

<p>What was their fix, anyway?</p>

<p>They no longer write their parse cache to Program FilesVisual Assist .Net. Instead they write to where $temp points to - which is in Documents and SettingsuserLocal Settingstemp.</p>

<p>That makes sense for their temporary cache files.  My real question is where to store user settings so I can (i) avoid the access programs with program files, and (2) find them for a clean uninstall?  Chris Sells suggested IsolatedStorage, but this would require considerable work for the uninstaller.  This security/clean uninstall issue is a dilemma.<br />

<p>Why not just use Application.UserAppDataPath in a WinForms app?</p>

<p>When my uninstaller uninstalls the appf or the machine, how will it find all the user settings to remove?  It could look for them, but which of the canned uninstaller packages do?<br />
"<br />
User preferences may be considered user data and left behind, <br />
but an option to do a completely clean removal should <br />
be included.<br />
"<br />

Thanks for thinking about this.  I never worried about the issue prior to your post about living as a non admin.  FWIW, I decided to tweak the permissions to a subfolder of Application.CommonAppDataPath, as per ...<br />
"<br />
CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA. <br />
This folder should be used for application data that is not user specific.<br />
For example, an application may store a spell check dictionary, a database<br />
of clip-art or a log file in the CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA folder. This<br />
information will not roam and is available to anyone using the computer. By<br />
default, this location is read-only for normal (non-admin, non-power) Users.<br />
If an application requires normal Users to have write access to an<br />
application specific subdirectory of CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA, then the<br />
application must explicitly modify the security on that sub-directory during<br />
application setup. The modified security must be documented in the Vendor<br />
Questionnaire. <br />

<p>Thanks for the pointers, Tim. I suspect I'll run into this problem soon enough once I start looking at the current state of install software. I hope I don't have to write my own ...</p>
