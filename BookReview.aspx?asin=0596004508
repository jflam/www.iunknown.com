                <span id="Label1"><I>Mac OS X: The Missing Manual</I> ranks among the best books to have at your side as you explore the latest Macintosh operating system as an everyday user who wants to get some work done, have a bit of fun, and feel part of the Mac community. David Pogue--a respected Mac authority and longtime author on the subject--is the perfect guide on such a quest, as his Mac knowledge is profound and his ability to explain facts and procedures considerable. The second edition of this popular book covers Mac OS X 10.2 and all of its many new features, including Sherlock 3, iCal, iSync, and firewalling. There's coverage of .Mac online services, as well.<p>Pogue writes really well, so his prose is a treat to read and most readers will appreciate his occasional page-long straight prose passages. More often, though, the wisdom in this book comes in the form of annotated procedures and bulleted lists, as well as notes and tips. There are also two highly handy "Where'd It Go?" glossaries: one for longtime Mac users (this one answers such questions as where the Apple Extras folder is) and one for Windows users (to explain, for example, the equivalent of Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the Mac). Unlike most books about Mac OS X, this one explores its  UNIX-like underpinnings (the Apple implementation is called Darwin) pretty thoroughly. However, based on the logic that if you wanted to use UNIX, you would, Pogue emphasizes the traditional, graphical Mac interface over the Terminal window. If you want an in-depth treatment of Darwin and know something about UNIX already, have a look at <I>Mac OS X for Unix Geeks</I>. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to use Mac OS X 10.2 and its immediate predecessors. This is a user-level book, concerned with managing files, folders, media, users, and hardware. Lots of attention goes to the operating system's special features, including the "i" series of applications and the .Mac online services.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book to help me switch from Winduhs. It's a lotta words and I later read in his New York Times column that he "types" by dictation into .. I think Dragon Naturally Speaking on a Winduhs based machine (uh hu). The book's contents could have been cut down to less than a hundred pages-- but these books are sold by the kilo anyway. He didn't really know the OS he just banged out a quick book to earn a  yep a quick buck. I read his "consumer" columns in the NYtimes and find them useful but this book wasn't. Oh yeah and the switch ...... to Mac .... over rated but OK. </span>

It even gives you great tips that will increase your productivity. I used a coupon from UnderTag.com, so it was almost free for me too.</span>

                    <span>I'm a long, long time user of Macintosh computers that finally migrated from OS 9 to OS X (10.2.6) about a year ago.  A great OS, stable, feature-filled, and visually attractive but oh so different from the old Mac operating systems!  This manual has paid for itself many times over in the last year that I've used it.  It's sheer size is daunting but Pogue writes so clearly and the book is so well organized that it is a great resource for both beginners and experienced users. I tried the more basic guides first but they seemed "too cute" or too abbreviated for my taste.  I recommend this manual  without reservation.</span>

                    <span>As a new mac convert who switched from the pc, the mac OS is a totally different environment. I ordered 7 mac books before my new iMac arrived and this is the one along with"Teach Yourself Visually Mac Os Xv.10.3 Panther" that I am able to obtain the most helpful info and answers to my questions from.I am very pleased with both of these books for their thoroughness and ease of use. A mac newbie won't go wrong with both of them(which I recommend),and you will find yourself referring back to them over and over so I suggest you keep them in the vicinity of your computer area!</span>

                    <span>Apple simply doesn't include a manual with their computers. The whole "Help" thing is better than it used to be, but it is still a JOKE if you need real help with something complicated. David Pogue is not exaggerating with his title. You need this book, especially now that OS ten has landed, and taken over. Just get this book when you get your new apple and get it over with, you will save yourself a world of grief. Just do it!</span>
