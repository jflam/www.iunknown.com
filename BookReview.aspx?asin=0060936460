                <span id="Label1"><p>Virginia Woolf introduced us to the &#147;Angel in the House&#148;, now prepare to meet... <i>The Bitch In the House</i>.</p><p>Women today have more choices than at any time in history, yet many smart, ambitious, contemporary women are finding themselves angry, dissatisfied, stressed out. Why are they dissatisfied? And what do they really want? These questions form the premise of this passionate, provocative, funny, searingly honest collection of original essays in which twenty-six women writers&#151;ranging in age from twenty-four to sixty-five, single and childless or married with children or four times divorced&#151;invite readers into their lives, minds, and bedrooms to talk about the choices they&#146;ve made, what&#146;s working, and what&#146;s not.</p><p>With wit and humor, in prose as poetic and powerful as it is blunt and dead-on, these intriguing women offer details of their lives that they&#146;ve never publicly revealed before, candidly sounding off on:</p><p>&#149; The difficult decisions and compromises of living with lovers, marrying, staying single and having children  </p><p>&#149; The perpetual tug of war between love and work, family and career</p><p>&#149; The struggle to simultaneously care for ailing parents and a young family</p><p>&#149; The myth of co-parenting</p><p>&#149; Dealing with helpless mates and needy toddlers</p><p>&#149; The constrictions of traditional women&#146;s roles as well as the cliches of feminism  </p><p>&#149; Anger at laid-back live-in lovers content to live off a hardworking woman&#146;s checkbook </p><p>&#149; Anger at being criticized for one&#146;s weight </p><p>&#149; Anger directed at their mothers, right and wrong</p><p>&#149; And&#150;well&#150;more anger...</p><p>&#147;This book was born out of anger,&#148; begins Cathi Hanauer, but the end result is an intimate sharing of experience that will move, amuse, and enlighten.  The Bitch in the House  is a perfect companion for your students as they plot a course through the many voices of modern feminism.  This is the sound of the collective voice of successful women today-in all their anger, grace, and glory.  </p><p>From The Bitch In the House:  </p><p>&#147;I believed myself to be a feminist, and I vowed never to fall into the same trap of domestic boredom and servitude that I saw my mother as being fully entrenched in; never to settle for a life that was, as I saw it, lacking independence, authority, and respect.&#148;&#150;E.S. Maduro, page 5  </p><p>&#147;Here are a few things people have said about me at the office: &#145;You&#146;re unflappable.&#146; &#145;Are you ever in a bad mood?&#146; Here are things people&#151;okay, the members of my family&#151;have said about me at home: &#145;&#145;Mommy is always grumpy.&#146; &#145;Why are you so tense?&#146; &#145;You&#146;re too mean to live in this house and I want you to go back to work for the rest of your life!&#146;&#148;&#150;Kristin van Ogtrop, page 161</p><p>&#147;I didn&#146;t want to be a bad mother I wanted to be my mother-safe, protective, rational, calm-without giving up all my anger, because my anger fueled me.&#148; &#150; Elissa Schappell, page 195</p></span>

                    <span>I was enthralled when I started this book of reflections by female writers on love, marriage, sex, and motherhood but towards the end it did become tiresome, as another reviewer said. It was just more of the same. No one was truly happy giving up the single life for a shared one with a man; the womqn, despite her best intentions, always became "the wife" and an unequal partner. The one woman who had a husband who was truly fully engaged in fatherhood jealously competed with him for the child's attention. <BR>Another failing was that all the women are fairly young with very young children. I wanted to see the same reflection from the perspective of older women whose children are grown and establishing their own lives. I daresay the stories would be quite a bit different when the authors are not so immersed in the experiences about which they are writing.<BR>If I had read this book while still single, I would have found the stories of women feeling so trapped in expectations quite depressing.</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of first-person essays in the beginning, but as I read more I found, as several other readers seem to have found, that these women's experiences were too similar to enjoy reading over and over. There is not much diversity of culture, race or age. Still, I did enjoy the humor and the sharing, and thought the writing was very good. Ultimately I did realize that I am not as angry, not as bitter, not as disappointed as these authors, though I did enjoy the writing, and would recommend it to others.</span>

                    <span>All these essays are fairly interchangeable. All the women seem to be white professionals, all left-leaning academics/writers griping about their complicated lives. There's a sameness to all their narratives; even the one by Ellen Gilchrist, a writer I admire, is suprisingly flat. No humor, no variety, no lightness of touch anywhere--just the self-absorbed ruminations of spoiled, earnest women who've bought the line that they can,and deserve, to have it all.</span>

                    <span>This book sounded like it would be terrific -- women talking about things women tend not to discuss. However, it wasn't at all what I expected. The contributors are mainly upper-middle-class magazine writers, which means that the pieces all tend to sound the same, and have a real feeling of entitlement. Too, there are almost no older women/women of color/etc. <P>I actually preferred THE BASTARD ON THE COUCH, because the men seemed a lot more dimensional than their wives (if as shallow).</span>
