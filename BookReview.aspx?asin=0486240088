                    <span>This is another collection of celebrity photographs from the John Kobal collection. This time the focus is on the stars of the 1950's. Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Doris Day, Gina Lollobrigida, Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren are just a few included in this collection. Also included are stars that were primarily from the 1930's and 1940's that managed to maintain their star status. They include Marlene Dietrich, Vivien Leigh, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth and Gene Tierney. There are also a few pictures from 1949 as well as from 1960. While the photographs are nice, the elegance, sophistication and glamour that were trademarks of 1930's and 1940's Hollywood photography is clearly missing. That's not to say the photographers that photographed these stars didn't produce high quality work, it's just that Hollywood and the country as a whole were changing and becoming more casual and these photographs reflect that. If you're more interested in photographs from Hollywood's earlier decades I highly recommend "Hollywood Glamor Portraits: 150 Photos of Stars, 1926-1949" and "Movie Star Portraits of the Forties: 163 Glamour Photos" both are by John Kobal and feature Hollywood glamour photography at its very best!</span>

                    <span>When I first saw this book I was relunctant because I figured it would be almost entirely made up of Marilyn Monroe pictures. After getting the companion book about the forties, I went for it and was pleasantly surprised. Of course there's Marilyn but there is also other stars from the 50s. Everyone from Ava to Liz to Rita. There's also Brando to Dean and Bogart & Gable. The only one I could think of is missing is Gene Kelly. The text though makes you wonder why the author did this book since the 50s is clearly not his favorite decade calling it dull. Besides that the photos are great! If you like the stars from the 50s go for this book!</span>
