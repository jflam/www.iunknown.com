                <span id="Label1">Learning by doing is always good, especially if you have good role  models to follow. As part of the publisher's "Showing It" series, this book  brings together 19 of the most innovative designers who are working in motion  graphics, and gives them lots of page room to talk about their work in general,  their inspirations (movies, games, etc.), and how they created some of their  best projects. Some of the best-known participating artists include Tomasz  Jankowski of Mondo.com, Todd Purgason of Juxt Interactive, Eric Jordan of  2advanced.com, and Irene Chan of Eneri.net.<p>  Following along is easy; large screen shots and step-by-step narratives guide  readers through each process--often telling not just how to do a particular  something, but also why. How you then apply these methods to your own work might  not be spelled out, but by re-creating the projects you'll gain the confidence  and experience that you need to push your skills to the next level.<p>  Projects range from thevoid's fairly basic, tween-heavy ripple animation to an  interactive menu that's driven by dynamic ActionScripting from James Paterson of  presstube.com. Simple text effects are covered, too, along with an introduction  to ActionScripts, 3-D animation using only Flash, ActionScripting and Swift 3D,  deciding between bitmap and vector art, discussions of download time,  integration of Photoshop and Director, and many other topics. All project files  are included on the companion CD-ROM, along with some extras.<p>  This is a great addition to the Flash library, but the book unfortunately gives  off an overpowering ink smell. The layout of the chapters is sometimes  confusing, too. Neither of these issues applies to the CD-ROM, however, which  reproduces everything in the book in animated form. All you have to do is sit  back and watch. And there are some great interview movies, through which you can  get to know some of the personal motivations and philosophies of favorite Flash  gurus. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><br>Profiles of 19 designers who work in Flash, with  illustrations of their work and influences<p>  Basic and advanced instruction in Flash, including the following:<br><p> <ul> <li>Tween animation <li>Simple, intermediate, and advanced ActionScripting <li>Interactive menus <li>Coordinating multiple movie clips and timelines <li>Integrating Photoshop and Director <li>3-D animation <li>Using sound </ul></span>

                    <span>This book presents some beautiful applications of the Flash product.  However, you will not be able to duplicate their results based on the brief explanations of how they were accomplished, unless you are quite advanced yourself.  More than half of the fla source files are not included on the CD-ROM, only the final swf product.</span>

                    <span>This is not for the beginners, and as an advanced actionscripter myself, I gained nothing. Maybe the intermediate will learn a few things or two about duplicating movies and if-else statements, but not much more. You will know how to recreate some tired and highly copied visual effects though, something you could of grabbed from the many flash resources online, and for free. But of course, knowing and understanding is two very different things. Actionscripting is a powerful language; if you don't understand at the basic level what certain commands do, you are going to have to be happy grabbing other people's scripts and editing them to your liking, which won't take you far at all. Plus flash is a heck of a lot more than just eye candy. So the basic point is, don't think of this book as a tutorial.</span>

                    <span>No, this isn't a "how to use the flash app" book, there's plenty of good ones out there for that (I found the "Teach yourself flash 5 in 24 hours" remarkably better than I had expected for this).<p>The "new masters" book is an excellent full color wide page design concept book, to give intermediate/experienced users some new ideas and insights to build on.  <p>In this it does an excellent job.  It's one thing to go to a website (I like flashkit) and see the 'cool sites' examples, it's more useful to read this kind of book, which gives you the original designers insights, tutorials, and even a half dozen interview movies, along with source flas' for many of the projects. <p>So, it's more than worth the price of a PS2 game :) and I found it to be useful.  I'm glad I didn't let the "but it doesnt explain how to code actionscript" neg reviews keep me from buying it.<p>I paid full price at a local bookstore, wish I had bought it here on amazon instead :o<p>Good book, worth getting for the intermediate+ level flash designer.  Not for newbies.   And, they tell you this.</span>

                    <span>They could well be the masters but as far as you and me, we won't be from reading this book. To me, there is only about 30% of content really worth reading and learning. Everything else is just plain useless towards the above average designers. Beginners will find quite a few good, eye popping, "wow" sort instant effect. But with lack of a certain level of art direction in the book, you still can't design a good Flash, and I have seen the effect on some people's site already (like a poorly mixed Ministry of Sound CD). Joshua Davis is one talented Flash creator, but unfortunately he only contributed so little at the end of the book,... And the CD is just okay.</span>
