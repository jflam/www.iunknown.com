                    <span>Flying for Peanuts by Marty Thompson is a clever and humorous little book that provides the traveler with the ABC's of Flying Southwest Airlines.  One of the most profitable airlines, Southwest treats its customers with fun and comedy, while cutting out the frills.  If you have never flown Southwest, you'll find this book fun to read in preparation for your first flight with that carrier.  If you are already a loyal Southwest customer, you'll find the book fun and familiar and you'll learn about the little lady named Irma who was the first commercial airline stewardess in 1922 and who helped form the customer service policy that works so well for the airline. This book is a manual telling any business owner how to establish successful customer service that allows the customer to choose his/her level of service and helps the workers and customers both find fun in the workplace.  The book is a tribute to all Irma's astute observations taught the industry, making each trip on Southwest Airlines a fun and memorable laugh-in.</span>

                    <span>I should have read this book BEFORE my recent trip on Southwest.  I actually saw many of the shennanigans Marty describes with such classy humor.  It made me wonder just how many of them he had pulled on me as the middle person to his aisle seat.  The book makes flying Southwest more fun.</span>

                    <span>I received this manual as a gift from my Dad. My friends and family know me to be an adrenaline junky who chooses the thrill of flying Southwest. Dont give me those fancy lah-de-dah airlines with their comfortable seats and routine plane maintenance. The thrill is somewhere between parachuting and bungee jumping! So when I received this guide to Southwest I thought, 'what is this sh#t!'. But let me tell you - it is AWESOME, baby! This guy is tighrope walking that fine line between insanity and genius. (Maybe more towards the insanity part). He has developed techniques to get on the plane first, get the best seats, free drinks, controlling the arm-rest and the holy grail of flying - GETTING A ROW TO YOURSELF. You have got to read this thing before it gets corrupted when they make it into a movie.</span>
