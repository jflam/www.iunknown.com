                <span id="Label1">Microsoft&#146;s Component Object Model is one of the most important concepts in software development today. Developer&#146;s Workshop to COM and ATL 3.0 provides an in-depth treatment of COM and shows how to adopt a component framework, namely ATL, to help lessen the burden of repetitive code. Every chapter contains integrated lab assignments that give you numerous opportunities to build COM clients and servers using raw C++ and IDL, as well as the Active Template Library.  <P>The book is divided into five sections, each focusing on a particular aspect of COM and ATL development. The book begins with a review of object-oriented and interface-based programming techniques, then moves into the core aspects of COM, including a full examination of language independence and location transparency. The author illustrates the numerous CASE tools used during ATL development and discusses apartments, COM exceptions, object identity, and component housing, in addition to various advanced concepts such as COM categories and tear-off interfaces. The fourth section examines a number of &#147;COM patterns&#148; such as enumerators, collections, scriptable objects, and callback interfaces. The book closes with an investigation of using ATL as a windowing framework and wraps up with the development of a full-blown animated ActiveX control using ATL.  <P>The companion CD contains full source code for all the labs, along with the official COM and DCOM white papers.</span>

                    <span>Mostly I just wanted to register my 5 stars for this book. It is hands down the most useful ATL book that I have ever seen and I have spent over three years looking. This book is the perfect engineers guide to ATL. It tells you how to be a COM ATL programmer. It explains all of the the most basic things that you need to know about COM and ATL programming and it does so clearly and efficiently. It then moves on to cover intermediate and advanced topics equally as well. You don't have to wade through endless chapters on how COM and ATL work nor contrived Active-X control examples... just real COM ATL as you will practice it every day. If I had to try and explain what is different about this book I would say that this book presents COM and ATL not as some abstract technology or disorganized bucket of functions but more as a programming language. Remember the first book you read on C++. This is class. This is how you create a class. This is a method. This is how you create a method. This is an exception. This is how you use exceptions. This book takes the same no non-sense approach. This is ATL. This is how you use ATL.</span>

                    <span>I've had the [mis]fortune to have bought or read over almost every COM and ATL book out there, and have been disappointed time and again. <P>What usually happens is that the explanations are simply too thin for the meaty subject matter of COM and ATL. A typical problem is that macros are referred to without explanation, talk about BSTRings and smart pointers fly left and right, all with the assumption that the reader must have a built-in familiarity with the subjects. <P>Not to hammer these other authors, since the subject is quite difficult to get a grasp on and explain, but I'd just about given up on finding a cogent explanation on COM and ATL which I could use.<P>Then I came across this book and Tom Armstrong's "ATL Developer's Guide". They're the only two books I can reccomend for any COM/ATL beginner. Personally, I feel this book is the better of the two, as the lab discussions and explanations Mr. Troelsen provides really help walk the reader through some difficult parts. It's a good read, and about subjects on which he could have easily lost the reader. Quite the balancing act.<P>If you're starting out in COM and ATL, you'll certainly want this book. I'd also reccomend "ATL Developer's Guide" as a sort of second-reference, because it's also a good one. If you've only budgeted for one however, this is the keeper.</span>

                    <span>This book is perfect if you have some knowledge of C++ and OOD. In fact, chapter 1 is an excellent nutshell of OOD with C++. The book covers both the low-level detail, but quickly, and the high-level ATL view. Also, it doesn't get all wrapped up with OLE, MFC, and Windows programming.</span>

                    <span>This book is really well written and organized. Prior to reading this book, I always thought of COM as a magic. However, after reading 450 pages, I no longer think of COM as magic :-). Rather, I now fully understand the concepts behind it. COM is NOT dead yet. In order to fully understand COM+ and .NET remoting and component framework, one needs to fully understand what COM did (and is doing) for us.</span>

                    <span>If you have the time to study, I mean REALLY study, and time to do the examples from start to finish (I don't), and want to know how COM works under the hood, this is probably a good book. However, sorry, but I could care less about HOW things work under the hood, I just want them to work so I can concentrate on my application. It also jumps around too much, important things you really need to know to make ATL COM objects are scattered throughtout the book (thank goodness it has a good index).</span>
