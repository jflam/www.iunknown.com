                    <span>I must be getting old...all the guys who were playing basketball when I was in college are now coaches! I was a college classmate of one of the coaches profiled in this book, so from that perspective I found it interesting, but not terribly well-written. This is really two books in one. First, Curtis profiles the "inside stories" of the coaches and teams at Iowa, Illinois, Notre Dame, and UCLA. But then, he drops in all sorts of little essays on the state of the college game today: how recruiting works, how coaches really make all their money, how influential Dick Vitale is, how the coaches network among themselves to recommend each other for jobs. Each of these could have been a decent book; both together is just a little too much. There also were a number of spelling errors and a few factual errors.</span>

                    <span>Some very interesting material told in mundane & uninspiring fashion. Either he had his facts wrong or there was sloppy editting on some occasions. Some of the sidebar explanations of refereeing and recruiting covered ground that has been covered by a variety of authors in much better fashion. We learned about the four coaches, but there was never a real emotional attachment for the most part. College hoops junkies will like it, but as another reviewer mentioned, I would definitely recommend John Feinstein's a "Season Inside", "A March to Madness" and "The Last Amateurs". Perhaps the first for insight into Alford, but I would recommend the last two the most . Especially in "The Last Amateurs" I believe that a reader will gain much more emotional attachment to the players & coaches.<P>If this book caused a reader to break up with a girlfriend... the girlfriend may be better off!</span>

                    <span>potential due to poor execution.<P>This is a great topic to cover but alas John Feinstein has already done this with a "Season Inside", "A March to Madness" and "The Last Amateurs" and done it a lot better.<P>Curtis never really dug deep into his subjects or explored the "Why" or the "If". He stuck more to the "What" and even then seemed to be off on several facts........P>All in all......a disappointing read.</span>

                    <span>This was a really terrific read. The anecdotes about players, coaches, recruiters, officials, and sports reporters are all interesting and some really funny. It's a pretty big book but it reads very fast. The politics of college basketball, from race conflicts, to academics, to the often nasty seduction of recruits, opened my eyes in a big way to these issues that usually get only brief treatment from the media. The coaches that the author followed are pretty stunning characters. I had no idea of the extent of their day-to-day obligations, or their perks. I strongly recommend this book for anybody with even a causual interest in sports. What'll stick with me most for a long time are incredible individual and group moments of pain, and victory, and laugh-out-loud humor. Definitely a good book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great read, even for the not so avid basketball fan...the stories behind the story, the humanization of these high-powered coaches makes for fascinating reading...you need not have an in-depth knowledge of the game...Curtis relays many situations in which the coaches find themselves...It's unbelieveable how he had access to all this information and the insights one gets from this book is just amazing...After reading Curtis" book, I have a greater appreciation for the people connected to the game.</span>
