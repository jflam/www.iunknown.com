                    <span>This is great fun: A distinguished research mathematician, known (among other things) for the expository clarity of his writing, returns in his seventh decade to his "first love, baseball."  "Returns" is perhaps the wrong word. It is clear from his account of his gradeschool days, when he taught
<br />himself long division computing batting averages by flashlight under the covers at night, that Ken Ross' infatuation with our national pasttime has been steadfast and faithful.
<br />
<br />Cheerful and idiosyncratic, this book approaches in
<br />mathematical rigor the standards required of a formal college-level introduction to such topics as Bernoulli trials, betting strategies, correlation, expectation, odds, probability (including conditional probability), statistical significance, and strategies---all in the engaging context of anecdotes and data drawn from the world of baseball. Thus the book reads equally well from two perspectives: as a self-contained introduction to sophisticated mathematical concepts, motivated and spiced by carefully chosen anecdotes and examples from ``the real world" of professional sport; and as an extended focus on baseball itself, sprinkled with countless examples
<br />of how an appreciation of mathematics and statistics can enhance one's enjoyment of the game. (As a sporting
<br />enthusiast and a professional mathematician, I thought I knew about all there was to know about this interaction. But the day after reading Ross' book I happened to find myself in a Connecticut bar watching TV while the Yankees and the Red Sox beat up on each other yet again. The story line was familiar, but my eyes and ears were attuned as if to a new experience. New riches, subtleties and nuances were mine to appreciate, thanks to this stimulating book. Despite decades of first-hand
<br />experience, I found myself recollecting the question raised by
<br />Cole Porter in a very different context: ``How long has this been going on?")
<br />
<br />Amazon.com sent me this book for \$13.96 plus postage. That was money very well spent.

                    <span>This book is a waste of time. The title is VERY misleading (although the author is a mathematician and has gone to a ballpark), the chapter titles are very misleading and the book is 95% a textbook on teaching statistics and probability and 5% on their relationship to baseball. The subtitle of "odds and probabilities for baseball fans" should instead say "a textbook on odds and probabilities" (a good example is over 4 pages in the middle discussing statistics with respect to AIDS, after which he states "I apologize that the preceding examples aren't about baseball.")  As one with an engineering degree you might expect that I found the book somewhat interesting and easy to read - not so. And as one who over the last 16 years has spent a week each summer traveling around the country with 2 buddies (seeing baseball games in every major league stadium and about 50 minor league stadium and traveled 32,000 miles in 48 states in the process) you could imagine my interest in the topic. But after the first 25 pages touch somewhat on baseball, the next 112 are mostly statistical/probability theory. On page 137 he says "Finally, I return to baseball!" That is true but the baseball content barely goes from 5% to 25% for the final 30 pages. Skip this book and watch a game instead. The cost is about the same and you'll remember the game.</span>

                    <span>This book was horrible for what I expected.  Almost an entire chapter was dedicated to calculating BA, OBP, and SLG.  Come on!
<br />
<br />The author felt the need to spend an entire chapter on his mind-numbing strategy for betting on baseball games.  Bet when you think the true odds on a team are less than the actual odds.  Wow, that's ground breaking stuff!  Also, bet against the teams that have a large following and you will get better odds.  Ya think?

                    <span>The reader should be aware that this is not a book about baseball: It is a book about probability and statistics. A well written, engaging, relevant and approachable book about probability and statistics, and seen in this light, a very valuable book.
<br />
<br />Ross has created a book that will introduce any reader with a reasonable command of algebra to the key ideas of probability, odds-making and statistics. Unfortunately, Ross quickly discovers that his desire to use Baseball statistics as the primary motivation leads to a quadmire. Baseball outcomes are simply too complex: The pitcher, batter, ball-park, weather, time of day and game situation all have profound effects on the outcome of a particular at-bat. This leads Ross to focus just as much time on Roulette as he does on baseball.
<br />
<br />I don't fault him too much for this, though perhaps he should have used a less mis-leading title. On the positive side, this book contains all the precision and care that is missing from Aczel's "Chance," and the book is a great read. I intend to use it as a supplementary text in my senior level Algorithms course to introduce students who have not yet taken Statistics to the key ideas of probability.</span>

                    <span>Only about 20% of this book is about baseball.  If the author didn't have his own agenda, it could have been closer to 80 or 90%.    The best parts of the book are Appendix 1 (almost all SABR material) and the annotated bibliography.  A good idea squandered.</span>
