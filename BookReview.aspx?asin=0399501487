                    <span>I thought this was a horrible book.
<br />It is beautifully written, easy to read, and even real, to a certain extent. You only need to flip through a history book to see the horrible things people have done to other people. But to read about twelve year old boys killing each other is really sick. And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage. 
<br />My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.
<br />But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race. Anyway, that's what I got out of it. And I am glad I read it - if only to say that I read it and now sort of know what the fuss is all about.</span>

                    <span>This is, without doubt, one of the greatest books ever written. If you do not already own this book (presumably why your here) then you should buy it now. That's it. Right now.
<br />
<br />Still here?
<br />
<br />Ok. I suppose you probably want my reasons for reccomending this book, before just buying it on my word that it is good. The reasons are as follows:-
<br />
<br />1: Lord of the flies is original. And I mean actualy, properly  original. It does not try to compete against the high tech thrillers such as Jurrassic park, (also an amazing book by the way), or the fast pace thrills of the Da Vinci Code, (amazing again). It is not a horror book, or a romance, or a science fiction book. If I am forced into a situation where I have to classify this book, I call it a very, modern classic. It is one of those books that stays with you for the rest of your life. You will be able to remember every little plot twist for years to come.
<br />
<br />2: It is a beautifully crafted, highly relevant novel that acts as a window into the emotions of a child, as well as reflecting the behavior of the human race as a whole. In other words, it shows you what would actually happen if you dumped a load of kids onto an island in real life. There are no illogocal leaps here. Everything flows, everythiing works, everything is stunningly real. It is this that makes the book as terrifying, and as haunting as any I have ever read.
<br />
<br />3: It's good for all ages and all audiences. Well, all ages that can read. Basicaly it is fine for anyone who could read and understand Harry Potter. It is terrifying, but not in the way that induces nightmares. It has action in it, but it is not entirely based around car chases. It is not hugely fast paced, because you will be hooked enough to read it at a slow pace. It will make you think about/complain about/reflect on life.It is not a romance. But I would say that the character relationships in it are the most important part of the book. (In case you're wondering, this is not something I usualy say, and character relationships are not usually what drives me to buy a book. But in this case... just buy the book and see for yourself.)
<br />
<br />4: It has everything, all written in a style that not so much leaves you wanting more, as leaves you wanting to get other people to read the book, while you read it again. It has a good plot, characters, location, suspence, anything else you can think of.
<br />
<br />5: If you still don't want to buy it, buy it for a friend, (any friend, it doesn't matter, if they can read it they'll like it), and then take thier word for how good it is. They'll just get to read it before you do, thats all.
<br />
<br />So, this is one of my favourite books ever, number 1 is possible, and it won a nobel prize for literature. So now that you know my opinion go and buy the book.
<br />
<br />Bought it yet?</span>

                    <span>One of the greatest books I have ever read and the best William Golding has written has to be by far The Lord of The Flies. This superbly written book has an extremely simple basis, which is human nature. William Golding illustrates human nature through words by telling the story of a group of schoolboys who crash land on a deserted island. At first the boys get along electing democratically a leader. The leader being Ralph who symbolizes everything good and righteous. Slowly however things on the island begin changing as human nature and a power hungry boy takes over.
<br />	The power hungry boy is named Jack who symbolizes evil and in my mind Nazi Germany. He slowly by force takes over Ralph, Piggy, and the rest of the weaker part of the group. This group could possibly symbolize the Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Jack and his band of strong classmates oppress and put down the weaker bunch continually. Slowly they become more and more physical until fights break out and two distinct groups are formed. 
<br />	One group headed by Ralph was the weaker group and the other headed by Jack was the stronger group. Eventually, Simon a boy who was for peace and not dividing was "sacrificed" by Jack's group and total war broke out until Piggy had been killed and everyone else on Ralph's side fled to Jack's. Ralph alone and scared was hunted like an animal by Jack's band of hunters. The forest catches ablaze and Jack is on Ralph's heels with a spear in hand but what will happen next? You must read the book to find out!
<br />	This book is one of my personal favorites because of the immense amount of symbolism and hidden meanings. The characters can take on different groups in history and play out exactly what happened in those situations just like the one I provided about Nazi Germany. Another reason I adore this book is because of it's cold and raw reality about human nature and the scary fact that the school boys in the story could one day be anyone of us.

                    </div>
                    <span>In the Lord of the Flies, William Golding reveals his pessimistic (and I would say accurate) view of human nature.  As everyone must know, the book depicts a group of schoolboys marooned on a tropical island, where in the absence of an overbearing state they soon fall into the "nasty, brutish, and short" existence predicted by Thomas Hobbes and many other political philosophers.
<br />
<br />This is a wonderful premise for a novel, but Golding's treatment of it is pedestrian and there is little here that is surprising or entertaining.  On the first page, we meet a fat boy with glasses.  He's obviously doomed.  On the fourth page, we read that another boy has "a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil."  So we know he's not going to be at the top of the food chain, either.  And so on.
<br />
<br />Admittedly, part of the problem may be that the book has been so widely read and discussed.  Supposing that this book may have more to offer someone who is not already familiar with its theme, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and three stars.

                    </div>
                    <span>Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books ever. The story is awsome and it has a great message. Every one of the boys reminded me of someone I've met in my life. I've met people who are similur to Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Simon, Roger, Sam n Eric, and even some of the minor characters. I even found myself getting attached to some of the characters. I loved Simon, and just about every scene he was in I found myself thinking "Awe, you're so cute!" And I cried when I found out what was to happen to him. I felt bad for Piggy and I wanted to yell at the other boys to stop picking on him. I liked Ralph, he acted like a lot of twelve year old boys I know. Samneric cracked me up a few times. Jack also acted like a lot of twelve year olds I know. I even liked Roger, he made a good sadistic evil character, but I wouldn't want to be stuck in an elevator with him.
<br />
<br />Over all, I thought this was a great book. It had a powerful chilling message. There was a lot of symbolism, but not so much that it dragged the book down. And the author used the perfect amount of discription, enough so you get the feel of the envirnment, but not too much like taking ten pages to decribe a single leaf. I recommend this book to anyone. 
<br />
<br />There are also two movies out on this book. If you plan to watch one, watch the 1963 version. It's in black and white but it follows the book. The 1990 version doesn't even feel like Lord of the Flies at times.</span>
