                    <span>Why the vituperative reviews for what is intended as a concise but accurate psychological treatment of a historical figure?
<br />
<br />Napoleon has been much romantacized.  As Johnson states, more books have been written about Napoleon than any other historical figure except Jesus Christ.
<br />
<br />I had always thought of Napoleon as the brief restorer of France's glory after the devastation of the French Revolution.  Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo ended what would have been France's return to glory.  This books shows that Napoleon's brief reign in France consisted of very thin soup.  Contrary to some of the negative reviews, Johnson doesn't think everything Napoleon did was bad.  He quit persecuting the Catholic Church, restored some order to governing, and did not hold grudges.  He treated the army rather well.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, he bankrupted the country with endless military campaigns.  As soon as the money ran out, he would decide to attack another country.  There was no stabilty to the government because it depended financially upon the next military victory which inevitably quit coming.  Napoleon also established a secret police.  Bribery was rampant.
<br />
<br />Johnson rightly debunks the past attempts to romantacize Napoleon's relationships with women especially his first wife, Josephine.  There have been entire novels purportingly based upon Napoleon and Josephine's love life.  Very little is known about their actual life together except the bare facts. 
<br />
<br />I found this book easy to read and informative.

                    <span>This "biography" is so stuffed with sloppy inaccuracies that it's hard to know where to begin. To take two examples at either end: in Chapter 1 we are told that Bonaparte's brother Luicen became King of Holland! For Johnson's information, it was Louis. Final chapter: we're informed that while on St Helena Napoleon befriended the young Betsy Briars. Her name was Betsy Balcombe -"The Briars" was the name of her father's house. To carry on listing all such factual errors would require too much time and space for a book so little deserving in either. Johnson is a die-hard British snob who is determined to debunk Napoleon at all costs, including historical accuracy. </span>

                    <span>Paul Johnson has written many bad books, but this one tops them all. He says he wants to refute the notion that "great forces" rule the history. What he really hates about Napoleon is the fact that he was French. Johnson has spent the last thirty years worshiping the British Empire and in this book he attacks Napoleon for conquering other peoples. Pure hypocrisy and utter waste of time from a bitter old man.</span>

                    <span>My reasons for choosing this book:  my world history background is weak, I wanted to fill in a crucial gap; I did not want to spend several months on a steamer trunk of a biography; I am a fan of the Penguin Lives series; I have read Paul Johnson before and know him to be a fine stylist in content areas that many writers lay waste with stultifying prose.  I was not disappointed for the most part.
<br />
<br />Understandably, it is impossible to catch every fact, every nuance of Napoleon Bonaparte's life and ongoing contribution to history in just under 200 pages (one Victorian era writer dedicated 10 volumes to the man).  Johnson limns the environment of the Enlightenment and revolution that was sweeping the western world and connects the life in terms of its how, why and consequences.  He strikes a remarkable balance between the birds-eye view of Bonaparte sweeping through Europe and close-up personal sketches, the former conveying the formidably shrewd man of action, the latter revealing an often comic figure.  It is to Johnson's credit that he reconciles the two in one body.  
<br />
<br />Johnson is in no way forgiving of Bonaparte but he does invite wonder at how he rose up out of inauspicious beginnings, could seize a continent, only to make such glaring errors in strategy at Waterloo and ultimately die in exile on a distant island.  The autopsy report is a final ironic twist.
<br />
<br />Johnson is not without his biases, but I got very good information from him via bright, fluent prose.

                    <span>Written by the prolific British historian Paul Johnson, this small volume on Napoleon Bonaparte is part of the excellent new series of "Penguin Lives" which is a series of concise biographies of major historical figures written by distinguished writers.  "Napoleon" is not a hagiographical account of the famous French general's life.  Johnson is a historian who isn't afraid to make judgments and this account is one, which holds Bonaparte up to moral scrutiny and finds him responsible for the long series of wars that bear his name.  The hardships that the continent of Europe had to endure and the loss of millions of lives are laid at the doorstep of "Le Emperor's" tremendous ego.  Johnson clearly sees him as an opportunist who took advantage of the power vacuum left after the bloodletting of the French Revolution.  Napoleon, like many 20th century dictators recognized that revolutions provided an opportunity for those who were ruthless enough to seize power.  Johnson's Napoleon is a charismatic man but one who doesn't truly care for the men who won him glory and bore the brunt of his insatiable lust for power.  The author succeeds well at describing the battles and campaigns that made up Napoleon's life and as usual, he is particularly adept at sketching the character of Napoleon's generals and ministers.  The constant death and mayhem are enlivened by humorous anecdotes about Napoleon's love life, which was the subject of much ribaldry in the British Army, when they intercepted one of his love letters.  Johnson does give credit to a man who, after all, rose from nothing to attain great power.  As the Emperor of France, he did institute much needed reforms, some of which are still in place in the France of today, but more than anything, Paul Johnson sees Napoleon as a man who came out of the chaos of revolution to dominate an epoch and become a precussor to the bloody tyrants of the 20th Century - Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, Hussien - who each built their cult of personality on the Napoleonic model.
