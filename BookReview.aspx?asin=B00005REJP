                <span id="Label1">This is an enhanced edition of the HBR reprint R0109D, originally published in September 2001. HBR OnPoint articles save you time by enhancing an original Harvard Business Review article with an overview that draws out the main points and an annotated bibliography that points you to related resources. This enables you to scan, absorb, and share the management insights with others. If leadership, at its most basic, consists of getting things done through others, then persuasion is one of the leader's essential tools. Over the past several decades, experimental psychologists have learned which methods reliably lead people to concede, comply, or change. Their research shows that persuasion is governed by several principles that can be taught and applied. The first principle is that people are more likely to follow someone who is similar to them than someone who is not. Second, people are more willing to cooperate with those who are not only like them but who like them, as well. Third, experiments confirm the intuitive truth that people tend to treat you the way you treat them. Fourth, individuals are more likely to keep promises they make voluntarily and explicitly. Fifth, studies show that people really do defer to experts. Finally, people want more of a commodity when it's scarce; it follows, then, that exclusive information is more persuasive than widely available data.</span>

                    <span>This short article introduces you to six principles of effective and ethical influence. The principles were identified and researched by social scientists during the last half of the twentieth century. For that reason, this article might be aptly described as a compilation of important ideas in social psychology or social influence studies. That said, this article is more than just a compilation. It is a concise introduction to how the principles of social influence can be applied in your professional life. Along with Conger's "Necessary Art of Persuasion," I would consider this article a great introduction to workplace influence.<P>Some of the ideas may initially seem self-evident. People are more influenced by information that is scarce. People do defer to credible authority. Frame a favor as an exchange and people will "owe you one" in the future. As obvious as these principles may seem, many professionals miss key opportunities or moments for invoking the six principles. As a result we are less effective in the workplace than we might otherwise be.<P>A more detailed description of the six principles can be found in Dr. Cialdini's books. You will also find more examples in the books as well. But if I am working with clients or MBA students for only a very short time, I find this article makes an excellent introduction to important ideas. As Linda Hill at Harvard Business School reminds us in her book On Becoming A Manager, successful managers must learn how to exercise informal power. This article teaches exactly that.<P>Though I prefer the more detailed explanations in his books, this article is an excellent introduction. Obviously I am a big fan of Dr. Cialdini's work. I think you will be too if you give this article, or one of his books, a try.</span>

                    <span>Overall the book (if you can call it that) does offer what its supposed to and does that in an effective manner. It teaches you how to develop persuasion. The trouble though is it only gives you the most basic outline on just 11 pages. The information that is contained inside of it is something that has been available for years in other similiar books.</span>
