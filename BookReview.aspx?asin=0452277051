                <span id="Label1">When conservative President-elect MacArthur Foyle dies in a freak accident four days after the election, it seems as if the next leader of the United States will be his running mate, Ted Block, whose frequent verbal mishaps are no doubt intended to remind readers of some vice-presidential figure or other (wink, wink). But one electoral representative from Michigan, Dorothy Ledger, sets off a wild chain of events when she innocently asks about some procedural rules....<p>  Veteran TV political correspondent Jeff Greenfield has pulled off the seemingly impossible task of making one of the most arcane components of the American political system, the Electoral College, the center of a genuinely entertaining novel. Some of the fun, of course, stems from the "guess who" quality of many of the political characters, but the scrappy, improvised team assembled by Dorothy and her friends also provides much fun. </span>

                    <span>This was quite an interesting book.  One who critiques the setup of the novel may be infuriated.  This is not Cervantes or Dickens.  Jeff Greenfield is probably the best political analyist on T.V., and his insight provides a great story.  Twists and turns keep you inthralled.  I went from start to finish with this book on Memorial Day.  If you like politics and Constitutional loopholes, you'll love this book.</span>

                    <span>and in light of the fact that it was written and published before the 2000 Presidential Election/Fiasco, it seems amazingly prescient. I agree with those reviewers who say this book isn't the greatest work of literature, but it is nevertheless incredibly entertaining and informed about the wheels of politics and the ways in which they spin, all puns intended.</span>

                    <span>I heard about this book when Judy Woodruff commented about it while talking to Jeff on air on CNN during the 2000 election. So I finally picked up the audio version and gave it a listen all in one night. Four double sided tapes is a bit long, but it was an amusing listen.<p>Let me say that this was an excellent book. But...<p>My first complaint though right off was that Mr. Greenfield reads way too fast. Understandably he was the one who wrote it and therefore knew it nearly by heart. It had already sunken into his mind. But to me as he sped through scenery and other descriptions I couldn't get a hold of it in my mind. He was already on to the next paragraph.  Perhaps if it was not read by the author it would have been a better listen.<p>But the book itself seemed to be well written. The only problem I had with his style was that he seemed to put the 'heroes' into situations that were unrealistically impossible. Not just one or two. But seemingly every situation. The road blocks were immense and then he would proceed to write the characters out of the problem though yet another miraculous turn of events.<p>The very nature of the story was supposed to be unreal. But it seemed like every situation the 'heroes' of our story ran into tried to feel like they had no hope of escape.  Its used by many authors to portray a sense of excitement and drama. Especially when they are faced by these great odds and seem to triumph time and again. Real life just isn't that interesting. But this is fiction. :)<p>I was a little disappointed in the ending. I would have preferred to see perhaps the opposite candidate get in. I would have preferred to see the showdown they had talked about through the whole book. I would have even preferred to have seen perhaps a third party candidate involved in this some how just to spice things up.<p>All that aside, it was worth the money and its better than 99% of the other political garbage writing that is out there.<p>I highly recommend it. The ending, though not my preferred ending, was still a nice surprise. Who would have thought that he would show that kind of character?<p>In the end Mr Greenfield could never have guessed the actual level that real life politicians and deal makers would stoop to win the 2000 election. At least his characters followed the laws.</span>

                    <span>While covering Campaign 2000 late last October, I loaned this book to my boss, who started it... and then, after Election Day, was unable to finish it because Greenfield's imagined fiasco was too close to reality. (In fact, Greenfield said that what happened in the 2000 election put this book to shame.)<br>Greenfield is television's smartest and most knowledgable commentator about elections, and this comedic novel about the Electoral College -- imagining what might happen if, following the president-elect's death, the electors decided they did not want to make the vice president-elect president -- is full of great historical tidbits. Greenfield is at his best, and seems to be enjoying himself the most, where filling pages with anecdotes about electoral wrinkles in the past. That's where the book shines.<br>As for the story itself, it is a bit thin, and the ending is less than satisfying. But, especially with the renewed (but now-waning) interest in the Electoral College, this book is a fun read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I heard this book mentioned a number of times during that seemingly endless election we had not too long ago. I started out expecting yet another "political thriller"--Primary Colors left a bad taste in my mouth, and most other such books were spy novels disguised as political novels.<p>"The People's Choice" does suffer from some of those things that other political novels do. One glaring similarity is the number of characters used in the book. Nearly all political books feel the need to introduce dozens of characters, lest their campaign atmosphere seem inauthentic. TPC is no exception. No character is ever flushed out; before one is introduced, another one has to be rammed through so the author can get them all in. Greenfield is not alone in this; Primary Colors did it too.<p>Greenfield also suffers in his novel writing. One device I found particularly irritating was the sudden, if not exactly frequent, shifts from third to first person. They are cordoned off by chapter, thankfully, but some rather distracting "explanations and history lessons" are inadvertently added in. And, as other reviewers have pointed out, much of this info, and the dialogue from the characters, seems to be of the "hey! here's an interesting anecdote I learned in grad school! Let's work it in!" variety.<p>With all this, though, the book is pretty good. Admittedly, it gets better as you go along; the first chapter is appalingly bad; the second chapter is pretty good; and the third is excellent. Surprisingly, as the procedural mechanisms are slowly realized, the suspense gets better. It also has one of the most fun--if not believable--endings I've ever seen in such a book. <p>The book is done in fun, of course, but the facts are straight and presented nicely. It's obvious that Greenfield has an anti-electoral college bent, but it's not so overt as other reviewers have said; in fact, it's only directly touched on briefly at the end. The dialogue is fun, if not real-life, and the last third of the book is pretty fast-paced, interesting, and holds up with the best. If you can slog through the first chapter, the rest falls into place; it's worth it.</span>
