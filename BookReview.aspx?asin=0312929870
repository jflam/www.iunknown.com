                    <span>I bought Ray's book seeking insight into business and the personal qualities of a business man.  The book contains little business insight, but is a complete autobiography of one of the most successful enterpreneirs of the century.
<br />
<br />Ray Kroc told his story with honesty and enthusiasm, but I am not richer for it.  This surprised me, since I deeply believe in the virtues of individual opportunity, and Mr. Kroc lived his life by this creed.
<br />
<br />I was left cold by Mr. Kroc's single minded dedication to business during his entire life.  Maybe that is what it takes to succeed on the scale that he did, but it isn't something I would wish on somebody I cared about.
<br />
<br />Ray's story taught me to make sure that my search for wealth and success does not consume me.

                    <span>Ray Kroc was more than just a successful entrepeneur, he was a man with a vision. In Grinding It Out, that vision is clearly evident. If you want to succeed in virtually any field, read this book & pay attention to his approach & attitude. This is more than a business biography, it's a "how to" book.</span>

                    <span>This book is like McDonald's - not very nourishing or satisfying! While I loved reading about Mr. Kroc's upbeat attitude and how he became so successful, I don't think the book was very well-written. (I couldn't believe it was written by a former journalist for the Chicago Tribune!) Nevertheless, I found many inspirational quotes in the book, such as the homily that Mr. Kroc recites ... that not even education and talent can make you a success. You need persistence, for the world is full of people who had the other two but never went too far.</span>

                    <span>When it comes to business literature there are three kinds of writers:<p>1.	Those who did it and write about it: business owners and entrepreneurs<br>2.	Those who read about it: journalists, business books writers, and historians<br>3.	Thos who think about it: professors, researchers, and think tanks<p>Every single of has their own merit and contribution to the world of business history, but for me it is very important as a business professional to learn from the people who did it. What were they thinking? What where they feels? Why? <p>The other two kinds of writers can tall you what they did and how but they can never tell you why?<p>Which is why I recommend reading books like "Grinding It Out". <p>Even though most people might think that McDonald's was brought to the world by a family baring that name, it was Ray Kroc who found them in California and brought it to the billions of people worldwide. <p>In this book you make many discoveries as to the reason for McDonald's success. Why did they become number one in their category? What was Ray Kroc thinking and why he chose the path he walked. <p>I highly recommend this book instead of all of the other books about McDonald's because you the inside prospective from the person who did it all, but perhaps most importantly you get to know why!!!!</span>

                    <span>It is truly inspirational to read about a businessman succeeding by being perfectly moral.  Ray Kroc continuously focused on delivering positives instead of negatives.  He was way ahead of his time, realizing the power of the entrepreneurial spirit and how to harness that in a large corporation.</span>
