                    <span>While this may not be some of Ambrose's best work, it is never-the-less very good stuff.  As one reviewer pointed out, Ambrose is not only a pretty good historian, but he is an excellent teller of stories.  That is a good combination.  Ambrose writes popular historical books.  This is good.  With this collection of writings, and the many others of which he is responsible for, he has brought history to the general public, in a readable form, and not just let it molder in academic land.  This is a collection of Ambrose's writings.  It is not his more popular fist person interviews.  This is not a collection of essays, rather, it is little bits of this and that, addressing America's fighting men and women throughout the years.  He has done well here.  Recommend this one highly.  </span>

                    <span>This isn't really a book, or even an essay collection. Instead, the  publisher decided to put this out when Stephen Ambrose was at the height of his popularity. It's a collection of magazine articles and essays that Ambrose wrote over the course of about 30 years. Some are long and detailed (the first piece, on the Vicksburg campaign, is about 40 pages long, and 30+ years old) while others are much shorter, and some are very new. One (the piece on The Christmas bombing in Viet Nam) is a reprint from MHQ, the article there in turn excerpted from Ambrose's bio of Nixon.
<br />
<br />For those who aren't familiar with my opinions (which is probably most of you) Ambrose isn't my favorite historian by any stretch of the imagination. He started out a conventional narrative historian and biographer, but tended to run with whichever trend or fad the historical community thought was cool that year. Crazy Horse and Custer, for instance, spends some time comparing the toilet training practices of the societies the two men grew up in, with of course the expected inferiority of white society highlighted when compared with that of Native Americans. A few years later, oral history became the watchword, and Ambrose essentially hitched his horse to that wagon for the rest of his career, writing five or six books that relied on this medium most or all of the time.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, here we don't even get much oral history. These writings are mostly from the pre-oral history era of Ambrose's scholarship, and the newer pieces focus on historical pieces as opposed to oral history ones. As a result, we get opinions on such topics as George Custer (whom Ambrose despises; anyone who read Crazy Horse and Custer already knows that), MacArthur, Grant, Eisenhower (of course), and various other figures and topics from American military history. Some of the pieces are now essentially useless: one titled "The Cold War in Perspective" is so out of date now as to be a waste of one's time to read.
<br />
<br />That leaves us with some Ambrose opinions (many of them uninformed, at best) and a few pieces of good writing that cover topics you could probably find other material on. I wouldn't recommend this book to much of anyone, though there are a few pieces in it that someone might find worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>Ambrose was a prolific military historian and this book is a re-print of 15 articles he had published in various magazines over the years. Most are short and full of insight. The only one that I found tedious was the first one, concerning the Battle of Vicksburg in the Civil War - an irony for me considering that I love to study the Civil War. 
<br />
<br />The articles about Eisenhower were particularly of interest to me - prior to this book I had a pretty low opinion of the man (a grandpa president who played golf throughout his 8 years of presidency) but Ambrose portrayed him in a different light and now I want to read more about him.
<br />
<br />Very readable, very informative book. Well-written history is always a pleasure.</span>

                    <span>The format of Ambrose's essay compilation makes it wonderful topic read and a powerful reference book.  The chapter addressing the Atomic Bomb and its consequences presents an objective, interesting, and extremely informative perspective on this overwhelming event.  This refreshing and riviting approach provides the reader a method of sitting in Professor Ambrose's classroom while being taught by a master historian.  The final essay provides a prophetic outlook to war in the 21st century that is amazingly accurate considering current world events; a perspective that can only be provided through years of study and education.  This work is an absolute must own.</span>

                    <span>This was the first of Stephen E.Ambrose's books that I have read.  The book is a collection of independant essays on a variety of wars with American involvement. Although I found the book had alot of his own opinion on each battle or war I also discovered that he had some unique historical insight.  He also posed some interesting questions as to the resoning behind the very critical decisions made in each war. After reading just the Introduction I became intrigued and aware that Ambrose has an amazing grasp on his material and understanding of the complexities of war. Ambrose has a rare gift of understanding, making each essay in the book remarkably easy to follow while at the same time passing along a great wealth of knowledge.  After reading this book for the second time, I realized that if an author can make his reader think about his ideas and therories to the extent at which I was debating them within my own consciousness, then this book is well worth the time of others.</span>
