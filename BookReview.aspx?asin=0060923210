                    <span>I spent a good 15 years of my life trying to make peace with Christianity. I've struggled to appreciate the avid Christians' ability to embrace the Bible as a literal transcription of God's word. I've struggled to forgive those who applied peer pressure to me as a young teen to "accept Jesus as my personal savior." I've pondered with bewilderment the idea that God would create us with inquisitive, questioning minds but then require us to engage in blind acceptance of Jesus' teachings. 
<br />
<br />Finally, I was pushed over the edge by an evangelical Christian housemate who wouldn't shut up, and I picked up Mitchell's book in the hope of developing my gentle art of verbal self-defense. What an expected blessing this book has been! I was touched deeply and permanently by Mitchell's focus on forgiveness, and the many ways in which the teachings of Jesus the man are relevant to finding the Kingdom of Heaven within myself every day. Mitchell's book has helped me make peace with Christianity and Christians, and that is no small gift. </span>

                    <span>I read this book and couple more books of this author. It is the same theme and same goal. I wish if he had read bible honestly once without throwing his crooked ideas.  
<br />This is another master plan like "Davinci's code" to discredit Jesus and christianity, hoping to defend Judaism. Author is a  descredit to honest Jews too.

                    <span>I would recommend this book to anyone seeking spiritual truth. Mitchell has done a wonderful job of research to find the inconsistencies in other works, including the bible. What remains are not  versions of the truth written by those with a personal agenda, but the simple message of the Christ: The Kingdom is Within. Why dogmatic religions don't get this is still beyond my comprehension. Perhaps it's to keep people living in fear of suffering an eternal inferno, or to keep the religious hierarchy alive. But when the man called Jesus embodied the Christ his point was clear: don't follow me, but your own wisdom, for you have the Christ within as well.</span>

                    <span>I wish Mitchell began this book with more autobiographical material. He spent many years halfway around the world finding spiritual truths in Zen Buddhism. How could he not find Western Christianity lacking? I found the most perceptive insights speculate on Jesus' psychology as an "illegitamate" child. Perhaps the local community knew Joseph was not Jesus' biological father. Whether or not  you believe in a miraculous conception, one has to wonder whether Jesus was perceived by his peers to be of legitimate birth. How this would have fueled his anger against the Roman occupation! There has been some speculation by non-believers that Jesus was son of a Roman soldier.  Was Jesus rage personal as well as righteous? Not for devout Christians.</span>

                    <span>...but the fudamentalist won't like it!  But they don't like much of anything that goes against their narrow, exclusive beliefs.<br>The Gospel According to Jesus is a magnificent, large-hearted book that makes Jesus come alive again.  If you are burnt out on "fundagelicalism", then read this book and be refreshed!</span>
