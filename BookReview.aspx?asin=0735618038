                    <span>Oney's book provided the right overview and explanations I needed to get up to speed. I didn't expect a man to pop out of his book and do the work for me. Most any serious development is never done by the purchase of a book alone. <p>I do recall certain areas where I mumbled a little, where I'd wished he'd elaborated and/or expanded a little more, but this is meant only to hint at a slight criticism. <p>Oney's book was used in helping to produce successful results for real-world commercial software development. Thanks Mr. Oney!</span>

                    <span>I am borrowing a copy of this book at work, and I agree with the other reviewers that its helpful, and it doesnt "talk down"<p>But it can get quite rambly, the IO Request Chapter is a great example of this.<p>That being said I actually tried to include his DEVQUEUE in my driver code im using at work...Ive been programming for 10+ years so im not a slouch.<p>Problems:<br>1) C code written using C++ rules. This is annoying.<br>2) Doesn't compile at tighter warning levels...LOTS of warnings<br>3) Bug in DEVQUEUE initialization sent me on an IRP goosechase for good part of a day, and YES I did download his code service packs first. Watch out for stallcount being initialized to 1, StartNextPacket will refuse to run unless you change this to zero.</span>

                    <span>I got to this description of the first edition from a book list and ordered it. I read the book description and the reviews, but missed the one line recommendation from someone to get the second edition. So, I'm writing this as a review in the hopes that it will be more obvious so others won't waste money like I just did. Do a fresh book search on the title and buy the most recent edition.<p>The 1 star reflects that this is an old edition. I'm sure the book itself is fine.</span>

                    <span>This book was a valuable resource for my successful driver development project.<p>For newbie's, the book is a great companion to the DDK.  The text provides simple and concise sample code.  The examples on the CD-ROM are a great way to start exploring driver programming concepts using a kernel debugger.  The DDK samples are far too complicated for understanding the fundamentals, so use the book to get started and then the DDK samples will be much easier to comprehend.<p>I recommend that you read through the entire book at a high enough level that you don't get caught up in the details.  Next, find the chapter and sample driver that is most appropriate for your task and get started.  Throughout the rest of development, you'll reference various parts of the book to understand the details and avoid the hidden pitfalls in kernel mode programming.<p>For experts, the book provides comprehensive treatment of the topic.  It's full of tips and suggestions based on real-world experience.  Many of the driver components on the CD-ROM can be integrated into real drivers in order to reduce development time and complexity.  If you are creating a production driver that you intend to ship to real customers, the book will also provide you many options for creating a top-notch user experience during the install process.  WHQL and driver security issues are addressed as well.<p>The author updates the CD-ROM sources in service packs located on the web site.  These updates are based on his continuing work and feedback from readers.</span>

                    <span>This book is written in an extremely hard to read style, with long and convoluted sentences.<p>The writing style is almost unbearably boring. It you thought Hardy's "Return of the Native" was too fast paced, this is the book for you!<p>It also tends to explain the micro details without clearly explaining how it all fits together. In this respect, it almost assumes you have read and understood the Device Driver Kits, although the reader will be generally looking for help getting started with the DDKs.<p>There also seem to be a lot of omissions, in that it does not do a very good job of getting you started. Want to write a winmodem driver? This book gives you no idea where to start.<p>Having said all that, you probably need this book if you are writing a WDM driver. It does have a lot of useful information and tips. However it assumes you are a guru already.</span>
