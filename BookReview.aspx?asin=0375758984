                <span id="Label1">&#8220;Brimming with stories of sacrifice, courage, commitment and, sometimes, failure, the book will support anyone pondering a major life choice or risk without force-feeding them pat solutions.&#8221;<br>&#8212;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><i>What should I do with my life?<br></i><br>It&#8217;s a question many of us have pondered with frequency. Author Po Bronson was asking himself that very question when he decided to write this book&#8212;an inspiring exploration of how people transform their lives and a template for how we can answer this question for ourselves.<br><br>Bronson traveled the country in search of individuals who have struggled to find their calling, their true nature&#8212;people who made mistakes before getting it right. He encountered people of all ages and all professions&#8212;a total of fifty-five fascinating individuals trying to answer questions such as: Is a career supposed to feel like a destiny? How do I tell the difference between a curiosity and a passion? Should I make money first, to fund my dream? If I have a child, will my frustration over my work go away? Should I accept my lot, make peace with my ambition, and stop stressing out? Why do I feel guilty for thinking about this? <br><br>From their efforts to answer these questions, the universal truths in this book emerge. Each story in these pages informs the next, and the result is a journey that unfolds with cumulative power. Reading this book is like listening in on an intimate conversation among people you care about and admire. Even if you know what you should do with your life, you will find wisdom and guidance in these stories of people who found meaningful answers by daring to be honest with themselves. <br>Among them:<br> <br>-the Pittsburgh lawyer who decided to become a trucker so he could savor the moment and be closer to his son. <br>-the toner-cartridge queen of Chicago, who realized that her relationships with men kept sabotaging her career choices.<br>-the Cuban immigrant who overcame the strong dis-approval of her parents and quit her high-paying job to pursue social-service work in Miami.<br>-the chemistry professor who realized, quite late in life, that he would rather practice law.<br>-the mother torn between an Olympic career and her adolescent daughter.<br>-the seventeen-year-old boy who received a letter from the Dalai Lama and was called to a life of spiritual leadership.<br>-the creator of <i>St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire,</i> who wasn&#8217;t sure he could quit his successful Hollywood life for the deeper artistic life he had always wanted to pursue.<br>-the author himself. Po Bronson has worked as a bus-boy, cook, janitor, sports-medicine intern, bus-lift assembly-line technician, aerobics instructor, litigation consultant, greeting-card designer, bond salesman, political-newsletter editor, high school teacher, and book publisher. Since then, he has written three books: <b>Bombardiers</b>, <b>The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest</b>, and <b>The Nudist on the Late Shift</b>. But none of those experiences compared to what he learned by writing this book.<br><br><br>&#8220;We all have passions if we choose to see them,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;Most of us don&#8217;t get epiphanies. We don&#8217;t get clarity. Our purpose doesn&#8217;t arrive neatly packaged as destiny. We only get a whisper. A blank, nonspecific urge. That&#8217;s how it starts.&#8221;<br><br>With humor, empathy, and insight, Po Bronson probes the depths of people who learned how to hear the whisper, who overcame fear and confusion to find a larger truth about their lives. A meditation, a journey, and a triumph of story-telling, <b>What Should I Do with My Life?</b> is a life-changing book by a writer who brilliantly tackles the big questions.</span>

<br />I agree 100% with a review from "YOU must answer the question..., June 17, 2003
<br />Reviewer: A reader." 
<br />Couldn't have said it better than that, so please read his review instead..
<br />

                    <span>I am well educated but have been stuck in jobs for which I've been overqualified.  And then unemployed ultra long term in the latest structural economic crises.  Much of my work life, I have taken advice from books written BY management FOR management, and applied it down to my situation. With a moderate amount of success, I might add.  I wrote aggressive cover letters looking for jobs, campaigned fiercely for jobs in the past, for example.
<br />  
<br />THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TYPES OF BOOKS.  There is a grain of truth in every situation, just a matter of degree.  SO THESE BOOKS ARE TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, BUT LEARNED FROM!!  
<br />
<br />Yes, books like these are absolutely just like magazines like The Utne Reader, which look a little down on daughters of the working class and the "choices" they do not have to make but "should" (but that's as far as I will go with all that--irrespective of where one is politically on this--privilege exists everywhere in the political spectrum).
<br />
<br />At 50 years old, I am about to emerge from underground.  I am probably one of the "invisible homeless", having lived and living in various relatives' abodes, for longer than I care to think about.
<br />
<br />I would be taking psychotropic drugs right now if I took any of this (stuff happening outside myself) to heart!
<br />
<br />First, I lost 60 pounds and managed to keep it off this time.  Then, I sort of changed careers.  The future is uncertain, as I am not working full time right now, but there is hope for full time in the future.
<br />
<br />And some hope for my choices ...

                    <span>I picked up this book at a time when I was really struggling for a direction and purpose in my life. This book showed me that I'm not in alone in this quest. Po Bronson traveled across the United States to hear and document the stories of those who yearned for something more, those who tried to find it and succeed, those who tried to find it but failed and those who simply lived with the yearning.
<br />
<br />'What Should I Do With My Life?' is not a book for everyone. It doesn't spell out for us what we need to do or what we should do. It just gives us a very realistic picture of what happens in real people's lives. You will take from the book what you chose because it allows you to draw your own conclusions. 
<br />
<br />It's a beautifully written book that tells many stories. It's not written in the style of many self help books that give you directions or exercises, this book just helps you to realize that we all have options. I found it very inspiring. Bronson does show both sides of the story that sometimes we fail in our attempts to find happiness but he also shows that if you stick to your intentions and don't let yourself be swayed by the material things in life, you can find happiness. Just like this book, life is all about what we make of it!</span>
