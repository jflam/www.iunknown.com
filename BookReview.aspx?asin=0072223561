                    <span>granted, anyone who doesn't have a basic hold of flash development (that means actionscript folks) will be lost. However, those who do have a little experience should read it >TWICE. I have found it to be enlightening and enjoyable. Penners methods will help you get a better handle on Actionscript, OOP and even regular daily life. he has developed some really interesting ideas not just about how to use actionscript, but how to approach any substantial task. The book will bring you up to speed on the math concepts you need to create dynamic graphics (2D&3D coordinate systems and trigonometry) and teach you good practices in code desing and project management.<br>I hope he publishes a second edition (for ActionScript 2) soon, i'd love to see what he does with the language now that it has matured.</span>

                    <span>If you are trying to learn how to use Flash, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU!!!   The inclusion of the word Flash in the title is very misleading - should have said "ActionScript Programming" instead.  <p>Penner spends too much time expounding on his philosophical mumbo-jumbo and explaining how HE has reached such a level of excellence!  Can you say EGO???  I'm not going to say that he isn't talented, I would argue strongly to the contrary.  But, I didn't buy the book to learn about Robert Penner, I bought the book to learn about Flash programming.<p>He does have some very well written ActionScript classes that address the physics of animation.  If you've never been exposed to a physics class before, he does a pretty nice job summarizing the topic and how it applies to motion.  This book should help a programmer who knows Flash, but not the physics of motion.<p>He does not, however, give you examples to actually tie the classes into Flash or how to format an ActionScript file.  If only he had included a chapter on how to incorporate his code into Flash, it would have been a much better book.<p>If you are looking for a book to learn Flash, don't stop here - come back after you've found one.</span>

                    <span>This book's a must have for everyone, who wants to develop high-level Flash-movies using Actionscript for Visuals.<p>With Actionscript you can do everything you can do with the timeline and much more: particlesimulations, 3D in Flash, dynamic web content, effects, drawing,...<p>Robert Penner writes in a very clear style, starts with his own "getting into Flash" goes thru basics of object-oriented programming to heavy scripted movies (with dynamic drawing/painting, (movieclip-)duplications, 3D, particles and much more).<p>The book concentrates on mathematics, vectors, classes, coloring, drawing, event handling and physics with Actionscript (sounds harder than it is ;-} )<p>All files of the book are online<p>If you're a beginner in Flash, you'll feel blue with this book, if you're an intermediate in Flash who wants to draw his lines with Actionscript this is your choice.</span>

                    <span>You could get this info on a message board. It might take you a little while, but it would be free. It would be nice to have on hand, though. It's useful information.<p>The post about real-world applications is a crock. If you work on projects and have at least half a brain, you'll be able to squeeze some of this code in somewhere. It may not be obvious at first so just keep at it.<p>Caveat Emptor --<p>You will gag on his egotistical rants. I did. He could've chopped that mess out and saved his readers some time and hidden the fact that he has a wooly mammoth ego.</span>

                    <span>I am a pretty discriminating purchaser of books, because I don't have much money to spend.  I come from an OO applications programming and systems programming background and I've been using FlashMX since a few months after it came out.  I read lots of books that are probably good for Designers working in Flash, but very very few good books for what programmers want to know.  This book is the best I've seen yet.  Most Flash programming books treat you like you've never written a line of code.  This books doesn't start there, but rather teaches real concepts that will translate into code you will need to accomplish what you need to do in Flash.  If you're looking for scripts to copy and don't have the desire to understand those scripts, then maybe look elsewhere, but if you are interested in understanding the code you write yourself, then buy this book.  You will love it.</span>
