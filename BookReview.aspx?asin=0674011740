                <span id="Label1"><p> September 11, 2001, distinguished Cold War historian John Lewis Gaddis argues, was not the first time a surprise attack shattered American assumptions about national security and reshaped American grand strategy. We've been there before, and have responded each time by dramatically expanding our security responsibilities. </p><p> The pattern began in 1814, when the British attacked Washington, burning the White House and the Capitol. This early violation of homeland security gave rise to a strategy of unilateralism and preemption, best articulated by John Quincy Adams, aimed at maintaining strength beyond challenge throughout the North American continent. It remained in place for over a century. Only when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 did the inadequacies of this strategy become evident: as a consequence, the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt devised a new grand strategy of cooperation with allies on an intercontinental scale to defeat authoritarianism. That strategy defined the American approach throughout World War II and the Cold War. </p><p> The terrorist attacks of 9/11, Gaddis writes, made it clear that this strategy was now insufficient to ensure American security. The Bush administration has, therefore, devised a new grand strategy whose foundations lie in the nineteenth-century tradition of unilateralism, preemption, and hegemony, projected this time on a global scale. How successful it will be in the face of twenty-first-century challenges is the question that confronts us. This provocative book, informed by the experiences of the past but focused on the present and the future, is one of the first attempts by a major scholar of grand strategy and international relations to provide an answer.  </p></span>

                    <span>Excellent, Concise and Illuminating   
<br />
<br />Professor Gaddis does not have a Military background but don't let that deter you. This book, although short; excellently captures the essence of National Security and American Grand Strategy in light of 911
<br />
<br />The book is a series of essays, 5 chapters, for a total of 118 reading pages.  The first 80 pages of the book are devoted to building the very compelling case that professor Gaddis articulates. It is rich with primary and secondary resources that support his case.
<br />
<br />If you are a Military Studies, Military Science, Military History or Political Science Major and are comfortable with your knowledge of Early American History then you may skip to page 73 and begin reading there.  If you are in the Military, I recommend that read the entire book; HOWEVER, I also understand time and operational constraints and make the following exceptions; If you are an O-4 and above or an E-8 and above, and are comfortable with your knowledge of History and Military Science then you may skip to page 80 and begin there 
<br />
<br />For those that need a brief refresher, and even those that do not, it is important to read the first 73 pages in order to understand the case that Professor Gaddis builds. 
<br />
<br />The real meat and potatoes of this book begin on page 73. The results of the historical perspective begin on page 80; the most illuminating explanation and comparison of the National Security Strategy of Clinton and Bush begins on page 83 and the heart of the doctrine begins on page 86.  
<br />
<br />This is a must read book.

                    <span>In his book Professor Gaddis tried to convince a reader that current US course of preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony is legitimate and even feasible and realistic. He found legitimacy in the past US experiences - during John Quincy Adams administration. I agree with author up to a point. But it was never a doctrine but a set of practical tools, and hegemony was applied to the American land and sea, not Okinawa or Tashkent. I also agree that security is a raison d'etre of the governments everywhere. But Gaddis hyperbolically pictures preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony as a coherent doctrine, which ought to dominate US foreign policy, while John Quincy Adams applied as it as a set of tools to be used for the practical necessity of protecting American lands from intruders. In reality, it is not a coherent doctrine, but a hotchpotch of ideas developed in various times by various nations. Thus preemption was first developed and applied by Bismarck and Moltke. The Germans successfully used against the French in 1871. But since then in proved to be a double-edge sword and, in wrong hands, brought a disaster back to the Germans, for example, Hitler's invasion in Russia in 1941.  Hegemony is a Greek concept, where hegemon means a Chieftain. How realistically US can be a chieftain in this post-modern world, where every state insists to be a sovereign of its own land, remains an open question.  Unilateralism is a less controversial concept, but the US was always a unilateralist by nature, except a brief period of World War II, but this was rather an aberration. American exceptionalism is a strong undercurrent and unilateralism is just a manifestation of this idea.  Although Gaddis is subtler than most neocons, his book inadvertently helps to justify neo-conservatives' rejection of diplomacy in dealing with other states under the banner of unilateralism.  
<br />But I have other criticism - It is interesting to me that Gaddis mentioned Adam Smith at the end of the book. In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed - in effect burying the idea of possibility of Western-style modernization in Russia. Thus Marxian doctrine of rapid progress and modernization based on coercive and hegemonic power of proletariat appears to be dismissed. However Marx's ideas were based on the ideas of European Enlightenment thinkers, most notably Adam Smith. Smith was the most influential economist of his time and he was in effect a creator of idea of leissez faire or unfettered capitalism. Smith's ideas were based on one central premise of Homo Economicus. Re-emergence after the end of the Cold war of religion, ethnicity and rivalry to territory and recourses makes a mockery of the idea of rational, economical man - the bedrock of the Western civilization, or better said the Enlightenment civilization, which strongest and last outpost is the US. Gaddis dismisses that as he dismisses Mujaheddin as 'pirates, marauders, and agents of predatory empires' (page 110). But fundamentalism is a post-modern phenomenon, not a 'blast from the past'. It is a thought-provoking book, but unfortunately, Gaddis resembles to me a scholar who lives in proverbial Ivory Tower not noticing tectonic shifts everywhere around him.</span>

                    <span>The surprise attack of September 11 brought about, in the eyes of many learned observers, a radical shift in American national security policy.  Since World War II and up until the collapse of the Soviet Union there was a policy of containment and deterrence.  During the 1990s, in the wake of the collapse, there was a feeling that democracy and capitalism would eventually triumph everywhere; the Clinton administration reasoned that the US "only needed to engage and the rest of the world would enlarge the process."
<br />
<br />In response the 9/11 attack the Bush administration formulated a new strategy, outlined in the national security speech at West Point on June 1, 2002.  This speech called for a new strategy which looked like a departure from American tradition.  The key elements of this new strategy were preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony.  In the beginning, it was little noticed; however, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, people began to examine this strategy more closely.
<br />
<br />Yale professor John Lewis Gaddis, in this short and well-written little book, argues that this was not a new policy, in fact it had deep roots in American history that go back to the earliest days of the republic.  Gaddis demonstrates that after the British attack on Washington DC during the War of 1812, the then secretary of state, John Quincy Adams asserted the same three principles.  Preemption was the rationale for Andrew Jackson's invasion of Florida, the "failed state" of its day being a haven for marauding Seminoles, runaway slaves and profiteering pirates.  With the diminishing authority of the Spanish in Latin America, the US sought to restrict the influence of other European powers in the Western Hemisphere.  The Monroe Doctrine was a unilateralist declaration even though the US did not have the means to enforce it without the backing of the British navy.  And in the end, the policy of John Quincy Adams was to be the predominant power in the Western Hemisphere, or at least on the North American continent - a hegemon in all but name. 
<br />
<br />Preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony was indeed a US strategy up until World War II.  The US was seeking merely to assure its security by keeping the European powers out of the hemisphere.  Most Americans believed it was a mistake to seek an oversees empire as the brief foray into the Phillipines proved in the early part of the 20th century.
<br />
<br />After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt was forced the build alliances with the Soviet Union and other great powers in order to defeat Germany and Japan.  It was thus necessary to forgo preemption and unilateralism in deference to the alliance.  During and after World War II, the US took the lead in building multilateralism institutions - a multilateral system that not only ensured American hegemony, but made it desirable at the same time.  Forgoing preemption gave the US the moral high ground, which it maintained until the invasion of Iraq.
<br />
<br />The Bush administration's invasion of Iraq had all the elements of a grand strategy: preemption, unilateralsim - when multilateralism failed - and American hegemony.  There was also an innovation to this strategy: there would be an active promotion of democracy in the Middle East.  This idea swayed many liberals to the cause, including members of the media and the academic community.
<br />
<br />The problems with this strategy became apparent after the invasion.  They are too numerous to go into and obvious to anyone following the news.  The mistakes made during the occupation leaves the Bush Doctine with only a few remaining supporters.  The failure to enlist the great powers, not to mention many of the smaller powers, destroyed our status as a benign hegemon and jepardizes our moral high ground.
<br />
<br />Gaddis does an excellent job of explaining the grand strategy and showing that it has precedents in history, better than Bush or anyone in his administration.  However, he does not show that this strategy is justified, morally or legally, and he does not seem to fully appreciate that many of our friends and allies find this strategy frightening and repugnant.  They do not call us arrogant for nothing.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, the jury is still out.  Immediately after the invasion, it looked as though one regime after another would fall in the region, along the lines of the dominoes of Eastern Europe.  At the present writing, with the Iraqi elections approaching, a decent outcome seems remote and a civil war possible.  Yet, there are stirrings of hope and change elsewhere in the Middle East, such as in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The upheaval in Iraq is also creating debate that did not exist before in Egypt and the Gulf States.  The pendulum may again swing the other way and the grand strategy may be working inspite of itself.</span>

                    <span>John Lewis Gaddis presents a very persuasive argument in his book, about the shifts undertaken in American foreign policy once American security was challenged by foreign threats.  Surprise, Security, and the American Experience is a concise well-thought argument interpreting the history of American foreign policy reaction to surprise attacks and security threats to the homeland.  And how these threats have altered the way the US acts on the world stage, whether isolationist, neutral, or ally.  He uses three principle events in American history to outline the three Bush administration's foreign policy strategies of, preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony.  The three principle events in which these shifts in strategy occurred were the burning of Washington by the British in 1814, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, and the Al-qaeda terrorists attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001. 
<br />
<br />The first monumental shift in American foreign policy occurred in 1814 after the destruction of the capital by the British.  The US had not ventured into this realm of diplomacy at this point.  America had not recognized that its interests lay in taking part on the world stage, whether with the world or against it, but always engaging with it.  President Jefferson had kept the US out of war with the British in the early 1800s by hiding from the direct conflict.    
<br />
<br />Jefferson had used a multi-faced policy of expansion, belligerency and appeasement.  He acquired the Louisiana Purchase from the French, and at the same time reduced the size of the army and the navy.  During the Napoleonic Wars when both Britain and France were violating American maritime rights Jefferson called for a trade embargo.  He contracted American interests, eliminating the threat to America by disengaging from the field, refusing to defend America's right to trade.  This was humiliating to the Congress and the people, and by 1811 both began calling for a defense of all American interests, whether it was possible or not.  The British response was to invade the US and burn down Washington.  
<br />
<br />After negotiating the Treaty of Ghent to end the War of 1812 John Quincy Adams became US Secretary of State in 1817 and began a major reformation of American foreign policy.  The US was in a difficult position after the war.  It had a huge land mass with vast borders to defend and only limited means to defend them.  It was therefore prudent to acknowledge that the US must first be willing to take action before a crisis ensues.  That is to use a doctrine of preemption.  Adams first applied this idea to the `failed state' of Spanish Florida. (pg. 17)  The vast open border of that territory allowed many non-state actors, such as Native Americans, slaves and the French to cross into the US and attack its citizens.  Adams instructed Spain to ensure that this no longer occurs by staffing it with more soldiers or Spain must cede Florida to the US to prevent future attacks.  This doctrine of preemption came to justify many subsequent American foreign policy engagements, from the annexation of Texas in 1845 by President Polk, to the American invasion of Cuba and the Philippines in 1898 by President McKinley.  
<br />
<br />The next diplomatic strategy that Adams helped establish was the doctrine of unilateralism.  This doctrine would be spelled out clearest in the Monroe Doctrine, which states that the US would have been the exclusive participant in the western hemisphere.  The Europeans were forbidden from intervening in the affairs or colonizing any country in the western hemisphere.  This was a dramatic shift in American policy considering the fact that the US had no way of enforcing it without the participation of the British Navy.  Adams had checkmated the British attempt at a joint Anglo-American statement about future European involvement in the western hemisphere, presenting instead a unilateral statement from the US determining the course of events in its own backyard.  
<br />
<br />The third strategy presented by Adams was the doctrine of hegemony.  As he saw it the US had time on its side, while the Europeans time was running out.  Population, economy, and potential strength were all increasing meanwhile the Europeans were beginning to reach the limit of their potential.  For Adams there was no reason to hide hegemonic aspirations.  The US was by far the strongest nation on the continent and shared that stage with no one else.  It was not enough to conquer lands and create empires, `security could best be assured, instead, by making certain that no other great power gained sovereignty within geographic proximity of the US.' (pg. 29)  
<br />
<br />The preponderance of power lay with the US in 1941 but a surprise attack using new weapons and tactics brought the weaknesses of that power home to millions of Americans on December 7th.  President Roosevelt choose to embrace a different a course for American policy then did Adams.  FDR accepted America's role in the world and formed alliances with other nations to protect our hegemony.  He did not sacrifice American power but dropped two key components of Adams strategy, preemption and unilateralism.  Americas' hegemony and preponderance of power ensured that the US could almost simultaneously bring to a close two separate wars, with the US coming out stronger.  FDR never let proclaimed interests extend beyond actual capabilities.  This was the genius of his strategy, unlike Wilson whose ideals for democratizing the world was not feasible and made the US look hypocritical and weak.  FDR believed US security was enhanced by embedding `unilateral priorities within a cooperative multilateral framework.'  Global American hegemony was now to `arise by consent.' (pg. 54)  
<br />
<br />After the Cold War American political leaders had neglected the building threat of global terrorism.  It was a symptom of the American psyche to ignore the invisible threat in the absence of visible danger.  They assumed that American power was supreme that with the fall of the Soviet Union no other country could or would directly challenge US power.  They believed they had won the game and they assumed that the `rules by which the United States, its allies, and its defeated adversaries had played' could never be challenged or broken. (pg. 80)  None state actors, terrorists acting without sovereign support became a foreign policy reality on September 11th.
<br />
<br />The Bush Doctrine states that the US will identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are, together with the regimes that sustain them.' (pg. 86)  This policy no longer respects sovereignty and implies that the rules that by which the world was playing were no longer going to be respected by the US.  The Bush administration was embracing preemption to find the terrorists threats before they attack us, which is also the policy of unilateralism which is needed when the world community is unwilling to recognize the threat.  Preemption in the Bush doctrine requires American hegemony, `the capacity to act wherever one needs to without significant resistance from rival states.' (pg. 87)
<br />
<br />Gaddis cites Fareed Zakaria whom I wholeheartedly agree.  Zakaria says that order, prosperity, and justice, the necessary building blocks of a stable society are not found in democracies.  They are found in liberal autocracies like China, Taiwan, Singapore and Chile.  According to our political ideologies these places are not democracies.  But they are ordered stable secure societies with limited freedoms.  Unlike the present situation in Iraq where massive amounts of freedom exists things are extremely unstable and insecure.  Democracies according to Zakaria do not do a successful job at providing the necessary order and stability to maintain a civil society like Iraq.
<br />
<br />I believe that Gaddis has written a very informative and effective argument for the current strategies of the Bush administrations War on Terror.  I think his reasoning is sound and his method of merging commentary and history is excellent.  I was however not that impressed with his minor criticism of the Bush Doctrine in the last portion of the book.  I had hoped to read more on the criticisms of the Bush Doctrine and its many flaws in presenting this strategy to the world and its failures at maintaining the good relations the US had had after the September 11th attacks.  Their exists many outcomes to the present Bush administration strategy, since this book was written, those outcomes have not been looking good for American interests in Afghanistan or Iraq.  
<br />
<br />I believe Gaddis has written an outstanding book that ultimately changed my perception of the Bush administration and its strategy for change in Iraq.  I was not convinced of America's right to act unilaterally or preemptively in this case.  I always believed that the threat of WMD was a sales pitch for the war and not evidence of anything.  I still agree with one of the merits for our invasion of Iraq, such as spreading democracy, but the methods for achieving this are proving disastrous.   I believe that we cannot simply throw-out the rules to the game because the terrorists no longer play by them.  I do not trust unchecked American hegemony where we no longer respect the rules we helped write and cherish.

                    <span>There has been a tendency in the attention that Americans have paid to global policies of the great powers to ignore how local individuals can have a tremendous effect on what happens all over the world.  In SURPRISE, SECURITY, AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE, Yale professor John Lewis Gaddis gives credit to John Quincy Adams for setting American grand strategy before we had the military power accomplish much.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt gets credit for minimizing the amount of fighting that Americans engaged in during World War II:
<br />
<br />"Stalin's dictatorship was at least as autocratic as that of Hitler, and its record of murdering its own citizens was even worse.  It clearly did not seek a world safe for democracy, capitalism, or much of anything else apart from its own immediate interests.  Yet Roosevelt's strategy required keeping the Soviet Union in the war, because for every American who was dying while fighting it, some 60 Russians were doing so.  How then to align American interests with the Red Army's capabilities?"  (p. 51).
<br />
<br />I am not able to dispute anything in this book, but what it intends to mean is so tied to thoughts about American superiority that it is hardly ironic that there is no entry in the index listing religion as a strategy for obtaining anything through hypocritical humility.  Also unlisted:  holy war, violent movie sensationalism, Southeast Asian war games (Vietnam), and rock 'n' roll.  The index does show some attempts to move beyond the interests that were in the forefront in previous wars:  shock and awe, Islamic world: recency of Islamic rage in, and weapons of mass destruction.  The attention paid to several centuries of American expansion and waning European hegemony allows skeptics who thought the Cold War was largely a fake cover for increasing military-industrial expenditures to reflect on how often an economic plan for the future is in harmony with such schemes.  What this book is missing is an awareness that the surprise of September 11, 2001 came just when the American future was going kaput.
<br />
<br />The great depression was not important enough for the meaning of this book to be listed in the index, but an astute reading of pages on the times of American isolationism following the great slaughter of World War I shows a hint that we know so much more now than we did in those days.
<br />
<br />"The first clear challenge to security elsewhere came only in 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, a region that hardly seemed vital to the defense of the United States.  And even if it had been, the onset of the great depression would have constrained whatever inclination there might have been to act:  the discovery that going to war could restore prosperity would have to wait for another decade."  (p. 44).
<br />
<br />Those who have an incredible ability to consider whatever income the top one percent of the population are making part of an indication of a restoration of prosperity in our own time might think they see an upswing now, but the enemies of the kind of warfare Americans engage in far from home are not detecting their own improvement.  Some Vietnamese were also expecting an economic takeoff after that war, but the 3 million Asians who died in the area-wide conflict and ethnic Chinese slaughtered in Indonesia in 1965 must outnumber those whose opportunities for smuggling paid off.  Those who think that smuggling might be a joke in this context should check to see what is listed instead in the index under Afghanistan.
<br />
<br />`Economic globalization:  Bretton Woods system and' is listed in the index.  "The purpose of Bretton Woods was to perpetuate the economic hegemony with which the United States was certain to end the war."  (p. 53).  Until Nixon was president, it made sense for the United States to support a system that would require cash payments in the event of trade unbalances so countries that produced goods did not get stuck with a large supply of worthless currencies from nations importing.  World War II was a historical event in which the number of countries paying the United States for materials was exceptional.  Current events are based on contrary expectations, and it is difficult to express how much of the world maintains thinking that runs directly contrary to the American ideals in this book, however ideal they may sound in speeches by the president.</span>
