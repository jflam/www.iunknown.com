                    <span>Worthless and waste of time and money.  There is no  great strategies discussed in the book, book is throughout boring and  repeating. Author sees the reader as a potential customer. You have a feeling that you were listering to a salesman aggressively trying to sell his products.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book shows you how fast a business can grow really super fast. Dell started out in his dormroom making computers for customers and now is worldwide. Dell takes you through every step of the way in his monstorous growth. He posed problems that arised from when a company grows too fast, and shows how he solved them in turn.
<br />
<br />The book is an amazing triumph in our computer age. You get a better idea of what happened in the 1990's with computers through Dell's unique perspective.</span>

                    <span>Michael Dell is a tech wunderkind. He is a successful businessman. He may be considered a visionary. A business author??? I just thought this book was a little too fragmented for my taste. The book could have gone the way of a full biography or full business lesson. There's valuable insights but the majority is padding. The book could have been condensed to a slim volume. Overall, I thought it was good but nothing spectacular. This shouldn't matter to those who view Dell as an iconoclast. It will belong in your collection.</span>

                    <span>Michael Dell sure isn't an exciting writer. His writing style rivals the Dell's technical manual on excitement. It isn't as if he lacks exciting stories to tell. Dell is one of the greatest success stories in business. But I found his stories to be downright boring. For example, he writes about how he managed the Coke Vending machine at one of his old factories...Who cares??? I wanted to get insights on how Dell beat hundreds of competitors in a business where product and price differentiation are minimal. On this, I was very disappointed. Dell repeatedly sites three things for his company's success 1)execution and 2)having the right people 3)selling direct. But there are other competitors who had the same qualities and now they are either minor players or out of business. This book didn't really gave me the insights I was hoping for.</span>
