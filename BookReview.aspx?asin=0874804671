                <span id="Label1">As Steve Allen proclaims in his introduction, "<I>Canyoneering 2</I> is not for everyone." Utah's local canyoneering guru has carefully laid out seven multiday backpack trips that are very demanding and only recommended for advanced hikers with technical rock-climbing skills. Muddy Creek, the Dirty Devil, Dark Canyon, White Canyon, and the Escalante east are all remote and seldom-seen routes. In fact, Dark Canyon is considered one of the most remote areas in the country, which sees only six to eight visitors every year. Still interested? Allen's guide gives you a good head start with preparation chapters, plenty of helpful tips, and excellent landmark descriptions for the confusing, often baffling desert terrain. <I>--Ben Tiffany</I></span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for the more hardcore backpackers out there. The loops described are a lot of fun, and provide access to spectacular views plus a chance to explore true wilderness. As for bringing too many people... after going on several of the hikes, I must admit we were hard pressed to find footprints less than a year or two old along the tracks, if any at all. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>The last review on this book felt that Allens book would cause the public to swarm the remote Utah regions and spoil this PUBLIC land for him. While he contends that the land is fragile and that anyone else besides him will destroy it, Allen emphasis time and again in his books the Low-impact camping tecniques essential to this land. This book describes in detail many fablous and beautiful hikes. Some of the most beautiful and marvelous scenery in the world is located in the bad, no-man lands of Utah. These series of books instruct help and guide readers through these wonders. We should be thankful there is a guide so that we aren't ruining the land by rescuing inexperianced hikers that didn't know what they were getting into. These guides are a must for anyone interested in exploration and enjoying the wonder of nature first hand. They correctly and accuratly depict water sources, milage and countless other invaulable things. Thankyou Steve Allen for all of the hard work and the sacrifice that you made to bring us these books. And to the previous reader, I am so very sorry that you feel the lands are to be used by you and only you. Get over yourself. <P> Sincerley, Justin Rammell</span>

                    <span>The guide is a good one. I have hiked the Long and Gravel Canyon area for over 20 years with friends and family. It can be amazingly fun but also amazingly dangerous country. My main feeling about guide books like the one Steve has written is negative, however. I am used to hiking in areas with only a topo map and a compass, as this provides much more of a wilderness experience. Hikes with a guide book destroy this aspect. Also, the land is very delicate in these riparian areas, and cannot tolerate large influxes of hikers without destruction of the resource. As guide books like this proliferate, the influx of hikers will more certainly destroy the wilderness experience as well as the physical viability of the resource much more surely than mining or cattle ranching could ever do. This in view of the fact that hikers seek out the best part of a limited resource and tend to overuse it. Mr. Allen makes a point of his love for the canyon country and yet ironically may be responsible for more degredation of the resource than almost anyone else because of the publication of books like this. I am not anti-hiker. In fact I am a member of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. But please, Mr. Allen, let us hikers "roam free", and leave us some unspoiled territory!!</span>
