                    <span>This book, along with the others in the series, is a short biography of George Washington.  There are plenty of other book about him that deal much more in depth, but this book makes for a good beginning.
<br />
<br />He was a man of tremendous ambition that was concerned with climbing the social ladder.  Indeed, he was one of the richest men in Virginia at the time.  But the fact remains that after the end of the Revolutionary War he resigned his commison and went back to his Mount Vernon farm.  Instead of taking advantage of his tremendous popularity at a time when he could have easily grabbed a lot of power from the young nation, he wished nothing more than to become a country farmer.  That fact tells volumes about his character.  How many men would have not taken advantage of the situation?
<br />
<br />Not to put him on a pedestal, or portray him as a saint, this book tells of his ambition, his concern with climbing further into the social strata, and also tells of his love for the new-founded country.  He was a great man, and totally human.  
<br />
<br />A good short introduction to George Washgington, and another great volume in the series!</span>

                    <span>I found the George Washington book by Burns and Dunn to be tedious and repetitive. The first part of the book was interesting and covered the subject in an interesting and readable way; I'm surprised that the last few chapters made it into a book in this series. It was a struggle to finish it (I typically read more than 150 books a year without this problem).
<br />
<br />I feel that the writers were writing more for their own edification than to inform their readers.  I you happen to pick up a copy read page 143 as a "readability" test.  I am very surprised that the editors allowed this book to be published with the problems that I perceive.
<br />
<br />I've enjoyed other books that I've read in the "The American Presidents Series"; don't let this review influence you on the whole series

                    <span>Burns and Dunn seem to think ambition is a dirty word, and that one can't have ambitious goals for oneself combined with modesty.  Perhaps they've never known modest, hard-driving and successful men - that is, people with outstanding abilities who want to realize their potential and yet are innately modest.  So we get the historian picking on Washington, exposing him for a hypocrite, instead of informing us on what contributed to Washington's outstanding leadership and moral qualities.  very disappointing. I quit reading after chapter 3.</span>

                    <span>I too am surprised that this series of short works on the American Presidents is getting what seems to me to be too little attention.  While not every book in the series is of the same quality, several, and in particular this one on Washington, are gems.  Not a general biography, this is an analysis of Washington's presidency and what we get of his early life is here only to further that analysis.  Despite this relatively narrow focus, it is a book all who want to understand our political system as it exists today should read.  Dense but very well written, I give it four stars only because I leave five for the greatest works of English literature and we aren't offered four and a half.  Nevertheless, I recommend it highly.</span>

                    <span>I admit I am a sucker for history, and especially American History and biographies. In the last few years there have been a plethora of books about our founding fathers, and Professor Burns and Dunn's work is right up there with the best. If there is a flaw it lies in the brevity. But the writing is sharp, almost like a well developed college lecture series, and though I have read longer, more detailed biographies of Washington, this was the most entertaining and easy to digest. I also highly recommend Professor Burns previous books on Franklin Roosevelt if you have a mind to immerse yourself in a very thorough history of a very troubled time and a very heroic, and human statesman.</span>
