                <span id="Label1">With the same drug-addled alacrity and jaundiced wit that made Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas a hilarious hit, Hunter S. Thompson turns his savage eye and gonzo heart to the repellent and seductive race for President.  He deconstructs the 1972 campaigns of idealist George McGovern and political hack Richard Nixon, ending up with a political vision that is eerily prophetic.  A classic!</span>

                    <span>     This book offers a fresh inside look at what really goes on behind the scenes of a presidential campaign. Follow Hunter S. Thompson while he absorbs himself into the story leading up to the 1972 presidential election. 
<br />     I recommend this book for anyone who has the slightest incling of what politics are and how they work. I also suggest you brace yourself for what you will encounter in this book. Filled with tangled webs of deception and corrupt politicians, this composition startles the reader into understanding the true policies of what it takes to be president and trust me, its not as it seems. 
<br />     Despite the fact that this drug-addled, stream of conscienceness sheds light to the lowest, dirtiest and most raw side of politics it will truly open your eyes to the fact that it has always been done this way, even from the very beginning. Nevertheless, Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail will leave you wanting more and hating Richard Milhouse Nixon with a firey passion that you will come to love as the book wears on.</span>

                    <span>All too often, Hunter Thompson's remarkable and vast journalistic production has been overwhelmed and deluded by his famous work, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It would seem that most Thompson readers fail to see that Thompson's works, far from being one esoteric drug opus, range the spectrum of popular cultre, politics, and to a great extent a large segment of American history. 
<br />
<br />One of his best and most illuminating books, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72, is written with the cutting commentary and breakneck pace so recognizable as Thompson. However, each comment and postulation is well researched and based on deep thought, even if enhanced by the occassional milky hit of Singapore Gray.
<br />
<br />Thompson studies the 1972 Presidential election month by month, following both polls and candidates across the nation.  Rather than see the election as a political institution, Thompson slices away the media fat and studies candidates, their motivations, and the varied behavior of the American constituency. 
<br />
<br />The author takes time to explore each candidate, although concentrating mostly on the Democratic Party, discussing their platforms on the major issues of the time: amnesty, the de-escalation of Vietnam, the civil rights movement, etc. and accurately and insightfully illustrates their place in not only the election, but in America during the early 1970's. 
<br />
<br />Thompson, having closely studied politics for innumberable years illustrates waves and trends throughout American politics, from 1964-72, with numerous and ultimately accurate predictions for the future.   
<br />
<br />Although a different work than Fear in Loathing in Las Vegas, a very interesting and personal look at American politics and Thompson the journalist.  A must read for "politics junkies" as well as Thompson fans.</span>

                    <span>Hunter Thompson would despise me. I am a conservative Reaganite. I thought Dick Nixon a brilliant President. I think the Lord Jesus Christ saves my soul. Whereas I despise Michael Moore and do not think he speaks the truth, I admire Hunter Thompson, who is probably a lot closer to Moore's politics than mine. It is not just the passage of time that heals divisions, it is more than that. If I were to analyze Hunter's political nostrums, I would probably find much that I know to be wrong, and that Hunter had enough education and knowledge available to him to know it was wrong but he wrote it anyway. Still, whatever visceral reaction I have to Moore I do not have for Hunter.<p>I guess humnor must be why. Hunter is absolutely inconoclastic. He is side-splitting. He never smiles, and his writing has no funniness in it. I picture him writing out of dread and hate, yet it magically transforms itself into laughs when my eyes meet his words and transfer to my brain. Forgive my bad attempt to get into his head and "explain" Hunter. It's all I can do to try.<p>This book is phenomenal. It contains events that are different from any descriptions ever. Others have novelized reality, but nobody splits the difference like Hunter. Hunter's supposed on-scene reportage of Edmund Muskie coming unglued in the New Hampshire snow, Frank Mankiewiczs' furious (drug induced?) ramblings, the one-on-one with Nixon himelf, leaves the reader exhausted in an effort to separate reality from fantasy. Hunter is like the great con man who uses Truth to augment his lies. This is not calling Hunter a liar, it is just an example. The fact that I don't see this as lies is telling, and separates Hunter and his times from the current political climate, in which his spawn, if you will, the likes of Moore and Al Franken, try to make Hunteresque points but leave themselves exposed as obfuscators instead. The answer is that Thompson is just so much better than almost all other writers that he cannot be duplicated or even imitated. To try is pointless. Many, inclduing myself, have tried to be the "next Jim Murray," but like Murray nobody can be Hunter, either.<p>STEVEN TRAVERS(...)</span>

                    <span>For all his gonzo journalism, Thompson has a very keen eye for politics, even if he backed McGovern in '72.  This is a very engaging and very insightful study of the McGovern campaign and how, in Thompson's mind, it was the only hope in the miasma of politics at the time.  He is unsparing on McGovern's opponents, particularly Humphrey, but saved his scorn for Nixon, whom the Democrats were desperately hoping to unseat.  One of the most memorable scenes in the book (whether real or imagined) is when Thompson was called up to talk sports with the President himself on Air Force One.  For a moment, Thompson puts down his guard, to engage in Nixon's favorite pastime, football.  What you get is a heady mix of politics and humor as only the Grandmaster of Gonzo Journalism can give.  The book remains unsurpassed in its candid view of a presidential political campaign.</span>
