                    <span>I've just read only section 2-1 (Manipulating Rightmst Bits) and I got much better understanding of binary arithmetic than I had before. As a collection of different computer arithmetic techniques the book is brilliant, but I think the book would have been even better if the auther had included derivations for formulas.</span>

                    <span>If you love the nuts and bolts of logical operations in computer programming, do I have a book for you! This book does a great job of describing in reasonable detail logical operators and what you can do with them ranging from very basic "what is it" to reasonably advanced applications such as wierd base -2 math, division, pattern matching, etc. I found this book to be a great reference and refresher clearly layed out and easy to read. I wish my software engineer co-workers would read this book. I'm tired of seeing ugly code (a while loop with a mod operator to align data pointers on, say, 8 byte boundaries).</span>

                    <span>I feel compelled to point out that this book is _not_ a few things: It's not a book that teaches you how to break into computers, or crack codes. It's also not the kind of book that teaches you how to do something which you don't know how to do. <P>This book is a collection of tricks that show the reader better ways to do things they already know how to do. And it's also a book that can give the reader insight into different approaches and mechanisms for solving problems.<P>Computer programmers translate their ideas and requirements into any of several computer languages. Those expressions are limited by the language the programmer is using, and maybe even the machine the programmer is targeting. But there is a wide continum of expressions that result in the same -- hopefully correct -- results. Choosing the most efficient, and most elegant, expression to some is "real" hacking.<P>This book is for real hackers. It's a great collection of tricks for performing usually simple operations in an elegant way. What's elegant? Well, elegant is efficeint. If there's a side-effect of an elegant operation, it turns out that side-effect is probably useful and not simply discarded.<P>This book catalogs insights into concrete binary math, shortcuts derived from different boolean operators, and even approaches some interesting numerical analysis problems.<P>If you already know how to write software, and you already know you want to find faster or more efficient ways to check for overflows on integers, divide nubmers, count bits, search for binary patterns, or do other twiddling, then this book is for you.<P>If the application of such techniques doesn't seem important to you, then this book probably isn't going to be of interest to you.</span>

                    <span>Early drafts of Dr Warren's book have circulated for several years samizdat style among a group of hardware, compiler and OS people at a large computer research lab. One copy in particular always sits about three feet from me. If the building were to catch on fire, you might very well hear shouts of "who's taking Hacker's Delight?"<BR> How do you determine, using the smallest number of instructions, if a word contains at least one zero byte? How do you transpose a bit matrix? Divide by 5? Count the number of ones in a word? Permute bits? Maybe you're smart enough to already know. Or perhaps you know someone else who does. For the rest of us there's Hacker's Delight.<BR> Some years back, in the course of building a large machine, we made a mistake that resulted in some very expensive rework. Just one particular paragraph in this book would have saved us an amount of money best not admitted in print. If you have Knuth on your shelf then there's a good chance that you'll want Hacker's Delight right next to it.<BR> And just in case life is getting too serious, there are some entertaining chapters on prime numbers and Hilbert curves, written so compellingly that you can't stop reading until the end.<BR> Highly recommended. If this book relates to the kind of work you do, then don't leave home without it.</span>
