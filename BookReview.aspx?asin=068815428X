                    <span>Managers may not be able to enact all of the principles of Gung Ho, but they will be able to walk away with some valuable insight in the world of motivation and performance.  If your not sure if you really want this book or not I would recommend that you go for it.  There is truly nothing to lose and the reading is entertaining and informative. Every person will be able able to take something from this book and be able to apply it to their work environment.</span>

                    <span>The book gung Ho by Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles is a great book for managment. It is excellent in the way it simply defines a way to significantly improve your management skills by focusing in the 3 principles. the principles could be used in personal life as well as your profesional life. It is so great that it helps create organization and to use practice using techniques on a daily basis. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in improving their work style. This book is also easy to read and understand.</span>

                    <span>Gung Ho! is a book related to management. Although the concepts in the book are simple, it is important to everyone, especially those are in the management field. The three underlying principles are The Spirit of the Squirrel, The Way of the Beaver and The Gift of the Goose. They are parables of the importance of making employees understand their roles, the conflict between directing the tasks to employees and empowerment by management, and the importance of appreciation to employees respectively. <p>In my view of point, I think Gung Ho! is a revolutionary technique to boost enthusiasm and performance and usher in astonishing results for any organization. The principles are the tips to increase productivity by fostering excellent morale in the workplace. For example, employees will be loyal to the company if they gain job satisfaction from their worthwhile work. Positive reinforcements such as appreciation (i.e. say ¡§well done¡¨ when those have good performance) and empowerment can motivate employees to improve and have a better performance.<p>To conclude, Gung Ho! is easy to read but useful for everyone. The writers convey the important management strategies to the readers by using simple story and parables. I think it is a good time for the company, the management team and the employees to refresh and understand their roles so that they can have a good relationship which can benefit as a whole.</span>

                    <span>Gung Ho! is another typical Ken Blanchard book.  It is a quick read and contains some very useful information, but falls short in giving managers the full picture.  Some readers will find the format cheesy, but I didn't take it that way.<p>The book is broken down into three areas:<p>1.  The Spirit of the Squirrel (which discusses the importance of making employees feel that their work is important)<br>2.  The Way of the Beaver (which talks about how managers should tell employees what they want and define the boundaries, but within those boundaries allow employees to figure out solutions in their own way)<br>3.  The Gift of the Goose (which goes over the importance of using positive reinforcement when employees do a good job)<p>These are three very powerful ideas that every manager should embrace.  However, there are numerous issues that the book doesn't cover.  To give just one example, what should a manager do is one of her employees comes to work every day late and is totally unproductive while he is there?  Obviously, The Gift of the Goose (i.e. praising employees) isn't the answer since that will just reinforce the negative behavior.<p>Despite the book's shortcomings, I think it's worth reading if you like management books since it does contain some useful information.  But if you want one book that going to cover the subject more dynamically from many more angles, then you should probably look elsewhere.<p>Greg Blencoe<br>Author, The Ten Commandments for Managers</span>
