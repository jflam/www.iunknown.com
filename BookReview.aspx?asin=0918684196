                <span id="Label1">Above Paris. Pierre Salinger writes, "Paris, in its entirety, has never been portrayed like this. The view of the Ile de la Cite with the imposing Notre Dame; the Eiffel Tower, seen from above the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees all give an entirely new deminsion to France's capital." His word picture of the world's romantic center matches Robert Cameron's stunning photography.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a stellar exploration of Paris and its environs via aerial photographs. Armed with a map and this book, you can take a wonderful tour of Paris from a bird's-eye perspective, becoming familiar with the layout of the city, the location of the most famous spots in relation to other structures, and a feel for how the city is built around the various physical landmarks, including hills and the waterways. There is also a wealth of photographs from the surrounding areas of Paris.<P>The photographs are of the greatest imaginable clarity, with a wealth of detail in every picture. Although it is possible to flip through the book, the best approach is to take it and carefully study each picture, teasing out all the details that each one can reveal. I will confess that I have never been to Paris, but thanks to studying this as well as other books enabling one to study the layout of the city, I honestly believe that I could negotiate between the landmarks if I were suddenly plopped down in the center of the city.<P>I have only two complaints with the book. First, the first section of the book features both historical and modern views of the same areas. I would have liked to see a lot more of that. For me, these were by far the most interesting photos in the book, and I wouldn't have minded if this constituted the bulk of the book. Second, while the pictures are of the highest imaginable quality, most were taken from approximately the same elevation. If one compares the photographs here to those in Jan Morris's OVER EUROPE, you will find in the latter a much greater variation in elevation. In the Morris book, they were able to many instances to use a remote control balloon with a camera to get much, much lower than Cameron was in this volume. Pierre Salinger's intro details some of the difficulties they had in getting permission for low-level photographs. Minor quibbles, but I do believe that more variety in the book would have increased its attractiveness and value.</span>

                    <span>Really, it is rather rare and pleasant to come across the books devoted to aerial photos of Paris. I have only one more. And it is twice pleasant to have such a solid and interesting book. Besides it contains good and well done photos, this book is intersting because you have the chance to compare Paris of 80-s and present Paris if you have been there. If not - no way, it will help you to get more about Paris when you'll have the chance.</span>

                    <span>This book is a beautiful collection of photographs of Paris, from the sky.<P>The aerial photography is wonderfully executed, and shows all different sides of Paris. I lived in Paris as a college student for a few months. I fell in love with the city and I purchased this book because I wanted something to remember the beauty of Paris by. This book did not disappoint. It presents a clear view of Paris, a city often shrouded by rose-colored glasses. <P>I especially enjoyed the comparitive photographs that are included in the collection. Some photographs show Paris of 100 years ago, and again from the same view, modern Paris. <P>The city of lights is beautifully presented in this well-done collection. If you hold Paris close to your heart, you will love this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Because Moulin de la Galette is now hidden by buildings from 19th and 20th century it is not possible any more to see it correctly. This high place for painting history (Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec) can be seen in a very impressive way thanks to the authors of this book. Same for "Les arènes de Lutèce", the roman circus located in the middle of Latin District. Nobody ever see this most ancien monument of Paris unless you enter the place ... or you buy this book. Another good reason to buy this book: some pictures are displayed close to similar aerial views taken 70 years ago! This is especially impressive for Les Halles. For those of us who remember this "coeur de Paris" will feel something when they will see Les Halles "before", "during the demolition process" and "after". One cannot say this book is "artistic". Neither the layout nor the pictures themselves have the quality of Artus-Bertrand. Despite this limitation to my enthusiasm I recommand buying this book either as a gift or as a souvenir from a Paris you never see.</span>

                    <span>A correction to the correction: There are, in fact, several books containing aerial views of Paris. The operative words in my previous review were "low level." It took Salinger and Cameron months to get permission to make a single low level flight over Paris. Some of the photos were taken from altitudes as low as 1200 feet. It is these shots which make ABOVE PARIS unique. And believe me, it is unique.</span>
