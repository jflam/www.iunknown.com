                <span id="Label1">This book is designed to help general Windows developers and developers of image processing-based applications (including desktop publishing programs) with highly focused solutions using the Black Book approach. Hundreds of graphics coding examples and tips and tricks are provided. It features a complete presentation of specific DirectDraw-based solutions, computer graphics algorithms, and a primer on computer graphics theory, which is also helpful for game developers. The book also teaches how to control every aspect of Windows bitmaps, reliably render/capture images to the printer and other devices, and compressing and decompressing images. It shows in detail how to use the GDI functions including Windows 2000-specific GDI functions, such as the new alpha blending support, and creating advanced user interfaces. </span>

                    <span>Need I say more? If so... This book is about 3 to 4 inches thick (~1200 pages) and covers just about anything you want to know about windows graphics from creating a bitmap and putting a dot on the screen to morphing and distorting images. When you get done with this book you could easily write your own Photo Editor. Full of code examples and explanations. Very well written. I own 30+ programming books and this (as well as the other Coriolis Black Books) is one of my favorites. I would say perfect for a Newbie all the way up to a Power User. I have been looking for a book like this since Windows 95 came out. Bottom Line: BUY THIS BOOK!!!</span>

                    <span>Frankly amazing to me that in a Win graphics book of this size and, in other respects, scope and excellence, that neither "metafile" nor "enhanced metafile" is in the index, nor is there anywhere else a mention that I could find. Consistent with this, all of the metafile-related GDI functions are missing as well---hardly a "comprehensive treatment of the Windows GDI" as stated in the Introduction. It seems to me that this rather large omission deserves at least a tiny explanation or justification somewhere, but there isn't one...instead it appears we are pretending that metafiles are not part of the Win2K GDI. A bit surreal!<P>DLS</span>

                    <span>This is a mammoth undertaking that was necessary in today's market of Windows-dominated graphics applications. This book may be too much for a beginner. However, for the serious graphics developer, this is a must-have reference and handbook all-in-one. Before seeing this book, my favourite hard-core computer graphics book was "Computer Graphics" by James D. Foley and Andries van Dam. This "black book" does an better job when it comes to the Microsoft Windows-specific approach of doing things. From page one it jumps into a direct explanation of topics. It cuts through the chase when it comes to developing high-performance applications. The examples are in C++ however as a Delphi developer, I used it effectively in a major project that involved both video capturing and image processing in the medical software industry.</span>
