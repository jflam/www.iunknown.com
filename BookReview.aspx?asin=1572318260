                <span id="Label1">As the latest installment in the series of training kits from Microsoft Press, <I>Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Database Implementation Training Kit</I> focuses on how to work with data in SQL Server 7 and prepares you for the 70-029 Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) exam. SQL Server is a mammoth product, and administrating it is far different from mere data manipulation. This title offers a self-paced program for learning how to create and access SQL Server databases with foresight and skill.<p> The book begins with a discussion on Transact-SQL--the Microsoft flavor of SQL used to work with SQL Server. During the first few chapters, the book shows you how to create database objects, implement constraints and rules, and work with indexes. Clear syntax diagrams and straightforward examples help make these important issues more intuitive. The course moves on to multi-table queries, explaining join types, subqueries, and cursor manipulation. While this section covers a lot of material, part of the appendix offers a review of basic querying concepts.<p> As you progress through the chapter lessons, you'll learn about locking scenarios, transaction management, distributed database configurations, and stored procedures. Each lesson clearly frames the information to be learned and includes an overview and summary section. In addition, review questions prompt you to play with real-world scenarios while an accompanying CD-ROM provides multimedia presentations of key concepts. This training kit addresses the core database competencies essential for anyone looking to exploit SQL Server's powerful capabilities. <I>-- Stephen Plain</I></span>

                    <span>This is a pretty good test preparation book. It is the only volume I read cover to cover to prepare for the System Administration for Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 exam (70-028). I had spot read several other volumes to prepare a maintenance guide for SQL Server 7.0 installations so had become familiar with admin topics on the job. I did find after passing the Admin test that my margin of safety would have been greater if I had read the companion volume on Implementing a Database Design on Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 (Exam 70-029) before I tested. It is clear that you really need to work through both the Administration and Design books to be prepared for either of Microsoft's SQL 7.0 Exams.</span>

                    <span>I am always amazed with the training kits from MS Press, with no exception of this kit. Buy this kit and you'll get a 4 months trial edition CD of SQL Server 7.0, a complimentary CD with exercise and multimedia files, a really good book from the Microsoft experts - concise, complete, crystal clear, and cover all materials needed for Exam 70-028. <P>But, you won't get any exam simulators that you'll probably have from the other publishers. Don't worry, because in my opinion not a single exam simulator can help someone passing this exam! This exam is an all-in-one nightmare you can expect from any kind of written computer certification exams. The questions are extremely long as well as the exam time - 3 hours (even the answers are very long, too!) Exam takers will certainly be knocked-out if they don't have real good hands-on experience and theory in design and implementation of SQL Server 7.0 or the previous releases of SQL Server. <P>Using this book alone combined with my previous experience of SQL Server 6.5 and MS Access 97 I had successfully passed this *!@ (read: terrified) exam on my first try several weeks ago to complete my MCDBA title! :) CCNA, MCDBA, MCSE+I</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book with the 70-029 exam in mind. Dislike other reviewers I didn't have any experience in Microsoft SQL Server, I was migrating from the AI/X DB2 world. This book is superficial in important aspects like index tunning and distributed queries. I finally had to adopt a different strategy based on sample tests and Microsoft Books On Line to pass the 70-029 with a less than satisfactory 755 mark.</span>

                    <span>It should have 4.5 stars. This book is great for learning everything you need to know for getting SQL Sever 7.0 up and running (and I mean running not walking). This book is a well structured course that takes you through all the way for implementing databases on SQL Server. The only con I found is that It promotes Client-server arquitecture and has no mention on n-tier system (except for the beginning where it's barely mentioned). But at the end this is a very good book for learning SQL 7 administration .</span>

                    <span>Everything the other reviewers have said is true. Regardless, I looked for something better and came back to this book. Today I passed 70-029 and added an MCDBA to my MCSE. Be prepared to be tenacious with this material. It took me a year of catch-as-catch can study. This book should be your main study material with Transcender exams your proof of understanding. However, if you're just starting, go directly to SQL 2000 and skip SQL 7.0. From a job perspective, the best part of SQL is that it's in demand, and there aren't many people who can pass the exam.</span>
