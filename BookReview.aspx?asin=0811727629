                <span id="Label1">For anyone in North America (and elsewhere) who is hooked on fly-fishing and pursues it past the initial stages of tangled lines, spontaneous river dunkings, and emptied bank accounts, there is one goal that dangles with a tantalizing glimmer just out of reach--the golden ring that spurs anglers on to perfect a variety of tricky casts, study entomological texts deep into the night, and wade through sleep with visions of lurking grizzlies, monster rainbows, and rivers paved with salmon. That ultimate goal is the final frontier of earthbound territory: Alaska, the angler's paradise. So if you dream of one day stepping off a bush plane somewhere in the Alaskan outback, you might as well start planning now with Dan Heiner's guide to the state's nearly limitless sport-fishing opportunities. Heiner's anecdote- sprinkled and info-packed guide takes a narrative approach to fly-fishing this vast area; his experience is related through stories as well as advice. Initial chapters include tips on equipment, travel, accommodations, and, of course, bears. But the real meat is about the fish and fishing: which species to chase, when and where to chase them, and how to bring them to net. And if that's not enough to set the gears in motion, the color photos are sure to leave you drooling...or dialing up Alaska Airlines stat. <i>--Langdon Cook</i></span>

                    <span>The greatest reason for mystery about Alaska's fishing lies not so much with the size and diversity of the state, as with the reluctance of writers to divulge what they consider "secrets" -- for fear that they will turn into zones of combat, and these authors then become the scorn of the populace. As a result, most writings reveal little more than the most popular, widely known locations, and common information on techniques and fly patterns. Dan Heiner's book is more of this same style: but here, he seems to relate his experiences and feelings, predominantly as a guided client -- urging others to do the same. He eludes to particular places and techniques, but does not tell the reader where or what they are -- instead telling them to get a guide for that. In several instances, he baits the reader by saying he is excluding several locations from his list of best rivers because of fishing pressure. The reader doesn't know which ones he is referring to, but several of those left off the list are among the most productive silvers salmon streams in the world -- no secret. While guided lodging is one way to enjoy fishing,this is not for the majority of fishermen or prospective readers, and Heiner does not adequately cover the logistics and locations for countless camping/rafting/boating and other fly-in experiences. His coverage of fly patterns, while more thorough with respect to rainbow trout, is substantially different from what one would want to target other salmon species. Several of the maps, for the western rivers (Goodnews and Kanektok Rivers), and Kodiak Island misrepresented the location of major lakes and drainage outlets. The book provides very common knowledge, replete with obligatory campfire tales about bears, and would be appropriate for those who prefer the comfort and catering of a lodge experience (and can afford it). Very little more is provided to those seeking adventure.</span>

                    <span>If you are planning a fly fishing trip to Alaska, this book provides useful information. The Bristol Bay drainage is the focus of the book and each key area (Iliamna, Katmai, Alaska Peninsula, Wood River-Tikchik Lakes) is covered in brief, along with information on the Goodnews, Kanektok and Kenai rivers and Kodiak Island. Also included is advice on fly selection, gear, etc. The author has obviously fished a great many of the rivers in Alaska and has shared some of what he knows.</span>
