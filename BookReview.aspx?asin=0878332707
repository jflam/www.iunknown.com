                <span id="Label1">ESPN: The Uncensored History is the first book to provide a critical analysis of the 20-year history of Americas original and largest sports network. Through information gleaned from internal documents, police and court records, and interviews with network employees, on-air talent, producers and executives, this book investigates the inside story of ESPN and brings it to you uncensored.  <P>In the tradition of John Helyars landmark book about the business of pro baseball, Lords of the Realm, ESPN: The Uncensored History recreates in vivid, no-holds-barred detail the pivotal events that shaped the network in the first two decades.<BR> Among the books highlights:  <P>&#61623; The real story of the networks founding and very early days;<BR> &#61623; A revealing portrait of the networks most compelling personalities, such as Keith Olbermann, Dan Patrick, Chris Berman, Stuart Scott, and the conflicts between them;<BR> &#61623; the power struggles between management and talent;<BR> &#61623; an unsparing account of the networks troubles with sexual harassment, racial discrimination, drug use and gambling addictions.   Tracing its meteoric rise from its improbable inception through its evolution into a slick media outlet reaching more than 60 million homes through over 26,000 cable providers, this book evenly examines the profound influence ESPN has had on its industry and the culture at large.</span>

                    <span>If you have spent years watching nearly every Sportscenter as I have, then you will love learning about the history of the network and its personalities. But to be honest, I thought the early chapters moved slowly and there were ambiguous parts where it was hard to tell what was fact and what was the author's version of the events. I also agree with an earlier review that it is a bit presumptuous to state that certain reporters and anchors are "the best" talent, reporters, etc....<P>However, like I said, if you can't get enough of the network(s), the magazine, and the Web site, then this is a quick read and an enjoyable one.</span>

                    <span>ESPN: The Uncensored History by sports journalist Michael Freeman is an eye-opening, bare-all look at the global telecommunications network that since its inception in 1979 as the "Entertainment and Sports Programming Network", has gone on to become virtually synonymous with televised sports. From its relatively humble origins, ESPN has gone on to expand into additional offerings for the dedicated sports enthusiast including ESPN2, ESPN Classic Sports, ESPNews, and ESPN Magazine. Extensively researched, ESPN: The Uncensored History presents a fascinating, candid, revealing story in clear, unambiguous, and highly evocative language. A singularly memorable and compelling "tell-all" book, ESPN: The Uncensored History is strongly recommended reading for all sports buffs.</span>

                    <span>I think Freeman's book is a good history of how ESPN became the media giant that it is (I was born in 1982-- i cant imagine life without ESPN), but the book focused WAY too much on the sexual harassment angle, and it bogs down the story.</span>

                    <span>I'd read mixed reviews when Freeman's history first came out, so I wasn't anticipating a great book. Unfortunately, ...ESPN: The Uncensored History... fell fall short of even my rather tempered expectations.<P>A large part of the problem is that ...Uncensored... can't decide whether it is a corporate retrospective or a tell-all expose. Freeman spends the first third of the book on a rather dull detailing of how ESPN was founded, the close calls it encountered in finding financing and trying to stay afloat, and the power struggle that ensued among the founding fathers. Only the principals and their family would find this portion even mildly interesting.<P>As the book progresses, it switches into expose-mode, teasing the reader with hints of scandals behind the scenes. However, even though the author spends page after page dwelling haughtily on the personal foibles of ESPN personnel, particularly focusing on a culture which seemingly encouraged sexual harassment, Freeman mostly avoids naming names, with one very notable exception.<P>Freeman then goes back and forth, between a dry rendering of ESPN's corporate evolution from a backwater independent cable channel to the crown jewel of Disney's purchase of ABC, and a bowdlerized tale of malfeasance among the employees of ESPN.<P>Occasionally, Freeman tries to focus on some of the anchors which the so many viewers have seen so often, but even then, the portraits seem two-dimensional. Other than Mike Tirico, who is portrayed as a Jekyll-and-Hyde family man/sexual predator, and Keith Olbermann, cast as the tortured genius, the sketches of the on-air personalities seem rather hollow.<P>All in all, disappointing, and not worth the time.</span>

                    <span>I am a fan of ESPN and enjoyed learning about the history of the company (channel, network, whatever you want to call it). I particularly enjoyed the first quarter of the book that focused on the original entrepeneur that started the network. However, after that I thought the author focused too much on the bad parts of the history, particularly the sexual harassment incidents. While these seem very serious and should have been mentioned, I don't think they should have overshadowed everything else in the company's history in the last decade.</span>
