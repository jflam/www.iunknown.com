                    <span>A story about a teenager who is in danger of spinning totally out of control before he manages to grow up (boy, is he really screwed up). But he really cares for his little sister. Just when he is about to lose it completely, he gets another grip on life and does not go over the edge, because he realizes his dear little sister would  go down with him. What a relief, you hate see someone destroy himself(not to mention a great little girl). </span>

<br />The Catcher in the Rye is a book about a young man named Holden Caulfield who gets traumatized by the death of his brother Allie. This story is narrated by Holden himself as he tells the story to a Psychiatrist in a psychiatric hospital. 
<br />
<br />Holden is a troubled young adult who is afraid of growing up because he doesn't like grown ups and he wishes he could stay a child. Throughout the book Holden describes why he doesn't like grownups (I don't want to completely ruin the book for you so I won't tell you any reasons.) and why he loves children. 
<br />
<br />When I read Catcher in the Rye I was really moved at how J.D. Salinger used various symbols throughout the book to help you get inside the mind of Holden Caulfield. The main symbol in the book when holden talks of being the catcher in the rye and standing on the edge of the field keeping the children from falling off. What Holden means by this is that he just wants to keep kids from falling off the cliff and dying (child dying and becoming an adult). Holden beleives children are innocent and he respects them completely. I really thought it was neat that although Holden curses every five to six words throughout the book, when he talks about any child he doesn't curse at all. This is one way that J.D. Salinger shows holdens respect for children in the book. 
<br />
<br />I must add that even though I absolutely loved this book, friends of mine said they didn't like the book because there were too many symbols and they didn't catch them all therefore the book didn't make much sense to them. I must say this could be a problem for many people. I have read The Catcher in the Rye several times and every time it never fails but I seem to catch something new that I missed before. This is one of the many reasons why this book is one of my favorites. Give it try! Another recent Amazon purchase I loved is 'THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition' by Richard Perez -- it also takes place in New York City and is about loneliness and not fitting in -- and reminds me in certain ways of The Catcher In the Rye.

                    <span>One of those classics that I read as a teenager. I don't remember my reaction then (except for the nagging feeling that it was something I was supposed to appreciate because it was a classic and because I was right around Holden's age). So here I am 40 years old, reading it again. And I think it's magnificent. As a teenager, I probably thought Salinger was a lot like me because of the voice he has created for Holden. As an adult, I think Salinger is a brilliant stylist because he obviously "captured" the voice of an angst-ridden (and for good reason!) teenager. There is so much complicated stuff to consider amidst a seemingly uncomplicated tale. And it's always fascinating to consider what literature sticks around and what doesn't. Just for grins, I checked out the Pulitzer site and discovered that Conrad Richter's The Town won in the same year that Catcher in the Rye was eligible. Makes you wonder which 2005 titles will still be around 55 years hence.</span>

                    <span>Incessant whining and complaining are all that comprise this book. I cannot for the life of me understand why it is such a well-loved novel, or how it even came close to being considered a classic! I had to read this in high school and I HATED every moment of it. To this day, every time I hear the title I cringe. I think this book should be forever banned from the list of "Classic, Must-Read Literature".</span>

                    <span>I have no idea why this book is considered to be a so called "Classic Of Modern Literature". I have read it twice over a 25 year period and I still fail to be impressed by it. It concerns an 16 year old teenager named Holden Caulfield who flunks out of School and rather than facing the wrath of his parents he decides to rent a Hotel room in New York for 5 days. A great portion of the book is Caulfield describing his Rampant Teenage Hormonal Desires and yet when he finally gets a consenting adult female in his room he declines to sleep with her!!! This is very strange considering his obsession with older women which he describes on his train journey on the way to New York where he meets a mother of one of his classmates and is sexually attracted to her. The rest of the book sees Caulfield trying to get drunk and whining about how everybody else in this world is a "phoney " except of course himself. He also displays a fascination with homosexuality and one begins to wonder if he is in reality suppressing his true Sexuality .Read this book if you want to see how a 16 year old teenager has yet to discover that he can run but he can't hide from himself no matter how  hard he tries.</span>
