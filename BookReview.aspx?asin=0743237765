                <span id="Label1"><P>There has been a revolution in neuroscience over the last ten years, and, as Debra Niehoff shows in the first book to examine violence from a complete biological perspective, now is the right time to consider how we are going to use the achievements of that revolution to reduce the level of violence in our society.<P>What is this new perspective that Niehoff presents? Simply that by understanding human biology we can control violence in our society. The debate over the roles of "nature" and "nurture" is over. Our genes do affect the likelihood of violence. And so does our mature brain chemistry. And so does our environment, as well as the nurturing we get as children and the social life we have with our peers. Everything affects us, but no one element is the sole determining factor. The real story that biology has shown us is that we recreate ourselves all the time, even as adults. Everything is involved in the ongoing process of life.<P>Niehoff brings together a wide range of research to show that we understand behavior in a totally unprecedented way, and that our ability to control violence effectively has never been greater. The awful consequences of violence for victims and perpetrators are not an outcome we have to accept. The vicious circle that connects bad genes, bad environment, and bad brain chemistry in a kind of feedback loop can be broken. As Niehoff shows, creating a caring, safe social environment is almost always the first step in halting the train of aggression.<P>The received wisdom is that psychological disorders such as violent aggression are too complicated, too intractable to be cured. In far too many cases, incarceration is the only solution we live with. But do so many people have to be in prison? Aren't there cheaper, more humane, and more civilized ways of dealing with violence now? Niehoff makes many surprising, fascinating, and provocative observations on the new science of violence.<P>Niehoff is eminently qualified to present these breakthrough ideas. A Johns Hopkins-trained neuroscientist and a biomedical communications professional, she has composed a book of vision and courage. More than merely a polemicist, here is that rare writer who can objectively and clearly present a whole new area of science and identify its explosive implications. Niehoff has a timely, powerful message. She demands science, and also compassion, in the face of violence.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>"The Biology of violence" by Debra Niehoff is the best book on the subject I have read. I've been through over 300 books in the last three months looking for a neuro-chemical link between aggression and violence, specifically "impulsive" aggression, that from which I have, at times, suffered its unpleasant effects.<P>Niehoff clearly shows her education and scientific background through her writing. This book is throughougly and adeptly referenced down to the smallest detail. Every sentence informs, every page educates. I learned, for example, about the role of serotonin, the master hormone, and norepinephrine, and how they keep each other in check. One controls aggression, the other fear, both having specific receptors which, it is to be discovered, sometimes receive signals from other neurotransmitters and hormones (and also caffeine!). The role of environmental factors is given a fair and impartial comparison in conjunction with the actions of the body's hormones, increasing Niehoff's conclusion and credibility.<P>There is far too much information to be absorbed briefly; a detailed study is in order, well worth its rewards. I have found this work to be monumental, and while not solving the total violence problem, will at least lead the reader to make better choices at the root: the diet (foods are converted to make certain hormones and neurotransmitters). Also of interest is the treatment of insulin and its role in the body. A complete, highly informative work, unparalleled in depth and understandability by the educated layperson. Top recommendation!</span>

                    <span>I have read widely in neuropsychology and neurobiology over the last five years by necessity. This book is written by an expert with a thorough grasp of her material and the English language. This is a book with the depth needed by professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, law enforcement, probation, attorneys, judges, etc.) and the accessibility needed by laymen. Niehoff's analogies simplify complex interrelationships. Her analysis is compassionate, realistic, and sound. Her discussion of working memory and aggressive behavior is indispensible for parents of TBI children. Her discussion of PTSD and of the interplay between nature and nurture are lucid and compelling. She has an excellent introduction to brain functioning that readers will readily appreciate. When I consider the strength of the book I felt that the conclusion was somewhat weak; however, this should not deter potential readers. In another books, I would have considered the conclusion strong. I think highly enough of this book to have two copies. One for my bookshelf and the other to loan to those concerned with aggression and violence.</span>
