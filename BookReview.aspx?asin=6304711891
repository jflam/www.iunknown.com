                <span id="Label1">Between his high-octane debut, <I>Bad Boys</I>, and 1998's wannabe blockbuster <I>Armageddon</I>, hotshot director Michael Bay forged his dubious reputation with this crowd-pleasing action extravaganza. In it a psychotically disgruntled war hero (Ed Harris) seizes the island prison of Alcatraz and threatens to wage chemical warfare against nearby San Francisco unless the government publicly recognizes the men who were killed under Harris's top-secret command. Nicolas Cage plays the biochemist who teams up with the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz (Sean Connery) in an attempt to foil Harris's terrorist scheme. As one might expect, what follows is an action-packed barrage of bullets, bodies, and climactic confrontations, replete with enough plot contrivances to give even the most jaded action fan cause for alarm. It's a load of hooey, but the cast is obviously having a grand old time, and there's enough wit to make the recycled action sequences tolerable. If you're ordering this movie on DVD, be careful with the volume knobs on your home-theater sound systems, because <I>The Rock</I> could cause partial hearing loss and structural damage to your home. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>The rock starring Nicholas cage, Sean Connery and Ed harris is a modern day classic with all the characteristics of what makes a film great. Cage plays an FBI chemical weapons specialist selected to join the elite Navy Seals team in a bid to overthrow a group of mercanaries and neutralize the threat of a battery of VX poison gas rockets being fired upon the unsuspecting citizens of San Fransisco.Connery however plays the part of an ex SAS agent imprisoned by the US government for his knowledge of the corrupt goings on in the Whitehouse. The only man ever to escape from Alcatraz now comes back to haunt the Government that took thirty years of his life being the only man alive to know how to get into the once feared penitentiary. He Plays a vital part of this fantastic movie showing every bit of skill acquired throughout his distinguished career and not once showing his age. I rate this as a classic action film and recommend it to everyone. the great acting, plot and music score are all well within the confines what anyone would expect from any Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer production. i end this with a quote from the movie by ED harris , if you have any doubts about seeing this film "i hope this elevates your thinking"</span>

                    <span>This DVD is superb! The transfer is brilliant, the extra's are amazing, and the film is one of the best action movies ever made! The Film: The plot of the movie is as follows. A Marine General (Ed Harris) steals some chemical weapons and takes the old prison of Alcatraz as his base of operations. He trains the weapons on San Fransisco, and tells the government that he wants money to be given to the families of the Marines killed under his command. The government turns to an FBI chemical specialist (Nicolas Cage), an imprisoned ex-SAS soldier (Sean Connery) and a team of Navy SEALs (led by Michael Biehn) to get rid of the threat. Needless to say, there are a lot of explosions and gun battles during the course of the assault on Alcatraz.<P>The Extras: The extras on this edition are brilliant! The best feature is The Do's and Don'ts of HollyWood Gunplay, hosted by Harry Humphries and Marshall Teague (he plays one of the SEALs in the movie). It shows some of the mistakes made in films during gun sequences, and how dangerous these can be. Other extras include a brilliant documentary about the prison itself, and some great info about the special effects in the movie.<P>All in All, a great buy, and one of the best DVD's available!</span>

                    <span>This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.<P>In this director approved Criterion Collection release, we are treated to some excellent materials.<P>The film follows the story of Francis Hummel (Ed Harris), a retired marine who takes hostages on Alcatraz island. His demand is that the families of soldiers killed in covert operations be given compensation. He treatens to launch VX nerve gas into the city of San Francisco if his demands are not met. A navy SEAL team is sent in to neutralize the threat. Helping out is Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a chemical weapons expert, and John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz.<P>The film has great acting and there are some good laughs in the film also. There are many action packed scenes including a car chase through the streets of San Francisco and the cars are often airborne when they go on the hills.<P>The Criterion DVD has many special features and is on a deouble disc set.<P>Disc 1 contains the movie with optional audio commentary by Director Michael Bay, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Technical advisor Harry Humphries, and actors Nicholas Cage and Ed Harris.<P>Disc 2 contains a theatrical trailer and TV spots, a video interview with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, a blooper reel, a special about the film's premiere on Alcatraz, scenes from a TV special "Secrets of Alcatraz" that contains interviews with actual former inmates and a history of the island from Native American times to modern times.<P>There is a special "Dos and Don'ts of Hollywood Gunplay" with the film's technical advisor Harry Humpries and Marshall Teague. This specail contains depictions of errors made in action films regarding the use of guns it emphasises saftey and common mistakes including gun drawing techniques that don't "work" such as the "gangster grab" or the "wyatt earp pull".<P>There are also 2 features on the films special effects. One is on the dive sequence and the other is on other effects, like the cable car crash. There are also storyboards, production stills and drawings.<P>This is a must biy for fans of the movie as well a fans of the Criterion Collection.</span>

                    <span>The Michael Bay - Jerry Bruckheimer formula, like that for the James Bond films, is pretty well set: lots of stuff blowing up, lots of bodies flying through the air, a cast dominated by strong male leads, women are very secondary, a very dramatic music score, lots of foul language and a very right of center political outlook (the military are always the heroes and anyone who questions the heroes' judgment are pansies or some other leftwing radical type). However, the James Bond films always had a sly sense of humor about themselves. Bond might save the American Space program, Fort Knox, Miami and the planet Earth, but there was always an underlying message: This is just for fun folks. The Bay-Bruckheimer films, however, have the delusion that they're actually fighting the battles depicted on screen. There's a lot of overwrought music, emotional scenes between the characters and slow motion closups of the hero(es) walking or running towards their battle with evil. The Rock, in this way, is no different. A team of marines, led by General Frank Hummell (Ed Harris) and disgusted with the way the U.S. Government has neglected the families of those soldiers killed in illegal missions abroad, has taken 81 hostages on Alcatraz, threatening to lauch nerve gas rockets into San Francisco unless reparations are paid to those soldiers' survivors. Heavy, heavy stuff.<BR>However, injected into this serious mix is none other than the best James Bond himself -- Sean Connery. Even in the more serious early Bonds, Connery always managed to convey to the audience that they were supposed to have fun during these films. Bruckheimer and Bay do their best to elevate what is essentially Saturday morning action serial material into Wagnerian opera. But there is Connery, putting all the action into perspective by not taking anyting too seriously and grounding the material by recognizing what it really is: sheer entertainment.<P>Bay, Bruckheimer and company keep trying to push the fact that Ed Harris' desperate General Hummell is a man of honor, a real hero, etc., etc. Anyone who questions his judgment, like the hapless, simpering Presidential Chief of Staff at the first briefing scene, is shot down as a liberal wimp who would never make the sacrifices that Harris' character made for America and should shut up before one of the real men in the room shoot him (I wonder what George McGovern, Daniel Inouye and other liberals who fought for and were decorated for fighting for their country think of this kind of portrayal). Never mind that the General threatens to kill thousands of San Franciscans with nerve gas. Bay-Bruckheimer have stacked the deck by having the great Ed Harris play General Hummell, giving the character an inherent integrity that can't help but make him sympathetic. Fox News isn't this slanted.<P>In walks Connery who, in his big confrontation scene with Harris, gets right to the heart of the matter in a few lines. He correctly says that he doesn't see how "you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million" and sums up Hummell's actions as "an act of lunacy." In one fell swoop, Connery slaps the collective message of the film across the face and shows that terrorism is terrorism, no matter if it's done by decorated U.S. soldiers with a legitimate gripe against the government. It's fairly certain that Connery, an executive producer of the film, purposely torpedoed Bay-Bruckheimer's testosterone toned view of the world.<P>In The Rock, Connery proves, once again, that an actor with a strong enough presence and a large amount of talent doesn't need to scream and shout to give a great performance. Nicholas Cage, Connery's co-star, bellows and shouts like he's on fire most of the film ("How, in Zeus' BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell?!?!?!?!?!?" -- god, give it a rest, Nick!). Cage certainly isn't alone -- the rest of the cast buys into Bay-Bruckheimer's "this film is the most important thing you'll ever watch" mentality. However, Sean Connery, with his charm, wit and grace, throws a bucket of cold water over the entire proceedings and reminds everyone that the film is what it is and nothing more: a technically superb action film that exists merely to entertain ... period.<P>A final note: Criterion has always produced the finest quality DVD's loaded with many, many interesting extras. Most of the films Criterion has released are classics: Notorious, Roshamon, Ikiru, Yojimbo, Charade, Rebecca, etc. I enjoyed The Rock, but why did Criterion deem it good enough to rank with the other films they've released on DVD? Criterion has been selective in its releases and The Rock lowers the bar.</span>
