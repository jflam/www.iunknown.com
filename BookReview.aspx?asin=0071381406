                    <span>Jack Welch is no stranger to the world of business.  In his book, "Jack Welch on Leadership:  Executive Lessons from the Master CEO", he hit the mark on what it truly takes to be a leader in any organization.  In this book, he has once again shared his expertise and wisdom in the world of business.  As a business management trainer, counsellor and consultant, I can honestly say that when it comes to business and strong leadership, "The Jack Welch Lexicon of Leadership" ranks near the very top of my list in providing quality, insightful business philosophy.  I find myself quoting to my students "infamous words of wisdom" discovered in many of Welch's previous books.  From globalization to effective customer service, Welch shares a wealth of advice on a vast number of topics. I particularly enjoyed the section on the significance of the Internet as the Internet has, indeed, changed the way we do business in today's marketplace.  "The Lexicon of Leadership", which to me is like a "business bible", is highly recommended reading material.  It makes an extraordinary reference guide and is most deserving of a five star rating.</span>

                    <span>As Dean and Professor at the Alan Shawn Feinstein Graduate School at Johnson & Wales University I have adopted Mr. krames book as the major theme for our 700 MBA students.  The succint, valid, and sophisticated manner in which Mr. Krames transmits Mr. Welch's ideas and philosphies is remarkable.  The next best thing to Jack Welch is Jeffrey Krames and this book is the inner psyche of one of the world's greatest business legends.  I strongly recommend this book to instructors, business leaders, and managers in every field.  It is a one stop shopping trip of the wisdom and intellectual stimulation provided by Jack Welch through his alter ego, Jeffrey Krames.  This book should be on the list of every "Great Business Books" series for the world's top business schools and on the shelf of every manager anywhere in the world.</span>

                    <span>This is a great find for the reader who wants to truly understand what makes Jack Welch such an icon.  For years, I've been subjected to "Welchisms", loosely tossed about by everyone from managemenet consultants to managerial wannabes.   <br>In "The Jack Welch Lexicon of Leadership", the author provides a comprehensive look beyond the man to his underlying principles.  He discusses the significance of each and highlights Welch's initiatives within the perspective of the man's career as a trailblazer.  Best of all, it's succinct, which is more than I can say about some of the amateur "Welchism" purveyors I've encountered over the years!</span>

                    <span>This author puts Jack Welch's tools to succeed in business and in life in the reader's hands.  It really hits the mark by accurately blending practicality and inspiration.  <p>Comprehensive in its coverage, this book takes you through all the phases of modern business yet it is timeless in its application.  Truely, a book to be referred to over and over.  A real gem that will age well, because the lessons learned here gain in depth and significance as time passes.<p>As a sales consultant and trainer, I find this content provides the reader a roadmap to success and enables them to control their destiny.</span>
