                    <span>Martin Blumenson's has created a fascinating and surprisingly readable biography of the World War II hero, General George Patton. Blumenson has taken the General's diaries, personal and official letters and combined them with letters written to him and newspaper articles written about him. These are arranged in chronological order. <p>The period covered by this book was the most active of Patton's lifetime. In the last three years of his life, Patton had adventures enough for several lifetimes. After playing a major part in the conquest of North Africa, then Sicily, Patton was sidelined for nearly a year after the slapping incidents. During this time a disinformation campaign was put forth to convince the Nazis that Patton would command a non-existent army group that was to invade the south of France. A month after D Day Patton took command of the recently formed Third Army and drove across Europe, playing a pivotal role in the Battle of the Bulge. <p>In this book, Blumenson splices together the actual documents written by and about Patton as the actual events unfolded. Despite being an amalgamation of material from so many different sources, the book reads like a novel. Blumenson very rarely adds his own editorial commentary. This is done in a way that enhances the flow of the narrrative. My only complaint is that it frequently is difficult to determine where these asides begin and end. This readability is what makes the book great and unique. Having read many other biographies that over-analyze and inject the authors' personal opinion into the narrative it is refreshing to simply have the facts laid out in front of you. <p>Patton had an amusing tendency to give sarcastic nicknames to his rivals and adversaries. Omar Bradley is "the tentmaker," both for his Arab name and his tendency towards caution, Eisenhower is "divine destiny" for his political ambitions. General W. Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's hated chief of staff, is variously referred to as Beadle and Beetle. At the same time he is privately mocking these people, Patton takes great pains to praise and flatter them publicly. He even admits to himself in his diary that he is a shameless bootlicker and rear-end kisser when necessary. Patton justifies his actions  because he feels he must be a sycophant to fulfill his destiny of leading men in battle. Patton even advises his son (who was a West Point Cadet at the time) that the way to advancement at the Academy is to seek out the Commandant and Superintendent and suck-up to them and their wives as much as possible.<p>I had low expectations for this book. Every other collection of the letters of famous men  I have read has been interesting in spots but unreadable as a whole.Even the famous collected letters of Pliny the Younger are mostly dreary reports to the emperor and uninteresting notes to friends. For Blumenson to have created such an entertaining and informative document from similar material is a remarkable achievement.</span>

                    <span>I used this book while writing a paper for my Graduate level International Relations class.  Although it is not considered a classic, it possess and delivers enormously relevant information regarding one of the greatest and most controversial master of war acknowledged in modern history.  I commend this book as an pleasurable read, as well as an highly effective intellectual reference instrument.</span>

                    <span>Although a fan of General Patton, I hesitated to purchase this book.  The title indicated a daunting book for reference only, rather than one for reading.  But one shouldn't judge a book by its cover; I was wrong.  "The Patton Papers" is surprisingly readable, and a must for anyone who would seek to understand this American hero.  From diary entries to personal letters, Martin Blumenson weaves a fascinating story that makes one feel one is a part of the Seventh and Third Army staff!  I recommend that you read a biography first ("Patton: A Genius for War" is excellent) so that you have an overview of Patton's life.  A word of caution: reading this book will dampen your enthusiasm for the movie "Patton," as it makes clear the multitude of historical inaccuracies.  A really great book!</span>

                    <span>I have read both volumes of the Patton Papers and together they are an excellent history of America's greatest General flowing mostly from his hand (compiled by Martin Blumenson).  For those of us to young to have lived during his time, reading what General Patton has written is invaluable.  These books give this opportunity.</span>

                    <span>Martin Blumenson probably doesn't enough credit for stitching together the diaries of this amazingly complex man and military mind. Then again, it seems few if any have gained the unparalleled access to GSP Jr.'s letters and diaries. Taken of course in conjunction with Volume 1 (1885-1940), one sees a vivid picture of a tremendously gifted military man, a person so deeply spiritual in one moment, yet ravenous for the destruction of his enemies the next. Three things Blumenson highlighted that I found most thoughtful and salient: (1) Patton's deep, exacting grasp of military history -- seemingly, all the way back to when the first caveman bashed the other with a club; (2) his all-encompassing mantra of a self-destiny that must be fulfilled, and (3) how completely wedded he was to the dictum that the most disciplined and principled troops will win the day. Blumenson's work takes the common, two-dimensional mainstream picture of Patton -- slash-and-dash tank commander with a penchant for being a martinet -- and produces instead a tremendously deep, textured portrait of one of the most intriguing military figures of the century. Lastly, Blumenson's exacting eye gives the reader a strong rendition of the men of "The Greatest Generation" -- before they were called that -- through Patton's eyes and the man's devotion to his troops.</span>
