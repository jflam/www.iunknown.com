                <span id="Label1">Programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools (editors, object managers, version trackers) to generate a certain kind of product (programs) that will operate in some environment (operating systems on hardware assemblies). Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they've discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.<p> Some of the authors' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, "if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras." That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You'll want a copy of <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I> for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products. Elements of the approach include specification development, customer relations, team management, design practices, development tools, and testing procedures. This approach is presented with the help of anecdotes and technical problems.</span>

                    <span>In this book Hunt and Thomas have compiled a collection of 70 tips, thoughts, and techniques that are a must-study for every programmer regardless of skill or experience.<P>The tips cover all programming topics. Issues include programming style, languages, time management, planning, customer relationships, and spotlights on the project lifecycle. Some of the tips in the book seem obvious, but are often forgotten even by experienced programmers. Some tips are things that I initially was surprised by, but after reading the thorough explanation the topic came to light and became clear.<P>This is a good book that can be read off and on in sections, picked up at any time for a quick refresher on good programming.<P>I would heartily recommend this book for all programmers, whether you're a casual dabbler in VB, a web perl scripter, or you write unix system utilities in C.</span>

                    <span>This must be one of very few books I never felt like putting down. Quite a daunting task for any programming book. The reason for not wanting to put it down is probably related to the fact that it should strike a cord with every person that writes code. It effectively force you to ask: Am I writing programs or am I a programmer? If you don't understand this question becuase you think there is no difference then you should definitely read this book.<P>The techniques and habits the authors describe are very useful. Even if you may not have a use for every single one in every single project, I am quite convinced that you may over a career find all of them useful. The author's don't propogate that this set of ideas are a complete set - what they do propogate, however, is that programmers should work smarter not harder, and that one obviously achieves by thinking about what you are doing (and learning form other - like this book).<P>The writing style is very entertaining and thus makes a good read. I would say that this book is indespensable in your personal growth as a programmer. It may just prompt you to adapt your way of doing from being a "child" programmer to becoming a "real" ("adult") programmer. If you think you are already a "real" programmer, like I thought, then this book should make you realize that one is never to old to learn, that one should never stop thinking about what (and how) you are doing.<P>Enjoy a great read.</span>

                    <span>For the last year in two different companies I have been evangelizing many of the concepts in "Pragmatic Programmer", but had a hard time validating my thoughts to the more skeptical people in our group.<P>That's over now. "Pragmatic Programmer" has given me not only the ammunition I need to wage war against some of the more Philistine ideas that I must deal with, it has added to my thoughts and made me a better leader, better communicator and a much, much better developer. Any book that tells you to step away from the keyboard before you begin is good, but this book is a masterpiece because it tells you WHY you should take a step back.<P>Every chapter is a gem and stands alone, but taken together with the references and extremely well-written explanations, it almosts reads like a novel. I felt guilty putting it down!<P>If you are serious about software, serious about becoming a real craftsman and a leader in your field, then this book needs to be on your shelf, dog-eared and used.</span>

                    <span>I can only repeat what most other reviewers said: it's an extraordinary book, a real treasure. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this book would deserve 6 -- but I must draw one star for the bulky design ;)<P>Information density is high and actually the book could be a small pocket book ideal to take along everywhere. But unfortunately the publishers preferred to use big typefaces, thick paper and include a lot of empty space. They probably blowed up the book to make it heavier and look "more important" in order to sell it for a higher price. For me, they didn't hit the target because I didn't buy the thing. I swear I would spend $40 rightaway if it would be as handy as it could but for now I stick to the electronic version.</span>

                    <span>A friend of mine recommended this book to me a year ago and I finally got around to reading it. Not only do I wish I had taken him up on his recommendation immediately, I wish that I had read it years earlier. The book's subtitle "from journeyman to master" really sums it up nicely.<P>The book contains practical advice from experienced programmers that will help you become a more effective software developer. Unlike many books which dogmatically preach a specific methodology, this book focuses on (not-so-)common sense practices that are simple yet effective, as well as highlighting potential pitfalls to be avoided. Many of them can be applied to your own development process without requiring radical changes, while others will require team- or project-wide changes. Fortunately the nature of the recommended practices is such that you don't have to adopt all of them to be effective. You can pick and choose which ones are most appropriate and gradually incorporate them into your development process.<P>The range of topics covered is fairly broad, but the important themes are writing easy-to-maintain, reusable code, identifying and adjusting requirements quickly and effectively, managing large projects, and avoiding bad habits and developing good attitudes. Although I don't absolutely agree with everything the authors present, the justification they provide is thought stimulating and will probably change how you do things even if you don't consciously decide to adopt any of their practices.<P>I found the exercises (and their accompanying solutions) scattered throughout the book to be extremely useful in internalizing the principles being taught, as well as gauging how well I approach problem-solving. I'd highly recommend working through them as you read the book.<P>Finally, it's worth mentioning how enjoyable this book is to read. The authors' sense of humor and sprinkling of anecdotes make this an easy read without in any way detracting from the content.<P>If you're a brand new programmer, you probably won't appreciate many of the ideas presented in this book, but come back after you have a year or two of experience. Successful, experienced programmers will find that this book confirms many of the things you're already doing, while providing a lot of useful ideas to become even better. Even if you're not a programmer, but manage or otherwise work with programming teams, you'll find a lot of helpful information here. If there were one book I could require all of my coworkers to read, this would be it.</span>
