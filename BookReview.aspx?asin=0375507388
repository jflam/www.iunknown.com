                    <span>As the author or editor of fourteen books on the Civil War and Indian Wars of the American West, I understand that errors of fact inevitably creep into the best of books. But I have never encountered a work of history with so many egregious errors as this one. On nearly every page one finds misstatements and historical lies of the most enormous sort. No, Mr. Perrett, President Lincoln did not dream up the idea one summer day in 1862 to issue paper currency; he merely signed an act of Congress, passed several months earlier, that called for paper currency. No, Mr. Perrett, the Federals did not walk up Marye's Heights "like tourists" during the Chancellorsville campaign; they encountered bitter resistance and lost heavily. No, Mr. Perret, Corinth, Mississippi, is not on the Mississippi River - not even close. 
<br />
<br />The author may have some intriguing conclusions. But it is impossible to give them the slightest credence when they rest on a foundation so factually shaky.
<br />
<br />I could go on, but I heartily recommend the reader to Pulitzer Prize Winning Historian James McPherson's review of this book in The Nation. He properly relegates it to the historical trash can.
<br />
<br />If it were possible to give zero stars to a book, I would do so here. I've written dozens of reviews for journals and magazines, and this is the first completely negative one that I have ever felt compelled to put forward.              
<br />
<br />By the way, I noticed one reviewer offering as an excuse for the scores of errors possible lapses by "administrative staff," or by research assistants. Baloney. And if that is the case, and these erros slipped past him, than Mr. Perret is hopelessly ignorant of the subject matter.

<br />I'm neither an 'expert' nor uninformed concerning the Civil War. Neither did I buy this book expecting nor desiring another volume on the battles and leaders, the strategies and tactics, or the personalities and bickering. Not even the Western versus the Eastern theaters.
<br />
<br />Simply put, I wanted to read this book to get Mr. Perret's views of Mr. Lincoln. As far as my interest goes, it more than serves that purpose. I enjoyed the book and would purchase it again. I have many books on the shelf about Lincoln, some I consider good, others not so good.
<br />
<br />To paraphrase the late Lillian Hellman, I don't choose the books of history I read to fit today's revisionists or so-called experts reviews. Hang around a few years, and possibly this book too, may eventually be praised by some of those now trashing it, who knows.
<br />
<br />And I get a sense of 'politics' in a few of these reviews, professional bickering and perhaps even a certain proprietary jealousy, similar to one on a book about Gettysburg I recently reviewed.  So if you are an unbiased reader don't pay too much overt attention to these controversial reviews, I suggest in fairness, any prospective reader should at least look through this book before deciding for themselves one way or the other. If you are anything like me, you won't want anyone, 'expert' or not telling you what is or is not suitable for you to read.
<br />
<br />So trash my review if you must, but when I read this volume looking for information on Mr. Lincoln I find it full of interesting items, very enjoyable, and that is the only reason I wanted to read the book.

                    <span>I got this book cheap, fortunately, and read it before I saw the scathing reviews here and elsewhere.  As I was reading I wasn't aware of the myriad alleged factual errors mentioned, but I was disturbed by the idiosyncratic writing style, an odd attempt to be "folksy," I supposed.  There were also passages which seemed abrupt and poorly edited.  While the book was fairly easy to read and had some interesting things to say about Lincoln's role as military leader, I cannot recommend the book due to the apparent sloppy research and editing, and knowing there are undoubtedly much better works available.  So I won't say don't read this book, but I will say don't spend any money on it!</span>

                    <span>I've read the reviews below and McPherson's review, and yes there are errors in this book.  It is clear that Mr. Perret does not know a whole lot about the Civil War, but does that mean he doesn't know about Lincoln?  On the contrary, I found this book to be interesting and enlightening on Lincoln and I've read other books on our greatest President.  Some of the interesting items that I learned from this book are as follows.  Lincoln saved numerous soldier's who deserted from firing squads and by executive decree he saved a lot of men from this fate.  He continually visited hospitals to talk to wounded soldiers.  His focus and concern was with the individual soldier, and visited the army to meet them and talk to them.  This book studied Lincoln not the Civil War.  And, the input on this Lincoln study was from the perspective of the Library of Congress.  So what if Mr. Perret didn't recognize that more than two regiments of sharpshooters beat the Confederates on July 2nd, 1863 at Gettysburg.  This isn't a history of the Civil War.  It is a historical telling of Lincoln's role in the Civil War.  More importantly, to me, it highlighted what a good man he was.  We were lucky to have him as President during this trying time.  If you are interested in learning about Lincoln, I recommend this book.  It is good at delving into his personality.  If you are interested in learning about the Civil War, don't read this book.  It is as simple as that.</span>

                    <span>A disappointment.
<br />
<br />A book on Lincoln's role in the Civil War might have gone deeply into the controversial issue of the suspension of habeus corpus, or the history of civilian and military relationships in Europe and America, before and after Lincoln. But contrary to the claims on the dust jacket, there is little real discussion of any of these issues in Perret's book. 
<br />
<br />In fact, this book is mostly just another quick survey of the history of the war. Why do we need to be told again about the battle of Pea Ridge, or Chattanooga, or even Gettysburg, for that matter? All this is covered in many popular histories. Perret should have used his pages to expand his case about technological innovations, for instance. This is indeed a fascinating topic, but Perret just gives us dogmatic pronouncements about iron-clad ships and repeating rifles being the wave of the future, really saying nothing that hasn't been said often before.
<br />
<br />I give it the lowest possible rating because Perret makes a huge mistake in his brief discussion of war financing (pages 201 and 202) The controversial "Greenbacks"were not interest-bearing notes. They were "fiat-money", the now familiar paper currency, legal tender for all depts public and private, their values fixed by government authority. Interest bearing bonds were something completely different, with a long history: Samuel Chase, I find from the encyclopedia, apparently pioneered the idea of issuing them in low denominations,  twenty five or fifty dollars, targeted for sale to the general public, not just wealthy investors. There is an interesting story here, but in flying over it so fast, Perret has garbled it completely. I wonder who David Taylor from Ohio really was? Somebody could write a book....  If Perret gets this wrong, how can one rely on the rest of his scholarship? (Except when he is repeating familiar material)
<br />
<br />Perret exemplifies a style of history-writing that I find annoying. I want a historian to tell the story of what was done in the past, and expand on it by exploring what options were available to the people back then, and why (maybe) they chose as they did, and what it was all like for them. But Perret is like an editorial-writer. He wants to tell us, dogmatically, where the people of the past made mistakes, and what they should have done instead. Perret tells us that Lincoln should have ignored Richmond, and focussed on the western theater. Well, maybe so, and maybe not. The famous benefit of hindsight only tells us how things actually did work out, it doesn't tell us how things would have worked out if different decisions had been made. For a variety of reasons, I am much more interested in how Lincoln, and even how McClellan and Burnside, actually made their decisions at the time, than in how Geoffrey Perret thinks they should have decided.
