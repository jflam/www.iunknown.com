                    <span>The format of this book is new and different. It makes learning "trivia" fun and easy. Instead of long, drawn out questions with answers far away, in the back, you have short descriptions and answers right there! I also found that the "trivia" is more interesting than most of what I've seen in other trivia books. The history and geography sections are the best for me. The book is well categorized so you can jump around to whatever subject you are interested in at the time. Everyone will surely find his/her favorite topic. After you finish you will want to be on "Jeopardy".</span>

                    <span>The idea behind this book is great; it is a collection of all the most important trivia that may show up on TV gameshows and Trivia Bowl competitions. I can't recall seeing an episode of Jeopardy or Who Wants To Be A Millionaire since I bought this book that didn't go over information covered in this book. With episodes of Jeopardy, you can bet that half the questions are covered. I started to make a similar collection of information (which I called the "Book of All Knowledge") when preparing to tryout for some gameshows this year, but when I found this book I quit, because someone else had already done it.<P>The unfortunate thing is that the book has an egregious amount of errors. The vast majority of the information is correct, but there must be on average at least one error per page. Most of the errors are typographical in nature, and often it appears that the author simply can't spell and tried to list the words phonetically. If they came out with a 3rd edition that actually was edited well and had all the answers checked for accuracy, now that would be a truly great study aide.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book to help me study for my upcoming test and audition for the t.v. game show Jeopardy! It came highly recommended by some who have appeared on quiz shows. While it does cover the material thoroughly that regularly appears on such shows, there is one downside: so many typographical errors! Many of the errors are obvious, but one that nearly tripped me up was a misspelling of the capitol of Belize. Luckily I double checked my information and caught it, but if I didn't, that could have thrown me off and cause me to miss a critical question. <P>Overall, I recommend this book, but with a caution that you need to double check facts and not use this book as a foolproof reference for quiz show study.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. It is more than a simple exercise in memorization when I delve into it. One little nugget of info will often set me off down a path to new and fascinating knowledge I never had before. I got it because I am going on the game show Jeopardy, and in watching the show and noting what comes up, I would have to say the author does a great job of including very essential and relevant info. If you want a big book of arcane knowledge there are an abundance; this is not one of them. This book is reccomended if you already have a fairly broad knowledge base to draw on. Otherwise it is meaningless and gives you rote memory, which is a waste of your time. I reccomend this book to fill in the gaps of your knowledge. Take a few months to go through it and take a more extensive look at the items that interest you.</span>
