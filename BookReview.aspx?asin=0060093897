                    <span>This is not a traditional biography, which was what I expected when I picked up the book.  If you wish to know about Rudy's life before 1989, his first marriage, childhood, days as U.S. attorney, this is not the right book for you.  The first 100 pages or so this book are a bit slow--too much campaign stuff and not enough on governing.  However, the narrative picks up quickly over the last 200 pages.  We learn about Rudy's mistakes and triumphs--of which there are many.  You learn a ton about Rudy's controversial policies.  The personal scandals are discussed, but not in a malicious way.  We never learn about the details of his mysterious marriage to Donna Hanover--or anything much about Hanover.  So, yes, things are left out.  However, Al Sharpton is a fascinating character here.  You learn about Rudy's day on Sept. 11, when the author was actually running around the city with the Mayor. The narrative ends in 2001.  I would have loved to hear more about Bloomberg, but who can change the publication date now?  It isn't perfect, but Rudy remains one of the fascinating--and successful--Mayors of our time.</span>

                    <span>This biography was excellently written in a mostly unbiased way. Kirtzman has an excellent understanding of NYC politics and this served to his advantage in chronicling Giulianis life. For a more comprehensive biography pick up "Rudy" by Wayne Barrett.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up to read on a flight from Providence to Phoenix.  I never put it down and read the whole book by arrival.  It is an incredibly readable book.  As far as I understand it was oringinally published before sept 11th so most of the book is unbiased by the great acts the mayor performed on that day and afterword.  This being siad the author is great at detailing the intricacies of New York politics.  A worthwhile read for anyone who didnt experience the Guliani era first hand(in NY).  As another reviewer siad it does lack detail and certainly is in no way a biography of the man.  The book is a political biography the starts in 1988 and ends in 2001.</span>

                    <span>Consider that even before Sept 11, this "hero" was publically questioning whether there should be mayoral elections at all, (term limits meant he had to go) and after the tragic events he wanted them cancelled so that he could stay on, since in his words he was already "experienced and doing a good job". His contempt for democracy is matched by his endless conceit. <br>His public order record is bound to be reviewed considering the positions he took over repeated police shootings/savagery of civilians/bystanders (Dialo and Louima being only two of the most publicized).<br>As for the "hero" part, a hero is one who risks his life to save or help others. It is not clear what risk Mr Juliani undertook either as mayor or as soon-to-be-ex-mayor during the aftermath of Sept 11, other than attempt to monopolize the publicity of a profound tragedy for personal aggrandizement. There is clearly an effort by the Royalist (former Republican) party to place him in the front running for high national office. Don't go for it.</span>

                    <span>Having lived through those turbulent years and having to begrudginly give my approval to many of the things that he did,I find that the balance in this superbly written and easy to read study make me more comfortable with my feelings. Kirtzman doesn't take sides as much as he presents both sides allowing the reader to get a better feel for this complex and often forbidding and not forgiving mayor without sacrificing your basic reactions to the man. A must read.</span>
