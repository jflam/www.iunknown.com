                <span id="Label1">Standards for portfolios are changing as fast as anything in photography today, and Pulitzer Prize-winner John Kaplan leads photographers of all types to the cutting edge. With informed advice from award-winning photographers, agents, photo buyers and art directors, and top-notch sample images, Kaplan immerses readers in the strategies and standards photographers need to know to get noticed.   Kaplan shows how the right editing can help photographers earn higher fees with portfolios destined to land on top of the stack. He shares his acclaimed techniques for selecting and organizing portfolio-caliber images for any genre of photography, then discusses  professional methods for displaying them in print, web, CD and slide  formats--including how to painlessly build an online portfolio. The book features genre-specific advice from experts in commercial freelance, photojournalism, nature & wildlife, wedding photography and fine art specialties, too.   <P>Beyond looking good, a portfolio must sell and sell again. Photo Portfolio Success adds up-to-the-minute guidance from industry insiders on self promotion and future growth. With motivational visuals from famed photographers and authoritative, up-to-the-minute advice, it's the definitive book on contemporary portfolios.</span>

                    <span>In his new book, "Photo Portfolio Success", John Kaplan has created the most comprehensive, current, in depth and honest book for photographers who may be hoping to get their foot in the door, for those where the door is already open, and even the lucky ones with an all-season pass in the competitive and rewarding field of photography. This book debunks every myth you thought you knew and tells it like it is from the very top people working in photography today. A literary device using pull-out quotes from top photographers, editors and even New York photo agents subtitled: "Your Biggest Mistake", and "Your Best Move" also gives the reader more honest guidance of what they really need to know to succeed in an often cutthroat business. Here's a nugget from Detroit Free Press photographer J. Kyle Keener: "Don't show something in your portfolio that you can't do consistently." It's honesty like this that helps photographers get to the next level. Kaplan's book scales several mountain ranges with advice every sane person really needs to know if they want to keep a roof over their heads in making a living at photography.<BR> In 13 chapters, this book covers all the bases and genres of photography and everything you need to know to get a running start. Photojournalism, wedding photography, freelance and commercial work, nature and wildlife, fine art photography and the extremely important areas of marketing and self-promotion are all covered. Detailed yet easy-to understand methods of building your own web page to promote your photography business are included. Necessary links to various companies providing presentation material like portfolio cases are also here. The book is well designed and beautifully illustrated with examples of some of the finest photography being done in the world today. <BR> I think the really nice thing about this book is the underlying encouragement that Kaplan offers the reader throughout. Reviewing as a professional photographer myself, Photo Portfolio Success gave me a renewed sense of vigor and honest assesment of where I need to go in this crazy yet wonderful career of photography.</span>
