                <span id="Label1">Written by Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman, childhood friends who met at one of New York's most elite prep schools, <I>The Right Address</I> seeks to expose the cruel and wicked ways of the top echelon of the Park Avenue crowd. Peppered with seemingly unbelievable accounts of social-climbing at its worst, the characters in this novel glide from party to party, relishing every possible chance to destroy each other's reputation while simultaneously air-kissing one another. The story revolves around Melanie Sartomsky, a former airline stewardess who is thrust into the world of <I>shatoosh</I> parties ("they make cashmere feel like emery boards") and Narcolepsy benefits after she marries Arthur Korn, a billionaire who found his fortune in funeral homes. As Melanie tries to adjust to her new life, the authors expose us to the darker side of high society--steamy affairs between CEOs and their custodial staff, salacious scandals in Harlem flophouses, and a discreet arrangement between a kleptomaniac's husband and Tiffany, where this pedigreed socialite enjoys pocketing the wares.<p>  A prime example of the Gossip Lit genre, which began its ascent after <I>The Nanny Diaries</I> and <I>The Devil Wears Prada</I> hit the scene, <I>The Right Address</I> could have been an amusing, albeit extreme, expose of the lives of the rich and well, rich.  However, the unsteady cadence of the novel, coupled with the absence of any real human emotion, turn this effort into simply one nasty gossip session after another. The reader never feels invested in any of the many characters, and even when our heroine comes to her senses, there's no real sense of relief or delight. So while the tell-all nature of the book may make it hard to put down, the only real joy lies in the fact it ends quickly. <I>--Gisele Toueg</I></span>

                    <span>This book is not as poorly written as "The Devil Wears Prada," but it's close. The authors (it took two people to write this book?!)don't give us anyone to root for; everyone in this book is either a tacky wannabe or a catty snob and no one has redeeming qualities or distinct characteristics. What they should have done was had Melanie Korn, the socially ambitious ex-stewardess and second wife of funeral home magnate Arthur Korn, be humiliated a few times by her two socially connected nemesises (is that a word?) Joan and Wendy. Then under the tutelage of Mr. Guffney, the butler, she ascends the social ladder all Eliza Doolittle-like and exacts a satisfying revenge. Wait, I've read a story similar to that--oh, yeah, Candace Bushnell's "Trading Up." (I liked that book, what can I say?) Anyway, as the book is, Melanie is incredibly gauche and keeps making the same mistakes page after page, until you begin to wonder how many times can she be ostracized and humiliated? Does her earthy husband, Arthur, really love her, or is he jonesing for the perfect society girl, Olivia? Do Wendy and Joan have lives? Is Morgan really gonna have Maria, his baby mama, killed? The authors do give us a peek into the lives of the idle rich, with their charity balls and ruthless gossip. But for the most part, this book is like Melanie and Arthur's apartment before they had it redecorated: a lot of nice pieces, but nothing that really comes together as a whole.</span>

                    <span>The title of my review essentially sums up my feelings on this book. I was browsing the new books in fiction at my local borders one evening, when I came across this book. Upon reading the dust jacket, I decided that it sounded like a cute fun book to read while lounging in the sun in my backyard, or on the beach. Once I returned home, I logged onto amazon and was quite disappointed to see the negative reviews. However, those reviews only made me more eager to read the book, so I could judge for myself.<P>After finishing the book, I must admit that this is not for those looking for a well-written, intellectual novel. I am a college student, reading this book for leisure over the summer. However, I was amazed at the number of typos and grammatical errors that I found in this book. The authors certainly need to find a better editor. In spite of the poor editing, I did find the characters to be quite easy to laugh at, for their often despicable actions. It is amazing how people can be so shallow. While there may have been a lack of characters to "root for," I found the characters in this book to be quite amusing. If one reads this book looking to laugh at the pathetic nature of these upper east side society people, you should not be disappointed. <P>Overall, I would recommend this book. However, I recommend it only to those looking to read this type of book.</span>

                    <span>I would have given the "Nanny Diaries" 4 stars, and the "Devil Wears Prada" 3, with the understanding that we are not expecting literature from these books. This one was so formula based I could have told you the whole story after a few chapters. I thought it would at least provide a window to a different world, but it did not even accomplish that. My suggestion, don't bother.</span>

                    <span>What a trashy read. I thought this book would be somewhat like The Nanny Diaries, which was a fun book. This book skewers a certain kind of woman found on the Upper East Side whose only ambition is to preside over benefit dinners, and to have her tiny, shiny-face photograph appear in the party pages of any magazine.<BR>Amid this thicket of gossips, snobs and nasties lives Melanie Korn, a former stewardess who's married to "life transition" mogul Arthur Korn. That means he's made tons of money on caskets, funeral homes and retirement homes. But it will take more than Arthur's megamillions for her to succeed in ingratiating herself to the wicked witches of the Upper East Side. <BR>The Right Address could have been an amusing, albeit extreme, expose of the lives of the rich. However, the absence of any real human emotion, turn this effort into simply one nasty gossip session after another. The reader never feels invested in any of the many characters, and even when our heroine comes to her senses, there's no real sense of relief or delight.

                    <span>The Right Address was really well written. It moved along and the ending was very satisfying. All of the characters -- except maybe Jerome -- were three dimensional (though even the real-life Jeromes are two dimensional).<P>I can't wait to read more books by these authors. I'm surprised this is a first book by these authors. While this was mentioned on the tv show the View as beach reading and chick lit, I would have enjoyed reading this over the winter holidays. I would enjoy reading serious lit from these two or even more fluff.</span>
