                <DIV class="ReviewHeading">Book Description:</DIV>
                <span id="Label1">INTRODUCTION  <P>China has grown up alone and aloof, cut off from the rest of Eurasia by the Himalayas to the south and the Siberian steppe to the north. For the last three millennia, while empires, languages and peoples in the rest of the world rose, blossomed and disappeared without trace, China has been busy largely recycling itself. The ferocious dragons and lions of Chinese statuary have been produced for 25 centuries or more, and the script still used today reached perfection at the time of the Han dynasty, two thousand years ago. Until the late nineteenth century, the only foreigners China saw &#150; apart from occasional ruling elites of Mongol and Manchu origin, who quickly became assimilated &#150; were visiting merchants from far-flung shores or uncivilized nomads from the wild steppe: peripheral, unimportant and unreal.  <P>Today, while there is no sign of the Communist Party relinquishing power, the negative stories surrounding China &#150; the runaway pollution, the oppression of dissidents, the harsh treatment of criminal suspects and the imperialist behaviour towards Tibet and other minority regions &#150; are only part of the picture. As the Party moves ever further away from hard-line political doctrine and towards economic pragmatism, China is undergoing a huge commercial and creative upheaval. A country the size of ten Japans has entered the world market: Hong Kong-style city skylines are rearing up all across China, and tens of millions of people are finding jobs that earn them a spending power their parents could never have known. Whatever the reasons you are attracted to China, the sheer pace of change, visible in every part of Chinese life, will ensure that your trip is a unique one.  <P>The first thing that strikes visitors to China is the extraordinary density of its population. In central and eastern China, villages, towns and cities seem to sprawl endlessly into one another along the grey arteries of busy expressways. These are the Han Chinese heartlands, a world of chopsticks, tea, slippers, massed bicycles, shadow-boxing, exotic pop music, teeming crowds, chaotic train stations, smoky temples, red flags and the smells of soot and frying tofu. Move west or north away from the major cities, however, and the population thins out as it begins to vary: indeed, large areas of the People&#146;s Republic are inhabited not by the "Chinese", but by more than two hundred distinct ethnic minorities, ranging from animist hill tribes to urban Muslims. Here the landscape begins to dominate: green paddy fields and misty hilltops in the southwest, the scorched, epic vistas of the old Silk Road in the northwest, and the magisterial mountains of Tibet.  <P>While travel around the country itself is seldom problematic, it would be wrong to pretend that it is an entirely easy matter to penetrate modern China. The tourist highlights &#150; the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Army and Yangzi gorges &#150; are relatively few considering the size of the country. In particular, recent modernizations have, quite deliberately, destroyed much of the historic architecture which would have lent Chinese cities the character enjoyed by those in Europe or the Middle East. On top of this are the frustrations of travelling in a land where few people speak English, the writing system is alien and foreigners are regularly viewed as exotic objects of intense curiosity, or as fodder for overcharging &#150; though overall you&#146;ll find that the Chinese, despite a reputation for curtness, are generally hospitable and friendly.</span>

                    <span>This is one of few guides to China whose authors seem to have a fair amount of understanding of, and interest in, the country they're writing on. This is reflected in a carefully crafted book with a lot of interesting footnotes that make it a good read as well as a travel companion. Something which reflects more the rapid growth of the PRC rather than the authors is the fact that even a mere 18 months after publishing, I found the guide to be accurate only about 50% of the time. You decide whether to shell out for it.</span>

                    <span>I am just back from a week in China. Unlike my normal travels this time I stayed in luxury hotels and had arranged transport. Therefore I did not depend on the guide to tell me which bus to take from which museum etc ( at any rate a painful thing to do with most guides and something to be explored much more easily locally).<P>The guide was superb in giving condensed information on the places we have visited ( Beijing, Xi'An and Shanghai) and enabled us to do all the planning of what we wanted to do and wanted to see whilst travelling. I found the information on markets and shopping to be very accurate and, most enjoyable, for all the markets, places of interest, restaurants, hotels etc. the guide had the names in Cihinese characters as well, so that we could tell our driver or the taxidriver where to go.<P>Also the general information on history and culture where quite interesting and gave another dimension to our short and unplanned trip. All in all well worth the value.<P>One tip; the guide has for all the hotels the listed prices. Through the Internet or with frequent flyer cards you can get up to 60% discounts even in the big hotels like Sheraton and Hilton.</span>

                    <span>I can't fully agree with negative review of this book. I'm living in China for three years now. I got many guides to China I use them quite a lot during my traveling in here. Sure there is maybe a few thing missing and there are some mistakes in this book but it is still the best. I find it much more accurate and detailed than last edition of Lonely Planet.<P>It's best all around travel guide for China.<P>If you want to get and bring just one get this one.</span>

                    <span>This book presents itself as a revised edition, but it is very<BR>little more than a prettied-up reprint of the text from three<BR>years ago, and some of that was a bit long in the tooth then.<P>The first and second editions carried great promise, worthy<BR>competitors for the boys from LP. To represent the third as<BR>having been "updated" is merely a deception. It would have been<BR>better not done at all.<P>The book is a curiosity. The title-page has it "written and <BR>researched" by the same three authors as the previous edition <BR>more than three years ago, but "this edition updated" by two<BR>others. It's not clear that the original three have contributed <BR>any "research" at all that was not reflected in the previous<BR>edition. Nor is it even quite clear that the two "updaters"<BR>have actually been on the ground in China. The "updating" is in<BR>fact so slight that it could almost have been done by a<BR>desk-bound clerk on the strength of readers' reports, with <P>perhaps the odd nod in the direction of the Lonely Planet Thorn<BR>Tree.<P>The new edition has more pages, but that's explained by a <BR>slightly larger type-face; finer paper; unchanged net weight.<BR>A second colour introduced throughout, with improved visual<BR>presentation, a bit prettier. And not many other changes.<P>Chinese names and words still without tone-marks in the main<BR>body of the text - a shortcoming that was never really excusable<BR>and which has been merely unacceptable since Lonely Planet bit<BR>that particular bullet.<P>There is scarcely a town or locality mentioned that is not<BR>included in the previous edition. No one who is on the ball in<BR>the matter of China travel could fail to discover many more<BR>places worthy of attention than he knew about three years<BR>before. And circumstances change as well: more than a year<BR>before the last edition, all of western Sichuan was opened for<BR>the first time, but the vast treasure of the previously<BR>forbidden region is still undiscovered by the new edition of<BR>this (very) rough guide. The wonderfully scenic Muli and<BR>Yanyuan counties in southern Sichuan have been open for years<BR>but (apart from one passing reference to Yanyuan) rate no<BR>mention. Yushu Prefecture in southern Qinghai, with all<BR>counties open at least since mid-2001, is not mentioned; indeed<BR>apart from Xining district and Golmud (Geermo) there's hardly a <BR>mention of any part of Qinghai province at all.<P>Of course I can't expect even the best guidebook to discover all <BR>the places I may have discovered and found worthwhile - the<BR>Mekong in north-west Yunnan, Yulin in northern Shaanxi,<BR>Shibaoshan in western Yunnan, Daocheng and the Yading Reserve,<BR>not to mention secret places in Tibet that I'd perhaps rather <BR>keep to myself, nor the phenomenal valley of the Salween in<BR>western Yunnan. The trouble is that this book has found very<BR>few new places (though there's a tantalising addition of almost <BR>impossibly remote Loulan and a couple of extra morsels on the<BR>"southern Silk Road" - a reader's letter perhaps?)<P>Then there are the occasions when I've found the previous <BR>edition mistaken or misleading - Chishui, Matang, Tiger-Leaping<BR>Gorge, Ruili district, Sanying hotel open to foreigners (well,<BR>it is if you threaten the PSB with an international incident<BR>failing their acquiescence), Pingliang hotel; and so on. Any<BR>corrections? Not one that I can find.<P>Some details of hotel tariffs, telephone numbers, admission<BR>charges and so on have been changed, but they are generally far<BR>too few to lend any confidence in the reliability of what has<BR>not been changed; a number I've been able to check are just <BR>wrong.<P>The maps are now far too few, the provincial (or<BR>multi-provincial) maps just too simplified; the largest scale<BR>for some provinces is one to twenty million. Even so, how<BR>revealing for the text to say that "Weixi marks the end of the <BR>road" (from the east)! Tell that to the mini-bus drivers who <BR>drive another 220km north to Deqin, from where the road<BR>continues all the way to Lhasa and beyond! The railway line<BR>between Changsha and north-western Hunan (which cut the journey<BR>from Zhangjiajie to Changsha to about six hours when it had<BR>already been commissioned three years ago) is not shown.<P>Good points? There's a new "food and drink glossary", which is <BR>to say phrase-list. The paper is excellent - strong and<BR>light, perhaps better than the heavier paper of the Lonely<BR>Planet, so that there are about 30% more pages but 10% less<BR>overall weight. There must be more words in the Rough Guide,<BR>but I doubt there is more information, regardless of its<BR>accuracy.</span>

                    <span>The Rough Guides are considered among the "cream of the crop" in the guidebook world, and this book is no exception. I used it extensively in the planning phase of my recent month-long trip to China, and it was very helpful.<P>The background sections of the book are outstanding, giving the reader a solid overview of Chinese history and culture. The primary sites of interest to travelers are adequately covered as well, and so the book is very helpful in planning one's itinerary.<P>The main drawback of the volume is it's weight. If you are backpacking in China, as I was, this book is pretty heavy to be lugging around. Therefore, unless you are staying in China more than a couple of weeks, you might consider looking at the smaller city guides.....or ripping the necessary sections out of this book and packing only those in your rucksack.<P>Highly recommended for pre-trip planning at home. Recommended for packing and taking to China *if* you are going on an extended trip to the country.</span>
