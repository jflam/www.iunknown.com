                    <span>Author Michael Shapiro captures the flavor of baseball circa 1956 with this informative look at the Brooklyn Dodger's last pennant.  The author aptly describes both the play on the field and the team's ownership moves that occurred behind the scenes.  
<br />
<br />I liked reading of the down-to-the-wire pennant race, where the defending world champions overcame age, injuries, and challenges by the upstart Milwaukee Braves and Cincinnati Reds.  We get an inside look at many players; aging leaders Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese, garrulous Roy Campanella, sulking slugger Duke Snider, volatile hurler Don Newcombe, etc.  Readers feel almost inside the clubhouse as the talented players fight for another pennant. 
<br />
<br />Interwoven into the pages is an informed look at the seamy business moves of owner Walter O'Malley.  Declining attendance had O'Malley looking for a new stadium while also secretly negotiating with the city of Los Angeles.  The author indicts city planning czar Robert Moses for blocking a new Dodger stadium in downtown Brooklyn - but the greedy O'Malley was hardly blameless.  In the end, of course, O'Malley callously deserted to California, leaving thousands of broken hearts in Brooklyn.      
<br />
<br />This book is informative, engaging and well-researched (if too easy on O'Malley).  Fans that like this book - and most will - should also see "Boys of Summer" by Roger Kahn.

                    <span>This book goes beyond just a detailed view of the Dodgers' last great year in Brooklyn, it also provides a nice historical snapshot of the legendary borough and the changes that were taking place. This is a well researched book with a lot of great information on Dodger greats such as Reese, Snider, Newcombe, Robinson, etc. I definitely enjoyed it.</span>

                    <span>This is a gripping and well-written account of the last days of the Brooklyn Dodgers, their final pennant race in 1956 and the battle to keep the team in Brooklyn. 
<br />
<br />If you've read The Boys of Summer, this is a good companion because that book focuses on the early 1950s teams and then the players in later life. This fills in some of the gaps in that narrative.
<br />
<br />Shapiro is an outstanding writer and historian. If he has a weakness, it's that he's not a baseball writer per se, and his descriptions of some of the game action can be a bit disjointed. But he more than makes up with it in his accounts of the social fabric of Brooklyn and the political wranglings that eventually led Walter O'Malley to move his team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. His profiles of the key players, both on and off the field, are also exceptional.
<br />
<br />This is a book that will make you yearn both for the start of a new baseball season and a simpler day when the fans felt a sense of kinship with the players.</span>

                    <span>The Dodgers of Brooklyn are now mythic.  After one reads a wonderful book like Boys of Summer and hears stories about the Bums, you can't help but believe it.  However, the Last Good Season brings some balance to the stories and memories.  He honors the men who played a boys game in a decaying old stadium.  He does not villify O'Malley, but does Robert Moses who was not a great force for good.  The book is not a pure baseball book, but as a self-styled historian (using the term very loosely), I enjoyed the views of the Brooklyn and the large social change.  Shapiro does not make the Dodgers more than they are.  If anything, he is understated in his discussions of the power of baseball.  It works beautifully.  The book is engrossing and by the end, you can't help but the love Dodgers more.  Once you have read this (and you must read Boys of Summer first) go read The Sandy Koufax book, A Lefty's Legacy which really is a nice a bookend to the Dodgers glory years of the 1950s and 1960s (to say nothing of the '70s and '80s).</span>

                    <span>The conventional story of the Brooklyn Dodgers' demise is largely familiar to most baseball fans by now. The Borough of Brooklyn saw the working-class white families who had supported the Dodgers flee en masse in the decade after World War Two, replaced by blacks, Puerto Ricans and others of different customs and values. Meanwhile, greedy Dodger owner Walter O'Malley, after making a pretense of wanting to stay in Brooklyn, quickly packed his bags for the more lucrative territory of Los Angeles. If this is the storyline you cling to, be prepared to re-think it. In "The Last Good Season," Michael Shapiro provides a thoroughly-researched, gracefully-written account of the Dodgers' final pennant race and the transformation of Brooklyn. <p>"I see the boys of summer in their ruin," Dylan Thomas had written in a poem that would forever become linked to the Dodgers. Roger Kahn's masterpiece was still in the future in 1956, but the great Dodger team that had dominated the National League for a decade was clearly approaching the end of the line. Age and injuries were taking their toll on men like Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Carl Erskine and Pee Wee Reese. Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax were on hand, but were still untested youngsters, not the dominant pitchers they would become on the west coast.<p>Shapiro interweaves an account of the 1956 season with the story of Brooklyn's transformation in the postwar years. Yes, many whites were fleeing to the suburbs, but Ebbets Field was still filled with fans. In fact, he suggests, it was a wonderful, if brief period when black, brown and white fans came together for a common purpose.<p>What seems abundantly clear from the archives Shapiro has mined is that far from looking for a quick exit, O'Malley was seeking every opportunity to stay (although on his terms.) All he wanted--reasonably enough, in his view--was the city's help in securing the site for a new stadium. Here, though, he came up against the most powerful man in New York--Robert Moses. It was a battle he was destined to lose.  Interestingly enough, while Shapiro refuses to condemn O'Malley as a carpetbagger, he does conclude he never should have owned a baseball team. Why? He simply didn't understand the game, or its true meaning to its fans. O'Malley was the kind of owner who could maximize the bottom line, and knew how to successfully market his product--but that's all it ever was to him. A product. As Shapiro's book makes clear, for millions of fans, the Brooklyn Dodgers represented so much more.--William C. Hall</span>
