                <span id="Label1">Learn how to improve your Java coding skills using unit testing.  Despite it's name, unit testing is really a coding technique, not a testing technique. This book shows how to write tests, but more importantly, goes where other books fear to tread and gives you concrete advice and examples of what to test.  Discover the tricky hiding places where bugs breed, and how to catch them using the freely available Junit framework.  It's easy to learn how to think of all the things in your code that are likely to break.   But the best part is that you don't need to adopt Extreme Programming, or Test-Driven Development, or change your whole development process in order to reap the proven benefits of unit testing, the pragmatic way. </span>

                    <span>Pragmatic Unit Testing is one of those books that you only find once in a great while: concise, readable, practical, and applicable to everyday work tasks.  There are a number of test frameworks for Java, a number of them based on JUnit.  This is both good and bad: good, because JUnit is an effective, easy to use framework, and bad, because the documentation that comes with JUnit is horrible.  This book is the documentation that JUnit SHOULD come with.  Although quite simple in nature, this book provides guidelines not only for using JUnit, but concepts for planning effective Unit tests as well.  I particularly like the examples and exercises the authors included with the book, as I learn better by doing them and seeing the results myself.
<br />
<br />If you're not familiar with Unit testing or skeptical of the results, read this book and give it a fair try.  You'll never program the same way again.</span>

                    <span>Unit Testing is one of those widely accepted good practices that is not always well applied. This book helps to bridge the gap between what should be done and what is done.
<br />
<br />While JUnit and Mock Objects are introduced in the text, the main focus is on developing insight into the philosophy of pragmatic unit testing. Most developers have a vague understanding of the why and how, but what do their results really mean? Are they sufficient to determine that the code is correct? How does the developer know?
<br />
<br />With anecdotes and clear examples, the authors help to clear the fog. Just as important, they dispel many of the testing myths and explode the excuses that   are offered for not unit testing. Resistance will frequently come developers, but also from management thinking that developing test code will add time to the project instead of saving it.
<br />
<br />A side-effect of developing unit tests is that they add another layer of code that must be managed. Do you need tests for your test? Where does it end? Again the pragmatic programmers provide poignant pointers to managing the tests themselves.
<br />
<br />One of the pragmatic programmer commandments must be "Be brief". In less than 160 pages, this slim volume covers a lot of ground. For a project technical lead, several copies for your team to read may be a solid investment. Be sure to make a poster-sized version of the "Pragmatic Unit Testing: Summary" page from the book for the wall behind your desk.</span>

                    <span>(The following is an excerpt of a review of "The Pragmatic Starter Kit" I posted at JavaRanch.)
<br />
<br />"Pragmatic Unit Testing - In Java with JUnit" - the second volume in the three part "The Pragmatic Starter Kit" series" - from authors, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, is an excellent introduction to the practice of unit testing - proving that a piece of code does what the developer intended it to do.  If you're a new developer, hopefully you've asked yourself and others questions about how to establish that your code really works, how to feel confident that it keeps working after scores of changes have been made, what types of common problems and bugs should you be looking for, where are these problems likely to be, and what makes a good test.  While answering those questions, this book also introduces the practice of testing with Mock Objects, how to organize the test code in a project, how to better design code for testability, and how to make use of JUnit for running all these tests.  I'd recommend this book as a strong introduction to any developer new to or uncertain about the art of unit testing.

                    <span>Pragmatic Unit Testing  is another outing for the "Pragmatic" brand.  This time the authors apply their characteristic humour and collection of acronyms to unit testing, specifically as it applies to Java and using the JUnit software package.
<br />
<br />The book gives a general introduction to the whys and wherefores of unit testing and then uses a good example to introduce JUnit as a mechanism for carrying out these tests.  This is followed by various chapters that look into what you should test and when and where, etc.  In this respect it covers much of the ground on unit testing and does it well but the truth is that there isn't all that much to cover; to the extent that the authors can even provide a one page at-a-glance summary of all their main points at the back of the book.  This is fine and as an introductory text I would recommend the book.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, there are a number of areas in unit testing that always present problems for developers.  For instance:
<br />How should private methods be tested?  This is mentioned in passing but not really addressed.
<br />Where should tests be stored?  Some options are presented but their advantages and disadvantages barely mentioned.
<br />How can systems such as databases or networks be simulated for test purposes?  There is a short chapter on simple Mock Objects but after presenting a small example they conclude "and that's all there is to mock objects" and the rest of the chapter barely covers anything more.
<br />
<br />In summary, the book is a good (if verbose) introduction for beginners but is of limited value for those who are already familiar with JUnit and are looking for a book that tackles the more difficult areas.</span>

                    <span>There has been a resurgent interest amongst developers in unit
<br />testing, mostly spurred on by Extreme Programming, test-driven
<br />development and the JUnit testing harness. But most of the discussion
<br />has been on how tests can shape design, rather than on how tests can
<br /><i>test.</i> This book does the best job of describing how JUnit-style unit
<br />tests can actually be used for testing. The book is available in two
<br />flavors: one in Java for JUnit and one in C# for NUnit.</span>
