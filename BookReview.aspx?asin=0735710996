                    <span>I bought this book a couple months ago after trying in vain to find good examples of a default DENY policy firewall for Linux that also uses Masquerading. Lots of documentation is on the internet dealing with IPCHAINS and firewalling, but very few go into depth like this book. Some reviewers stated that there weren't enough explanations of the examples but I feel that, that is a good thing. I don't think someone who has never used or tried to implement a firewall should look here for good reasoning behind the rulesets given, this book is for someone who understands TCP/IP and can use the help with the syntax. When I recieved the book I was a little worried that it would not cover what I needed it to since it is geared toward small firewalls that would suit a home user best, but when I read the book I also found a great example of a screened-subnet firewall which was helpful in the planning of our new setup at work. All in all I'm happy with the title. I will point out however that even though this book is fairly new it will shortly be outdated. The firewall code for Linux is changing yet again to NETFILTER that will require a whole new syntax; that is expected this October.</span>

                    <span>Good points:<P>* Lots of details about how to set up packet filtering in Linux.<P>* Good reference material about various ports & services.<P>Bad points:<P>* The command lines in his "rc.firewall" scripts are long and thus wrap when printed in the book, making the scripts VERY difficult to read. A smaller, fixed-pitch font for the scripts, and good use of column alignment would have helped tremendously.<P>* Scant discussion of the "hosts.allow" and "hosts.deny" files, or of TCP/IP wrappers and inetd. Both are an essential part of Linux firewalls.<P>* The overall organization of the book is good, but some of the detail in the chapters is not well organized. Since he protects against invalid packets going OUT as well as coming IN, there's a lot of detail that many people will not want. That detail tends to obscure the WHY of what he's doing.<P>* In the appendix, he lists in exhaustive detail all his firewall rules, and then lists them AGAIN in a "better" order. Yes, the second order is better for BOTH efficiency and understanding, so why provide the first list? Actually, there are SIX complete lists in the appendix: three for ipchains, and another three lists for ipfwadm), but that's another story ...<P>All in all, a good book in spite of the above. There are a few typos, but once you understand what he's doing, the typos are obvious.</span>

                    <span>I have used ipfilter on FreeBSD for many years, and I'm now starting to deploy Linux. Ziegler presents an extremely well researched book. Particularly impressive is his discussion of the nastier protocols like DHCP and FTP. Getting ssh and smtp through a firewall is pretty simple, it's the tougher protocols that really require some thought, and it's clear he's done that.<P>Along with explaining the protocols, he explains how iptables works and how to apply the protocol knowledge to building iptables rules. The appendices where he assembles all of the rules together are worth the price of the book all by themselves.<P>I wish half of my technical books were as good a value as this one.</span>

                    <span>This book does a great job of explaning the theory behind netfilter firewalling with iptables. Every concept is backed up with a concise script.<P>And this is precisely why you should avoid this book.<P>Page after page is riddled with glaring errors. Some scripts produce syntax errors. Others yield unexpected results. Entire passages are copied and pasted out of context. Only a handful of errors can be chalked up as mere typos.<P>I spent too much time correcting mistakes that could have been better spent studying the material. If you must read this book, don't blame yourself when you get lost-- the proofreaders were lost as well.</span>

                    <span>This book is horribly written. There are glaring grammar errors which make the book impossible to read. Hopefully the proofers have been sent back to kinder-care. Moreover, there are sections in the book where they cut-and-copied the syntax explanation into the example section. But they forgot to change the text to an example! Look at the section on xinetd for an example. This one had to go back. This is too bad. We really need an good book on this topic. Sorry Mr. Ziegler, get better proof readers for the 3rd edition.</span>
