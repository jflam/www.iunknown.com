                <span id="Label1">Payoffs (under the table cash), grade tampering , eligibility scandals, illegal recruitment tactics, lies, deception and immorality are all a continuous part of this real life story.  <P>It shows the twisted nature of coaches, administrators, and family, hell-bent on winning while ambivalent to the academic and personal development of the student athlete.  <P>Derek Sparks shows us what it takes to keep a dream alive, in this story of his transfer to four different high schools in four different years.  He faces the challenges of loneliness, temptation, ostracism, while living in a gang-land enviroment. He also fights a desperate battle to prove his eligibility, while protecting his scholarship offers, and acheive qualifying SAT scores even after an insidious vow from his coaches: "YOU'LL NEVER PLAY ORGANIZED FOOTBALL AGAIN!"  <P>Derek's story delivers a message to today's students seeking a future in athletics, or to the average student seeking a future in life. It tells of the wisdom and maturity a 21st century student must have to steer their way through a maze of manipulators and opportunists.  <P>Through his mistakes and his successes, Derek conveys his testimony with a vision of a better way.

                    <span>This is an absolutely must read for anyone who loves sports stories (but should be required reading for lettering high school athletes). I could not put it down! The book paints a vivid, yet disturbing picture of the exploitation of a "can't miss" superstar-high school football player, by the system. It takes you through Derek Sparks' incredible "on-the-field" successes and lets you see how many of the people he trusted, sold him out, "off-the-field." This book depicts a situation which serves as the predecessor to (what most likely will be)future exploitation by "star" athletes, next at the collegiate level and later by agents and money managers, who all want a piece of "the pie" and will do anything to get it.</span>

                    <span>I was very moved by Lessons of the Game and what Derek Sparks had to say. As a first time author, I think he is a very good writer. It encouraging to see athletes prosper off the field. I look forward to reading his next book. It was very brave of him to step up to the plate and deliver. I could not put this book down when I started to read it. As a parent I was concerned by the things that go on under the table. Lessons of the Game will be a required reading in my house hold. Thank you Derek for your sincere care for our youth. <P>Guy Thomas</span>

                    <span>Lessons of the Game is truly an amazing book. Although a non-avid reader, I recently picked up this book and read it within two days. Derek's writing style is very easy to understand. His choice of words to describe things made me know exactly where he was coming from and what it was like at points in Derek's life. I found myself laughing out loud several times as he described scenes as well as almost shedding a tear. This book gives the reader an inside look into Derek's life and true test of character. I believe this book is for the young, old, athletes, non-athletes, or anyone who is ready for an excellent book to read! It is a must read and won't be put down until finished!!!</span>

                    <span>Hello,<BR>I just finished this book and found it very interesting being as how i just finished my first season as a high school quarterback, and i have many of the same aspirations to do what he dreamed of doing. I was wondering though how much of a sugarcoat was put on derek in this book. it played out looking like everyone else were the bad guys. I wondered if one of the so called bad guys were to write a book stating his side who would you belive. But anyhow it was an exelent book and i encourage every one to give this book a try!!!</span>

                    <span>I would highly recommend this book for all young athletes who aspire to compete at a higher level. It is an excellent example of how a young athlete can be convinced he is immune to the rules of the game. As a former high school athlete and coach it also serves as a warning for parents and coaches on how their own behavior can have devasting effects on a young athlete's career and life.</span>
