                    <span>Great book, especially for young girls in their search for self.  This book surely must be based, at least in part, on some observations from East Tennessee Christian Home in Elizabethton, Tennessee because the author has cited several times East Tennessee Children's Home (where the novel is set), as well as Allen Avenue (the actual location of The Home), and Elizabethton, Tennessee (the city in which the novel is set).  I certainly encourage young girls to read the book, as well as their parents.  I think it will lead to more understanding on both sides.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed the book, Where I'd like to be. It had alot of truth behind the story line, it used alot of real life situations. The young girl Maddie had a very inteligent mind and view on life. I also really enjoyed the book because you could actually step into Maddies life and her experiances around her.
<br />
<br />The worst part of the whole book would have to be when you find out that Madiie really does have family but the can't take care of her the way a young girl would need to be taken care of. The best part of the book was when the younge children completed there tree house it turned out great. The book had alot of up and down scenes  it kept you quessing but never left you hanging.
<br />
<br />One story element was when Maddie explains her meeting the the ghost of an elderly man when she was a baby. She explains that the ghost saved her life while at her grandmothers house. She explains that the ghost forced her grandma to awaken and find Maddie tangled up in her blanket fighting for air. Another story elemt is when Logan, Maddie, Murphy, and Ricky Ray go to the lumber yard for supplies for there tree house. They had know way to carry it so the owner of the lumber yard carried to the to logans house where they would constructed the house. They had the tree house up and running in little under a week.</span>

<br />Where I'd like to be
<br />By Frances O' Roark Dowell 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />"Maddie was saved by a ghost," says Maddies grandmother. When Maddie was younger she almost suffocated but then there was a whisper in her Grandmothers ear that caused her to find Maddie in her crib wrapped up in blankets and she couldn't breathe. Maddies Grandmother turned around to thank the man that whispered in her ear but there was nothing there but Maddies empty crib and a very sick baby in her arms. 
<br />When Maddie turned 7 her Grandmother died. Maddie has been all over the country at orphanages and foster homes. When she turned 12 she moved to the east side tenseness children's home. After about a week of living in the home another girl named Murphy moved in she was a little bit spoiled but she made Maddies life more interesting. Maddie also has a best friend named Ricky Ray. Although he is only 6 he is very fun and he is interested in the same things as Maddie.
<br />
<br />They shared a room and there beds were next to each other's. They had some things in common and enjoyed things they didn't. They both brought special possessions from home Maddie got jealous of what Murphy had so she took out the most special thing to her...soon after she showed her she fell in love with it instantly which grew there relationship closer.
<br />
<br />Maddie strived for a place to call home with loving friends and family that cared about her and help her get rid of her past. She even made a "book of houses" in which she would like to live in, a "book of people" in which she admired and a "book of animals" that she loved. Murphy grew closer to Maddie and they became friends. But is Murphy more like a sister or a friend? Could maddies dream come true? Could Maddie have found family? You will have to read the book to find out!

                    <span>This is a great book about friendship. It is a fiction book. It is by Frances O'Roark Dowell.
<br />Some of the things that I like about this book are when Maddie's granny, Ganny Lane, says that when Maddie was an infant she was saved by a ghost. I also like it when Maddie, Ricky Ray, Logan Parish, and Murphy try to build a fort because they are accomplishing a dream together. Another reason I like this book is because it shows true friendship and how people forgive each other.
<br />I would recommend this book to anybody who likes a good fiction book. I would also say that it is more of a young adult book because of some of the vocabulary and events.
