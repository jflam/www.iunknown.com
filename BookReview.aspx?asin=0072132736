                    <span>I think this book was more advanced than I was able to handle, considering I was a beginner computer user.  Nevertheless, when I
<br />e-mailed the author 3-4 times, he was always professional, courteous, and willing to help.  It's a great book and has an author who stands behind his product.  If you are into web-page design, this book is definitely worth its money.  </span>

                    <span>Written for beginners, this book provides a solid foundation in how to write your own HTML (not how to use a WYSIWIG editor, such as FrontPage). Written in friendly, easy-to-understand language, the author progresses from chapter to chapter in a logical step-by-step fashion. What he doesn't cover in any given chapter is easily referenced in the Appendices, or in the many website links he provides. This book completely demystifies HTML.
<br />
<br />However, what I found confusing when learning HTML is when and where to apply the all the different attributes (such as background color, font styles, text & image positioning and so forth). What I learned after having done a fair amount of web development is that cascading style sheets (CSS) are the way to go. This is explained in ch. 10. The reader of this book may wish to jump to this chapter at the beginning and be ahead of the game.</span>

                    <span>I took a course on HTML that lasted 4 months, and I thought I knew HTML after that.  Two years after that I read this book, and in the month it took me to read it and summarize it, I learned more than what I did in that course.  Not only does it teach you almost everything you need to know about HTML in an easy-to-follow way, but it also gets into other subjects like CSS, JavaScript and XML.  Great book!</span>

                    <span>"How to Do Everything in HTML" does exactly what it says.  It simply takes a beginner (like me) and shows how to use basic programming to do what you want rather than what you can figure out.  <p>This is THE book I would recommend to someone who wants to know what HTML is and does but lacks prior computer programming experience.  Even those familiar with other computer languages such as C++ or java will find the user-friendly approach by Pence a joy over most technical books.<p>If a beginner's book is what you want, here it is!</span>

                    <span>If you ... dont want to fork up the [dollar amount] for the book, I suggest going to ... the web.  If you want pay for a book, this book is certainly your best choice. The layout is simple and any person with absolutely no prior knowledge of HTML can learn it in less than two weeks. It also serves as a great reference after you master html, and you need a little help to look back on something you forgot. The only reason it gets four stars, is because it leaves out more complex things that I want to do with html. Other than that, great book!</span>
