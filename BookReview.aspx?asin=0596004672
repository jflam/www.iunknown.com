                    <span>I am an ASP.NET developer, and I have never been too crazy about JavaScript.  It is much too slow to develop, it is finicky to debug, and it is a pain to maintain.
<br />
<br />That is exactly why I love this book.  It shows me exactly what I need to know to add some VERY sophisticated client-side pizzazz to my applications.  Unlike most programming books, you don't have to read half the book to understand the advanced concepts.  Each "recipe" has a more-than-adequate supporting explanation.
<br />
<br />For the last year and a half, I have consulted this book above all other JavaScript references.  It is well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>As the title says, this is a Cookbook of JavaScript recipes. While it does devote a few chapters at the beginning to the basics of JavaScript, do not expect a book to teach you the basics of JavaScript. However, you can expect the contents to cover a reasonable number of common situations and solutions for enhancing web pages.<p>The author covers topics including: navigation menus (mouseovers and expandable trees), graphic layering, frames, positioning and dynamic content. In addition, he offers a chapter on style sheets that provides a wonderful resource for this often neglected topic.<p>Throughout the book the author presents each topic with an overview, followed by selected problems, solutions, code samples and code walk throughs. The prose is concise and well written. <p>For additional reference on JavaScript, try JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.</span>

                    <span>I've had the book two days and it has paid for itself a couple times over already.  I wish I'd had it about two weeks earlier.<p>If you 1) already know a programming language such as C (or really, any procedural language for that matter), 2) are new to Javascript and 3) need to do some web programming with Javascript, this book is great.  Before I bought it, I tried to figure out some of the stuff myself<br>(ie common Javascript problems: 'data validation in a textbox in a form','setting the focus','opening a new window','jumping back to the parent window',etc)<br>by using my Javascript language reference book and looking up the problem on the web.  I'd usually find a solution, but if I would have had this book at the time I could have just looked it up and saved myself a load of time.<p>I'd almost recommend it before a Javascript reference (but you'll eventually need one of those anyway). <p>So, it will come in the most handy for someone relatively new to Javascript who needs to get up to speed quickly on common Javascript tasks, but will also remain useful even to an expert as a reference book of often needed useful code snippets.</span>

                    <span>Review<br>In order to be proficient in a technology, you need to have a solid reference manual for it.  Often this need can be filled very well with the "Nutshell" series by O'Reilly.  But if you're like me, you also want to have a good source of examples and explanations of how to do basic things.  This book fills that role extremely well for JavaScript and DHTML.<p>Danny Goodman is well known for his JavaScript Bible.  The JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook complements that title to show both beginners and experienced developers different ways to use the language.  As someone who isn't quite as adept at JavaScript as he should be, I find this book invaluable in giving me code that I can immediately use and build on.  Between the working examples and a good technical reference, you can go far.<p>Each section in the chapter presents a problem, a solution, and a discussion of the issue.  You're told what browser versions will support this approach, and you are also pointed to other sections in the book that relate to the same issue.  It's a useful approach to presenting the material that gets quick results.  Goodman also includes JavaScript subroutines that accomplish functions that are commonly needed but aren't something you can do in a couple lines of code.  Great code to use for your own applications.<p>For Notes/Domino/Websphere developers, all the information in this review applies.  If you are getting started in web development, get this book along with a good JavaScript reference book.  Between the two of them, you will have all that you need to start producing solid web applications.<p>Conclusion<br>I highly recommend this book for both JavaScript/DHTML beginners and pros.  The beginners will learn how to effectively use the languages, and the pros will pick up a few tricks that they didn't know before.</span>

                    <span>This book has been extraordinarily helpful.  It contains an excellent blend of examples layered onto concepts (i.e.,  a cookbook with an in-depth discussion behind every recipe).  Particularly valuable are the many techniques and solutions it introduces that call upon an enormous amount of collective wisdom regarding different browser behaviors and their respective DOMs.  It's the kind of stuff that will help you provide a cross-browser solution in minutes rather than spending hours to reinvent some pretty tricky wheels.</span>
