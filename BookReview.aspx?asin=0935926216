<br />Stanford Wong's "Professional Blackjack" is simply the best card counting reference book.  It covers every major aspect of the Hi-Lo and Halves counting methods, all the important game variations, the most effective betting procedures and includes a wealth of detailed data.  If you intend to play serious blackjack, that is: if you have a bankroll of $10,000 or more to put at risk, you simply cannot do without this heavy hitter.
<br />
<br />It is not, however, a tutorial.  This should not be your first blackjack book.  Even if you already know how to play blackjack, and have even played a few times in a casino, you will need some solid orientation to get you up to the level of play that will make "Professional Blackjack" useful to you.  Of the choices available, "How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken" does a good job of briefly explaining some of the fine points of casino blackjack and includes a helpful card counting tutorial for the Hi-Lo method.
<br />
<br />Those who offer their own off-brand card counting systems tend to criticize the Hi-Lo method and imply that it is not as functional as some of the more complicated methods of card counting.  The simple truth of the matter is that the Hi-Low system has a 97% Betting Efficiency rating (see Griffin's "Theory of Blackjack") out of a range from about 86% to 99%.  Most other methods are generally more complicated and more prone to error.  Wong's blackjack books focus on the Hi-Lo method because it is both relatively simple and very effective.  As they say, "When Wong speaks, you should listen."
<br />
<br />All of Wong's books, "Basic Blackjack" (which is not all that basic and is also not a tutorial), "Blackjack Secrets",  "Professional Video Poker", "Sharp Sports Betting", "Optimal Strategy for Pai Gow Poker", etc are good, but "Professional Blackjack" is Wong's best.</span>

                    <span>"Professional Blackjack" is just as the title represents: a book for people who have aspirations to play blackjack for a living.  It is a no-nonsense, well-written, serious, blackjack book that tells you more than you ever really wanted to know about how to play blackjack.  Its only drawback, if it has one, is that it expects the reader to enjoy the mathematics and numbers involved in blackjack as much as the author does.  For those who are not serious "number people", this book can be tough sledding.  For those who are, this is undoubtedly the best blackjack book, ever.
<br />
<br />Other really first-rate blackjack books are: "The Theory of Blackjack" by Peter Griffin, who has a sense of humor, in addition to being a real mathematician, and "Beat the Dealer" by Edward Thorp, which is really the foundation book of card counting.  For fun, and a good overview, you should also read Ford's "How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken".  It provides some important perspective that can keep you from getting lost in the woods.
<br />
<br />Every good gambling library should contain these books, in addition to "Professional Blackjack".  Even at the minimum of $5 a hand in most casinos, a few hours of play can add up to some serious money.  The time and expense involved in buying and reading a few good books is quite small compared to the time and expense put at risk when you play blackjack for money.  It always helps to know what you are doing.</span>

                    <span>After reading several reviews, I realized that the reviewers actually tell you nothing about the book and methods, and I would go so far as to say that some really didn't read this book. I am a Level 3 Card Counter. I use the method described in this book known as the "halves counting method". It is the BEST and Most Accurate way to determine when to increase your bet. REALISTICALLY, MOST PEOPLE will NOT have the time and patience to learn it, so they will settle for the Hi-Lo method (also in the book), which will place them at a distinct disadvantage from someone using the "Halves Method". Is there a Better method than the "Halves" - yes, but it requires a "side count of Aces, and this is difficult to do while carrying on conversations and trying to survive at a Blackjack table. Remember this, although there are tips in this book about betting and other things, you have to read more books and play a "ton" of Blackjack to learn how to bet properly, how much to raise, how to read when a high True Count is "running away", and many more savvy bits of information. If you're looking to read ONE book and kill the Casino, it won't happen - if you're thinking you'll win every time out, it won't happen, even with the Halves Count -  but this is the BEST of the books for a diligent Card-Counter who would learn the "Halves Method". Remember, I am recommending this Book for the Halves Method and excellent, accurate tables in the book. I'd give it 5 Stars, but there's a few mistakes (some typographical),  and an asumption about "greater than the count" that leads to a minor error that is not earth shattering. Good Luck to you!</span>

                    <span>Stanford Wong's "Professional Blackjack" is THE essential reference on the game of Blackjack.  That is probably why it is one of the few books recommended by Dr. Ford in his book: "How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken".  
<br />
<br />If you are going to get serious about Blackjack, you must have this book.  It covers all the important details with unsurpassed accuracy.  While all of Wong's books are known for accuracy and attention to detail, "Professional Blackjack" is virtually "The Bible".  Anytime you find yourself in doubt about a what might be the best possible play, simply consult this book.  It contains the right answers.
<br />
<br />Wong's writing style is clear, simple, direct and a bit understated.  His style has the quiet confidence of an author who really does know what he is talking about.  He chooses his words carefully and accurately.  When Wong speaks, you should listen.
<br />
<br />The complexity of the book is due to the subject being more complicated than it appears.  Blackjack looks like a simple game, to the uniformed.  Wong unravels the complexities with unsurpassed clarity.  You simply will not find a better book on the details of Blackjack.

<br />the book is very orginized and consice. it gets right to the point of each subject. 
<br />I simply love this book. I take it with me to every trip (just in case) and read it just for fun. I think I reread it 10 times.
<br />I read so many other books in blackjack. (no one is close). 
<br />If you intend to be a good blackjack player you must have this book. period</span>
