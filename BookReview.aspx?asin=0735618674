                    <span>Windows 2000 automation goes beyond simple and limited BAT/CMD scripts. For total control of Windows you should definitely learn scripting. Although it has an intimidating look (1300+ pages) this book is actually a fast track resource for learning and putting scripts to work immediately. The included CD has an electronic version of the book (not PDF, but in MS Help file format); it also has a separate link with all the scripts organized by tasks for you to copy and paste on your favorite text editor.<P>My interest was focused on Services, I had an urgent need on my project to automate services to start and stop at specific times during the week. I went directly to Chapter 15 on Services and then back to Chapters 2,3 for VBS and WSH reference. In less than a day I was able to resolve my issue using a combination of scripting and Windows Scheduled Tasks. These scripts saved me from having to come in very early to work (before users came in) to restart services that were being shut down during the daily system maintenance window. Manually restarting the services took me around 40 minutes every morning, so this is also a notable consideration.<P>My only criticism, in the hopes that a future edition would improve an already excellent book:<BR>The author explains that this book was not intended to be read in sequence and you may just get directly to the area of interest, but if you are an experienced administrator without scripting experience you have to get all the way to chapter 3 to find out how to run a script. There should have been an introductory section on this subject since there are many working scripts already available on the CD for administrators to use.<P>I recommend this book to any system administrator who wants to ease their daily work load.</span>

                    <span>Ever go through a good technical book - usually about 2-5X the size of your average pulp fiction bestseller - and feel this is one of the best investments you've ever made? The kind you just can't read enough of? If not, read this book.<P>Mature sysadmins need to know scripting. For Windows/AD admins, there's probably no better way to get started with scripting than this book. Every time I saw this book at bookstores, I couldn't help but think most of this stuff is on Microsoft web site.<P>What a mistake! Though most of the info may be available online, the organization of this book, the writing style and approach of the authors, the example scripts, and the accompanying CD with all scripts in the book along with an electronic version - all this make one perfect package to get started with scripting.<P>The book covers VBScript, WSH, Scripting Runtime, ADSI & WMI, and takes a reader through the task of creating scripts to automate everyday sysadmin functions.<P>What's particularly impressive is the fact that the author(s) present each script example - or rather a 'scriptlet' - as a way of accomplishing one particular task (or 'sub-task'). This keeps each example very simple and easy to understand, and you quickly learn to put together the different 'scriptlets' (and what you've learnt) to automate more complex functions.<P>Chapter 17: Writing Enterprise Scripts is a very well-written tutorial on accomplishing tasks like accepting input from text files, redirecting output to web pages, sending email notifications, et al.<P>This book (and the electronic version) has quickly become something I refer to practically every day.<P>Bharat Suneja<BR>MCT</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best, if not THE best scripting book I have read. As it states, it is written for the administrator, so its focus is limited to that aspect of scripting. But it is so well focused, well written, concise and full of pertinent examples that I couldn't help but learn more about scripting that is applicable to all aspects of scripting. I have applied lessons learned here to Access VBA, for example, with great effect.<BR>If you have only one book on scripting, this is it. It covers VBScript, JScript, ADSI, WMI, etc. Very well done and well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>If you want to write a script on how to find the cosine of an angle, this *isn't* your book. This is specifically geared to system administrators to make our lives significantly easier.<P>If you don't know anything about scripting, this is a great resource to get you started. It starts with the basics of VBScript, adds in things like WMI and WSH, and brings it all together for you to get work done. <P>If you already know scripting, this is a great reference book. <P>The most horrible thing (and what caused the 4 stars) is that there are an unacceptable number of typos in this book. Of course, if you are reading this, it's fairly easy to see these errors because the code and description don't make sense together...</span>
