                <span id="Label1"><p>In the late 1990s, author Rockford Lhotka wrote extensively on creating distributed, object-oriented Windows applications using Visual Basic 6, COM, and DCOM. The introduction of .NET has motivated him to revisit these themes and revise his strategy. In this book, he explains the changes introduced by .NET, the new possibilities that are emerging, and an essential tutorial on the best ways to make .NET work for you.</p>  <p>This book is divided into three parts. In the first, Lhotka analyzes logical and physical application architectures, exploring their effect on scalability, fault tolerance, and performance. In the second, he implements and documents a Visual Basic .NET framework for the creation of distributed, object-oriented applications that employ .NET technologies including remoting, serialization, and auto-deployment. This framework encapsulates functionality such as database access, transaction handling, and location transparency.</p>  <p>In the last part of the book, you&#146;ll use the framework to create a sample application, and discover the ease with which you can write Windows, Web, and Web services interfaces for the underlying objects. In addition, this book contains the author&#146;s own Component-based, Scalable, Logical Architecture (CSLA .NET), an object-oriented framework that can act as the foundation for a diverse range of enterprise applications. By the end of the book, you&#146;ll be free to examine, use, and modify this architecture for your own needs.</p></span>

                    <span>I don't know of any other author as dedicated as Rocky Lhotka in helping developers to most productively apply software engineering best practices to solve real-world problems.  VB .NET Business Objects is the only text I have found that is successful in developing 100% of the instruction needed for a developer with a moderate to advanced understanding of OO development to become significantly more productive when developing enterprise solutions.
<br />
<br />I award Rocky 6.0 out of 5 stars on his the .NET version of his text.  (A previous edition covered VB 6.0 and an upcoming edition will address VB .NET 2.0.)
<br />
<br />No single text can address all aspects of software development and this book far exceeds all or almost all others available.  That being said (and without reducing the score I assign to Rocky's book), there are always improvements that can be made.  Here are my recommendations for the next edition:
<br />
<br />Readers who are new to OO development and who are using this text to understand best practices of applying OO techniques while they simultaneously learn OO basics from another source will find the text challenging.  Rocky's book provides some basic OO instruction but is most beneficial to those with a fairly solid grasp of the underlying concepts.  That statement is not intended to reflect negatively on the book, as no single book can address all needs.
<br />
<br />One suggestion of how Rocky might expand the audience for his next edition, however, is to select a different case study for the book to follow.  The current edition uses a Project Tracker case developed by Rocky for the book to illustrate the concepts he describes.  Less experienced developers could gain more benefit from the book if Rocky selected a case study that was already described in a well-respected beginning-intermediate OO text.  Rocky could focus on how to implement the case study using the CSLA .NET framework.  Readers who are new to OO design could reference the detailed instruction in the corresponding text if they need a better understanding of the underlying OO concepts.
<br />
<br />I am sure there are many case study options available for selection; I happen to like the POS case study used by Craig Larman in "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development, Third Edition."
<br />
<br />With such an approach, Rocky could produce a volume that would be as beneficial to beginning developers as his current text is to intermediate and advanced developers.  The level of support that Rocky (along with the large and responsive VB .NET BO community of readers) graciously provides would likely be significantly reduced if an existing text answered many readers' basic OO questions.
<br />

                    <span>I have bought many book, most of them have been worthless. This is not one of them. I have read this book twice and it was worth it. The author actually responds to postings at his website. If you really want to think about what you are doing when you are creating business objects, You must buy this book. The material is somewhat complex and there were alot of time I did not understand how it worked. Once I got it to work I was very impressed. I am thinking about buying the book again, because my copy is so worn and so full of marks. When was the last time you bought a book twice. It is that good!</span>

                    <span>I developed a number of apps. utilizing Rocky's architecture for VB6, so, when I was learning VB.NET and noticed Rocky had a book out on his CSLA architecture in .NET, I knew I had to buy it.  As is the case with all of Rocky's books, they are the best value out there.  He explains the stuff extremely well, (yes, I have to read a few of the chapters a couple of times, but, this is some difficult stuff) and follows up his explanations with solid, correctly executing code.  I learn best by examples, and loading his projects and stepping through them provide me with an invaluable learning experience.  I cannot wait for his C# book on CSLA.  I have already been on his website and downloaded the beta code in C# and started working on some C# projects so when his book comes out, I will have already tackled the material.</span>

                    <span>Being new to .NET when I bought this book (a year ago), I was looking for architectural guidance. I wanted a layered architecture that fit well with object oriented programming. This book clearly hits the mark. The topic (Rocky's CSLA architecture) is great. It's based on some really sound principles, and has a noble goal: namely, smart business objects. And it gives good detail. While CSLA centers on the business layer, Rocky does a good job of explaining how it fits in with other layers. <p>Perhaps the thing I like best is the writing. Rocky is an excellent author. He stays on track, he's organized, and above all he is clear. He forsees many of your questions and answers them up front. <p>And Rocky puts his money where his mouth is. He addresses questions about the CSLA framework in the MSN email group on a daily basis. Let me see: a free architecture (he isn't selling a product, you're free to use the CSLA architecture in your work), an excellent book, and an author who's accessible and keeps working to advance the architecture in his free time! <p>If you have any lingering doubts, then go to a book store and pick up a copy and read the first two chapters. He does a fantastic job of explaining what he was trying to accomplish and how he went about it and the various design trade-offs that he encountered and how and why he chose to address each of them. If even skimming the first two chapters doesn't convince you it's worth the read, I'd be very surprised. <p>Finally, I would like to comment on an earlier review suggested that Rocky was retrofitting CSLA for VB.NET. I would like to respectfully differ. I think that CSLA fits BETTER with the .NET framework than it did in VB6. In VB6, he required several work arounds to problems that have been resolved in .NET, and these are clearly mentioned in the book. <p>p.s. The book was so highly sought after in the development community that he has written a C# version of it too, for those who are interested. It may be out already.</span>
