                    <span>I loved this book!  It is one of the best baseball books I have read.  It has more meaning for me because my nephew played in the Cape League and I know exactly what these kids are going through.  </span>

                    <span>This is a terrific book.  It balances nicely between an inside look (and it is quite honest about the players and other characters, showing their true human qualities--it does not pretty them up) and an ode to the one of the last places where the true spirit of the game lives.  I had long known of the league, but mostly through the reports of Peter Gammons and Baseball America.  It was all numbers and thumb nail scouting reports.  This book added layer after layer of humanity to these guys.  It also captures quite beautifully the connection of the game and the mythical qualities and the small town virtues.  It doesn't overdo it either.  The touches are excellent.  The narrative is a bit meandering at times, but that is ok, so is the game.  A beautiful tribute to the men (mostly Pauly, D'Antona, and Stauffer) and a game that is timeless.  Thank you Jim Collins.  </span>

                    <span>If you have been vacationing on The Cape for your whole life or if you've never stepped foot near the Sagamore Bridge, this book will win you over.  It's wonderfully written and has marvelous insight not only into the Cape Cod Baseball League but the lives of these young men during what is no doubt the best summer of their lives.  Overall it's an excellent read and it really makes you want to go down to a FREE game on the cape and watch baseball the way it was meant to be played.</span>

                    <span>The Last Best League is a wonderful book, right up there with Good Enough to Dream, The Celebrant, A False Spring, and my other favorite baseball books.  Jim Collins takes us inside the Cape Cod League via the Chatham A's, and although the A's didn't have a winning Cape season, it's fascinating to see the changes and growth in those involved.  As other reviewers have noted, Collins gets the ins and outs of baseball, and the pace of this book is perfect. As they say "I couldn't put it down"..I'd like to point out that this book doesn't come across as a "tell all", but more as an appreciation.  Faults are pointed out, but not exploited.  Thanks Mr. Collins for a terrific read.  I hope to someday enjoy some summer evenings in Chatham..</span>

                    <span>Once I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down! Growing up, we spent several weeks each summer in Chatham, and some of my favorite memories are going to the Chatham A's baseball games. Jim Collins does an outstanding job of capturing the atmosphere of Chatham and the other "baseball towns" on the Cape. He also writes of the love and dedication that Cape Cod residents have for their teams, and the fanaticism with which they attend games. Watching the games as a child, they just seemed like good fun to me, and it was something that everyone in the area enjoyed. However, since reading this book, I've come to understand just how important the Cape Cod League is to promising baseball players. Even now, all grown up, I still enjoy going the those games whenever I go home, although I now look at it with a new perspective. Even if you've never read a sports-related book before this (like myself), I think you'll truly enjoy Jim Collins' portrayal of one of the last places in the USA where baseball is viewed the way it is...</span>
