                    <span>The few snippets of Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech that are dutifully trotted out every January give little indication of his incredible ability to communicate and inspire. To me, the only way to experience the power of King's word is to hear them as he preached them. His slow, halting starts; his slow build ups; his hoarse, shouting, growling and resonant voice; ideas that are recombined and developed from speech to speech; King's evident weariness, outrage and persistence; and the enthusiastic, rapturous response of his audiences come across infinitely better on audio than they do on the printed page.
<br />
<br />"A Call to Conscience" highlights King at his best. His erudition and breadth of knowledge were astounding; his ability to apply the words of Jesus and Gandhi to the civil rights struggle connected abstract principles of religion and civil disobedience to real life suffering; his commitment to end segration and discrimation by non-violent means was awe-inspiring; his desire to build a loving brotherhood of all races was visionary; his willingness to suffer without bitterness at the hands of his enemies sets him high and apart from many in the human race. Each speech is introduced by someone involved with King and the struggle for equality. Speeches are often followed by gospel music sung during the movement. Taken together, these elements comprise an elegant and moving tribute to a man whose words and actions propelled America out of self-imposed hypocrisy, and toward a world in which all are measured by the content of our character, and not the color of our skins.

                    <span>An outstanding history of the Civil Rights movement through the most famous speeches of MLK. I particularly enjoyed his final speech which we hear words from but was full of inspiration and foresight as to what would become of America and its black citizens and their victory in the struggle for freedom.<br>A must for every buddding philosopher, peace activist and politician.</span>

                    <span>Reviewer: Mark Lamendola,... author of over 3500 articles.<p>Inspiring, informative, and soul-stirring, this tape brings to life the original recordings of Martin Luther King, Jr.<p>Having grown up in the era of the Vietnam war and civil rights demonstrations, I got this tape thinking it would help me remember some of the key issues of the time and compare them to where we are now.<p>What I was not expecting was the emotional and spiritual journey this tape took me on--it was a journey at a speed that made me look for my seat belt.<p>Let me interject a personal note here. I am not an African American. I am not black, but neither am I white. My family name is an "Americanized" version of a Sicilian name. While my family did not emerge from slavery on southern plantations, it did emerge from near slave conditions in Sicily. I would also like to note that Sicily was invaded by the African Moors, as is evident by the curly hair and nose structure of modern Sicilians--and by the fact we get sickle cell anemia (whites do not get this disease).<p>Italian-Americans, who make up 6% of the USA population also underwent an era of extreme prejudice and discrimination--as did African-Americans, who make up 13% of the American population.<p>Some people malign Dr. King as "that nigger who riled up all the niggers." Others said he was moving too fast. Others said he was asking for too much. And on and on. What these people fail to realize is Dr. King wasn't riling up anybody. He was not an agitator. He made a call to love. When you listen to his speeches, this all becomes very clear. I am not comparing King the Man to Christ the Lord, but to condemn his call to love does compare him to Christ and does condemn both King the man and Christ the Lord. To my mind, that is hypocritical and presumptuous.<p>In his speeches, Dr. King presented such concepts as:<p>*African-American slaves are not rightful property and never were. These people were kidnapped from their homes in the area of the Gold Coast.<p>*The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 declared all men (grammatical convention makes the pronoun gender-neutral in this context) equal. Yet, 100 years later, American people of color had actually moved backwards in relation to "white people." King presented incontrovertible evidence of the nullification of the Emancipation Proclamation and the abandonment of law and order that allowed suppression and oppression of an entire race of people.<p>*The segregation movement was part of a "divide and conquer" strategy to keep poor whites--especially poor Southern whites in their place by creating an even lower class.<p>*As a unit, African-Americans have more wealth than most countries--including France!<p>*No violent uprising has ever succeeded, unless it had the support of the general population. African-Americans did not have, and could not possibly have, such support in the USA.<p>*A violent uprising by African-Americans could never come to any possible good. At the outset, it would increase fear and mistrust. The government would be duty-bound to squash it, and had the power to do so. Violent uprisers would have to defeat the local police, then the county police, then the state police, then the state militia, then the National Guard, then the US Armed Forces--not exactly the recipe for success.<br>But non-violent action could succeed. This is what Dr. King espoused.<p>Dr. King said two conditions existed:<br>1. Power without love--this characterized the white system .<br>2. Love without power--this characterized the black community.<p>His goal was to combine power with love--not for black people, but for the brotherhood of mankind. His vision was that people would be judged by their character, not by the color of their skin.<p>This tape concludes with an incredibly moving speech, given to an audience of 10,000 in Tennessee. ... <p>It was Dr. King's last speech, given the day before a killer stopped Dr. King's campaign of love and brotherhood by severing Dr. King's spine just below his chin.</span>

                    <span>It is no doubt MLK's speeches are great and did alot<br>to shape American thinking.  Unfortunately, I can only <br>play the first 2 CDs on my CD player.  I have a friend<br>who has a CD player that can play all of them.  Apparently<br>it has something to do with the index numbering on each<br>CD.  Instead of each CD starting at 1 it starts where the previous CD left off.  I wouldn't take a chance that this<br>product won't play in your CD player.  I think it is very<br>unfortunate that I paid so much for the complete set of speeches<br>and I can't listen to most of it.<br>I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT VERSION COMES OUT THAT CORRECTS THIS<br>FLAW.<br>It would have been also nice to have some text to accompany the <br>audio CDs.</span>
