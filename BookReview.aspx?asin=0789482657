                <span id="Label1">These four companion books take a dramatic look at our watery planet.  <P>"From space, Planet Earth is blue. It floats like a jewel in the inky black void. The reflection of the sun's light from the vast expanse of water covering its surface creates it gemlike blue color. In the entire solar system, Earth is the only planet that has water in liquid form in such quantities." Scientist have calculated that 70 percent of our planet is covered by water; small wonder that the human being shave always been so fascinated by the oceans and what lies beneath. Today, while we still have so much more of the ocean realm to uncover, we have discovered enough to know that beneath the waves lies a vast treasure-trove of rich and diverse life. Accompanying the television series of the same name, The Blue Planet leads up on a voyage of exploration from the coasts, the very edges of the oceans, to the deep where weird and monstrous fish lurk in a world of perpetual darkness. Along the way we are introduced to a whole host of wonderful creatures -- from tiny copepods to majestic blue whales, and from the grotesque hairy anglerfish, to the amazing tripod fish that stands on its three delicate legs waiting to snap up unsuspecting prey. Complete with a foreword by Sir David Attenborough and 400 full-color photographs, The Blue Planet is the first complete and comprehensive portrait of the whole ocean system.</span>

                    <span>After watching the 'Blue Planet' documentaries on TV I developed an interest about life under the sea. Some of the documentary footage was truly groundbreaking work in terms of capturing the animals on film and bringing it to our homes in such a unique way. <P>The book, like the documentary is truly a great piece of work. It's well planned, presented and written. It covers all aspects of ocean life with out becoming to specific with regard to certain species. Some of the photographs throughout the book are truly wonderful; this book is a must for everyone, of all ages. It will satisfy any appetite for deep-sea discovery, shore life and marine biology.<P>5 Stars, This book has everything you need and more, and the presentation is second to none.</span>

Brilliant and sure to appeal to ages ranging from 8 to 80 years old.</span>

                    <span>It seems as though there could not possibly be any place left on the planet that is yet to be explored and exploited. Nevertheless the world's highest mountains and deepest caverns remain unexplored under the seas, many out of human reach. In fact, 60 percent of the oceans' waters and inhabitants are more than one mile below the surface. This book, a companion to the BBC/Discovery Channel television series and also available on video, is a feast for the eyes, with page after page of remarkable photos of grotesque, exotic creatures and beautiful landscapes. Chapters delve into man's attempts at exploration, the science behind the tides, the sea's prehistoric survivors, and the ecology of the various habitats seashore, trenches, polar regions, and coral reefs. The book covers the oceans' diverse plant life; plankton, the microscopic diatoms that produce the majority of oxygen on the planet and without which humankind would never have evolved; the sociology of whales; the ravages of pollution; and much more. The attractive layout includes myriad fascinating facts and well-written, accessible text. The index can be used to research a particular topic or the book can simply be browsed to gape at the amazing photography, typical of a DK publication. Even those who find underwater creatures creepy are guaranteed to exclaim aloud in amazement, no matter what page they pick. The coffee-table-style format is well worth the price tag.</span>
