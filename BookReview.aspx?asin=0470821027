                    <span>While the first three parts of this book are interesting and thought-provoking, and the data the author presents appear authentic, the fourth part of the book is the first time the reader is given a glimpse of the author's considerable biases.
<br />
<br />Because the author is so radical in his fourth part conclusions and suggestions, I found myself wondering if any of the first three parts of the book were presented in an unbiased manner.
<br />
<br />Duncan, the author, seemed to be writing to imply that he was "just giving the facts", but the conclusions he draws from the data don't seem to follow from the data.
<br />
<br />After reading some of the faulty logic and far-fetched conclusions in his fourth section, I found myself wondering if any of his economics was valid at all (and consequently if I had wasted a great deal of my time reading the book).  Had I understood the biases the author presents in the final section of the book, I probably would have selected another book to get my information from.
<br />
<br />Two stars is as high as I can rate this book.  It may be worth only one.    </span>

                    <span>Gold Trade created equilibrium in the trade deficit.  Here is how it worked.  Gold must leave the country in the form of a payment for a commodity.  As gold flows out credit contracts and the economy recedes, so product prices become cheaper.  Cheaper product price cause foreign nations to make purchases and gold flow into the country where foreign country purchases with gold payments. Product price would control the inflow and outflow of gold seeking equilibrium.  A country experiencing a trade imbalance would accumulate more gold, the surplus would be credit, expanding credit would fuel an economic boom, provoke inflating prices, and inflated prices would slow down exports and import rise.  
<br />
<br />Gold reserves prevented budget deficits.  With only a limited amount of credit available to the government, borrowing would drive up interest rates making it more difficult for business to borrow money.  The government would crowd out the private sector with its borrowing.  Government deficits also tend to result in trade deficits and gold outflows.  Initially the government spending would stimulate the economy and imports would increase inline with the growth of the economy; however, as gold left the country recession pressures would return, gold would leave the country, interest rates rise, and prices fall.  Recognizing the undesirable effect deficit spending would have on the economy the government would attempt to maintain balanced budget as long as the country was at peace.
<br />
<br />Brett Woods created a fixed exchange rate system in which the U.S dollar was pegged to gold at $35 per ounce.  The value of the dollar was back by the gold reserves of the United States.  The 1960s represented a breakdown with heavy investment overseas and rapidly increasing expenditures from the Vietnam War contributed to the country's balance of payments.  Foreign countries found themselves holding dollars and began exchanging the dollars for the gold reserves
<br />
<br />In 1971 the gold flow was small but by 1973 the flow was a torrent. In 1973, Nixon suspends the gold for dollars policy and opened competition for currencies to be traded against other foreign currencies.
<br />
<br />Bubble economies overheat, hyper-inflate, and burst leaving their governments in political disarray and deeply in debt.
<br />
<br />Large inflows of foreign investment are stored in banks and banks use the money to create credit.  Monetary authorities sell bonds yielding rates to the public to soak up the undesirable liquidity and reduce the money supply.  Foreign assets in banks cause the money supply to rise. 
<br />
<br />Hyperinflation occurs when monetary authorities fail to soak up liquidity, as was the case with Asia monetary authorities who failed to regulate their foreign inflow of money and banks generated credit leading to hyper inflated land prices.
<br />
<br />New currency to purchase foreign assets is possible as government issues bonds to create high powered money.   In 1980, the U.S had $4 trillion credit market and by 2001, the credit amount was $29 trillion.
<br />
<br />The imbalance of trades created a credit expansion.  For example, Japan banks used the trade imbalance to increase the money supply 356% in the 1960s.   At the end of 2001, the U.S held $2.3 trillion indebtedness to the rest of the world or 23 percent of GDP and $500 billion surplus is reinvest back into U.S dollar dominated assets.   One could argue that credit growth is equivalent to GDP growth and therefore manageable.  Growth is a function of corporate profitability and profit alone sustains the growth not debt with debt provide short term benefits.  Private invest rises more than consumption during strong economic growth and personal consumption makes up the majority of demand in all major economies. 1990s experienced larger GDP than normal as an increased share of private investment purchased software and equipment for the dot.coms and telecoms.  As financial credit worthiness worsen, credit extension slowed down expanding only 2 percent in 2002.  Hard hit by credit troubles companies were quick to fire employees unemployment between Oct 2000 and June 2002 rose to 8.4 million and the rate rose to 5.9%.   Consumer indebtedness is fueling consumption in the U.S.  Consumers are have a hard time servicing their debt and borrowing 78% of GDP.  Debt can not expand faster than income indefinitely.  The sharp debt is occurring at a time when interest rates have never been cheaper.  Pressure starts to mount against the consumer as interest rise and interest payments become a heavier burden.  Without new loans to refinance old loans they must declare bankruptcy.  The bubble does not recede slowly, it crashes.   Switching to the government sector, in 2005, a federal debt of $8 trillion will expense the government $500 billion in interest payments, 4.5% of GDP with little doubt the government can service its debt.   Systematic banking crisis accompany economic crisis, for example, 30 percent of banks fail in the great depression.  Duncan points out that the risk is the $150 trillion derivatives market meltdown.
<br />
<br />Surplus nations earn their surpluses in US Dollars. By investing their dollar surpluses in US dollar assets, the trading partners of the United States helped fuel the stock market bubble, facilitated the incredible misallocation of corporate capital, and, by acquiring Fannie Mae debt, contributed to the dangerous rise in US property prices.  Where did the money go? U.S bond market total $2.5 trillion a $400 billion increase 2001 to 2002, commercial paper $1.32 trillion, mortgage related securities $1.01 trillion, new issues corporate bonds $388.2 billion, Fed agencies long term new issues $453 billion and $659 billion short term, treasury gross coupon issuance $233 billion, and municipal issuance $196 billion.  Surplus nations need $500 billion of investment vehicles each year in the financial, corporate, and household sector.  At present 40 percent of privately held U.S treasuries is held by foreigners.  The risk occurs should the foreign country decide to sell off for political or economic reasons.  For this reason it is unlikely the percent will exceed 50 percent.  Surplus nations would need look too the private sector to spend $250 billion dollars and the $800 billion U.S budget deficit will play a part of a safe dollar denomination asset.  Between 2000 and 2002, U.S equities markets lost $8 trillion in market capitalization or 48 percent drop but still maintaining a P/E of 26.  Surplus nations are less prone to invest in a market with high P/E ratios seeking a 15 P/E viewing the stock market as overvalued.  The remaining major investment is direct investment through purchasing U.S companies and U.S companies must maintain the attraction by keeping their earnings high.  A slowing economy will deter foreign investment.
<br />
<br />Deflation occurs when supply exceeds demand.  World War I, when the began and 1917 when the U.S entered the war, U.S gold reserves rose 64%, as Europe exchanged its gold for U.S goods.  Once the war end, gold continue to flow into the U.S as allies repaid their war debt.  The credit base double during this time period, industrial machinery and equipment output rose by 205% and all producer durables increased by 257%.  This surge in industrial capacity created an oversupply by 1926 and as a result the wholesale price declined.  In 1921 the fed sold large amounts of government debt and caused credit to contract by 8% through the economy into a brief recession.
<br />
<br />When the dollar earnings of the surplus nations are deposited into their domestic banking systems, those dollars, being exogenous to those banking system, act as high powered money and spark off an explosion of credit creation. Excessive credit creation permits over-investment, which, in turn, causes excess capacity and deflation. So long as the huge US current account deficits continue to flood the world with dollars, global deflationary pressures are very likely to continue to build, as reckless credit creation results in more industrial capacity than can be absorbed at the prevailing price level.
<br />
<br />Falling product prices make it impossible for businesses to repay their bank loans. A similar process occurs when excessive credit creation causes asset price bubbles in the stock market and the property market. Rapid loan growth causes asset prices to rise. Frequently banks accept the inflated assets as collateral for additional loans. This process continued for so long in Japan that the imperial gardens in Tokyo came to be considered as valuable as California. Eventually, it becomes impossible to pay the interest expense on such extraordinarily overvalued assets. The owners default, the banks then refuse to make new loans, the house of cards in asset prices begins to shake, panic sets in, the bubble pops and banks fail.

                    <span>This was a very informative book for me, although I would recommend it only for those who have a reasonable understanding of economics, and who are familiar with  international trade, foreign exchange, and Keynesian and monetarist theories. The author does explain these things, but you really need to know about them beforehand.
<br />
<br /> The data and charts the author uses to inform the reader about what is going on in global trade and finance are impressive. I would wager that a book like this would have been impossible before the advent of  readily available computer data. There is some repetition in the book, however, but it is convenient repetition.
<br />
<br /> Before reading this book, I was aware of the problems the endless U.S. trade deficits are creating. However I was not aware of  just how pervasive the problem is, and how one country after another gets hit hard by a powerful financial crisis followed by an intractable economic contraction.
<br />
<br />First the exporting countries get hit. An export country normally recycles most of its dollar surplus back into U.S. investments. What this means is that the U.S. pays for the excess goods it imports by selling either debt instruments, or real property, to the exporting country.  But also, enough of the export country's dollar surplus  gets converted into the local currency to cause a stock market and real estate boom and a rising currency. An example was Japan in the 80s: up and up went the markets, while the exporters were having an increasingly difficult time making a profit, because of the increasing local costs and an increasing currency exchange rate. Finally, the high stock market levels can no longer be justified and balloon goes pop, and we have a mess that can take a decade or more to clean up, as in Japan. And the author gives a convincing case for why China will be next on the hit list.
<br />
<br />The importing country, the U.S., in turn gets hit too. The recycled dollars from the exporting nations fuel a stock market boom, as in the 90s, with lots of new IPOs and new industrial capacity being created--and over capacity too. At the same time, U.S. companies, finding it ever harder to sell at home in the face of the ever rising tide of cheap imports, find themselves making smaller profits, and so less able to  justify their stock prices. The collapse becomes inevitable, and happened starting in 2000.
<br />
<br />But what made this book an eye-opener for me is the author's well documented argument that we have experienced  only Phase One of the U.S. contraction, in which the Fed reacts to the contraction by reducing interest rates drastically, and so mortgage interest rates, and so fuels a counteracting housing boom.  Now, the contraction in each country that's hit is intractable, the author asserts, taking a decade or more to recover from, and none of the reviews posted on this website seem to have made any comment on the author's prediction that Phase Two of the U.S. contraction is therefore still to come. All that is covered in the second half of the book.
<br />
<br /> The author, writing nearly three years ago, predicted that the low U.S. interest rates would cause a housing boom, and a lower dollar, which indeed they have. He also predicted that the low rates would give the contracting U.S. economy a stimulating respite, which they also have, because of people refinancing their homes and then using the funds to buy consumer goods. That stimulates  production at home, but more imports too. However, the low-interest-rate Fed stimulus will  grind to a halt, says the author, by 2004 at the latest, when housing prices reach an inevitable unaffordability level, and stop going up, even start coming down. At this point, the consumer binge fueled by home refinancing will stop, because everybody is up to their necks in debt, and can't refinance any more. The contraction will then resume with a vengeance--unless the Fed postpones the inevitable once more by pumping massive amounts of liquidity into the economy. 
<br />
<br />Well, we seem to be just past the housing-boom price peak, the flood of imports is worse than ever, and over capacity is everywhere, and so far the author's been dead right about how things will unfold. The ball's now in the Fed's court. Phase Two of the U.S. contraction is inevitable, says the author, its exact nature, and when it happens, depending only on how the Fed tries to stop it! To me it looks like the Fed has decided to flood the markets with liquidity as the solution, while raising interest rates slowly to keep the dollar up. This should keep prices, including home prices, from falling for now, and may even make the stock market go up in another speculative bubble, as in the late twenties. But if the author is right, this will provide just a bit more short term relief before the inevitable massive contraction prevails and dollar falls much further.
<br />
<br /> If you want to understand what's going on, buy this book. Many disparaging reviewers  have made much of the author's curative proposal that the long-term problem of trade deficits might be solved by a slow increase in the minimum wage in exporter countries like China ($5 per day at present). The discussion about this takes up only the last few pages of the book. The measure might well help, but it will be a long time before anything like that happens, if ever. The proposal can be treated as merely a largely irrelevant speculative addendum for purposes of debate. Don't let it stop you from reading this eye-opening book.

                    <span>This book was a big disappointment. It is very poorly written and the "solutions" the author proposes for fixing what's broken with the USD & international trade border on economic lunacy. You think I'm exagerating? You decide:
<br />
<br />In the last chapter of this unfortunate book, the author proposes two "solutions" for the weak dollar and international trade imbalances. Here they are:
<br />
<br />1. Global Minimum Wage
<br />2. Global Money Supply Control
<br />
<br />I'm not sure these two ideas would fix USD & international trade woes, but they would undoubtedly result in massive global unemployment & inflation, and they would serve as a very solid foundation on which to establish global tyranny on a scale that is hard to imagine today. The foolishness and potential destructiveness of these ideas raises grave questions, in my mind, about Mr. Duncan's competence in the economic sphere. 
<br />
<br />On every page you will find international trade and monetary policy jargon and vague chains of reasoning that are never adequately explained. This sort of writing may be fine for an experienced international trade professional, but it doesn't help lay readers seeking to learn more about the serious issues involved. I think many readers will find this book PRODUCES confusion rather than clarity.  
<br />
<br />One of the main theses in the book is that rising central bank assets cause inflation. While an argument can be supported that there is a "connection" between the two, one would be hard pressed to show that the connection is directly causal. Rather than clearly establishing a rational foundation for this claim, the author succeeds only in doing a lot of handwaving on the point. Inexplicably, the book focuses on reserve asset levels as the cause and ignores the inherently inflationary effect of fractional reserve banking systems & paper reserve assets. Hmmmm, I wonder why?
<br />
<br />Concerning the same thesis, the book offers up many, many charts and graphs displaying all sorts of statistics tangential to the point, but somehow, the author never quite gets around to displaying any stats that explicitly show the US rate of inflation increasing in step with the Fed's total reserve asset level. Hmmm? What a puzzler, Mr. Duncan. Seems like you'd want to back up the major contention of your book (which you repeat mantra-like ad nauseum) with just such statistics, yet none is presented. Curious indeed. 
<br />
<br />Also, several graphs of central bank reserve assets are displayed, "...without gold", with no explanation as to why gold central bank assets are not included. Again, I wonder why?  
<br />
<br />Every chapter is awash with unstated assumptions and vague chains of reasoning. Also, a large proportion of the statisics and studies on which the author bases his assertions & conclusions are from the IMF, for which Mr Duncan worked for years. In summary, the book appears to be nothing more that a global central banker proposing global central government "solutions"
<br />
<br />Sounds like the author subscribes to the well known dictum: EVERY problem looks like a nail if the only tool you have is a BIG HAMMER.
<br />
<br />To be sure, there are useful descriptions of certain aspects of the machinery of international trade and banking, but you'll have to dig through so much confused thinking and just plain muddy water, it's not worth fishing out the occassionally satisfying tidbit. 
<br />
<br />Save your money!! This book only serves to confuse the issues involved. Consider yourself warned.
