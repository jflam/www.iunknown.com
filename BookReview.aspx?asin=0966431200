                    <span>Although I do agree this book has un-catchy cover; the contents are far beyond expectations. The cover should read more like "How to Super-Charge your Goals", because that is exactly what this book shows you to do. Teitelbaum shows you exactly how to "Burn-in" your major goals to have them effectively reach your subconscious mind and create belief in your own abilities to achieve them. <P> Many self-help books indicate that you need to have a burning desire to achieve your goals; but don't really explain step by step how this is achieved. Teitelbaum's book reveals the secrets of mental training that world-class athletes have used for years to Laserfocus their brains on the outcome. The book is easy to read and packed with dozens of different techniques to keep you busy for weeks practicing them.<P> This book I believe is the missing link (The catalyst) to implement any other success program. It can be used from any goal that motivates you. Even if the goal does not motivate you, the techniques in this book show you step by step how to make the end result so sweet to your brain, that it is inevitable that you will reach your outcome. <BR>This book is the cornerstone for anyone who is truly serious about achieving the end result.</span>

                    <span>For many years I have been unable to discipline myself to take consistant, positive action in the direction of my goals. I read dozens of books with little result. In "The Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness" Daniel Teitelbaum gives step by step instructions on how to present your dreams to your mind so that you automatically become motivated on a daily basis. It's nothing short of incredible. I have already come a long way to achieving my life's ambitions. I couldn't recommend the book highly enough.</span>

                    <span>Dan couldn't motive Punxsutawney Phil to look for his shadow. Where does he come up with this stuff? It's so clearly a bad rehash of other self-help books. Did he even do any research? And what makes him qualified to "teach" this stuff? Maybe Martha Stewart heard him speak. If companies really do hire him, it's no wonder American business is losing its competitive edge. What he professes seems in line with the moral and ethical decline of "Corporate America." Heck, he probably writes his own reviews on Amazon. I can't believe I wasted any money on this book. At least I'll have kindling for next winter.</span>

                    <span>I have never bothered writing a review for a book before but feel compeled to do so in this case. This is the best self help book I have ever read, it'll change your life if you work at it. I'll stop there, enough said, buy it, work with it and grow.</span>
