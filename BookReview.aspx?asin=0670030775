                    <span>This lively book provides an overview of the literary achievements and personal life of Charles Dickens. For those Amazon.com customers who, like me, don't know how to approach this writer's vast achievements, I provide this advice from Smiley, who is an intelligent, charming, and enthusiastic biographer: "But a newcomer to Dickens can do no better than to begin with a novel-my suggestions are David Copperfield, to be followed by Great Expectations, Dombey and Son, A Tale of Two Cities, and Our Mutual Friend, in that order, light, dark, light, dark, light, a wonderful chiaroscuro of Dickens's most characteristic and accessible work." Bravo for Jane and her fun and concise treatment of an enormous subject!</span>

                    <span>Jane Smiley is a leading contemporary novelist whose insight into the difficult arcane world of writing for profit is helpful in reviewing our greatest English novelist.  As self-described Charles Dickens was the "inimitable." Dickens draws a broad stoke as his thousands of characters lie, cheat,[borrow], love, live and [end life] on the canvas of humanity.<br>   As one who has read all the standard biographies of the 19th behemoth of literature that was Dickens I can highly recommend this excellent book.  <br>   Smiley provides a sketch of Dickens life including warts and all.  Her dissection of the affair the middle aged author engaged in with actress Ellen Ternan was well done in looking at what may have motivated Dickens to break with his wife Catherine and thumb his nose at Victorian respectability.<br>   Dickens is a mixture of good and bad with the humanity and essential goodness of the man on display.<br>   This little book in the excellent Penguin Viking Biography series could be well used in an introductory course on Dickens, the nineteenth century English novel or on the art of literary biography.<br>   Smiley made me smile and laugh as I explored the mind of a genius with this gifted biographer.  It is the best biography I have so far read in this series.</span>

                    <span>I've read about half the books in the Penguin series and I'd rate this at the top (other favorites are the bios of Leonardo da Vinci and James Joyce).  It's only 207 pages long but there is no sense that anything important was left out.  I hadn't realized that Dickens was such an astounding character--Ms. Smiley brings him to life with precise detail, through knowledge, and insights that DESERVE to be called insights.  She's obviously an excellent writer herself and every page radiates her professionalism.</span>

                    <span>For those who want to spend two weeks leaning about Dickens, Peter Ackroyd's book is really excellent.  However if you do not have that kind of time, this work by Jane Smiley is excellent.  Whoever marries the authors to the subjects should be commended.  Jane Smiley is a best-selling author. Who better to write on the foremost novelist during the high noon of the novel as a medium?<p>This book provided an excellent overview not only of the life of Dickens, which can be summed up as "poor boy makes good," but also the novels themselves.  I do not agree with some of Jane Smiley's criticism ("Pickwick Papers" is a good read, despite what she says), but by and large she is on target with a great deal of what she has to say.</span>

                    <span>Smiley's lively biographical coverage of Charles Dickens paints a portrait of a convivial, astute and energetic writer who led an action-packed life as a prolific writer and family man. Blending with this highly recommended portrait of the man is a survey of his major works and narrative style, providing a fresh look at the man and his achievements.</span>
