                <span id="Label1">It's somewhat rare to see an entire grassroots political organization listed as the author of a book but it's perfectly in keeping with the spirit of both MoveOn.org and this handbook on civic activism authored by some of the group's members. It features 50 short chapters (one or two pages each in most cases) authored by non-celebrities from all walks of life who took it upon themselves to change the world. Some of the ideas are ambitious, as in the case of a liberal-minded Texan who decided the best way to make his views known was to run against Republican stalwart Tom DeLay in the GOP primary. Others are much simpler: write a letter to the editor, sign a petition, or go to a rally. But even in those seemingly obvious tactics, there are interesting techniques offered that could make a simple act a much more effective one. Included in each tip are bullet-pointed tips from MoveOn organizers to help the reader translate the idea into real action. While MoveOn is certainly not the first group to suggest simple steps to change the world, this volume scores points for it's concise editing and populist authorship. It's not a book to curl up with in front of the fire, it's meant to be thrown into a backpack or purse on the way to the next protest, campaign rally, or discussion group. The slant, like the organization itself, is a liberal one but the writers generally stop short of expanding on their political beliefs, choosing instead to focus on what those beliefs inspired them to do with their time and energy. Brief interstitial essays by notables such as Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi introduce sections of the book, providing expert gravity without detracting from the common person message. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>MoveOn.org is a democratic organization. Of course, America has been somewhat lacking in democracy for so long that perhaps people don't realize it anymore, and would go ahead and call MoveOn a socialist organization. <P>I love how a guide to being a participatory citizen of America (you know, as a democracy is supposed to be), immediately is labeled as nonsense and socialist. Perhaps these people are afraid of claiming their power as American citizens? Or perhaps they are too blinded by their beliefs they haven't even read the book, they just know that MoveOn as an organization doesn't support their ideas, and therefore deserves only 1 star. Why don't they just use MoveOn's guidebook to promote their own agenda? MoveOn put it out there. <P>Shame on you.<P>Anyway, if you are interested in political activism, take this book up. However, it may offend political conservatives with only enough heart for themselves.</span>

                    <span>MoveOn's 50 Ways to Love Your Country is based on the model that MoveOn.org uses: connect people with similar values and let them do the rest.<P>The book isn't dogmatic, negative, or preachy. It's a collection of stories written by folks just like you. Some are big, some are small. But all of them invite you to take what you want from the experiences of progressives all over the nation. <P>This collection is especially valuable to that population which shares progressive values but doesn't identify with the term "activist." The stories included demonstrate that even the most politically inactive can do their part to support issues that they care about.<P>Critics of the left would do well to garner some advice from this book before condemning it. But then again, maybe they shouldn't.<P>Way to go, MoveOn!</span>

                    <span>How can getting involved in a movement to empower the people be un-American? Apparently to many reviewers, the sign of a good patriot is to remain ignorant and accept everything the government tells you. That works if you are under age 15 maybe. Common sense tells us that everyone has a personal agenda, even our beloved goverment officials. <P>And lastly...everything you hear or see is biased in some shape or form. Having the intelligence to see through the bias to the real message is where having half a brain comes in handy. Labeling an idea as liberal and dismissing it on these grounds is a good way to never learn anything new. Let's try to consider ideas based on merit.<P>Check out this book if you think progressive change is a good think.</span>

                    <span>MoveOn.org has compiled an awesome book! This is such an enjoyable and easy read, and can basically be read in one sitting. The collection of submissions and categorization of such are well done. This is one of those kinds of books where I'll ensure easy access to, since I have no doubt that I will refer to it quite often. I also would encourage just about any individual, regardless of age, to read this book - you will be inspired to partake in the democratic processes of governing.<P>Way to go MoveOn.org!! Please keep publishing these kinds of books, for they are in dire need of being made available to the public.</span>

                    <span>MoveOn managed to corral nearly all the contributors to "50 Ways..." to make an original recording of their essays for the audiobook. There's the familiar sound of Al Gore's voice right alongside the less familiar voice of MoveOn's Eli Pariser....backed by the grassroots chorus of the dozens of ordinary extraordinary US citizens who contributed. A great project and a great audiobook. The production quality is good, the introductions and segues are well done, and there is a complete index of speakers/tracks etc. You won't be disappointed.</span>
