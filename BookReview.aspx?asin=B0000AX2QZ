                    <span>I just love this DVD and it helps so much to my game as a golf beginner. It is well organized and clearly expressed. Even my wife intended to join the golf after she watched it with me.Thank you Simon for doing a great job to guys like me.</span>

                    <span>I have been looking for a good golf video for quite some time, then I discovered Digital Golfschool. If you are new to the golf game, or looking for a few good drills for a slice or hook, this video is a must have!! If your a beginner, this video is priceless, Simon is clear and concise and will bring your game from horrible to the point where you can go on the course with some confidence. Make no mistake, this video (like many others) will not make you a pro, but if you practice what he says, your game will change for the better very quickly!!</span>

                    <span>Butch Harmon may teach the best athlete in golf, but how many of us can do any of the things Tiger can do. Simon Holmes can turn twenty-five handicappers into 12's, 12's into 8's, and pros into winners (Suzanne Petteresen on the LPGA and Joakim Haeggman, winner of last weeks Qatar Masters on the European tour). I have seen Simon perform miracles, and I am sure he and his video will improve your game.</span>

                    <span>Finally a made for DVD golf instructional. Simon Holmes is a real trainer and coach - and it shows. This is not about "once-in-a-million" shots by some pro that are impossible for anybody else to do but about solid instruction for all level of players. With over two hours on the DVD the different segments (e.g. the Swing) are systematically developed and presented. The DVD navigation also allows you to go directly to all relevant areas, for example Impact drills for slicers or Controlling distance in bunker shots. This is a DVD that you'll come back to many times.</span>
