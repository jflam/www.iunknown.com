<br />Full of practical advice. The author(s) apparently has a lot of experience as a developer.   
<br />It is not at all dull as some reviews claim. </span>

                    <span>Anyone can copy information from other sources and put it into a book. It takes someone who really knows his or her stuff to write a book that is invaluable to the SQL programmer. I would definitely not recommend this book for the database professional.</span>

                    <span>I've owned this book for over two years and I still go back to it as a reference.  It covers Sybase SQL Server 11.5 and Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 (with limitted coverage of 7.0) so it is now a bit dated for Microsoft, but is still viable for Sybase use.<p>I would love to see an updated version of this book for the Microsoft side.  But this book is an excellent reference for determining the difference between the Transact-SQL languages in Microsoft vs. Sybase.  <p>The Microsoft and Sybase T-SQL languages were similar when this book was written, but have probably diverted even more since MS bought the license for SQL Server from Sybase.  As much as I would love to see an updated version of this book, the new version would probably be more difficult to write.<p>It's still a great reference for Transact SQL and I can't knock the book for age when it's a classic.</span>

                    <span>Our teacher chose this never ending phone book for the relatively simple language of SQL (not Transact SQL)! I have found FREE online tutorials that say more in one paragraph than this author can say in 700+ pages! He didn't even bother to define the variables until chapter 6! His other books on SQL may be easier to read, but if your buying a book exclusively for SQL you may want to choose any one but this one!</span>

                    <span>AS so many others have said, this book was out of date when it was published.  Not a good sign.  Computer books are by their very nature very time sensitive.  This one covers virtually none of the features that were added in SQL Svr 7 and none of those added in the 2000 release.  You add to this some fairly bad instructional material and you end up with a book that's out of date and not really worth having on the shelf.</span>
