                    <span>I bought this book a few weeks ago and have been going through it very slowly.  There is a lot of information here.  You need to digest it a bit at a time, rather than plough through it.  <p>Stephen Skinner gives detailed information - he covers the theories, formulas, interpretations and room by room analysis thoroughly.  He also includes fascinating history on feng shui - making this more than a 'how to' book.  I also like the fact that he explains the "wild stars" such as the Grand Duke Jupiter.  Other feng shui books were sometimes not very clear on these and his explanations really helped me to understand them better.<p>Lots of great charts in here, plus an excellent appendix with information on Chinese Dynasties and Feng Shui Chronology and more!  His list of the typical analysis sequence in the back also gives a great idea of what to include in a feng shui diagnosis.  <p>I would definitely recommend this book.  Add the following books, and your feng shui library is complete:<br>The Complete Idiots Guide to Feng Shui by Moran and Yu<br>Principles of Feng Shui by Larry Sang<br>A Master Course in Feng Shui by Eva Wong</span>

                    <span>There's a method of traditional feng shui called Flying Star. For the uninitiated, it's akin to knowing the astrology of your home: the probability of auspicious or inauspicious health-, wealth-, and relationship-related events occuring within your living and/or working space. Flying Star is a numbers game. The year your home was built along with the building's directionality produces a numeric qi map. The configuration of numbers tell you what's going on now and what can possibly happen in the future. Once you know the numbers that correlate with a specific area within your home, you then set about enhancing good prospects and discouraging the bad ones. How? Well, you'll have to read the book! I'm a big fan of Stephen Skinner's work. In this book, he begins with the fundamentals of Chinese cosmology. Then, step-by-step, he shows you how to perform a Flying Star audit. The information is clear, concise, and very well written and illustrated.</span>
