                <span id="Label1">JavaServer Pages (JSP) is an established and popular technology for building dynamic web applications that can access databases and provide an interactive experience for your website's users. This book uses the new version of JSP &#150; JSP 2.0 &#150; which makes JavaServer Pages more powerful and much easier to program.  <P>In this book you'll learn how the web works and how JSP fits in, how to get input from the user and create web pages "on the fly", and how JavaBeans, components, and tag libraries allow you to make your code more readable and easier to maintain. The book also covers how to handle errors in your code, the best ways of designing web applications, and finishes with a comprehensive case study that builds a browser-based project management tool easily adaptable to many businesses.  <P>JSP is built on top of the Java programming language, so this book will additionally teach you the fundamentals of Java alongside JSP itself.</span>

                    <span>The book is supposed to serve as tutorials for people who even don't know Java programming language. It could live up for it promise only if authors would care not to make so many typos and mistakes sprinkled throughout the text. Some examples are impossible to get to work correctly unless reader is experienced in reading and understanding specifications to Servlets and JSP. One example is writing Simple Tag in chapter 9. It will never work the way the authors presented it.<BR> Some techniques are used inconsistently, for example, scriplets are used in sample code where more advanced Expression Language or Standard Tag Library would do. JSTL tags are not clearly explained and can be confusing to understand and difficult to memorize.<BR> Despite limitations mentioned above, the book manages to teach JSP. At least for Java programmers, the book is easy to read through at good pace and pick up fairy good understanding of JSP and even Struts framework. It would not make good reference though and the determined learner will need a lot of other material on the subject.</span>

                    <span>I'm about half way through the book and am finding it to be just what I need. I inherited a JSP application from a programmer who didn't practice code reuse, JSTL, struts, etc. I knew there had to be a better way to code the 100+ plus programs so that they could be maintained and enhanced. I highly recommend this book! I have been able to successfully begin rewriting the code and eliminate redundancy (refactor) and debug the application (which was never used by the end users who commissioned the app in the first place - too buggy). As the previous reviewer mentioned, it would be helpful to have some background in programming to fully appreciate the material but it really does take you step-by-step through JSP and JSTL use. I t isimportant to do the exercises and examples if you're not an experienced C++ or Java programmer though. <BR>I especially like the fact that the authors are very careful to explain each new element in the code the first time it's used. It's great to understand every line of code as it's being presented and without repetition after it's been presented. Kudos.</span>

                    <span>I took out one star is beacause the part on setting up Apache tomcat, Java SDK and other software in Linux is vaque. <BR>On the whole it is a book. It shows you many examples and most importantly the book explain the examples in great details.<BR>I would recommend this book to people who has knowledge in aleast one programming language.</span>
