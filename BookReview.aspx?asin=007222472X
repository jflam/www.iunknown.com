                    <span>The J2EE, The Complete Reference is arguably the best book ever written on the J2EE and Web Services programming. But the book is not only code. The descriptions themselves of the code are practical and helpful. There is a tremendous amount of detail in this book about every aspect of J2EE including JDBC, JSP, and JEB and equally as impression of the detail about every aspect of Web services including XML and SOAP. This is a must buy for anyone seriously interested in developing Web services using J2EE.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for building a good foundation in J2EE/Web Services, this book is the best choice to start with. It provides simple, clear and precise explanation for all concepts you need to know to develop industrial quality web services applications using J2EE. This is one of the Best books I've read for learning to build a web services application using J2EE.</span>

                    <span>Don't even think of buying this book! It is positively one of the worst technical books ever produced. I primarily bought this book because of the seemingly excellent reviews. However, take a closer look at some of these positive reviews - you can see that many of them are similar in style, tone, content, and length. Moreover, many of them were submitted on the same day! This is absolutely despicable behavior by the publisher/author/party - those interested in selling more copies of this book. I've reported these customer reviews to Amazon - hopefully, they will take action against those involved and at least remove those reviews. I've learned my lesson - I'll examine the reviews more closely next time. [...]<P>In terms of the book, the writing style is actually decent. However, the severe deficiencies of the book come from its lack of depth and inappropriate focus on SQL, XML, and the like. There was only a single chapter on EJBs and very little on servlets/JSPs. There was absolutely no depth on those two topics.<P>Don't waste your money - if you want to learn about EJBs, buy "Head First EJB." If you want to learn about the rest of J2EE, I would suggest you buy something else...</span>

                    <span>I have purchased this book after reading the excelent Java 2: The Complete Reference, by Herbert Schildt.<P>This book has lots of chapters covering many subjects but none of them goes deep enough to let you really learn what that thing means.<P>There are chapters about HTML, XML and SQL that I really think that are not needed in that kind of book and the chapters about JSP and EJB are so small and poor in content that I had to go through the J2EE 1.4 tutorial provided by Sun to get the point on these techs.<P>The most part of the book is waste on tables listing methods of classes, but it's just that: The author gives a table with a list of methods and a small sentence stating what it does. No code sample, no usage... If I was searching for list of classes and methods, the Sun documentation available online is more than good.<P>I have not yet seen a really good J2EE book, even because I haven't read so many, but the Sun's tutorial looks very good.</span>

                    <span>Based on the title of this book, you would think it would have some real content. After reading the first part of this book, I was deeply disappointed. I think this book is great for project managers who want to learn the development side of the J2EE technology. But for developers/engineers, it is a complete waste of time. Although the author does touch on every subject associated with J2EE he fails to connect all the dots. Explaining Java servlets and JSP, as one example, was a good start but there is nothing about how they work with each other. There arent very many examples either, but the ones that do exist, get right to the point and explain the subject matter appropriately. Too bad that isnt enough to make it more than a 2 star book. Glad I didnt pay full price for it (bought a used copy for $6 - barely makes it worth it).</span>
