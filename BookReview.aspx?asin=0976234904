                    <span>I will say that I enjoyed "Still Sheisty" much better than the first book.  Ms. Baker took the challenge and improved her writing which can only get better as time goes on.  She made sure to have more action with each of the characters and the story was a serious page turner.  I look forward to her next novel. 
<br />
<br />Although I liked this novel, I can only give it 3.5 stars.  Why?  Ms. Baker may have stepped up her writing game but the editors at Triple Crown aren't even at the starting line.  I don't know how the authors submit their finished work at this publication but I do know that it is a crying shame that on almost every other page of this book there were grammatical errors and typos.  I will continue to say that Triple Crown needs to be more professional in what's being printed.  You will continue to be perceived as a "ghetto book company" if you don't correct these mistakes.  It takes so much away from the story.  I think that you are also taking your customer for granted.  Fifteen dollars is a lot to spend for one book, it's not too much to ask that the mistakes are at least kept to a minimum.  
<br />
<br />Also, when the reviewers are reviewing the book, it's not necessary to give away all the details, just say if you like it or not!!  There are too many reviews on here where people are telling everything that happens, including the end.

                    <span>Is it possible to overcome shady behavior?  Well in STILL SHEISTY: PART 2 by T. N. Baker, the sequel to Sheisty, we learn if it's likely.  Epiphany Wright, Keisha Moore and Shana Scott continue their drama-filled lives from book one. Because of her gold-digging ways, Epiphany finds herself near death and a close friend actually dead.  When she awakens from her coma, she doesn't remember what happened which is a good thing for a gangster named C-God and his partner Ness because they are the ones responsible.  If Epiphany remembers, their best bet will be for the cops to get them first because street justice can be a killer.
<br />
<br />Keisha does the unthinkable due to loneliness.  She has it all: a nice job, a beautiful home, a child, and a man who would do anything for her, but she tosses it away for a brief romp in the sack that was unfortunately caught on tape.  But was it really her fault? Or did she have some help from the little green-eyed monster? 
<br />
<br />With her man, K. C., fresh out of the joint, Shana is doing her thing and keeping it real while making some money.  But she has a secret and is praying K. C. doesn't find out.   Sadly, someone else wants a piece of her action and is willing to blackmail her to get it.  What price is she willing to pay to keep it a secret?
<br />
<br />This was definitely a page-turner from beginning to end.  Ms. Baker did an excellent job capturing enough details from the first book so that STILL SHEISTY could stand alone.  The drama was so thick that I found myself caught up in the lives of the main characters from the get go.  This book was about what goes around comes around.  Each of the main characters taught a lesson about the choices we make and the repercussions that follow. You may be getting yours now, but, in the end, there is a price to pay.  Although I enjoyed the action-packed, drama-filled pages, I felt some fine-tuning was needed in the editing department.  There were enough typographical and grammatical errors to make this a distracting read at times.  Despite that, this is one book I'm sure will be a big hit with the hip-hop generation.  (RAW Rating: 3.5)

                    <span>Still Shiesty is a good book. I enjoyed every bite of it and wasn't able to put it down. I want to shout out the Triple Crown Authors for writing great books that are edgy and real.</span>
