                <span id="Label1">The unique culture of Iran and the sweep of its history are revealed in this evocative travelogue of an American family searching for a lost friend in the country of their youth.<br><br>Growing up in Tehran in the 1960s, Terence Ward and his brothers were watched over by Hassan, the family&#8217;s cook, housekeeper, and cultural guide. After an absence of forty years, Ward embarked on a pilgrimage with his family in search of Hassan. Taking us across the landscape of Iran, he plumbs its unimaginably rich past, explores its deep conflicts with its Arab neighbors, and anticipates the new &#8220;Great Game&#8221; now being played out in central Asia. Insightful, informative, and moving, <b>Searching for Hassan</b> enhances our understanding of the Middle East with the story of a family who came to love and admire Iran through their deep affection for its people.</span>

You'll feel good. I guarantee it.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Ward writes a pleasing account of his family's journey to Iran. His description of Iran's history and the beautiful hospitality of the Iranian people is artfully done. The people of Iran and the West have ever been friends. Mr. Ward effectively describes this hidden, but rich culture. On a personal basis, he makes a compelling argument for Rapproachment. <P>Respectfully, I dissent from Mr. Ward's shocking anti-American position asserted in this book and his negative description of Iranian ex-patriots. I have known many of these ex-patriots. Most fled Iran in fear for their lives. They are cultured and honest and should not be painted with the brush of profiteers. Likewise, I am disturbed by Mr. Ward's deliberately soft approach to a revolutionary regeme that executed thousands of its citizens, extended a bloody war with Iraq that could have ended years earlier, and one that has been a deliberate sponsor of international terrorism. Mr. Ward doesn't justify these acts, but does seem to reconcile them by repeating that during his journey, he noticed no beggars on the streets. I suppose you can't make an omlette without breaking a few eggs.<P>I recommend this book. Nonetheless, to potential purchasers, realize that it is written by someone who describes his family as having been under self imposed exile from the implicity evil United States.</span>

                    <span>I didn't know too much about this book when I picked it up, but judging by its cover I thought it would be a quest in search of Hassan. The title, however, is a little misleading, the book is a far richer spiritual journey, breathing life into the past with a depth and richness rarely seen. I'd call the book a "hard" read for the average reader, not because the language is difficult, but because it is such a rich piece of work that you simply can not rush through it. So rich, in fact, that you have to absorb bits at a time and let it sink in. This is a gorgeous recollection by Terence Ward and is about him and his 3 brothers and parents, as they return to Iran during a time when it was not so safe for travelling foreigners, to rediscover a part of their childhood and past. The Wards have not been back to Iran since the 1960's and this adventure takes place around about 1998. The Ward family travels to desinations near and far and the prose that Ward uses to describe the terrain and people, and to also weave their past back into the story is nothing short of breathtaking. He is truly a gifted writer with a special talent for capturing moments and people and experiences, managing to flawlessly translate them into colorful prose. Searching for Hassan comes to fruition towards the end of the book, and is a beautiful story in and of itself. But I highly reccommend this book as a informative source on culture and history. I do agree with the other reviewers that the political outlook is skewed--thsi is not a better future for Iranians. The Shah might have been cruel and greedy, BUT the regime that followed was and is a classic example of "out of the frying pan and into the FIRE." One cannot help but to think that maybe Mr. Ward was influenced to write kindly about the current political regime...but read the other reviews for a deeper analysis of that as one reviewer pegs it completely, explaining all about LA Iranians and their persecution, etc. Other than the soft political views, this is actually a great piece of work---and kudos to Mr. Ward for being such an amazing man and sharing the wonderful story of his journey with his family to Iran, and bringing it all to life so movingly. His knowledge of Persian culture and history by far outrivals most of his peers. Thank you Mr. Ward!</span>

                    <span>I am really impressed by the manner in which Terence Ward weaved his family's pre-revolution past with their journey in the quest of Hassan, throwing in gems of information about the Iranian history in between. Very well laid out book.<P>Amongst all of the books I read about Iran, this certainly deserves the top podium.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Ward's story is not only a well written account of a personal journey to reconnect with his past but it also opens our minds to an entirely different culture where even today there are "secret groups" whose intention is integrating the divine into daily life and not being concerned with transient power possessors located either in the east or west because they know the only real power, the only lasting power is the divine. Reading the book sparked in me enthusiasm to return to Iran having spent a month there in March 2001 where I met (real) Sufis with occupations such as carpet dealers, healers, taxi drivers, business men. They met secretly or "under cover" continuing the ancient practices specific to their traditions... Naqshband, Netamahali, Qadiri,etc...</span>
