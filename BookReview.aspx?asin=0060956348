                    <span>This is a superb baseball book, but it's also a moving treatise on family, life and loss.  Author Roger Kahn grew up with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and covered that legendary team in the early 1950's as a young reporter for the old New York Herald Tribune.  Kahn lets us get to know the team's outstanding figures, from gruff skipper Charlie Dressen, to baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to stars like Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Carl Erskine, etc.  Readers should enjoy the author's sentimental look at Brooklyn prior to urban decline and the Dodger's inexcusable desertion to Los Angeles.  Kahn also grants a strong role in the narrative to his baseball-loving father.  Readers will learn (or be reminded of) baseball in a drug-free era of modest player salaries and loveable ballparks like Ebbets Field.  In the books second half the author interviews the former Dodger players twenty years later.  Hardship and tragedy followed several players into their middle age, yet most retained their gentle humanity long after they'd been returned them to the ranks of ordinary men. 
<br />  
<br />THE BOYS OF SUMMER was published in 1972, yet remains one of the best baseball books ever written.  Readers should also enjoy its later companion, MEMORIES OF SUMMER.

                    <span>As a young reporter, Roger Kahn got to cover the Brooklyn Dodgers for two seasons.  In this book, he tells us about those two years, then goes back to visit the players several years later, describing their lives and hardships after baseball.  The sad part of the book is that the players seemed to have more than their share of bad luck after leaving the game.
<br />
<br />It's an interesting look at the Dodgers in the early 1950's and an even more interesting look at the indiviual players as people after they retired from the game.  It also tells us a great deal about how the team was dealing with integration a few years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.</span>

                    <span>Roger Kahn's "The Boys of Summer" may very well be the best book written about baseball. It certainly lies in the Top Ten of any self-respecting baseball fan's own personal list. It is beautifully written, often poetic. It is elegiac yet alive and vibrant.<p>The book is neatly split into two parts. The first is a reporter's account of his own love of baseball, specifically the Brooklyn Dodgers, while growing up there. The era comes alive with descriptions of his neighborhood, of the city, of what baseball meant to kids at that time.<br>Of how baseball bonded fathers to sons, children to adults, neighbors.<br>In that scenario, imagine the fortune of this young reporter who gets the dream job to end all dream jobs: follow the Dodgers. <br>You get to watch baseball, played by your favorite team and then write about it. And get paid!<br>It's a lovely evocation of the time...things aren't like the way they used to be. The earth doesn't stop rotating when the Dodgers come back in the bottom of the ninth.<br>It used to.<br>You get a sense of how important and vital the Dodgers were to that community. Daily conversations were incomplete without a mention of last night's game. Stickball was everything. A glove was gold. <br>The parts about being a member of the press in Manhattan for a big newspaper are terrific. I swear I could hear the chattering typewriters, the traffic outside the window, the tinkling of ice in a bar glass...you are there. As the golden era of baseball was ending, so was an era of newspapers. Soon TV would supersede the papers as the way to get your news. The influence of the newspapers on public opinion (and vice versa) would never again reach the heights they did here.<br>As history, there is no better concise snapshot of that hallowed Jackie Robinson era than this book.<p>The second half of the book has Mr. Kahn travelling around the country decades after the Brooklyn team has ceased to exist. He finds the players...Gil Hodges, Jackie, Pee Wee, Duke, Clem, Erskine, Billy Cox...and gives us a separate little chapter on each player. We find out what has happened after baseball for them, Campanella's injury, Robinson's and Erskine's family problems, if they stayed with baseball (Hodges) or got completely away from it (Cox)...<br>...it finishes the story of that Brooklyn Dodger team. It also gives Mr. Kahn a chance to return to that era and write about it from the perspective that age and time will frequently offer.<p>If you love baseball, and you love to read, there is no better book. Sure, an argument could be made for a Halberstam book, or someone's well written autobiography, but they would be coin flips.<br>"The Boys of Summer" may arguably be equalled, but I doubt if it will ever be bettered.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the books that I had considered reading since I was a young man in love with baseball for the first time.  In a sense, I'm glad I waited all these years to finally read it.  I think that I would not have enjoyed it at 14 the way I did at 28.  The book is beautiful elegy and mediation on a time long gone and the men who made up it's glory.  They bear littler resemblance to the stars of today.  I grew up with stories of the '52 World Series and the Dodgers.  This book gave me the gift of being able to exprience a bit of what my grandfather and father shared on that October day in 1952 as Joe Black took the mound against the Yankees.  I've always held the Dodgers in awe (the BRooklyn version at least) and this book allows me to see the men who made up those times as real people.  Pee Wee Reese emerges as Kahn's hero in the baseball parts.  I would argue that his father, Gordon, was almost as heroic to him.  It is beautiful book about boys, their fathers, and the ties that bind us to what is still, even in this day and age, the single greatest game ever invented.  This is a classic that should be read by every fan.  Thank you, Mr. Kahn.</span>
