                    <span>I really like this. This is a terrific resource (especially when combined with team websites for game schedules) for planning a major baseball-oriented family excursion, or for fitting in a ballgame--almost anywhere in the country--to a non-baseball business or pleasure trip.<br>There's an index in the back that lists addresses and telephone numbers for virtually all professional teams in the U.S. and Canada, but the regionally-organized sections of the book focus on the cities and parks that the Adams/Engel family found to be NICE places to see ballgames, and to visit before and after the games. They are obviously devoted fans of the game itself, but recognize that there's much more to a great fan experience than the star power on display. Thus, some major league teams are barely mentioned while some minor league and independent ballparks are highlighted. For example, the New York-Penn league affiliates of the Mets and Expos are judged worthier destinations than their major-league parents. Admittedly, the judgements are personal and perhaps idiosyncratic, and completists may well be annoyed by some omissions, but I can't argue with the authors' priorities.<br>Besides all the baseball material, each section suggests hotels, restaurants, historic sites, and non-baseball entertainments worth visiting to anchor the regional flavor of each destination.<br>I was already planning a six-day, five-game trip with my young daughter for spring, but this book has me thinking about the NEXT excursion! If you want to actaully experience "baseball as America," this is a nice guidebook to have.</span>

                    <span>This is a a great book for those who love to travel to baseball games with the family. My only complaint would be that it doesn't cover every MLB stadium. On the plus side, it includes independent and minor league stadiums.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book because, like many baseball fans, I've thought of one day seeing all the major league ballparks (or at least those worth seeing). Baseball Vacations doesn't disappoint, offering information on baseball parks clustered into chapters by region or theme. It's mainly addressed to families, but a couple like us can get a lot out of it too.<br>My only beef with their reviews came when they labeled Dodger Dogs mediocre, quite a slight to the Dodger fan. Hmm, maybe they didn't try the grilled ones.<br>Anyway, they offer seating tips (like which seats have obstructed views), parking, lodging, sightseeing and entertainment options, although the latter two would be better served if you accompany your trip with a local guide.<p>I really like the pleasure they take in describing the historic parks. You can identify with their love for the game.<br>I would recommend it to the true baseball fan in search of the past.</span>
