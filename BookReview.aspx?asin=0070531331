                    <span>I first read "Strategy Pure & Simple (I)" back in the early '90s, just before embarking on my first strategic planning job. Since then, I have managed strategic planning and implementation processes at a total of six different operational subsidiaries of two very large financial services groups. <BR>As a financial controller and later a CFO, I have read a great many other books and articles about strategy and planning. Most of those were actually quite interesting, but when it came down to setting up and managing a actual, real-life planning process, I always turned back to Strategy Pure and Simple, because it is just GOOD ENOUGH.<BR>- It includes all important issues that must be addressed during planning;<BR>- more importantly, it reminds you of staying focused on those issues that happen to be key to your company (given its market, own caracteristics, timing, resources, etc.);<BR>- still more importantly, it insists on interaction between the planning team and the management team, and helps with examples of visual aids and cues;<BR>- it really helps a lot in communicating with line and senior managers during the planning process, getting them involved, assuring buy-in, and finally ensuring that the plan, when finished and approved, actually is implemented by those in charge. And, in the end, that is certainly what matters most.<BR>I have now joined a new company in another industry, and have to manage yet another strategic planning process. Well, the best I can say about Strategy Pure & Simple is, I have fished out my 1993-vintage copy, and look forward to using it once again.</span>

                    <span>This book is like any other drivel about corporate strategy - figure out what you do well, do more of it and cut the rest. Sounds great when you grossly oversimplify your business. Know what really works? Fire anyone who is stupid, lazy, or unproductive.<P>PS- If Michel Robert is so smart, why can't he learn English?</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately I bought this book after "The Power of Strategic Thinking" that I found full of very interesting ideas, insightful and thought provoking. <BR>If I only knew that it has almost no differences with "Strategy Pure and Simple" I would've never done it. The book is written by copy-and-paste method. There are whole pages and chapters there that were not even worded differently - direct citations from the previous book. The only enhancement - pictures in "The Power of Strategic Thinking" look more silly but are actually the same.<BR>There are probably some fans of Mr.Robert who buy all his books as collectible items but to me it seems like cheating - the same product under new cover. Total disappointment. It also brings doubts about all 'true stories' Mr.Robert tells about his successes with 300 companies.</span>

                    <span>Michael Robert presents a well-organized plan to enable you to produce a distinctive strategy. He emphasizes the need for strategic thinking, which sets out a vision of where your company is going. Use this as your basis for making the appropriate choices and plans. Clarify what your company is, and is not, to avoid becoming scattered and overextended. Robert uses the metaphor of playing a game as his framework. Every CEO must carefully choose what game to play, and how to craft a strategy to make and shape the rules. To illustrate these principles, Robert draws on actual examples from client companies, alternating a step-by-step guide to strategic planning with brief case studies that demonstrate strategic thinking. We [...] recommend this book to top executives and managers in large companies.<br></span>

                    <span>When it comes to understanding and explaining why some companies develop and launch new products better than their competitors, Mike Robert truely has no equal. In preparing to help overhaul the strategic planning process at a major publishing firm, we read countless books on strategic planning before choosing Mike's "Strategy, Pure and Simple" as our guide. We couldn't have made a better choice. Mike's tell-it-like-it-is style and clearly defined process served as a guide through numerous planning sessions. This is Mike Robert's third book on the subject, and it is every bit as powerful as the first two. Whenever a client asks me to assist them on their strategic thinking journey, Mike's principles are a guiding force and his books are must reading.
