                    <span>If you're just curious about what six-sigma is this is a good, easy to understand, book.  But it teaches you little that can be applied.  
<br />
<br />I'm in a company that is begining a six sigma effort and I am assisting the black and green belts in their work.  I had wanted a book that would help me do the things I would probably be asked to assist with such as building a SIPOC diagram.  Instead, the book is devoted almost entirely to telling you what the black belts do on a project (half of the 300 pages are about statistics and much of the remainder is about things like project charter).  The obvious problem is that a book like this can't actually teach you to be a black-belt. So after 300 pages I know some statistical principles, but not enough to actually do anything with, and I know nearly nothing about how to assist a black belt on a project.
<br />
<br />Before you say "but six sigma is all about statistics" let me say that I know that.  Stats are the core, and doing them takes training.  You will not learn to do six-sigma stats from this book.  You will probably not learn much else from this book either.</span>

                    <span>This is invaluable in making Six Sigma and its critical principles available to the broad audience who can benefit from breakthrough improvements in operating performance.  It surely has application to the boardroom.

                    <span>I am working my way through this book after becoming aware of the six sigma process and how it can apply to many non-technical areas.
<br />I want to use these ideas and principles to better organize and produce my work.  Although a couple of the chapters are quite heady,  I can follow the examples to get the main idea.  I think just reading this is making me think in ways I never have before! </span>

The book's ease of use allowed for rapid implementation of some of the Six Sigma principles for problem solving.  The user-friendly text made a complicated technical system realistic and accessible to this neophyte.  I highly recommend this book for any professional who wants to improve the quality of the work environment.</span>

                    <span>Reaching six sigma simply says that in your production line you will produce fewer than 3.4 bad parts out of each million parts you make. Or to express it another way, if the automobiles you make are 99% good, you'll have 3 warranty defects per automobile. If your cars are six sigma, you can expect one warranty claim for every 980 new cars. 
<br />
<br />This book is mostly about the analysis you need to make of your production line to eleminate errors. It's about the statistical analysis you need to do to be sure that you're operating at six sigma. 
<br />
<br />This book is a great place to start learning about six sigma. It's enough to give you the background you'll need to really begin analyzing your process. 
<br />
<br />I have to say that it probably isn't enough for you to get to a six sigma production line. You'll need more, more classes, more time, more software, more management support than you ever expected. As best I understand, Motorola pioneered the six sigma concept. And I don't believe they ever got most of their production lines to operate at that level. In fact I've heard that they were only able to get their diode line running that error free. 
<br />
<br />Good Luck. Get Started.
