                    <span>For anybody over 50, or headed in that direction, this book by Jane Glenn Haas is a great read.  The author covers a wide spectrum of issues that are important to all of us who are looking at the second, more productive, half of life.  Which is exactly her point.  What we do from the age of 50 on can be every bit as productive and rewarding as the things we did in our 20's and 30's.  It's a time of continued growth, tempered by the wisdom we wish we had when it all started.  So much of it comes down to attitude, as her columns demonstrate over and over again.  The tone is no-nonsense direct, which I found very refreshing - no whining allowed here.  Some topics are poignant (hew own battle with breast cancer), and others will get you chuckling (selections from her annual poetry contest).  <p>Although this is a collection of columns originally published in the Orange County Register (southern California), the topics are universal - how to deal with difficult or estranged children, looking at new career opportunities, getting your face lifted (bravely, she features her own before and after pictures), sex in the second half, to name just a few.  The colums are short, making it an easy book to pick up and put down without losing the gist.  A good bedside read and a great gift book for anyone you know who falls into the over 50 age group.  It will definitely show up under the Christmas trees of several of my friends and relatives.</span>
