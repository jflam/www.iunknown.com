                    <span>"The Rule of Four" reads like the latest Hardy Boys installation. Here, the Hardys, along with their two best Princeton friends (and one of the boy's cute college girlfriends) unravel a mysterious, ancient plot buried in the sub-text of an obscure Rennaissance Italian book that is probably even less interesting than "The Rule of Four".
<br />
<br />On the bright side, if you come to "The Rule of Four" via "The Da Vinci Code" and/or "Angels & Demons", at least you will be pleasantly surprised by the decent writing style employed by Caldwell & Thompson. (Which admittedly only places this book slightly above the Harry Potters).
<br />
<br />It's slow. It's crammed full of ultra-intellectual & references which, while surprisingly not pretentious, still comes off as fairly unbelieveable coming from a group of college coeds (notwithstanding their Princeton pedigrees).
<br />
<br />As the book's plot unravels to its anti-climactic resolution, I finally realize that I just don't care. I don't care what happens to these four boys, I don't care if the Hardys solve the Mystery of the Medieval Memoir, and I don't care if I never read another book like this again. </span>

                    <span>What more can I say about this book.  To think that this material came from two first time authors is mind boggling.  It has the maturity of an established literary writer, and I really couldn't put this one down.   Comparisons to Dan Brown are inevitable, but not accurate.  The only commonality here is the fact that both authors deal with archaic myseries being solved in the present.  As far as writing styles go, The Rule of Four soars over any of the Brown books I have read.  It is beautiful, lyrical in spots.  I eagerly await their next effort.</span>

                    <span>"If you loved The Da Vinci Code...dive into this". This text on the front cover immediately brought my attention to the book "The Rule of Four". Hoping for the same fast paced, well written and original adventure novel, I immediately purchased it. Talk about disappointment!  The book is most of all extremely boring and incomprehensible. It was definitely not written for a broader audience, as readers that are not familiar with Princeton or who have some sort of degree in languages or literature will very soon find themselves lost. The text is complicated and the plot takes forever to develop. Through out the book, the story keeps jumping back and forth in time and one has to get through more than half of the book before anything at all attention-grabbing occurs. I still think the idea and the story potential is very original and appealing, but I think the authors just fail to make it work. I have read somewhere that the book took 6 years to write and that is definitely how long it will take me to finish reading it, if I ever will. I usually do not bother to write reviews, but in this case I couldn't help myself. Expecting  "The Da Vinci Code" as promised by the reviews on the cover I feel cheated both out of time and money.</span>

                    <span>This novel does err on the side of slow, as many of the previous reviewers have stated.  If you enjoyed Da Vinci because of the action, this book is not for you.  If you like Da Vinci because of the historical references involved, you should enjoy this book.  
<br />     There are many references to pieces of literature and art that    may be somewhat obscure to those with small backgrounds in classical literature.  
<br />     As for myself, I found the book interesting because it brings light upon Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, a complicated text written in the late fifteenth century.  The novel itself is exceptional prose with great character development.  The first line of chapter 1, for example states "Strange thing, time.  It weighs most on those who have it least."  The authors use this kind of abstraction through much of the work, which is why I would recommend this book only to those people interested in literature and literary history.
<br />     My major buff about this work is that the plot is not very great.  The timeline skips around and can be confusing.  The authors build up suspense and then, wham, we are back into character development, leaving a sense of being cheated on the next secret of the novel.  Be sure this novel is right for you before picking it up, or else you will find it a waste of time.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately this book did not live up to any of the hype accorded it so generously on either the jacket or in publishers reviews. The story was slow and tedious and any plot momentum was abruptly cut off at the knees by poorly contructed flash back characterisations. Boredom was accentuated by drawn out descriptions of Princetons architecture, sewer system and intiation processes and the read left me thoroughly unsatisfied as a historical thriller or indeed any genre in which it tries to place itself. Follett, Shea and even Dan Brown are certainly much better value than this unfortunate first work. Steer clear unless you suffer from insomnia. (One star was for the potential of the story line which remained unfulfilled).</span>
