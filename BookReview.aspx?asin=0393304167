                    <span>Upon first reading the diary of Anne Frank, I have become interested in other "similar" types of narratives. Miron Dolot certainly gives us a captivating and sometimes heartwrenching account of when Stalin and his henchmen in Moscow carried out this policy against the poor Ukrainians during the early 1930s. This famine did not only effect Ukraine but Kazakhstan and possibly other areas as well. The story of the famine told by a young teenage boy is very insightful. Such a sorrowful chapter of history.<P>"Harvest of Sorrow" by Robert Conquest is another good book on the same subject. This one, however, is briefer compared to Conquest's book and can be read in the course of a weekend.<P>Dolot's book should be read by all interested in European history. I also agree, that it should be used in schools.</span>

                    <span>The author leads the reader slowly into the horrors of life in the Ukraine during the early 1930s, when Joseph Stalin (and Nikita Krushchev) engineered the mass starvation of about seven million Kulaks and Ukranians in about two years. Rich narration makes it easy to follow the events, as conditions deteriorate into unspeakable horror. <P>In some ways, "Execution by Hunger" is better than Solzhenitsyn's books, and better than "Coming Out of the Ice." Dolot, I think, reaches every reader's heart. Read this book and you'll look at Russia, and its governments, with a much clearer eye and mind.</span>

                    <span>In 1929, Joseph Stalin ordered the collectivization of all Ukrainian farms. During the resulting upheaval, some seven million Ukrainians died of starvation. But, while it ended with mass starvation, the Soviet program of oppression started with property confiscation, arbitrary arrests, judicial and extrajudicial murder, and a whole constellation of unspeakable mistreatment.<P>One of the survivors of this holocaust was a young Ukrainian boy, who survived the conflagration and World War II, and succeeded in escaping to the United States. Written under the pseudonym of Miron Dolot, this heart-rending book tells the story of what he saw throughout the holocaust, and what he felt and thought.<P>I originally picked up this book because my own family, who were Russian Mennonites, left Ukraine before this time, but all of the relatives that stayed were annihilated to the last man, woman and child. Even so, I dare anyone to read this book and not be moved. The author does an excellent job of bringing the heartless insanity of this holocaust home to right where you live.<P>So, if you are interested in Russian or Ukrainian history, then I highly recommend this moving book to you.</span>

                    <span>This book is a first-hand account of the forced collectivization of a Ukrainian village in the 1930s in the USSR.<BR>It was a real nightmare for all the victims (alive or death), but also for the reader. One gets cold in the back when one sees what an ideology in a by one party controlled State can do and did with mostly innocent citizens.<BR>All free peasants were considered as kulaks. Their farms were confiscated and they became 'State slaves' controlled by an omnipotent totalitarian bureaucracy. Millions of human beings (they were not human for the CP, only enemies) were starved or frozen to death.<BR>One thinks of Jheronimus Bosch when one read certain passages in this book, but they portrait a nightmarish reality: "... a heap of frozen human corpses like some discarded woodpile ... Their frozen arms and legs were sticking out from under the snow like tree limbs in an intricate configuration." (p. 187)<BR>This book contains even harder scenes.<P>The author stresses also another aspect of this genocide (or was it the principal one): nationalism.<BR>The Party members, who imposed the murderous collectivization, were Russians. Miron Dolot sees the organized famine as a deliberate attempt to annihilate the Ukrainians as a people.<P>Apart from its uncontested historical value, this book should be read as a warning against the madness of pure ideologists, who, once in absolute power, implement their insane policies, accepting at the same time millions of human casualties without the slightest form of remorse.<P>For a more general evaluation of the organized famines in the 1930s in the USSR, see Robert Conquest's 'Harvest of Sorrow'.</span>

                    <span>Many have been calling the tragedy in the Ukraine during the 1930's the 'hidden' holocaust or the 'other' holocaust. This book and others like it('Harvest of Sorrow' by Conquest and 'Gulag' by Applebaum) describe the terrible pain and suffering and outright genocide that was perpetrated against the Ukrainians by Stalins Russia. This began with the collectivization of the farms. Then the Kulaks, who Stalin called capitalists because most owned one or two more chickens then their neighboors, were all shipped to Siberia. What followed next was the confiscation of the grain from the farmers and the starvation of millions. <P>This book details the tragedy. It is a good accounting of this very hidden history, unknown to the west until years later. In fact many western jurnalists were duped into beleiving Stalin had created a 'maricle' in the Ukraine. THe only miracle was the disappearence of millions of people, whose only crime was that they were peasents.</span>
