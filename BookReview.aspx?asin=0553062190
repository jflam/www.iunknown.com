                <span id="Label1">Appearing within months of golfing sensation Tiger Woods's record-shattering win at the Masters, this appreciative portrait benefits from the author's friendship with the Woods family. (California-based sports journalist John Strege has been covering the 21-year-old golfer since he was 14.) Tiger comes across as genuinely nice and capable of being just one of the guys, despite the astonishing abilities already evident when he first swung a cut-down golf club as a 9-month-old toddler. Strege's snappy prose captures the excitement Woods has brought to a sport most Americans used to consider dull.</span>

                    <span>This book really had very little informative stuff. This guy obviously does not know how to write a good biography. It was sooo boring and there really wasen't that much stuff. It almost seems like John Strege collected a lot of newspapers and got some info. from the internet and went straight on to write what he calls a "biography". It's nothing but a summary a lot of games played by Tiger...nothing more! It doesn't go much into his personal life, if that's what you want.</span>

                    <span>I read this book a couple of weeks ago for a book report in my english and i would rate it about a four out of a five. I like most of it but some of it didn't need to be in the book. There is a part about his swing and it was not very nessecry to add. That is one thing they could have kept out. Another thing that inpressed me alot was that they had alot about the first tournment he played in on the Tour. They also had alot of first like his first hole in one, his first best round, and the first time he played in a tournment. The best part of the book from my opionen is the part where they talked about how he was going to go the Stanford to play golf. The coach at Stanford was watching him play when he was 13 years old. Also, he played with Jack Nickulus, a great golfer when he was a child, at a camp in Florida. He was getting into the pros when he was about 20 years old. That is one of the youngest players ever to play on tour up intill today. The coach of Stanford was a very good golfer a long time ago named Mr. Goodwin. He made the program at Stanford very well and and developed. What made him such a good golfer was when he was young he went to the range and hit balls more then he played on the course.</span>

                    <span>A good biography of Tiger. Goes into details of his growing up period, his life during college and as an amateur. Well written.<BR>Old now and hence some facts have changed. Covers till his professional debut, still very interesting reading</span>

                    <span>I thought that this book about tiger woods is a good book because it has alot of information on him from when he was a baby to when he turned into a pro golfer. In the biography tiger starded golfing at three years old ,tiger was even on a tv show to show the would how good he was at four years old. as he was growing up tiger entered into alot of tornaments and because he was so good he became pro after coming out of stanford college. i would recomend this book to people who are wanting to know alot about tiger woods.</span>
