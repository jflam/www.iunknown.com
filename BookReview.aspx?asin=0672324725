                <span id="Label1"><p>Learn to build applications with Jakarta Struts, the most popular JSP development framework. <i>Struts Kick Start</i> is a "hands-on" book filled with sample applications and code snippets you can reuse, and in-depth coverage of new features in Struts 1.1. If you are looking for a practical book that "shows you how to do it", then Struts Kick Start is for you. Plus, it's the first Struts book with detailed examples of the major Struts tags.</p><p>The book begins with a discussion of Struts and its Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The authors' then demonstrate Struts' power through the development of a non-trivial sample application - covering all the Struts components in a "how to use them" approach. You'll also see the Struts Tag Library in action - use tags for HTML, javabeans, logical operations and more. You'll learn to use Struts with JBoss for EJB's, with Apache Axis to publish and use Web Services, and with JUnit for testing and debugging. The authors work with the latest Struts 1.1 features including DynaForms, Tiles and the Validator. </p><p>The book includes a CD-ROM containing the tools discussed in the book: Struts 1.1 beta 2, Java 2 Standard Edition, JBoss 3.0.3, MySQL 3.23, XDoclet, Torque, Tomcat, Ant, Axis, Cactus, and JUnit. Plus, it comes with an electronic, fully searchable version of the book. </p><p>From the Inside Cover:</p><p>"Struts Kick Start is a good resource for learning about Struts, and it willhelp you get up to speed quickly."</p><p>- Craig McClanahan, Creator of Struts</p><p>Thoroughly covers the essential features of Struts in a clear and readable style.</p><p><i>Struts Kick Start</i> is a solid starting point for learning how to develop webapplications using Struts. The authors start you off by reviewing thefoundational technologies on which Struts is based, and immediately get into thesorts of practical "how to" information and examples that get you up to speedquickly.</p><p>Notable features that I really appreciated include the coverage on integrationwith other technologies (such as EJBs and web services), using Ant to set upyour development environment, and the fact that the software goodies you needare available on the included CD. Struts does not live in a vacuum&#8212;it is one ofthe tools in the developer's toolkit, so knowing how it works with othertechnologies is very useful.</p><p>Of particular importance is the coverage on testing your web application as youbuild and maintain it. Developing a solid testing methodology, and a substantialsuite of tests (to protect yourself against regressions), is criticallyimportant to a rapid development cycle that still needs to produce high qualityapplications. Coverage of testing, though, tends to be minimal in many booksabout programming technologies. James and Kevin provide specific advice on howto use the JUnit and Cactus testing frameworks with your Struts based applications.</p></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The Struts framework is becoming a de-facto standard for developing interactive web applications using servlets. If this type of development is something you are responsible for, you should consider getting a copy of this book to help you take the next step in your professional development. The "kickstart" concept means that the authors don't spend a lot of time on fluff or auxilllary material. You are quickly exposed to the core concepts along with a large number of examples to illustrate those technical points.<P>There are a number of assumptions made in this book. The web server used for examples is the Jakarta Tomcat server. If you're using that platform for your development, you'll be very comfortable with the book. The authors also assume a prerequisite knowledge of JSP, as well as the use of MySQL for writing applications that access data from relational databases. From a cost perspective, this is all good in that you can set up your test environment for free. On the other hand, if you use other packages such as IBM's Websphere Application Server and DB2, you'll have to make the adjustments on your own.<P>The book is very comprehensive in what it covers, and there is an abundance of code to help you see working examples that you can use for your own purposes. Since I'm not as "up to speed" on servlet technology as I'd like to be, I'd prefer a somewhat slower style for learning. But that's not a knock on the book as much as my own personal preference.<P>Conclusion<BR>If you're comfortable with web applications, deployment, and servlet coding, this will be a good choice for getting started with Struts. If you're still relatively new to all this, you may want to get a book that doesn't assume quite so much to start with. Once you get familiar with Struts, this would be a good companion book for examples.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I find this book to be full of inconsistancies and unexplained references, and generally disorganized. The authors often present the code samples with a minimum of explanation, or just discuss a small part without the surrounding context. They consistantly use parts of the technology that are explained much later in the book, leaving the user to try and sort it out. They don't even bother to warn you or cross-reference. This is a tightly interwoven framework, and I had hoped for a better "map" to what ties in with what other parts (and why).<P>The chapter on the struts-config.xml, arguably the pivotal file of the entire framework, is shown by inserting the DTD and a few confusing notes about some of the attributes. The chapter ends by telling the reader to go out and get a GUI editor.<P>Many pages are wasted listing out code for a concept better shown in a few well-chosen lines. The code that is included is poorly documented.<P>Now, I need to go find another book to give me some cohesive idea of using Struts -- maybe this one will serve better as areference once I'm familiar with it.</span>

                    <span>First, this book was published in 2002, which means it was written in 2001. Rather out of date.<P>I have three very major complaints.<BR>1. The author, like almost all Struts book authors, starts right off the bat giving examples of JSP files that include Struts tags...a topic that is not covered until many chapters later! So the beginner (me) is left scratching his head wondering what all this gibberish is about. How much easier it would have been to provide the early examples in HTML and then later show them using tags AFTER tags have been introduced and discussed.<P>2. There are l-o-n-g sections of nothing but HTML/JSP code with almost no commenting. Do ANY publishers get it that they don't need to print EXACT code listings? The printed page could have arrows and circles and bold print highlighting codes snipets and discussing what they do. This book leaves it up to the reader to find the important nuggets in hundreds of lines of code.<P>3. Certain sections are so terse as to be meaningless, and even go so far as to tell the reader to look at the Struts documentation and then you'll understand it all. HELLO?? That's why I bought the &%$#!! book.<P>On the plus side, the font is nice, there is plenty of white space and it is easy on the eyes.<P>Skip this one. This is my 5th Struts book and I'm STILL looking for a good one. I think a good rule is that if a book is written by an open-source code author, avoid it like the plague. Coders are NOT writers. Unfortunately, the editors don't seem to be writers either. Maybe that job was outsourced...</span>

                    <span>This book (like many of its type) reads more like a collection miscellaneous notes than a structured, organized text book. It is disjointed and incomplete. Moreover, it encourages bad practices (at least the examples do).<P>The book fails to intelligently synchronize and present the relationship between the JSP page, the action class, the action form and the struts-config.xml. In fact, you never see the struts-config file (it's kind of important).<P>The last straw came when I was reading a 4 line section about a particular tag usage. The authors offered this brillant insight - .."for more detail, refer to the Struts documentation"! Gee, thanks...maybe the authors should have given that advise in the introductory paragraph and left the rest of the book blank.<P>The discussion of <html:select> and <html:options> and the mechanism to store and retrieve these data elements to and from the Action Form was ambiguous and misleading. Moreover, hard coding data elements in a Vector inside the JSP is just downright bad practice. The point of Struts is to minimize the need to put java / javascript code in your JSP.<P>Overall, poorly organized, poorly written and not that useful.</span>

                    <span>Background Info: I started my web app development with PHP/MySQL and I quickly realized how messy PHP can get by dropping logic in with presentation code. I have some background in Java, but not using it in Web Apps. I soon learned about MVC and Struts. I scoured the web for Struts tutorials and if you're like me, found them VERY lacking, very incomplete and very unhelpful. I've struggled with configuring ant, compiling java files by hand all to no avail. There had to be a better way. I finally broke down and got this book.<BR> <BR>I was soooo excited to get this book and start my web app development projects using Struts. The book starts off pretty good by disecting a very simple struts application, but it didn't tell you how to run/deploy the application. I figured I could just deploy the app with Ant, (since i've struggled with it before) but I decided to be patient and told myself, perhaps I should finish reading the entire book first before I start writing web apps.<P>Then the book transitioned to what I believed to be a somewhat complex struts app for beginners. The authors do a good job in dissecting the code and explaining how it works, but again, no help in how to run and deploy the application. I felt like I was being rushed. <P>Later on, I started to get bored and began skimming the book. The stuff near the end was getting complex and I still was shaky on the easy stuff. I read the first couple of pages of EJBs with Struts and Web Services with Struts. They were interesting, but I wasn't ready to get into that yet, I still felt like I was missing something.<P>I still recommend that you get this book. If you're new to web application development, this book really breaks down best practices and demistifies web app buzzword terms such was MVC, EJBs, J2EE web services, SOAP and other things a web app developer should know, but you will get it shoved down your throat. Be warned, this book isn't for beginners. It's for those who have been struggling really really hard trying to learn struts on your own through tutorials on the web. You should be somewhat already familiar with Ant, (or you can get that shoved down your throat too), setting up environment variables, Tomcat, Databases and some database terms (primary key, auto increment, things like that). I had to tweek the build.xml and build.properties files to work in my environment. That didn't bother me too much because I learned something in the process.<P>I'm not dissapointed in the book because I learned so much from it. Had I not already struggled with Struts and learning how to write java based web apps, I'd be lost. If you're someone like me, it's worth it. Get it.</span>
