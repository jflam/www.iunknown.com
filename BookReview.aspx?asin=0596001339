                    <span>This book is small and travels well.  It does not have an index, which seems odd for a reference text, but it does have a table of contents.  I find Essential XML Quick Reference (ISBN 0-201-74095-8) to be well worth the additional investment.</span>

                    <span>I guess it's my fault for not checking closely enough, but this book is somewhat dated now (more than two years old as of this writing).  It was somewhat of an impulse buy at the book store when it looked useful after a quick scan.  It had a little "2nd Edition" banner across the front cover corner and I just assumed it included coverage of schemas.  The coverage of XSLT and XML in a small format is quite useful.  I'll probably buy the 3rd edition when it comes out--I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars two years ago when it was first published.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a useful overview into the basics of XML while doubling up as a quick reference to the XML specification. Handy for those that want to dabble in XML without buying a more detailed book, but then XML has so many related technologies anyone serious about XML will need more.<p>The O'Reilly pocket references are so concise that they are not really meant for someone who is totally new to the subject. They can however be the ideal way to provide an overview to anyone who wants to know the basics of the topic.</span>

                    <span>I can't possibly imagine that this book will be of any value to someone working with XML on a daily basis. It should be renamed to "a terse introduction to xml", as it is in no way a reference. This is based on the fact that I bought it to learn XML from, and it was quite good at teaching someone with no experience in XML whatsoever the basic concepts.<p>If you are looking for a reference, look elsewhere. If you are just like me, and don't want to wade through hundreds of pages to get an idea of what it is all about, then you can perhaps consider it. Since it is so wrongly named, I give it three stars. But as an introduction it really deserves five.</span>

                    <span>This book is ok, the first half part is pretty good. <br>It covers XML basic and DTD very well, but it does not <br>cover schema; it covers XSLT/XSLFO also, although there are something inaccurate inside; its part for XLink and XPointer is<br>useless and wrong; and there is nothing for XML database or <br>XSP. This book may be helpful, but you need another book as <<XML by example>> or <<Inside XML>> to really learn XML basic.<p>Daniel, IBM certified developer for XML and related technologies.</span>
