                    <span>D'Emilio and Freedman have provided their readers with a thoughtful, entertaining, and concise history of American sexuality. As their title suggests, their perspective is historical rather than psychological. Like most social histories, "Intimate Matters" adopts a bottom-up approach, choosing to emphasize how groups of people experience (and have experienced) sexuality within their own economic, racial, gendered, and cultural contexts, rather than on the decisions of elite policymakers. 
<br />
<br />There is plenty of interesting information here, ranging from the sexual practices of the early colonists to grassroots campaigns to censor sexually explicit literature. The authors capitalize on a wide variety of evidence, citing both quantitative and qualitative research to buttress their arguments. "Intimate Matters" is an important contribution to a neglected area of historical inquiry, and offers readers important insight into how economic and cultural forces shape, and are shaped by, human sexuality. </span>

                    <span>The authors did an excellent job of writing and presenting an accurate description of sexual practices in our country, including its history - obviously, an extremely difficult undertaking. 
<br />In early America, the main deterrent to premarital sex was the fear of pregnancy and the severe consequence of social ostracization.  
<br />However, sexual desire was always there for both men and women, regardless of social class or standing.  Control over casual sex lay in the hands of family and/or the mores of society.  Premarital sex was not permissible for anybody.  In practice however, this sexual taboo applied mostly to women.  
<br />Men - on the other hand - had choices!  They were the creators (always with god's help - of course) and enforcers of the rules and laws governing our social behavior!  Talk about one-way streets!  
<br />Margaret Sanger (born 1883) was a nurse who fumed over this grossly unfair treatment between the sexes and began the search for a dependable means of birth control.  She needed a means or device that women could use to counter their fear of unintended pregnancy.  She locked horns, clanged heads with the law (mainly the Comstock laws), and ended up with a number of warrants issued for her arrest.  She fled to Europe while a number of her friends and associates kept the ball rolling in search of a positive, reliable means of birth control for women.
<br />In 1915, she announced she was returning to America to surrender and stand trial on the charges against her.  As soon as the courts heard of this, all charges against her were dropped; the bureaucrats feared her like no other woman.
<br />For the first time, women got reliable birth control devices, and could begin to enjoy sex outside of marriage, without fear, just as surely as men did.  
<br />By the turn of the century, in order to finish leveling the sexual playing field, women needed a place to go and a means of getting there.  Two World Wars, one in 1914 and the other in 1941, would provide the answers.

                    <span>"Intimate Matters" could be viewed as the story of a timeless conflict between two opposing value systems which influence the direction of an individual's sexual life.  One value system proposes that efforts be made to subsume the erotic into a gentle spiritualized passion, keeping it contained within the private sphere of marriage.  Another system observes that sex has been identified as a critical aspect of personal happiness, which need not occur only within the traditional framework described above.
<br />
<br />The radical diversity of social life discussed by these authors suggests to us that their is much more to the story of sexuality than such a simple conceptual approach can relate.  The authors document a period of sexual history covering the years between the early 1600's and the late 1990's. Given that the context of the work is the history of American society, one can see from reading the text that no one class or social group will ever successfully assert a claim to speak authentically on the meaning of sexuality for all.
<br />
<br />There are repercussions to the sexual act which do apply to many, however, which the scholarship of "Intimate Matters" helps to describe.  Issues of sex between the various social classes and social groups, sexuality within family life and gender identity concerns are discussed here.  A comprehensive treatment of perennial medical issues such as the use of contraception, the meaning of pregnancy, and the existence of sexually transmitted diseases are all covered. 
<br />
<br />"Intimate Matters" is a work of objective inquiry, helping to describe a broad range of human sexual experience.  As such, it permits the reader to see their own sexual life through the mirror of a much larger social reality than their own particular journey might allow.  This book is recommended reading for all who want to be well informed on this ubiquitous social practice.</span>

                    <span>The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex.</span>

                    <span>Intimate Matters provides a comprehensive analysis of the history of sexuality in America through an engaging and thoughtful narrative.  It is useful for the professional historian--it is well documented with references to existing historical literature on the topic (although it is  not original research).  However, it also will prove very interesting to  the casual reader.<p>The book itself provides a broad descriptive  introduction to the history of sexuality and reproduction from the colonial  era to the present, but also presents a clear argument that is easy to  follow.  The authors claim that sexuality in America has gone through three  distinct phases, from family governed sexuality in the colonial era, to  privatized but conservative sexuality in the nineteenth century, to our era  of comparative sexual freedom, often governed by consumerist values, in the  twentieth century.  Beyond that, it is simply fun to read.<p>The book does  use language that might be considered objectionable by some, but these  words are quoted directly from contemporary historical sources.  They help  to give an honest impression of the way sexuality was discussed in the  past.  It is a very good book.</span>
