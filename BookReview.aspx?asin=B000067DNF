                <span id="Label1">In every aspect, the extended-edition DVD of Peter Jackson's epic fantasy <I>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</I> blows away the theatrical-version DVD. No one who cares at all about the film should ever need to watch the original version again. Well, maybe the impatient and the squeamish will still prefer the theatrical version, because the extended edition makes a long film 30 minutes longer and there's a bit more violence (though both versions are rated PG-13). But the changes--sometimes whole scenes, sometimes merely a few seconds--make for a richer film. There's more of the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien, embodied in more songs and a longer opening focusing on Hobbiton. There's more character development, and more background into what is to come in the two subsequent films, such as Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship and Aragorn's burden of lineage. And some additions make more sense to the plot, or are merely worth seeing, such as the wood elves leaving Middle-earth or the view of Caras Galadhon (but sorry, there's still no Tom Bombadil). Extremely useful are the chapter menus that indicate which scenes are new or extended. <p>  Of the <I>four</I> commentary tracks, the ones with the greatest general appeal are the one by Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, and the one by 10 cast members, but the more technically oriented commentaries by the creative and production staff are also worth hearing. The bonus features (encompassing two complete DVDs) are far superior to the largely promotional materials included on the theatrical release, delving into such matters as script development, casting, and visual effects. The only drawback is that the film is now spread over two discs, with a somewhat abrupt break following the council at Rivendell, due to the storage capacity required for the longer running time, the added DTS ES 6.1 audio, and the commentary tracks. But that's a minor inconvenience. Whether in this four-disc set or in the collector's gift set (which adds Argonath bookends and a DVD of <I>National Geographic Beyond the Movie: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</I>), the extended-edition DVD is the <I>Fellowship</I> DVD to rule them all. <I>--David Horiuchi</I></span>

                    <span>Considered both as fantasy adventure and as an adaptation of a beloved literary classic, Peter Jackson's film of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" sets new standards for cinematic excellence. Everything about this film feels exactly right, from the casting to the screenplay to the special effects. The last are amazing, putting to shame anything George Lucas has come up with, and yet they always serve to advance the story; unlike Lucas, there's never any hint that Jackson is merely playing with his toys. Jackson shows great respect for Tolkien's text, but not slavish devotion. Certain characters--such as the lovable Tom Bombadil and Frodo's poisonous Aunt Lobelia--are missing, and Tolkien would be chagrined to find that the little poems and songs he loved to write are nowhere quoted. But if Jackson gives short shrift to Tolkien's whimsy, he more than makes up for that by giving us Tolkien's intensity, pathos and moral vision absolutely undiluted. Above all, Jackson never forgets that Tolkien's chief emphasis was always on the characters he created. Jackson casts wonderful actors to play those characters and--again unlike Lucas--he actually allows them to give performances. How wonderful to find the great Sir Ian McKellen, a uniquely commanding and charismatic actor, as Gandalf, or the charming and touching Elijah Wood as Frodo. You can go straight down the list--Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Sean Astin as Sam, Ian Holm as Bilbo, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel--and find nothing but perfection. This is one of the very few big-budget blockbusters that unqualifiedly deserves its success, and all we can do now is look forward with excitement to the release of "The Two Towers" in 2002 and "The Return of the King" in 2003. Like the books they came from, these three fillms will be cherished by future generations.</span>

                    <span>If you've read Tolkien's classic saga, you'll find yourself miffed at many of the critical changes and omissions. Nevertheless ... taken on its own, the movie is an exciting tale that's far more thrilling than Harry Potter. New Zealand's splendid landscape is a perfect setting for the movie - wide expanses of open plains, forbidding mountain ranges, beautiful rivers and valleys. The settings created by the filmmakers for other places in the book - Rivendell, Lothlorien (never named in the movie), and the mines of Moria - are equally compelling and beautifully crafted.<P>Although the movie is almost three hours long, it never drags. The "fellowship of the ring" consists of nine members, and even within a three-hour movie, it is hard to do justice to the characterization of each of those nine. Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn are the most finely-drawn and compelling, with Sam Gamgee and Boromir close behind. Legolas, Gimli, Pippin, and Merry are supporting characters - they look exactly right for their parts, but the complex interplay that existed between them all in the book doesn't make it to the screen. Ian McClellan, who plays Gandalf, is completely believable as the gruff wizard, seen by the hobbits as simply the master of incredible fireworks, but actually an important leader in the fight against Sauron.<P>The story's most critical "actor" is, of course, the Ring. Created by the evil Sauron, it would give tremendous power to whoever wields it - a power that ultimately corrupts. The message - that one cannot use an evil tool to accomplish good - is beautifully clear. To rid the world of this compelling evil, Frodo and the others set off on a quest to find the Cracks of Doom, where the ring was forged, and there destroy the ring. Many who are already evil seek the ring; others, once good, are corrupted by the desire to possess the ring and threaten Frodo as he journeys eastward. The movie chronicles Frodos's journey from the peace of the Shire east to the black regions of Mordor.<P>The strength of the book, and one which director Peter Jackson translates well to the screen, is the compelling believability of this alternate world, peopled with creatures out of legend (elves, trolls, and wizards) as well as newer, imaginative creations of Tolkien's (hobbits and orcs). The battle and chase scenes are visually stunning, and the contrasts between the beauties of the untouched portions of this world and the ones which have been corrupted by the Ring's destructive power are vivid. Young children may find some of the battle scenes too frightening - at least one parent exited the movie with children under 9 who just got too scared (that's why the movie has a PG-13 rating!).<P>At the end of the showing I went to, many members of the audience applauded. So did I ... and I wish I didn't have to wait a year to see the next episode!</span>

                    <span>J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved Lord of the Rings comes to life on the big screen in Peter Jackson's excellent adaptation. This movie is superior from begining to end. Although it runs right at 3 hours, the action and suspense held my attention throughout and left me wanting more. The actors; Ian McKellen as the great Gandalf the Gray, Elijah Wood as the young hobbit Frodo, Viggo Mortensen as the swashbuckling Aragorn, Sean Astin as Frodo's companion Sam, and Ian Holm as the aging but wise Bilbo, give riveting performances throughout the film. The special effects are top notch, especially the battle with the Balrog of Moria and the numerous encounters with the mysterious Orcs. Anyone who has read the beloved Tolkien trilogy knows the story of the Ring, and it is accurately told in the film. The ending is left wide open for the sequel, The Two Towers, which I am eagerly anticipating. Watch this exciting film, which should rank as one of the greatest fantasy films ever, and experience the wonders of Middle Earth.</span>

                    <span>"We can make them longer, stronger, better!" When Peter Jackson said this about the extended DVD versions of the films, I'm sure hordes of movie fans disagreed. They were WRONG!! The Lord of the Rings trilogy is quite possibly the best thing that's ever happened to the movie industry, and these extended version DVDs are the best things to ever happen to DVD players. This first installment was great in the theater, but the extended version is better. Several things are explained in greater detail, and you can't tell where new material has been inserted. It's flawless, from the acting to the music to the scenery. I can't say enough good things about this movie. Oh yeah, the extras are nice too.</span>

                    <span>Without repeating the reviews of the rest listed here....I can say that the extended editions add more texture to the story and the documentary DVD's give you more background and understanding of the story. <P>It made me want to read the books to see what the films couldn't touch upon ...the poetry and descriptions of middle earth are very much on target. I really hope that Jackson gets the chance to do the Hobbit. It would be a crime if it wasn't adapted by him in the very near future. All I have to say to the film makers is ..Lets see the Hobbit before the actors become unavailable to produce the film!</span>
