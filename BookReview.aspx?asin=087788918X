                <span id="Label1"><I>Walking on Water</I> collects 12 brief meditations by Madeleine L'Engle on the nature of art and its relation to faith. L'Engle, the beloved author of <I>A Wrinkle In Time</I> among others, has written and spoken widely and wisely about the connection between religion and art. The gist of her understanding is as follows: <blockquote>To try to talk about art and about Christianity is for me one and the same thing, and it means attempting to share the meaning of my life, what gives it, for me, its tragedy and its glory. It is what makes me respond to the death of an apple tree, the birth of a puppy, northern lights shaking the sky, by writing stories.</blockquote> She believes that "[b]asically there can be no categories such as 'religious' art and 'secular' art because all true art is incarnational, and therefore 'religious.'" And "incarnation," in L'Engle's view, means "God's revelation of himself through particularity." In this book there is some slippage between L'Engle's autobiographical and critical voices. As a result, she often claims Christian significance for works whose meaning is not intentionally Christian. She admits this freely: <blockquote>[B]ecause I am a struggling Christian, it's inevitable that I superimpose my awareness of all that happened in the life of Jesus upon what I'm reading, upon Buber, upon Plato, upon the Book of Daniel. But I'm not sure that's a bad thing. To be truly Christian means to see Christ everywhere, to know him as all in all.</blockquote> <I>-- Michael Joseph Gross</I> </span>

                    <span>My roommate has been in love with Madeline's writing for years, so I just had to see for myself if she was as good as he said she was. <P>Thankfully, I found her to be as enriching as C.S. Lewis at times and as articulate as Brennan Manning. A whimsical, mystical read that explores the kind of faith Peter had when he looked to Jesus and walked on water. <P>Clearly for the artists, writers and those deeply into art as a means of expression vital to the growing Christian's faith, this book will make you think, make you guess and make you question what you really believe about the All-mighty and All-creative power of God.</span>

                    <span>In this rerelease of such a rare and insightful book, Madeleine L'Engle continues to exemplify exactly what it is that makes her such a wonderful author, and the foreword by singer Nicole Nordeman reveals a glimpse into the relevance of L'Engle's writing to the artist, the woman, and the Christian of today.<P>She writes about art and the flavor one's faith may give it. "Bad art is bad religion," she says, and I must agree with her. Whatever ones creates will be a reflection of the intrinsic beliefs of the individual: good or bad, Christian, Buddist, or atheist, we recreate what we are. She also ponders subjects such as art, human dignity, the individual Christian witness, creativity, and the Creator. <P>All wrapped up in an informal tone, "Walking on Water" feels like a peek into her journal. She addresses her thoughts on her craft as well as her life with her actor husband and children. This book is hands down my all-time favorite. I have read, reread, underlined, dog-eared and starred mine so many times that the binding is falling apart, and I fear that I may soon need to purchase a new copy. Even after her death, L'Engle has become my mentor, role model, and sister of my soul.<P>If you liked this book I highly suggest "A Circle of Quiet," also by Madeleine L'Engle. She uses the same informal writing style and addresses some similar topics.</span>

                    <span>I'm not Christian; I'm not an artist. Therefore, you would think this book would hold no appeal for me. Nonetheless, as a huge Madeleine L'Engle fan, when I stumbled upon this book, I had to read it. It is one of the most though-provoking, inspirational books I have ever read, and definitely one of my favorites. It touches on many of the same topics covered in the Crosswicks books, but reflects on similar thoughts and experiences in a different way. This is definitely her best nonfiction that I have read thus far, and also provides a fresh perspective on the creative background of her fiction.</span>

                    <span>Madeleine L'Engle is the preeminent interpreter of the Christian journey as it pertains to these words of the Apostle Paul, "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things." (Philippians 4:8). Ms. L'Engle invites the reader to focus on that which is great, greater and greatest, in a world that all too often settles for what is dishonorable, unjust, impure, ugly, discourteous, shoddy and worthy of condemnation. In both her fiction and non-fiction writings, she helps the thinking Christian look at the world through the eyes of faith.<P>Ms. L'Engle takes as the theme of the book, Jesus' invitation to Peter to come to Christ walking on the water. For a brief moment, Peter did just that. Ms. L'Engle states that is how we were created to be, and even when we sink, and cry for help, that Jesus will pull us up. She says, "The impossible still happens to us, often during the work, sometimes when we are so tired that inadvertently we let down all the barriers we have built up. (Page 238).<P>Ms. L'Engle views the creative process as a successive letting down of barriers. Of opening to God. When one responds to the urge to create, one is one more than holy ground-one walks on water-since God is the Creator and God's creative energies are limitless and surprising. God's very unpredictability and joy become the same creative force in musicians and artists of all kinds. Ms. L'Engle speaks of the freedom to laugh at ourselves as one of the prerequisites for bringing about that which is worthwhile. <P>Lest we mistakenly think that Ms. L'Engle's approach is sweetly sentimental, listen to what she says about the rigors of faithful creativity, "Complicated creatures we are, aware of only the smallest fragment of ourselves; seeking good and yet far too often unable to tell the difference between right and wrong; misunderstanding each other and so blundering into the tragedies of warring nations, horrendous discrepancies between rich and poor, and the idiocy of a divided Christendom." (Page 153).<P>This would be an outstanding book to give or receive for a special occasion such as graduation or confirmation. For Christians of any stage in life, "Walking on Water" is a call to live expectantly and trustingly.</span>

                    <span>This is truly an incredible book. I recomend it to all Christians, not just artists, as a beautiful example of how reconcile faith with daily life. <P>I am excited to see that this edition includes a forward by Nichole Nordeman. In the notes to her album, "This Mystery", Nordeman speaks about how this book shaped and influenced her work. I recomend buying this album as a companion to "Walking on Water". If you read it, then listen to the cd, I think you'll agree that Nordeman's work works as a perfect soundtrack to the book.<P>Two incredible women.</span>
