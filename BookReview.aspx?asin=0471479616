                <span id="Label1">Real world anecdotes and step-by-step strategies to build and sell a successful business<br>   Half of the roughly one million businesses that start up every year fail because of insufficient financing, poor management, or lack of basic entrepreneurial skills. Based on his own experience as well as those of the many other successful business owners interviewed for this book, Joe John Duran explains how to overcome these obstacles. This reader-friendly book offers easy-to-follow advice, including 20 vital secrets that will help business owners avoid the most common mistakes, grow their businesses successfully, and then sell them at the highest price possible.<br>   Joe John Duran (Santa Monica, CA) built a national investment firm with billions under management and thousands of clients. Within 10 years of creating it, he sold it to General Electric for tens of millions of dollars. He is a chartered financial analyst, CEO of Alchemy Capital, Chairman of Finance of the Santa Monica Bay Young Presidents Organization (YPO), and a member of the Association of Investment Management Research (AIMR) and the Los Angeles Society of Financial Analysts (LASFA).</span>

                    <span>I was a little put off by the title but after having read this i have to say i have never had so much good advice in one place...i literally found something interesting in every chapter (though not all of them applied directly to my business). I have run my accounting firm for fifteen years but realize that there are many things i do wrong every day to complicate my life. this book was really easy to read..i have told several of my clients about it. I love those african tales.</span>

This book gave me several ah ha moments that clearly explained what i need to do to actually have fun, and build a sellable business.

                    <span>Where was this book when I started my first business years ago. Entrepreneurship is one of the most challenging undertakings and yet Joe John Duran steps you through the critical steps and makes it so clear. It is a fast and fun read. A must have on every shelf of a business owner or someone who still hopes to be one someday. I know the corners of my copy will become frayed and the pages worn as I expect to refer back to it often. A precious gift for yourself or the beloved small businesspeople in your life.</span>
