                <span id="Label1">The Nuremburg trials remain, after nearly a half a century, the benchmark for judging international crimes. Using new sources--ground-breaking research in the papers of the Nuremburg prison psychiatrist and commandant, the letters and journals of the prisoners, and accounts of the judges and prosecutors as they struggled through each day making compromises and steeling their convictions--Joseph Persico retells the story of Nuremburg, combining sweeping history with psychological insight. Here are brilliant, chilling portraits of the Nazi warlords and riveting descriptions of the tensions between law and vengeance, between East and West, and of the friction already present in the early stages of the Cold War.</span>

                    <span>I've always been facinated by the Nuremberg trials, and last year I actually took a college course solely on Nuremberg, so I've read many Nremberg historicals in my life. I think that this one might be the best simply because it is written in the most interesting way. Persico takes you through the trial as if it were a novel with twists and climaxes in its plot. He also interjects a fair amount of subjective criticism into the book ( much of which I disagree with ). I would recommend this book even above those written by trial participants such as Taylor's and Tusa's books for readers interested in learning about the shape and scope of the trials. This is especially true for readers new to the Nuremberg trial since this book is more likely than most to keep your attention throughout the book. The only book about Nuremberg that I have read that is better than Persico's is psychologist G.M. Gilbert's "Nuremberg Diary." Although this one is better for readers interested in learning about the trial itself.</span>

                    <span>Although based on historical fact, Persico¡¯s day-by-day account of the Nuremberg Trials reads more like a novel. In fact, because of the way he focuses on the points of view of nearly every individual who was involved, it almost seems as though the book were written so as to be easily adapted to a screenplay, which of course it eventually was. <P> Essentially, Persico tells the story of the Nuremberg trials, from before the start to after the finish. In so doing, he presents not just a narrative of the trial itself, but he also discusses and analyzes many of the subplots that were going on during the trial. Thus, at times he focuses on personal and professional struggles between characters, such as two American psychiatrists who, although theoretically working together, found themselves at odds over who could profit from the experience first. Likewise, he gives some attention to Justice Jackson¡¯s courtroom struggles, and how he tended to be overshadowed by the courtroom performances of fellow prosecutor Thomas Dodd. <P> Nevertheless, this attention to subplots does not come at the cost of examining the psychological issues or legal intricacies of the trials. Despite Persico¡¯s focus on the players involved, he spends a large part of the book examining the issues that readers would tend to find most historically important. He gives in-depth analysis of each individual Nazi defendant, discussing how each spent his time in prison, how some seemed to grasp and express contrition for what they had done while others felt no remorse. Likewise, he also spends a good deal of time looking at some of the important legal issues surrounding the trial, and the incredible efforts that the allies (except, generally, for the Russians) put forth to ensure that the defendants had as fair a trial as possible.<P> Overall, it is an insightful and engaging book, and an easy read.</span>

                    <span>Great book for those that want a quick glance on the happenings of the Nuremberg trials. Four main sections: Preparation of the court, Prosecution statements, Defense and Counterinterrogation of the Nazi warlords, Sentencing and beyond. Narration keeps the reader interested in the book. The only problem is the fragmentation of the situations; chapters are really short and have little continuity. This is a curse for the Nuremberg lovers...but a blessing for the normal reader...you can delay reading and not lose the whole objective of the book. There are TOO MANY NAMES...it is more difficult when half of the names are German. Still...I would highly recommend the book.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the only nonfiction books I've ever read, and it was well worth the effort. Although nearly everyone will be quick to place Hitler at the top of their 'most evil men in history' list, the rest of the Nazi coterie are not so well known, and what we find is a cast of characters worthy of any fictional account. You have Albert Speer, the sensitive and morally astute architect who nevertheless relied on slave labor to build his masterpieces; Goering, a bombastic wit who destroyed his captors and fellow inmates alike; Von Schirach, the eerily handsome youth leader described by one prosecution attorney as 'the sort of scout master who molests young boys;' Von Schacht, the imposing old financial genius who admits, grudginly, that he has some trouble with basic arithmetic; Julius Streicher, the lunatic propogandist, who swears at children and does nude calisethnics in front of the guard assigned to watch him.<P>The account is, however, very long, and I found the sections about the various other personalities involved in the trial uninteresting (well, it's difficult to compete with some of the most dramtically evil men of the century). If you're willing to skim a few passages (which is would be unacceptable in a novel, but which doesn't do much harm with a work like this), I think you'll find this very interesting, whether as a student of history, an artist, or anyone attempting to expand their knowledge of human nature.</span>

                    <span>While Joseph Persico is hardly the only writer to tackle the first, and most important, of the Nuremberg trials of high-ranking Nazis, his book is the one readers who want a well-written, historically accurate, compelling account of this history-making event.</span>
