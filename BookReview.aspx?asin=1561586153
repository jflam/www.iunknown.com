Through hundreds of inspiring photographs and engaging text, the author describes what gives traditional homes their enduring appeal. Versaci identifies Eight Pillars of Traditional Design that create a solid foundation for combining authentic, traditional design with livability to create homes that feel old yet live new. Featuring a vast array of new, old-house styles &#151; from colonials to farmhouses &#151; from all over the country, the houses illustrate the creative work of architects, builders, and craftsmen who are forging the movement toward building new homes that capture an old-home sensibility.</span>

                    <span>In this wonderful book, widely acclaimed architect Russell Versaci tells the reader how to capture the character of an old house in a new house, tailored for today's needs. The author, who is well known for this sort of designing, starts out with his "Eight Pillars of Traditional Design", and then shows you how to put them into practice. Taking eighteen houses found throughout the country (and reflecting the traditional regional style), he uses a combination of brightly colorful pictures and highly informative text to take you around and through the houses, giving you an insiders look into what was done and why.<P>Having grown up in an old house, I have always found the boxy/characterless/styleless post-World War 2 houses to be nothing short of depressing. My wife and I now own a 1916 house, and wish to add in the character that makes an old house a gem. Well, we found this book to be a great source of ideas and inspirations. If you like the style and grace of well-made older houses, and want to incorporate that style and grace into your own home, then you must read this book!</span>

                    <span>I love older homes. And when it came to renovating our newer home we were challenged to put the old into the new. I've been a magazine junkie, culling pictures here and there. But this book is a one-stop shop for classic American styles and details. I love that these houses are not lavishly large (for the most part) but intimate. The strength is in their high quality details. <BR>My husband and I really love this book. We have been able to visually resolve some ideas about mantels, flooring, and window styles to compliment our New England home. The side bars and floor plans are easy to follow. And notice how light plays in the interiors. Sumptuous! <P>(I just wish I could find an old stlye interior pattern book, complete with example photos, dates and locations. Hint, hint!)</span>

                    <span>As we all look for something authentic in a country washed over in a sea of fakery and bogus iconography; it is refreshing to see that there are artists and crafts people (and architects) still capable of creating space that is authentic. This is a book for anyone who is considering creating a space that is populated by not just a lot of "authentic looking" details but details that reflect the substance of the structure itself. The structures that are reviewed are not multimillion dollar, 45,000 sq. ft. mansions; rather they are a mix chosen for illustrating Versaci's message.<P>I read this book and as I embark on yet another new home building project feel a real sense of excitement. Time to find myself an architect who share's Versaci's enthusiasm for an authentic American architecture that is true to itself right down to the foundation.<P>If you are looking around your home and it appears visually shallow this book will be a real watershed for your vision of the "next" house. I bought several copies for friends who are looking at a possible "next" homes and it has really started them thinking in an all new way about their projects. <P>Nice book to look at and read.</span>

                    <span>My husband and I like old houses, and we had been thinking of buying a new Victorian in a subdivision. I say "had," because ever since we bought this book, we feel that the houses we have been considering are hollow imitations of the real thing. They just pale in comparision to the "new old" houses shown in this book. In short, we have become inspired to build our own "new old house." Thank you, Russell Versaci! We love this book!</span>
