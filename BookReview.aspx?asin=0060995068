                <span id="Label1">Shocking as it is, this book--a crucial source of original research used for the bestseller <I>Hitler's Willing Executioners</I>--gives evidence to suggest the opposite conclusion: that the sad-sack German draftees who perpetrated much of the Holocaust were not expressing some uniquely Germanic evil, but that they were average men comparable to the run of humanity, twisted by historical forces into inhuman shapes. Browning, a thorough historian who lets no one off the moral hook nor fails to weigh any contributing factor--cowardice, ideological indoctrination, loyalty to the battalion, and reluctance to force the others to bear more than their share of what each viewed as an excruciating duty--interviewed hundreds of the killers, who simply could not explain how they had sunken into savagery under Hitler. A good book to read along with Ron Rosenbaum's comparably excellent study <I>Explaining Hitler</I>. <I>--Tim Appelo</I></span>

                    <span>The power of "Ordinary Men" is its ability to convey the magnitude of the Holocaust by recounting the activities of a single battalion of German policemen stationed in eastern Poland in 1942-43. Browning keeps his focus on the atrocities committed by this 500-man battalion, without straying to discuss related parties or neighboring geographies. Far from creating a myopic study, this focus serves to underscore the breadth of the Nazis' extermination program during the Second World War. The key strengths of the book are Browning's careful research of German judicial archives from the 1960s, as well as his balanced interpretation of the battalion's crimes and of humanity's capacity for committing organized mass murder. The main shortcoming is that the author's analysis is saved almost entirely for the last chapter, rather than accompanying the relevant passages. This creates a dichotomy which is only a minor drawback to an otherwise extraordinary historical work.</span>

                    <span>Browning asserts an interesting thesis regarding the Einsatzgruppen; these were the death squads who adminstered conquered lands and carried out the final solution in places where they could or did not ship the jews to camps.  He establishes the backround of a particular Police Battalion. 
<br />
<br />These individuals were not hardened Nazi's nor fanatical SS; nor were they even that keen on gunning down Jews.  The argument that Browning makes is that anti-semitism was created in these individuals by killing jews.  In order to cope with murdering, they became anti-semetic.  When their commander announced their first action, he was in tears and offered an exception to whomever did not want to do this.  Soldiers cried, looked the other way when some jews tried to escape, establishing a character that challenges our assumptions.  
<br />
<br />As time went on, the soldiers became used to this, and would have to joke around with each other while shooting jews.  There were some instances of drunken debauchery that will break your heart as well: instances of cruelty that boggles the mind.  </span>

                    <span>One of the things that I remember about this particular dark period of history is what my father used to say about it. He felt, and stated, that the thing that was most upsetting was not what happened. But, that the people who did it, "were just like us."
<br />
<br />This book shows us the monsters of the Holocaust were truly just like us. This is a book about being a team player. It is about consensus and doing just a little more for the unit. In other words, it is entirely applicable today. 
<br />
<br />The moral lesson of this book is clear. Today we are pressured to do things that we know are a little wrong in order to get along. Doing something that is a little wrong is only a matter of degree. 
<br />
<br />I work in an industry where one of the interview questions is, "are you willing to do things, required of you in this job, that may, or do, violate your own sense of ethics or morality." I work here; so you know how I answered. 
<br />
<br />This is a very disturbing book if you read it and in any way relate to the many police officers that it is about. These reserve police are a true cross section of society and reflect a culture and value system very similar to our own.

                    <span>I thought this piece contains some material that should be seen by everyone, but then there was a lot of stuff that could have been left out. It was amazing to see how normal men turn into cold-hearted killing machines. Unfortunately,  the book containted too many number and statistics which really took away from it. The book didn't do that well focusing on the main topic either, because it went off on many different tangents. I would recommend this book to be read though, because it is hard to believe that you or I could have a terrible amount of potential to murder people like the men in 101 did, and this book helps to shed light on the dark side of humanity.</span>
