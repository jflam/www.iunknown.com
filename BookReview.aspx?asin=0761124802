                <span id="Label1">Whether you're an armchair quarterback or a fantasy football freak, this is a stat-head's dream. What it lacks in sparkle it makes up for in a cavalcade of numbers, rankings, comparisons, and lists. Just try to stump this book: which team has the fewest fumbles in a season? The 1959 Cleveland Browns committed a mere eight. Who has the most two-point conversions in one game? Denver's Terrell Davis ran for two against Atlanta on September 28th, 1997. Who is the 20th-best rusher of all-time? None other than the underrated Freeman McNeil, with 8,074 yards. The <I>Record and Fact Book</I> also includes a season-by-season chronicle of pro football, bios of every Hall of Fame member, definitive team information from the 1997 season (and a play-by-play recap of that season as well), and the important stuff, such as URLs for each team's Web site and team logos. The only thing missing? What John Elway ate for breakfast (Wheaties or Lucky Charms?) <I>--Tod Nelson</I></span>

                    <span>The Official NFL 1998 Record and Fact Book continues to be the best available NFL stats book. This edition provides great rundowns and scoring stats for every game played by every team during the 1997 season.<p>There is also a 4-page section on each team with coaching histories, individual and team records, draft choices, and coaches bios.<p>This 1998 edition includes a complete schedule for the 1998 season. This schedule is spread out over 6 1/2 pages with plenty of space for me to write in the game scores and miscellaneous notes. And it includes a worksheet to determine each team's opponents for the 1999 season.<p>Workman Publishing puts this book out each summer, and the 1998 edition is my fourth one. If you're serious about your NFL facts, then this book should be on your shelf!</span>
