                    <span>Mary Beth O'Neill is an experienced executive coach who provides a useful perspective and helpful guidelines and examples of what coaches can do to help executives. Her systems perspective and four-step approach is helpful with case examples and additional insights into how leaders can be coached to coach and how coaching can be combined with consulting to have a greater impact on the organization.  There are several key elements of professional coaching that are missing in the book:  First- The four-step approach does not include a thorough assessment of the executive and his/her organization using reliable historical, normative, and 360-degree data.  Instead, the major focus is on asking the executive what they think they need or want to work on.  Second- There is a lack of focus on involving and partnering with the executive's boss, board, key constituents, HR professionals and others to truly understand the executive and the organization from multiple perspectives and to have the potential impact on the whole system.  And third- there could be greater emphasis on what happens after the coaching is completed; how to transition for continued learning, application, and improvement.<br>For more information about the principles and practice of executive coaching that incorporates Ms. O'Neill's useful approaches along with the additional components described above, you may want to go to the following website for the free Handbook of Executive Coaching along with other free information and tools for executives, coaches, and HR professionals:  www.executivecoachingforum.com</span>

                    <span>Excellent resource for experienced coaches looking for insight to take their practice to a higher level. This book is also useful for those considering coaching or consulting as a permanent profession. O'Neill provides many honest examples of the inner thoughts of coaches during sessions and tools to help maintain effectiveness and composure with tough clients.<p>Her humble writing style fosters the belief that "I could do this!" even though the concepts are highly advanced. I found myself going back over pages and concepts as I realized I had been in similar situations before. The case studies are exciting and easy to absorb but read this book slowly to embrace the richer complexities.</span>

                    <span>Mary Beth O'Neill describes how executive coaches need to work with executives as partners to help them become better leaders. Coaches need the strength to share the truth with clients in times of crisis, she explains. She discusses the core principles that underlie coaching and the four essential phases of the coaching process: contracting, planning, live-action intervening and debriefing. The book is primarily directed to coaches, including consultants and internal or external trainers, who facilitate processes and projects in organizations. While it has its share of fuzzy and jargon-laden patches, the book is generally clear and to the point. It includes a mix of examples, charts, and step-by-step techniques, plus useful chapter highlights. We [...] recommend this book to coaches, to executives who are coaching employees and to executives who are being coached.<br /></span>

                    <span>It seems quite awhile since I have found a book in my own field that I can completely recommend to almost anyone.  This is a terrific book for coaches, consultants and leaders at all levels. Finally here is a book that explains the role of coaching as an Organization Development intervention.  As well it clearly alginates the differences between calling yourself an executive coach and the competencies required to actually be one.  In fact I would have to say that this is a must read for any executive or corporate coach.<p>One reviewer said this book was easy to read.  While it is well written and gives the illusion of simplicity, the concepts and specifics inside are subtler than that.  I am a quick reader and it took me some time to properly digest what O'Neill was really saying.  And this is not a big book.  When I first picked it up, I remember thinking:  "Oh brother another expensive book without much meat."  I was completely wrong.  There doesn't appear to be a lot of theory, but it is clear that theory is the underpinning of the author's work and it is there front and centre.  However, you do not notice it because of how it is presented.  <p>This one of the few books that I have read where the short case studies really added value to the book.  In the cases typical situations and examples of how she expertly handled them were reviewed, as well as some warnings about how the coach can also get triggered by what is happening.  Another great part is that this book as a "go back to" reference.  The three Appendix contain a personal assessment, questions to ask clients and issues on how to combine consulting with coaching or vice versa.</span>
