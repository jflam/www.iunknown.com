        <div class="entryTitle">Entertainment PC's</div>
        <div class="entryDate">2001-12-20</div>
        <p><P>The following is a description of my first foray into the world Entertainment PC's. This involves understanding issues such as PC-TV connectivity, sound card-video card interactions, and Personal Video Recorders (aka Tivo devices). Not surprisingly, I was lead like the proverbial lam to the slaughter. Here's an account of my experiences in hopes that others won't make the same mistakes that I did.</P>
<P>Here was my list of requirements for my EPC:</P>
<OL>
<LI>High-quality audio playback for WMA/MP3 files on a Dolby Digital receiver. 
<LI>High-quality video playback on a TV. 
<LI>High-quality video recording from a cable TV source. 
<LI>Remote control.</LI></OL>
<P>Sounds like a simple list, huh? This is where the fun begins. For the audio playback, it was a no-brainer. I just went to the 800-pound gorilla in the industry, Creative, and bought an OEM version of their excellent <A href="http://www.americas.creative.com/products/category.asp?Category=165&amp;MainCategory=1">Audigy sound card</A>. For video record / playback, it was also a no-brainer. I went to the leader in that category, ATI, and bought an <A href="http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/aiw_radeon/">All-In-Wonder Radeon</A> card (it also helps that a good friend from high school is the product manager for that video card).</P>
<P>If all I had to do was buy these two cards, I'd be set. Unfortunately, I have to plug those cards into a PC. And that is where the nightmare begins.</P>
<P>First things first. I have some general rules when it comes to buying a PC that I will use as a development box:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Don't skimp on the motherboard 
<LI>Don't skimp on the CPU</LI></OL>
<P>Somehow, I managed to throw both of these rules out the window in my quest to build the ultimate EPC. My first mistake was that&nbsp;I didn't want a PC that would spend its entire life in my <EM>living room</EM> to be more powerful than my development boxes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>A home-brew desktop &nbsp;with an Athlon 1200 + 768 MB PC133SDRAM + 7200RPM 60GB disk 
<LI>A <A href="http://www.pcmag.com/article/0,2997,s%253D1565%2526a%253D9636,00.asp">Thinkpad T-23</A> with a&nbsp;1.13Ghz Pentium III-M + 1GB PC133SDRAM + 5400RPM 48GB disk</LI></OL>
<P>So the first PC that I bought was a mega el-cheapo Celeron-800 box running an <A href="http://www.pcboost.com/product31.html">ASUS TU4VX</A> motherboard. The total out-the door price of one of these boxes with 256MB PC133SDRAM, a 60GB disk and a <A href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/Pioneer/CDA/Industrial/IndustrialProductDetails/0,1444,1742,00.html">Pioneer 16X DVD</A> card was just $640 CDN (that's just over $400 US). </P>
<P>Actually, I wanted <EM>two</EM> of these boxes, but due to a communications screw-up with the store, I only went home with one. This turned out to be a good thing.</P>
<P>After installing Windows XP Professional on that box, and messing around with a zillion different driver upgrades (note that as of the writing of this article, <EM>nobody</EM> actually ships XP drivers in the box, you need to download these and do various arcane invocations to upgrade the drivers correctly and install in the correct sequence). </P>
<P>So, now for the observations (many of these were made <EM>after</EM>&nbsp;2am on the 18th). </P>
<OL>
<LI>
<DIV>The audio playback experience was very disappointing on the Audigy (this turns out to be my mistake as I will explain later).</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>The TV quality was quite disappointing compared to running cable directly into my TV.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>I could not record video at the VHS and near DVD quality settings without dropping <EM>lots</EM> of frames. To compound matters, I couldn't play back any recordings made at lower than VHS quality without the player crashing!</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>I gave up at 5am. </P>
<P>When I awoke the next morning, I came up with a different angle of attack on the problem. First, it was pretty obvious that a Celeron 800 just wasn't going to cut it. It was time for the heavy artillery: I was going to switch over to the vaunted <A href="http://athlonxp.amd.com/">Athlon XP</A> series of CPU's. Along with that came the corresponding motherboard swap. When I called up my friends at ATI, they told me to avoid the <A href="http://www.viatech.com/en/index/index.jsp">VIA chipsets</A>. That was strange, but after doing some searching, I discovered that the <A href="http://www.asus.com.tw/mb/socketa/a7m266/overview.htm">ASUS A7M266</A> motherboard used the <A href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_873_1106,00.html">AMD761</A> chipset, and that it should probably do the trick.</P>
<P>I called up the store, and they graciously agreed to swap out my motherboard and CPU at no extra cost. That was nice of them considering they do have a no return / no refund policy. After driving across Toronto to the store and hanging around for the better part of the afternoon of the 18th, I was the proud father of two brand new Athlon XP 1600+ computers.</P>
<P>I was so tired after this saga that I went home and went directly to bed.</P>
<P>The next morning, I booted up my computers using Windows XP for the first time. The first computer crashed when XP tried to start. I tried the other one. It crashed too. Not AGAIN!</P>
<P>After a bit of fiddling around with the BIOS settings on the machines, I discovered that the reason why Windows XP was crashing was because I was running them at the auto-detect speed for the Athlon XP 1600+ CPU. Those settings are 1400MHz for the CPU clock and 133MHz for the front-side-bus clock. When I backed off those settings to the auto-detect fall-back settings for that CPU: 1050MHz for the CPU clock and 100Mhz for the FSB clock everything worked just fine.</P>
<P>Armed with this information, I searched the web and came across the Athlon Motherboard site. Looking through their discussion groups on the A7M266 motherboard, I came across <A href="http://www.athlonmb.com/vb/showthread.php?s=05e8e10300e143eb8a423e15fce13fa9&amp;threadid=36147">this thread</A> that argues convincingly that ASUS does not officially support the Athlon XP processor on that motherboard. In fact, the only motherboards that officially support the Athlon XP are the ones that use the VIA <A href="http://www.viatech.com/jsp/en/products/apollo/kt266.jsp">KT266</A> and <A href="http://www.viatech.com/jsp/en/products/apollo/kt266a.jsp">KT266A</A> chipsets.</P>
<P>While I could get these machines to work, I still wasn't happy with the fact that I had spent a bunch of extra money for CPU cycles that I couldn't use. So, I called up the store and complained again. This time, however, I argued that it was <EM>their</EM> fault since they should have known about the fact that A7M266 boards do not officially support the Athlon XP. However, they claimed to have bags of anecdotal evidence that shows that the A7M266 works just fine with Athlon XP processors, even if it wasn't "oficially" supported. However, they admitted that my experience was their first data point for Windows XP.</P>
<P>Who's fault was it? Was it ASUS's or Microsoft's fault? I don't know and frankly I don't really care. I just want some machines that work!</P>
<P>I remembered the ATI folks' warnings about VIA chipsets. So I resolved to go with the smallest delta possible: I would swap the Athlon XP 1600+ processors for Athlon 1400 processors (which are officially supported).</P>
<P>I spent the rest of the day setting up one of the boxes with all of the software, and experimenting with audio playback and video recording / playback features. On the software side of things, one particular piece of software that I purchased deserves mention: the <A href="http://www.snapstream.com/products/sspvs/">SnapStream Personal Video Station</A> software. This software converts any PC that has a supported TV tuner card into a Tivo-like recorder. What's really cool about this software is that it uses a web interface and lets other computers on your LAN download or view streaming video of the TV programs that you have recorded! It was so liberating to be able to watch a TV show that I recorded on my laptop while streaming the video over my wireless LAN. A vision of the future ... ;)</P>
<P>I experimented with recording various programs at different quality levels. On my crippled Athlon system, I was still dropping some frames at the near-DVD quality recording level. However, on the VHS quality recording level I was not dropping any frames whatsoever.</P>
<P>I also got around to installing all of the Soundblaster software and experimenting with it. Normally&nbsp;I <EM>never</EM> customize my development boxes because I wind up repaving them on a fairly regular basis. This means I normally just install the drivers and use software like Windows Media Player that come installed with the OS. However, I decided to check out the Soundblaster software that came bundled with my Audigy card. WOW. This stuff rocks! Especially the MP3/WMA player. It even lets you slow down songs without altering their pitch, which is really good for learning songs by playing along with the music. The audio quality playback on the Audigy card using the Soundblaster software was truly impressive. I am now very happy with the system.</P>
<P>I'm writing this article as I wait for the parts to arrive to replace my Athlon XP 1600+ CPU's. </P>
<P><EM>Update:</EM> there is definitely a conflict between the ASUS A7M266 motherboard and Windows XP. Maybe not with all instances of the same motherboard, but definitely with the two instances that I had in my posession. This frustrated me to no end. At the end of the day, with no resolution in sight, I decided to switch to Intel. Tomorrow I hope to be the proud owner of two new computers, each running a Pentium 4 1.6GHz processor on an <A href="http://www.ecs.com.tw/products/p4ita.htm">ECS P4ITA</A> (<A href="http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/850/">Intel 850 chipset</A>) motherboard with 256MB of <A href="http://www.rdram.com/">RAMBUS</A> memory. The surprising thing is that <EM>it is the same price</EM> as the Athlon XP 1600+ CPU's and my ASUS A7M266 motherboard. Go figure.</P>
