                    <span>Tom Pyzdek has a gift for explaining complex topics in simple terms. While the Six Sigma Handbook is a complete and accurate discussion of the material, unlike many books on this topic, this one is clear and easy to understand. Tom has actually used these techniques and his examples and explanations are easy to follow. Many books on this subject deal with theory or math. Tom tells you what to do to solve problems. The Six Sigma Handbook is a must-read for Engineers and Managers.</span>

                    <span>I am using this book as part of a six sigma course and it contains a lot of good information. On the downside I have seen some typos and some of the stat explanations were not as thorough as I would have liked. It I did not see binomial distribution table in it - I had to create my own.  Aside from that it covers the topics well. </span>

                    <span>I have been doing Six Sigma projects for GE worldwide for over six years. I was very pleased to find a book that doesn't pontificate about the benefits of Six Sigma without telling the practitioner what to do on a Monday morning. The organization of the tools using the DMAIC framework is especially useful for the beginning BB who is trying to make sense of the weeks of training while they are executing their projects.<p>Some sections, such as the TVM and Risk and Reliability analysis, are missing from the usual BB training and are welcome additions for extending the traditional Six Sigma methodology to `Lean' type projects.<p>Screen shots of Minitab and Excel make it a useful resource for refreshing techniques learned long ago.<p>The application of reliability analysis to call center abandonment rates is an interesting application of known techniques to a new area. <p>"The Six Sigma Handbook" is one of only a few reference books on Six Sigma that I have at my desk.</span>
