                <span id="Label1">The unlikeliest cult hit of 2004 was <I>What the (Bleep) Do We Know?</I>, a lecture on mysticism and science mixed into a sort-of narrative. Marlee Matlin stars in the dramatic thread, about a sourpuss photographer who begins to question her perceptions. Interviews with quantum physics experts and New Age authors are cut into this story, offering a vaguely convincing (and certainly mind-provoking) theory about... well, actually, it sounds a lot like the Power of Positive Thinking, when you get down to it. Talking heads (not identified until film's end) include  JZ Knight, who appears in the movie channeling Ramtha, the ancient sage she claims communicates through her (other speakers are also associated with Knight's organization). What she says actually makes pretty good common sense--Ramtha's wiggier notions are not included--and would be easy to accept were it not being credited to a 35,000-year-old mystic from Atlantis. <I>--Robert Horton</I></span>

                    <span>If total Self-Responsibility scares you, and you want to continue blaming others for your lot in life, you will NOT like this movie. The movie and the philosophy contained therein takes away all excuses, and puts the total responsibility for your life at your feet. If on the other hand, you embrace total Self-Responsibility, and recognize the total freedom it gives, you will LOVE this movie. Taken as a whole, rather than a series of parts, some believable, some not, this film conveys a solid message. The message has been conveyed by many others and is centurys old. BOTTOM LINE, THE MESSAGE WORKS for me. I am an atom in the body of the universe and the Divine Spark within me is the thinker of my thoughts, and the creator of my reality. That's my truth.  You're welcome to your own truth and to create your own reality, accidently, or on purpose. </span>

                    <span>We learned about this movie in my Sociology of Cults class at a predominant California University. If you notice all but a few of the people speaking in this movie are from the cult, with the exception of the one quantum physicist. That one Quantum Pysicist was interviewed about quantum physics and gave a very lenghty interview, where he spent most of the time disputing the cults ideas about quantum physics. After compiling hours of his discussions with them they edited everything he said to agree with their New Age cults viewpoint. He has since made public statements and went on a campaign to correct the ramifications of this movie, and their false use of his name, minipulating his words and jepordising his entire career. Plus many of these cult mebers try to talk like they truely understand quantum physics (when in reality we could count the number of innovative quantum pyhsicist on two hands). Please dont waste your time on this movie, but if you do go into it knowing that this is a cult and that their purpose is to spread their groups propoganda. If you liked it, or fell for it, dont be ashamed, were all searching for "truth" and "answers" but unfortunatly these people cant offer any real answers.  </span>

                    <span>On the DVD, the second side comes with Q&A sessions and interviews.  The film makers are very explicit that their goal is to change/effect the world.  I have no problem with that -- I'm fine with noble and lofty goals.  I simply would have enjoyed, respected, and taken away more from this film, if Ramtha had not appeared in it.  It has a variety of scientists and intelligent educated people, proposing some great ideas, and then, you had Ramtha.  Not only does what Ramtha says in the movie add nothing to the point (some of the comments are bizarre and seemingly irrelevant), but the film makers just injected a 35,000 year old spirit-through-a-medium into a scientific discussion, sinking their credibility.   
<br />
<br />I just hope that for those who have never been exposed to these (scientific) ideas before, they won't discredit all of science because of the strange and not-so-random affiliation made in this film.  I did some online research, followed some links, and was amazed at how some scientists will actually appear on a panel at seemingly large conventions -- with Ramtha on the panel with them, completely risking their careers in my opinion.  I can even intellectually understand how the film postulates that we need to open our minds to new ideas, and that accepting the possibility of ancient spirit/teachers sharing bodies with living people in order to impart their message would be a test of how open our mind is... but this movie suffers because of that inclusion, the otherwise liberating ideas are tainted, and it wasn't necessary.  I think it works against the stated goals of the film makers, and they would have reached a much broader audience had they omitted Ramtha.
<br />
<br />Honestly, I couldn't care who wrote, directed, and produced it.  If Charles Manson came up with an accurate, truthful, unbiased film on a reasonable and interesting application for the latest Quantum Physics, I would watch it.  So the fact that there were affiliations with "Ramtha's teachings" is not the issue for me...  it's simply that what Ramtha said did not contribute to the conversation, and since from the B-side interviews I gather that the film makers are fairly intelligent people, I am concerned that they felt it necessary to insert those clips.  They were either blinded by their own beliefs, or somehow bound to include them, because there is (in my opinion) no other reason for Ramtha to be in this movie.  Again, it just pulls down the whole credibility of an otherwise decent movie experience.
<br />
<br />Without Ramtha's presence in the movie, I might have given it four stars, leaving one off because there is this feeling that it would make a fun PBS special, but it did not tell me anything I didn't already know, so it was not a mind-blowing film experience for me.  Also the slight goofiness of the plot seemed forced.</span>

                    <span>I usually don't get into what other reviewers write.  But in this case I will make an exception.  To all those who feel compelled to smash this film to bits: shame on you.  Your negativity abounds into ruthlessness and it doesn't represent  you very well.  It's not always about science.  Science is wonderful, and important. But just like religion, it's not the only thing.  Open your minds, people.  If you are unable to, then move on and review some other film, perhaps a PBS film on evolution versus intelligent design.  Then I will listen to you.</span>

                    <span>Quantum physics astounds us because matter behaves DIFFERENTLY at the subatomic level than it does at the macro, human, scale. Basketballs DON'T just zip off into alternate universes. Implying that the laws of quantum physics should apply on the scale where Newtonian physics is a more accurate description of things is the same kind of presumption that made it initially so hard for the scientific community to accept that the subatomic world had it's own laws. 
<br />
<br />I do yoga, I meditate, AND I consider myself a scientist. A positive bent can certainly help us all on a personal level, but it's not because we're re-arranging the water molecules of our body into snowflakes. Is it no wonder that the details of Dr. Masaru Emoto's photographic process by which he captures his images is not even explored? This is a load of horse crap, along with several other notions in this film, presented as facts, like the idea that the Native Americans couldn't physically see the conquistadors' ships; I mean, there isn't even historical evidence for the latter suggestion.
<br />
<br />This film, with its weak-minded, ill-founded assertions, is an insult to both science and spirituality.</span>
