                    <span>Words fail me in praising this. Simply put, it is one of the most over-looked, classic texts of the 20th C. Platonov writes in a style that combines a dreamy, surreal sensibility of the world with a hard, trenchant, unflinching look at the characters who inhabit it. My copy of this is dog-eared, full of notes and underlines- aspiring writers take note- Platonov is a writer who is to be studied, as much for his subtlety and lyrical elegance as his tough-skinned presentation of ruined lives; people trying to craft some order and peace from a world, and largely doomed to fail. <P>I'm being a bit too romantic, too hyperbolic. I probably shouldn't have attempted this. But I want to put my two cents in as concerns this work, because I love it. It is a marvelous book.</span>

                    <span>This is one of those novels you will return to, repeatedly, like a cure. I can't think of any other work that so profoundly illuminates man's alienation- from self, from others, from nature, from meaning. Every thinking, waking person should own this.</span>

                    <span>Andrey Platonov was right in the middle of revolution. He was one of those who made it happen. And he wrote about what he knew and what he saw. He did not make it big but he was very good.</span>

                    <span>This book as others by Platonov provides one of the best hyperbolical explanations of why the revolution could not succeed in russia. Author shows it with the highest degree of veiled sarcasm. The book is fatalistic, sad, yet filled with a tender for russia, and written in an exceptional, poetic language... This will give you an outlook that is not to be found in history books or memoirs.</span>

                    <span>Soviet Russia during the 30's. Bloody Stalin's attrocities. To some people the period represented the joy of order, triumph of collective spirit and the blossom of ideas of Communism. To others it was the time of sleeples nights, spent in overwhelming fear for one's wellbeing, horrors of torture chambers, labor camps and death. Platonov's Foundation Pit is a book about building Communism, as an ennormous sacral machine that feeds on its own creators and demands bloody sacrifices daily. F.P. is definitely an abstract, utopian representation of the period, but the essense (and horror) of it is that the events described, no matter how grotesque and unlikely, very well might have taken place. Is the Foundation Pit the ultimate base for the future paradise on Earth where the children of the Soviet State will thrive for the Party ideals or is it the vast grave for the humanity as we know it? Descend at your own risk, and decide for yourself</span>
