                    <span>The Lost Years of Merlin epic is one of my favorite reads.  After reading this, I thought that "The Chronicles of Narnia" and "The Hobbit" together lost to this book.  Unlike those two books, The Lost Years of Merlin series creates an environment totally unlike your own.  The author, T.A. Barron, has an amazing ability to manipulate your mind into thinking it can smell every scent, feel every emotion, and walk alongside a young sage named Merlin.  Another reason for reading this epic on Merlin is because there are very few books that illustrate and discuss the events, heritage, and acquaintances in Merlin's childhood.  If you have read any books on Merlin and have wondered and even questioned his youth, here is the book that can resolve your queries.</span>

                    <span>The compendium of Barron's first 3 novels hasn't gotten nearly the credit it deserves.  The book competes with the Lord of the Rings in terms of imagination and creativity and surpasses Harry Potter by a mile.  Barron's tale follow's Merlin as he travel's from boy, to man, to wizard...<p>The life of the wizard is a tale so great it is known by both the young and old, and Barron does nothing but add to its greatness.  <p>Merlin's younger years take place on the mystical isle of Fincyra, which is not quite land and not quite water, neither the real world nor otherworld, but rather an "in between" place.  Fincyra is home to more mythical creatures than I knew exisisted; mermaids, giants, goblins, dwarves, dragons, fairies, and more, both old and original.  <p>Those who liked Harry Potter should devour this, and those, like I, who found that tale to be too childish, will be dazzled by the Barron's wonderful writing.  From the way he discribes things as simple as the rain and trees to being devoured by talking stone, the book seems to be written with the magic that it tell's of Merlin using.<p>This book isn't worthy of 5 stars, no, it's worthy of 6.</span>
