                <span id="Label1">David Goldberg's <i>Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning</i> is by far the bestselling introduction to genetic algorithms. Goldberg is one of the preeminent researchers in the field--he has published over 100 research articles on genetic algorithms and is a student of John Holland, the father of genetic algorithms--and his deep understanding of the material shines through. The book contains a complete listing of a simple genetic algorithm in Pascal, which C programmers can easily understand. The book covers all of the important topics in the field, including crossover, mutation, classifier systems, and fitness scaling, giving a novice with a computer science background enough information to implement a genetic algorithm and describe genetic algorithms to a friend.</span>

                    <span>I agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long.  Genetic Algorithms are a great programming tool, and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately, but this book had a lot of redundant information.
<br />
<br />If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so.  Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized.  Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that.
<br />
<br />I think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book.

                    <span>OK, I agree with the previous reviewers: it's the classical textbook for GAs. But it definitely needs updating, as it's a 15-year old book and much has been done in the area. Niching methods, for example, are just outlined. I'd recommend Melanie Mitchell's book instead of this one.</span>

                    <span>This book got me so excited that I was not able to continue reading. I had to put it down and walk about. The power of the learning classifier system (SCS) has yet to be fully explored. A system that organizes data (classifies) and learns new rules (generate new rules via the genetic algorithm) is a combination that still takes my breath away. The only negative to this book are the trivial problems the algorithms solve. There is none for the "bucket brigade" version of the SCS. Overall though it is an awesome book presenting a very powerful algorithm that has yet to be fully explored.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I've read for genetic algorithms and AI. I wish all books were like this. It is not pedagogical in its style (unlike Computational Intelligence - Engelbrecht), it is well written, very insightful and slowly takes you into the depths of GA/AI, so it's great to follow. This book contains source codes in Pascal (which is easy to translate to any other language - although you'd want to write your own based on OOP), pseudo codes, examples, and plenty of ways to understand the way GA's work. BUY THIS BOOK and you'll save yourself a lot of sweat and mind boggling wierd explanations from supposedly good authors. I'll never sell this book. <p>One reader wrote a comment about how this book could be cut in half, and is not suitable for CS majors, my response to that: "I'm a CS major, doing my Ph.D., my professor, my colleagues and almost everyone in the field has a copy of this book, maybe you never got past chapter2 in his book. If you want proof of theorems, there's lots of research papers available, almost all of which refer to Goldberg's book."</span>

                    <span>I was looking for an automated approach to finding an optimum run sequence through a changeover matrix. The programming examples gave me the elements I needed to experiment and then fine tune the approach for a working search algorithm. I found the book a good companion in my "voyage of discovery".<p>For me, the book works two levels, the basic pieces to "play with" are presented clearly in chapters 1 and 3, and practical implementation suggestions are spread throughout the text.<p>By developing programs in Visual Basic, experimenting with search parameters and re-reading sections of this book - I learned something new!</span>
