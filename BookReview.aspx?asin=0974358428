                    <span>I have seen Eric speak and I knew he was passionate about this subject.  What I didn't realize is that he had a knack for breaking down the information into usable chapters.  I had some knowledge about Key Performance Indicators, but this book gave me the concrete knowledge I need to speak intelligently about this subject.   Anyone in the web analytics field should have a copy.</span>

                    <span>I've read the 'classics' by Sterne and Inan, as well as some other good and bad books on web analytics, and this one is among the best.<p>What I especially like is the way each approach to analytics is thoroughly examined, and the strengths and weaknesses objectively discussed. Some books are dogmatic in their approach, locking the reader into the author's view of analytics.  This one differs by giving readers enough information with examples, clearly articulated factors, and other identified best practices to accept compromise solutions based on budget, level of in-house expertise and other considerations. <p>Another aspect of this book is the way the author cuts through ambiguous terminology that is rampant in the web analytics discipline, which does demystify.  The comprehensive discussion of tools, classified by type, is another area where this book shines. There is too much vendor hype that promotes fear, confusion and doubt, and this book cuts through the hype and uncovers what is and is not important, as well as sets realistic expectations.<p>Using the same comprehensive approach as in other parts of this book, the author covers metrics in great detail. This is, afterall, the essence of web analytics, and the thoroughness and scope of metrics make this book an invaluable resource.<p>If you need to learn web analytics, select tools to support it, or are a practicing web analytics analyst this book is one which should be on your desk - and given to other team members and stakeholders.  It raises the bar in books on the subject and is destined to become a classic.</span>

                    <span>Eric does a fantastic job of making sense of a complex subject and providing real context for all the web data available for analysis. If you are serious about truly being successful online, Website Analytics Demystified demonstrates how to move away from "reporting on yesterdays results" to providing real insight into online consumer behavior. If you are going to buy only one book on website analytics, this is the must have bible on the topic.</span>

                    <span>I have been involved with numerous web analytics initiatives as a vendor, consultant and business user.  Unfortunately, all too many deployed web analytics reporting projects have the following characteristics: sporadic insights separated by long periods of inactivity and inattention.  Furthermore, the choice of tools and the size of the reporting budget often have little or no bearing on the likelihood of success.  Eric Peterson's book goes right to the heart of how to make web analytics consistently actionable and profitable.  In a remarkably straightforward manner he helps you determine the limited number of key metrics you must follow assiduously in order to track the performance of your web site based on the business model (Online Commerce, Advertising, Lead Generation, and Customer Support).  This book offers immediate relief to anyone who has felt the pain of staring into yet another set of canned traffic reports overloaded with superfluous charts, tables and graphs, wondering just where they should begin.<p>The literature on web analytics is sparse.  There are only a handful of titles and they all belong on the bookshelf of anyone responsible for understanding and interpreting results on the Web.  Web Analytics Demystified, however, is the one destined to sit open on your desk, become dog-eared from use and accumulate coffee stains, doughnut crumbs and margin notes.  If your business involves making or saving money on the Web, then you need this book.</span>

                    <span>As a practitioner of web analytics and process management I have almost always had to forage knowledge where there was often none.  Finally, a book arrives that neither dumbs down information nor makes it too simple for an experienced marketer. I think the author was most successful in providing the guts of web analytics to generalists, and practitioners alike while maintaining an almost journal like approach to providing details about improving web site performance -- from the preplanning stages - onward. That day-to-day perspective is helpful, as many books in the field of Internet Marketing are flat and anecdotal at best. I think this is a very welcome addition in the academic world of web analytics and is more than meaty enough to refer to often. There are clearly many years of insight that are  relevant to the work of the web here.</span>
