                <span id="Label1">Benjamin Franklin, writes journalist and biographer Walter Isaacson, was that rare Founding Father who would sooner wink at a passer-by than sit still for a formal portrait. What's more, Isaacson relates in this fluent and entertaining biography, the revolutionary leader represents a political tradition that has been all but forgotten today, one that prizes pragmatism over moralism, religious tolerance over fundamentalist rigidity, and social mobility over class privilege. That broadly democratic sensibility allowed Franklin his contradictions, as Isaacson shows. Though a man of lofty principles, Franklin wasn't shy of using sex to sell the newspapers he edited and published; though far from frivolous, he liked his toys and his mortal pleasures; and though he sometimes gave off a simpleton image, he was a shrewd and even crafty politician. Isaacson doesn't shy from enumerating Franklin&#146;s occasional peccadilloes and shortcomings, in keeping with the iconoclastic nature of our time--none of which, however, stops him from considering Benjamin Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age," and one of the most admirable of any era. And here&#146;s one bit of proof: as a young man, Ben Franklin regularly went without food in order to buy books. His example, as always, is a good one--and this is just the book to buy with the proceeds from the grocery budget. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The past few years have seen the publication of a number of excellent biographies of Revolutionary era and colonial Americans:  George Washington (Ellis), John Adams (McCollough), Alexander Hamilton (Chernow), Jonathon Edwards (Marsden), and this biography of Benjamin Franklin.  Although this work is well worth reading, I found it to be the least insightful of these, and I found Franklin to be the least likable of the subjects.
<br />
<br />After running away from home at 17, Franklin developed skills as a printer and eventually accumulated sufficient wealth to permit him to "retire" and pursue varied interests.  He became famous in colonial America and in Europe through his Poor Richard's Almanac and his discovery of electricity.  He would become a leader of the Revolutionary movement and a key advocate for the American cause in Europe.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, Franklin frequently comes across as an unprincipled self-promoter.  His recognition that prudent public relations could be more important than actual accomplishment (giving the "appearance of industriousness," as opposed to actually being industrious) sets him apart as a modern man in a sense that most before him were not.
<br />
<br />Isaacson's writing style lacks flourish, and the book drags on at times.  However, I would still recommend the book -- though I would read the others listed above first.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be entertaining and very easy to read. Franklins personality is brought to life both in his accomplishments and failures in his family life. I thought it was amazing how much one person could accomplish. The level of detail was exactly what I was looking for.</span>

                    <span>This reads like most history books: dry and boring. The only reason I actually finished the book, is because the author did do extensive research, which, despite the boring writing style, I was willing to suffer through to gain more knowledge and facts about B.F.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After reading Joseph Ellis' excellent book "Founding Brothers" where he describes Washington and Franklin as by far the most preeminant of the founding brothers in the mind's of their countrymen, I was eager to read more about Franklin to learn how he came to such stature. I then read Isaacson's account of Franklin's life and was severely disappointed, not with the subject, but with the author.
<br />
<br />Isaacson does a fair job in providing a reporter's account of Benjamin Franklin's life: he chronicles Franklin's exploits and works in exhaustive detail.  He did this, however, without bringing those details together to create a portrait of the man - this was left up to the reader.
<br />
<br />I enjoy history books where the author does his research, presents a thesis and then supports it through a mosaic of facts and events. Isaacson doesn't bother with these latter points, he merely regurgitates his research. If I wanted to read a collection of Poor Richard's writings or a detailed accounts of Franklin's scientific experiments I would have gotten a book on those subjects. I was expecting a portrait of the man and instead got a reporter's account of the events in Franklin's life.</span>

                    <span>I love biographies, however not when the facts are skewed in favor of the person being chronicled.  Even at his worse, the author has managed to justify Franklin's actions.  If you like rantings about every specific detail or want have your opinion about Franklin already made for you, then this book is for you.</span>
