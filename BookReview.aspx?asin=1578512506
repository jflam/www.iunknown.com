                <span id="Label1">In their previous book, <I>The Balanced Scorecard</I>, Robert Kaplan and David Norton unveiled an innovative "performance management system" that any company could use to focus and align their executive teams, business units, human resources, information technology, and financial resources on a unified overall strategy--much as businesses have traditionally employed financial management systems to track and guide their general fiscal direction. In <I>The Strategy-Focused Organization</I>, Kaplan and Norton explain how companies like Mobil, CIGNA, and Chemical Retail Bank have effectively used this approach for nearly a decade, and in the process present a step-by-step implementation outline that other organizations could use to attain similar results. Their book is divided into five sections that guide readers through development of a completely individualized plan that is created with "strategy maps" (graphical representations designed to clearly communicate desired outcomes and how they are to be achieved), then infused throughout the enterprise and made an integral part of its future. In several chapters devoted to the latter, for example, the authors show how their models have linked long-term strategy with day-to-day operational and budgetary management, and detail the "double loop" process for doing so, monitoring progress, and initiating corrective actions if necessary. --<I>Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>Having used the BSc a few times in my work, I expected this to be a hepful addition to my knowledge base in the area. I found that it added little to the author's other published tomes and to his articles in journals like HBR. Although the basic concept is sound, the implementation challenges are dealt with as you'd expect from an ivory tower-based profesoor and are several steps removed from the challenges that most of my real-world, and smaller company clients, need to address. I truly felt as though I didn't get my money's worth with this purchase and I should have stuck with the materials I already had by the author that was available in other forms. I would have saved time, money and a degree of frustration.</span>

If you can manage to stick with it, you will reap the benefits of the BSC.  Good Luck!</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, a much better publication than their first work.  While an understanding of 'the balanced scorecard' is going to be needed to make sense of this work I would suggest you find that in other than the authors' previous work.  There are a number of other better introductions.<br>Using the balanced scorecard to drive business strategy is the impetus for this book and, giving plenty of examples, the sheer strength of this approach is something everyone should consider.<br>Using this approach you can't help but to implement your strategy: now if there was only a way to guarantee we'd chosen the right strategy!!</span>
