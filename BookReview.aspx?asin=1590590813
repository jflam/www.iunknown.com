                    <span>Lynn T. Harrison, Introduction to 3D Game Engine Design in C# (Apress, 2003)
<br />
<br />The main problem with Lynn Harrison's book is that, well, the code doesn't compile. Which isn't his fault; Microsoft made some changes in the version of the DirectX Software Development Kit that came out just after the book's release that compromised the code. But nine months go by, and no code update? Not a promising sign.
<br />
<br />That aside, this is a lucid, easy-to-understand book about, well, 3D Game Engine design. There could have been clearer explanation in some places, and it should have been noted at the start that the book wouldn't be presenting the code in an order the reader could type it in himself (typing in book code will beat downloading it from the website, where learning is concerned, every time). But getting past those minor problems, this is a quite workable piece of writing, and anyone who's been programming in C# for a few months should know enough to get the hang of the basics, and be able to pick up the rest from the book itself. Recommended. *** Â½</span>

                    <span>This book is focused on "Introduction to Game Design" and uses the C# language and DirectX 9 technology to illustrate the samples.<p>This book does not teach C# nor does it provide sufficient DirectX programming concepts.<p>If you are looking for a book that provides a good overview of how a 3D Game Engine works from the developer-perspective then this book is for you.<p>For those looking for a pre-built game engine upon which to learn then I suggest that you look somewhere else.</span>

                    <span>Obviously Lynn put a lot of work into the application used as the foundation for this book but unfortunate he did not put as much time into the instructional aspect of the application. Perhaps a good book for someone experienced with Direct X programming and who just want to migrate over to C# but not for a Direct X programming novices.</span>

                    <span>I just browsed the book in a bookstore in California, and decided to order it from Amazon. However, I am very confused over the negative ratings here. I guess, we are all looking for different things, at different levels. I want to model physical objects, like cars, and show how they move in a 3D-world. My idea is that the best way to get a better understanding of cars and the laws of physics in 3 dimensions, is to develop a program for it! I think this is more fun than any other kind of programming. This book will suit me well. Perfect for my level.</span>

                    <span>I didn't expect this book to teach me C# or DirectX, so no worries there.<p>The book, along with the code that you have to download from apress, shows how to design & code a game engine. Actually, it's pretty weak on the design, since there are NO diagrams, and very little doc in the code, to help me understand what I'm reading. No explanation of relationships between the various objects & classes. What's especially confusing is trying to find methods that are called by the sample code. Is the method in a base class? Do I need to override it? Is it in another object that I have to write...? If there's one thing that might save this book, it would be more diagrams, such as UML.<p>After reading Chapter 1 and its code (which calls game engine methods but doesn't explain them), I had to download the code and go through it line by line. I wrote out the method calls by hand, and now I finally understand the high-level structure of the engine and the sample game. But that doesn't even include AI, input, lighting, sound, and how game objects are organized inside the engine. I guess I've got my work cut out for me.</span>
