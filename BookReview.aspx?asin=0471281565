                    <span>George Eckes has written a concise, thorough introduction to the theory and practice of Six Sigma, the management philosophy that Jack Welch called the most important initiative of his entire career at General Electric. The book provides a look at every aspect of Six Sigma. In some places, it seems a bit too detailed for so short a book - particularly when the author introduces the variety of statistical charts, graphs and tables used in the analysis phase of Six Sigma. But that is a quibble. Eckes also gets a bit self-serving when, in the question and answer chapter, he takes a swipe at consultants who agree to work on a contingency basis, for a percentage of the savings a client achieves, instead of for a fee. In fact, we, where we are always glad to avoid a squabble, note that managers who use this book may achieve some level of business improvement without hiring any consultants at all.</span>

                    <span>Just finish reading this book. Good introduction-level material on the Six Sigma topic. This is not to say that the book is superficial or obvious. The book takes a logical cook-book approach to explane Six Sigma and how to implement a Six Sigma effort. If you are a manager that wants to understand Six Sigma and the esstntial elements of a Six Sigma program, this book is a good start. I really liked the section on the 10 Common questions about Six Sigma. However, if you want examples of detailed statistical models and metrics, then look elsewhere.</span>
