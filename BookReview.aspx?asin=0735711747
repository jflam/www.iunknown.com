                    <span>After reading some other books on the topic, I got the impression that some of these authors are so intellectual (or trying so hard to be), that they forget the fact that 99% of the world is simple, uninterested, and in a hurry. In this book, John captures and analyzes what it is that stimulates the average mind. He challenges you to understand the people that realistically you aim to target as a web designer. Today after reading this book, I feel like a more cognizant, perceptive person as it relates to what it is that makes me click - no pun intended.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Lenker has done an excellent job of bringing to the forefront an issue that has begun to plague many otherwise well-intentioned Web sites: the focus on usabilty as the exclusive barometer of Web site design success. As a Web designer/producer, I applaud his efforts to keep usability in perspective with the other important attributes of a well-designed user experience.<br>I did find the book a little difficult to read because of its formatting, but I appreciate the reinforcement of 'visitor experience' based on more than usability that Mr. Lenker provides.</span>

                    <span>This book is not one that is easily read. The pages are heavily designed graphic design treats, but the text and the messages play second fiddle to the layouts, distracting full color background images, and other visually focused entertainments and explorations. This book perhpas makes for a coffee table book, or a book to flip through to find ocassional inspiration, but not much more. The written ideas are lost in the visuals.</span>

                    <span>......or is it? After all, one design firm they profile in this book already went defunct. At least the book has the honesty to tell you that upfront.<p>Actually, I've been waiting for a book like this for some time. In my 6+ years of designing sites and 5+ years of doing Flash, I always try to stray away from the cookie-cutter, portal, hit-em-over-the-head approach so many websites try to do ala Yahoo. Considering the city where I currently call home, New Orleans, isn't the most sophisticated and well-educated city going, you can imagine how so many people here get so confused going to sites like that. Instead, I try to sell each individual website as an experience in which you really do feel like you're part of the atmosphere that the client is trying to produce with the brand.<p>TOT effectively explains this in full detail. Promoting simplicity in most cases over the whack-a-mole approach or the extreme simplicity (read: usability) of Nielsen. Kind of interesting then that Lenker bashes Nielsen BUT praises his partner in crime for actually figuring it out.<p>While definitely not your typical web design book (you won't learn Flash or Dreamweaver here.) The book is loaded with lots of inspirational sites and ideas to reinvigorate your mind better than any can of Red Bull could ever do. (Personally, I prefer 180 over Red Bull. 180's got a better orang-y taste....oh wait.....this isn't epicurious.com now is it?) I thoroughly enjoyed the book and i think it'll definitely get people talking.<p>Now let's just hope these ideas won't make us as bankrupt as Amtrak is........</span>

                    <span>The best pieces of work in art, music and literature always stir extremely strong emotions in people.  An audience's reception to the 'New' is always varied, as understanding and preconceptions (in the case of 'Train of Thoughts', the way in which we view and understand the web experience) are challenged.  This is nothing but a good thing.<p>Instead of advocating archaic rules and conventions that are merely reactionary to the mistakes made in the last few years, 'Train of Thoughts' takes steps to review and proactively improve/expand upon the manner in which we communicate and do business on the web in the future. The views here are a world away from Nielsen et al - and as such are extremely valuable for at the very least providing balance to the usability argument, and at the most, changing your perception of what is and isn't a good website and providing you with new ways to approach your work.<p>I have been in the web industry in the UK for 6 years now, and I have a constant battle to change perceptions in people - both within the company I work for, and in clients (potential and existing) of the company I work for. This book is going to be a great help to me in changing those perceptions.<p>Whether you agree with John Lenker's views or not (for the record - I do), this is a fantastic book that every web professional whether design or business focused (or both) should read.</span>
