                    <span>Hello, Everyone. First, we thank all of you for the generally positive comments about our book. We worked hard to bring you a book of high quality and are still alive.
<br />
<br />I wish to point out that the nature of this project was to provide a solid framework that, initially, was aimed at helping our readers to learn the issues involved in developing serious web applications. Think of Slither as a web framework aimed at being understood pedagogically, similar to what Minix aimed to do for teaching/learning operating systems.
<br />
<br />That said, a number of things have changed since we wrote the book. All of our day jobs became more demanding, similar to what's going on in much of the US workforce. We are committed to evolving Slither (the framework described in our book) and look forward to involving others in the project via our new home on SourceForge. A new release is already in the planning stages, which we hope will make Slither one of the best web programming frameworks ever--especially for Python programmers!
<br />
<br />For those who wish to grab the latest code, please visit the Slither project at SourceForge. We do not post URLs due to Amazon's guidelines.</span>

                    <span>Talk about a sleeper! This book may be one of the best kept secrets in the world of Web programming books. It could be described as Web programming with Python and Open Source tools. In the hands of most authors, this much breadth would produce a multi-volume set of books complete with material that could readily be found elsewhere. The reader is fortunate that it was written and edited by educators who know how to present the pertinent and relevant details of the OS, the Shell, the Python language, Apache, SQL. Lesser books give you the world but require the reader to determine what is relevant and how to use the features described. The manuscript is original and efficient; definitely not a regurgitation of material available on the Web. The advanced sections pertaining to the development of an application server are rich with good programming methodologies. However, some chapters may be exceedingly routine for intermediate and/or advanced server-side programmers. The book could be described as a "LAMP" developer guide for novices (where the P stands for Python not Perl). 
<br />
<br />A previous reviewer cited some typos. In an effort to keep that comment in perspective, I believe the number of errors for this amount of breadth + depth is very low. </span>

                    <span>This book had the right idea and its basic outline was well thought out. But when I tried some of the examples I found too many errors. There is no web site support for the errors in the code examples, or exercises by the author or publisher.  So you are on your own.<br>In all fairness, the book contains a good presentation to Python, Linux and MySQL, and a good basic explanation of the Internet, Apache and CGI.  However, I think most of us learn best by trying out the exercises after reading the theory, and it is here where the book is weak.  Because there are too few complete exercises, many errors, no errata, and lack of web support I cannot recommend this book.  Also, some of the exercises require the "Slither" libraries, which do not seem to be supported any longer.  Furthermore, I haven't been able to find a place to download the code in this book.</span>

                    <span>This book covers everything about getting a web application together. If you accept the Python Way, (a wise idea I think) you could look at the book as an attempted successor to Lincoln Stein's original compendium about how to serve web applications from top to bottom.<p>If you're a person who knows something about programming in general but not enough about programming for the web in specific, this book is just the thing to help you identify and fill in the gaps.<p>I do have a complaint that the writing could have been a bit smoother and the editing a bit more careful. <p>A far more serious flaw, though, is the authors' failure to keep the software framework on which the book is based up-to-date. The upshot is that while the book is very informative, it's unfortunately quite a slog getting the examples working.<p>While I recommend the book for its explanatory power, unfortunately it doesn't provide a direct path to getting your project online. If the framework were better maintained and documented, this could still turn out to be the only book you need.</span>

                    <span>This books was a major disappointment. The ideas seem pretty solid, but the book no longer matches the code that is available online. The downloads are a mess. The book says to install slither using the instructions in the download, but there are no instructions in the download. Two users posted requests over a year ago for these instructions and the requests were totally ignored. In fact not much has happened over the past year. It really seems as if the authors have moved on. Slither seems to be dead.<p>On another note - this book is very academic. For example, there is a couple of pages of discussion about the different theorectical ways to design databases. But my needs are so simple, that I already knew I was going to use MySQL, so I just did not care about this discussion. Unfortunately there are lots of discussions like that in this book. So if you just wanna get something done fast, this might not be the book for you.</span>
