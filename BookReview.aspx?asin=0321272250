                    <span>I bought this book a few months ago when I was still a beginner and I have picked up a great deal from it.  Most of the lessons revolve around making ads for the printed media.  What I love about this book is that each lesson is step by step and practical.  As the previous reviewers mentioned, it is not for the advanced student.  But if you are new to Photoshop and want to build a strong base, this is the book to get.  Scott Kelby has a talent for making this package easy to learn.  I even like his magazine where new techniques in Photoshop are introduced.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>My first book on Photoshop was one of Scott Kelby's Down and Dirty books. And while it didn't teach me an awful lot about the inner workings of Photoshop, it did get me hooked with a lot really quick and simple "wow, I made this" experiences.
<br />
<br />Today I revisited Scott Kelby in the shape of his Photoshop Classic Effects. I must say that was a bit of a disappointment. Not only was there absolutely nothing to learn for this Photoshop user, but the tutorials were more or less updated versions of the old ones in my Down & Dirty book. I suspect Scott Kelby only has this same set of tutorials/effects and more or less reuse them in each of his books. I for one, already have my Scott Kelby book, so I will stay clear of his stuff in the future. It goes without saying that none of these effects are terribly new, or couldn't be found elsewhere on Photoshop tutorial sites on the net.
<br />
<br />If you are a brand new to Photoshop or anything below intermediate user, this is still a good book to get, granted the above caveat. Do however realise that it is heavily slanted towards the kinds of work you'd do in advertising, and Photoshop is used in so many other avenues, but if that is your game, then it is a fine book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I only really learnt a few cool effects from this book. If you've been using photoshop for a while and this is not your first cookbook, then there are far too many common effects (I don't blame the author, that is the topic of this book after all! Classic effects are, after all, everywhere.) that you will come across. The author doesn't always take the route that is in my opinion correct (for example, very often he tells you to delete pixels, when you could just as easily mask it out instead, even though your file will be larger, you havent lost those precious pixels!!)
<br />But in my opinion, if you've picked up a cookbook-like photoshop effects book before, then be careful, this one might not be too useful. If you haven't and you just love all these cool effects, thne go right ahead, you will enjoy ;)</span>

                    <span>This book centers around Photoshop techniques for ad work. These include billboards, letterhead, DVD boxes and the like. The techniques covered include photo manipulation, typography work, and completely artificial drawings. The author does a good job of explaining each design step-by-step and making it all very easy to follow. The designs are pretty slick and there are some good ideas to borrow there outside of the context of learning about Photoshop.</span>

                    <span>I have 9 different photoshop books, four of them are from Scott Kelby.  Scott is definitely a Photoshop God. His books are easy to follow with step by step instruction.  This book contains many classic effects that we see in advertisement today.  This is a must have for a photoshop user at any level.</span>
