                    <span>Final Cut Express by Tom Wolsky takes you from installation of the software through practical application of the computer interface, with all the confidence of his many years of professional editing. The novice video editor will find that they can learn many techniques of using this non-linear software and will develope a trust in the author as he takes them through these steps with success. His ability to teach you will be measured by your rapid command of Final Cut Express. Advanced techniques are covered, too. These are covered in detail, like no other manual. There are many insights and discoveries offered by the author's intimate knowledge of the software, and editing in general, that will instill confidence. Tom is the official "Helper" for Apple's Final Cut Express Discussion Site. The kindness and generosity he shows at this web site show through in Final Cut Express Editing Workshop. For many, Final Cut Express will be an intimidating and challenging software application. Look to this book to learn the application. This IS the book that should have come with the software.</span>

                    <span>If you're only planning to buy one Final Cut Express (FCE) book, buy Tom Wolsky's "Final Cut Express Editing Worship." If your planning to buy TWO FCE books, buy TWO copies of Mr. Wolsky's book.<P>Okay, you probably don't need to buy two copies, but once you've read this book and worked your way through the tutorials, you will have mastered FCE and won't need of any other guides for working with this powerful program. If you ARE intent on buying a second book, buy something that deals with the art of film making instead.<P>I give this book 5 stars for two reasons: First, it covers everything about FCE and is packed full of hints and tricks that will greatly improve your productivity and the quality of your work. Second, Mr. Wolsky covers all of FCE's facets from beginning to end in a manner that's logical, easy to follow, and he writes in a casual prose that gives you the feeling that your best friend (who also happens to be a genius) is sitting next to you, gently guiding you through the entire process.<P>My only regret is that this book wasn't available BEFORE I worked on my first couple of projects. Take my advice, buy this book and work through it before you take on your first project. You'll be glad you did.</span>

                    <span>I made the switch from iMovie3 to FCE. I was very happy with iMovie2; but upgraded to enjoy the added features. I became very frustrated with the bugs. I now realize that I was expecting too much-my projects were becoming more complex than iMovie3 could manage. <P>The power of FCE is far far far superior to iMovie. I realized that I had not made an "upgrade"; I had changed to a very different application. The learning curve was steep. I needed a private tutor. Once this book (with DVD / DVD ROM) had arrived, I felt like I had that private tutor AND a reference.<P>If you're moving up to Final Cut Express: (1) order Tom Wolsky's Book, Final Cut Express Editing Workshop when you order FCE. (2) Watch the DVD where Tom tells us iMovie users what we need to know. (3) Read the first 2 lessons before you install FCE. (4) Be prepared to say, "I can't believe this Final Cut is so powerful" every time Tom teaches you something new as you go through his very well written tutorial.</span>

                    <span>At last, here is a book on FCE that gets you up and running with tutorial materials and an instructor who really knows his stuff. Tom Wolsky is a long time veteran in film and video production (nearly 40 years), brings years of experience working for ABC news into his current profession as a Final Cut teacher at Stanford University, and has established a solid curriculum with his titles on Final Cut Pro which in turn have been distilled into the first real title which sits one down and TEACHES Final Cut Express.<P>With the help of tutorial materials on the supplied disc (which you need a DVD rom to access, by the way), you are given sample clips to import, slice, dice, edit and organize into full blown projects as Mr. Wolsky leads you through 11 fast-paced yet comprehensive lessons in video production. I had previously purchased the Visual Quickstart and Dummies books for FCE, both of which explained in their way what the program could do, but don't really teach it. I felt like I understood more about it in the first three chapter/lessons in this title than in both of those other books combined. That's what I get for being impatient.<P>Also on the DVD is an in-depth look at working in Final Cut vs. iMovie, which made me glad I didn't get too used the lesser program; as Wolsky puts it, it's like the difference between an automatic and a stick shift car, with the added benefit of Final Cut's non-destructive process.<P>So if you're ready to get serious with your video, and want to start learning Final Cut Express with hands-on projects that will have you actually understanding the program as you go, you can't go wrong with this title, especially at such a low price compared to other such books. Highly recommended for the serious novice videophile!</span>

I recommend this to anyone who is comfortable with FCE, but still interested in learning all of the tricks.</span>
