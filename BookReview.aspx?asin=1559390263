                    <span>I was glad to find J. Powers' comprehensive explanation of Tibetan Buddhism. It was both technically informative and colorful. I enjoyed the detail on the discovery of the reincarnated Dalai Lama; the testing of the 2-year-old boy by the disguised monks. Tibetan Buddhism can be confusing and arcane, and a book like this was needed. My only complaint: Powers' use of female pronouns throughout the book is offputting to a male reader; slightly bizzare. Buddhism was founded by a male, developed by men, and has attracted men for aeons. A feminist agenda in work of this weight (even twisting the conventions of literature) is misplaced and gives to the text a triteness.</span>

                    <span>This book is not a good "Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism." It<BR>took me about one month to read the book. It is 500 pages.<BR>The author uses big words. There is great detail. For an <BR>intro to Tibetan Buddhism, buy "Open Heart, Clear Mind" by<BR>Thubten Chodron. I learned a lot from this "Comprehensive <BR>Guide to Tibetan Buddhism." But I have read thirty or forty<BR>books on the subject. And this is still a HEAVY meal. If<BR>you do want to really know about Tibetan Buddhism in an<P>"intermediate" fashion, then please buy and read the book.<BR>You will learn a lot. I was dissapointed to learn that one of the Dali Lama's was a romantic poet and womanizer who did<BR>very little spiritual practice! And that the Chinese organized<BR>massive "gang rapes" in order to subjagate the Tibetan people.<BR>So I learned a lot. But I still wished that there was less detail and more clarity. The meal is just too big. I'll state it once more. Buy and read this book if you want a comprehensive text on Tibetan Buddhism. Thank You.</span>

                    <span>I couldn't give it 5 stars simply becuase I haven't yet finished reading it. I borrowed this book from the library and couldn't finish it in the lending period (it's big!), so I'm now online buying the book. <P>What I've read is extrememly well-written and interesting, not of a textbook style at all. It explains Tibetan philosophy in a very accessible way.<P>I reccommend it for anyone interested in Tibet or Buddhism.</span>
