                    <span>I heartily concur with the reviewer who castigated the publishers for going to press too early to include the 2002 World Series and, what is more important, the midterm election results. The latter omission makes the almanac's list of the year's biggest news stories strange indeed: surely the fact that for the first time in a half century Republicans will have full control of both Congress and the White House is noteworthy. Is the almanac's mission to record the major events of the year, or is it to beat its competitors to the newsstands and book racks? This is cynical and shoddy publishing.</span>

                    <span>I recently bought a copy of "The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2003" for my workplace, and the book has gotten a lot of use. It's both a practical source of useful information and a fun thing to read in spare minutes.<P>The book reviews the top news stories of 2002, and includes coverage of the war on terrorism. There is a chronology covering 11 Oct. 2001 to 15 Oct 2002. The almanac is packed full of data in many categories: the U.S. government, arts and the media, awards, languages, religions, astronomy, nations of the world, etc. To make the book easy to use there is not only a one-page quick reference index and a more extensive general index, but also a quick thumb index on the back cover.<P>So if you want to know the salary of the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, the name of the winner of the 1918 Pulitzer Prize in poetry, the surface area of the island of Elba, the number of Buddhists in Europe, or a huge number of other global facts, you've come to the right source.</span>

                    <span>The World Almanac is the standard. Every year it's got all the information you need: economic statistics, historical data, states and presidents and sports. It's great again this year, except that the publishers rushed it to print and ignored the 2002 Congressional elections. Election data, state-by-state returns, are one of the key attractions of the Almanac, so this is a sore disappointment. Suggest that future readers, before buying, check to see if it covers the elections returns. If not, give it a pass.</span>

                    <span>I love the World Almanac. I buy one every year and have done so since 1985. I look at my collection as a solid historical archive. That said, I am very disappointed that the publishers chose to rush to the bookstore and ignored two very important stories that typically occur at the end of each year. The World Series is completely missing, much to my chagrin, since my beloved Angels finally won the title. I guess I'll have to wait until next year to read about it. And, of course, the U.S. Congressional elections. No matter what your political leanings, a GOP majority in all branches is news.<P>When I think of the World Almanac, I don't think hot of the presses up to the second sound bites. I think of it as a long term archived historical record. I would be more than willing to wait another six weeks to get a FULL review of the year, rather than suffer with a "downsized" version just to get the book out sooner. For instant news, I'll go to the internet. For the long view, I need the Almanac.<P>I will continue to purchase the World Almanac every year, and I sincerely hope that the publishers reconsider their schedule.</span>
