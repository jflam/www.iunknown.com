                    <span>Largely an exploration of mathematically-based games and puzzles, what makes this book work is how Poundstone can breeze a reader through them, then instantly say "Aha! Isn't this exactly like Political/Business/Interpersonal Situation X?" to put them in the proper focus. I found this book through a political science class of all places, and it fits beautifully there, exploring the nature of alliances, trust, subterfuge, and competition. If you've ever seen the emotions that can come from trying to win a simple game like Risk or Monopoly, or watching a competitive show like Survivor, you can see how Yugoslavia/Enron/elections/whatever-disaster-du-jour can be understood along the same principles. Poundstone is a mathematician, but he keeps it simple and light, yet relevant. </span>

                    <span>This book does introduce game theory and prisoner's dilemma , but first and formemost and primarily this is a book about John Von Neumann. 
<br />It was very interesting to go through the details of Neuman's personality as described in this book. Being a student of computer science , i was already aware of the great influence that he had on the computer architecture revolution.
<br />But what was new to me was that how great a mathematician and how big a genius he was . He truly was a gifted man. During his days of illness , he was quite afraid of death and what was humbling for me is that every man how great or ordinary has to approach death similarly and even has similar insecurities and apprehensions about what would happen to him after death.
<br />a good read for someone who wants to get introduced to game theory and know about some of cold war history , but even a better  reading for someone who wants to know about John Von Neuman .. the man.</span>

                    <span>Writing a review in 2004 about this book is superfluous. I was reminded how this work has entered the lexicon of contemporary thinking while attending a conference on education recently. Prisoner's Dilemma was cited by three speakers from the diverse fields of literary criticism, physics, and medicine. I could only smile at the assured understanding this book made possible. 
<br />
<br />William Poundstone writes clearly on the history and theoretical backbone of game theory and cooperation. I credit his work with making it possible for those three speakers to elaborate on their work and my ability to understand them and see the connections.
<br />
<br />Needless to say, I recommend this book to anyone (and everyone) who finds themselves with a dilemma.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book. One of the best I have ever read in my life. While you read it you get so many ideas about life, research, people...For me, as a doctoral student making a thesis on  multicriterion optimization, it is a revelation.
<br />I highly recommend it to everyone, since it is not a technical book, but written with ease for a layman. For the people in the business of decision making, I bet that you will be amazed with the impressions you get from it.</span>

                    <span>This book was a very good discussion of game theory and Prisoner's Dilemma type games.  It was interesting to see how so many real-life situations and conflicts can be reduced down to variations on some pretty basic games.  I only wish the book didn't keep returning to the atomic bomb and the arms race so frequently.  The point was made early.. and often.</span>
