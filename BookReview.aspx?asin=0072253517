                    <span>The title says it all. Well there's one additional tidbit of information that's important, there are 1200 pages in this book. In 1200 pages you can include a lot of things. You can include 300 pages on SQL for instance. And some of the new subjects like the new sections on The Grid (that's the g in 10g) are covered here for the first time. 
<br />
<br />The Grid is coming, as of yet it's just getting started, but in the next edition of this book it'll be a hundred pages, if it isn't a whole book in itself. 
<br />
<br />As an Oracle professional, at almost any level from developing an application, to tuning the performance, to security, to 'simple' things like installation, this is the one book you need to have on your desk ready for immediate use. 
<br />
<br />After this, it's kind of hard to say much about this book. You may want individual books on tuning or security or whatever if that is your primarily responsibility, but here in one volume is the basic for the whole thing.</span>

                    <span>It didn't seem possible that Mr. Loney could surpass the excellence of his previous books, but I have found "10g: The Complete Reference" to be the most comprehensive and well-written Oracle book on the market today. Most of 10g's new features are complex and can be misapplied if not understood thoroughly. Mr. Loney provides DBAs and developers with clean, concise writing and relevant examples that allow developers and DBAs to exploit the new features of Oracle 10g quickly and appropriately. The beginning sections on Oracle fundamentals should be required reading for all Oracle professionals. His wealth of experience is evident throughout the book. Indispensable for anyone serious about developing or managing Oracle databases.</span>
