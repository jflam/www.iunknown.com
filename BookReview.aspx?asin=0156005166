                    <span>Don't expect this book to teach you how to score games. The book lacks a full-size sample scorecard to use, which I would have liked. It doesn't go into enough detail about scoring; being a beginner I was flummoxed attempting to score double-switches, bunts and teams batting around in an inning. It will get you going, but if you're like me and don't know how to score a game yet, you'll be looking for more. That aside, the anecdotes and illustrations make this a fun book to read. The subtitle "How Scoring the Game Influenced and Enhanced the History of Baseball" is an accurate description of the gist of the book. It's less of a how-to and more of a why-to.</span>

                    <span>... I bought this book when I became my son's youth leagueasst. coach/scorekeeper. The advice that scorekeeping can become individualized to suit the needs of the scorekeeper and team led me to incorporate several techniques and created what I think was more interesting and revealing portrait a game on the page. This book reveals the many ways of keeping score and the true reason for the existence, to recreate the game on paper. The author offers baseball history and many interesting and funny anecdotes (LL Bean devised a scorekeeping method). Well illustrated, a must for all baseball fans.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the very best book out there about scoring, and aptly titled, because after I read this book I have become fascinated with scoring (maybe a little too much??). The author clearly loves the game and gives you lots of reasons to love it yourself. <BR>The book's thoroughness is both its strength and weakness. There is only a small section that gives you a clear mandate on how to score. But the rest of the book is just plain chock full of suggestions and variations, from simple to being able to recreate the game pitch-by-pitch, but you have to read the whole book to get all of them. This also makes it hard to find something you remember from past readings. There is an index to help out, though. <BR>Overall, a great book that truly embraces the joy of scoring, and has dozens of styles that you can choose to use when you score. He leaves it up to you to pick your own style.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately, I purchased this book looking for detailed instructions on how to keep score. While there is a section for this, it's very brief and did not suit my needs. 4 stars however, for the informative history of scorekeeping. Very interesting and entertaining to read.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the reviews already written. This is a nice book and reasonably priced, but not fully satisfying. It is an outline for an outstanding book, but it is not itself outstanding. Use it as a mid-winter meditation on the game or lend it to friends who don't understand why you bring pencil and paper to the ballpark.</span>
