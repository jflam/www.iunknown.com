                <span id="Label1">A rich, colorful history of California centering on the untold story of America 's biggest farmer, J.G. Boswell, who controls more than $1 billion worth of water rights and real estate in the heart of the state. <P> J.G. Boswell is the biggest farmer in America. Over the past fifty years he has built a secret empire while thumbing his nose at nature, politicians, labor unions and every journalist who ever tried to lift the veil on the ultimate "factory in the fields." Now eighty years old, with an almost pathological bent toward privacy, Boswell has spent the past few years confiding one of the great stories of the American West to Mark Arax and Rick Wartzman. <I>The King of California</I> is the previously untold account of how a Georgia slave-owning family migrated to California in the early 1920s, drained one of America 's biggest lakes in an act of incredible hubris and carved out the richest cotton empire in the world. Indeed, the sophistication of Boswell 's agricultural operation--from lab to field to gin--is unrivaled anywhere. <P> Much more than a business story, this is a sweeping social history that details the saga of cotton growers who were chased from the South by the boll weevil and brought their black farmhands to California. It is a gripping read with cameos by a cast of famous characters, from Cecil B. DeMille to Cesar Chavez.</span>

                    <span>I read this book to learn more about the history of water brokerage in California. Though I am a conservationist with a strongly liberal bent, the blatantly liberal bias of these authors tainted the credibility of an otherwise incredible book. Despite the obvious efforts to cast the Boswells in a negative light, the strengths and achievements of the family rise above the bias to make a stronger case for themselves than would be if the book were penned on neutral ground.<P>The Boswell story is worthy of an Ayn Rand novel. The environmental, agricultural, political, and social impacts of this family boggle the imagination. The hubris is 100% American born and bred. To say this book is about cotton farming is to say Moby Dick is a book about whaling. It is a read of tremendous scope.<P>Parts of the book are undeniably ponderous and written in a stop and start fashion. Details are thick and mundane in some places while sketchy and needing in others. Regardless, it is a fascinating and well-researched work. The King of California is a book worth reading and worthy of being studied by every student of California history and culture. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Mark Arax and Rick Wartzman have compiled and written a wonderfully comprehensive book on the struggle between man and nature as well as on man and the political machine. The story of J.G. Boswell and the taking of Tulare Lake is nothing short of an incredible tale of how a family of humble beginnings could become the largest farming operation in the United States. Arax and Wartzman are to be congratulated for their survival through years of research and writing of a book that will remain a classic of California history for years to come. Seen by many who are connected with the Boswell empire as a threat, the book lays out the details of how the company systematically gained thousands of acre feet of water rights in a drought-threatened San Joaquin Valley. It is a well rounded book telling a fantastic true story. The Boswell company should be proud of their success as should Mark and Rick in theirs. Booksellers in the San Joaquin Valley can't keep it in stock and have sold thousands of copies to local residents. It is a story that people want to know about.</span>

                    <span>King Of California is the true story of J.G. Boswell and a strong history of early California politics. King Of California tells the elusive story of a farmer who thumbed his nose at nature, politicians and reporters alike - one who owned more agricultural acreage and river water than any other land baron in the West. Boswell's story embraces the growth and history of California and is packed from cover to cover with historical drama and insights.</span>

                    <span>Excellent history of the Boswell family. Very interesting reading. The authors described many technical aspects of production agriculture in suprising detail considering that they are reporters and not agriculture specialists. <BR>Anyone involved in farm management, agriculture economics, environmental management or agricultural water management will enjoy reading this book.</span>
