                    <span>This is a very comprehensive guide to Joshua Tree for climbers. It is the book that we always take with us as the defintive reference. Generally, the information is accurate and the maps detailing which rock is which in various formations is quite good.<P>However, there are several notable drawbacks to the book. First - the routes often have no description of them or any guidance as to the trad gear needed for a given route. Second, many of the routes for some areas do not appear in the pictures making route finding without a good desription, difficult. Third, descent information is often not found or has to be interpreted.<P>It may sound like there are major faults with the book, but in reality it is a good book that is very useful. Just don't expect it to tell you everything you need to know about a given crag.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for the comprehensive catalog to Joshua Tree climbs, look no further. Author Randy Vogel has undertaken a huge task in compiling over 4,000 routes for the Park. The downside is that the route descriptions are very, often too, concise. For example, "Walk on the Wild Side", one of the best moderate climbs in Joshua Tree has the following "description": <P>"WALK ON THE WILD SIDE 5.7+ ****". <P>For a first-timer, this description lacks the necessary detail to be complete. Is this a bolted or trad route? How many pitches? Do I repell off or walk off? Are there bolted anchors? What gear should I bring?<P>I've found that using this book in conjunction with climbingjtree.com (which includes color pictures and user-submitted commentary along with detailed route descriptions and gear suggestions) to be the best of both worlds!</span>

                    <span>The comprehensive Joshua Tree Guide set a new standard for use of graphics, protection and quality ratings. More maps and photos than any guide ever published. Some of the best maps I've ever used, which is a real plus in an area like this where you could get hopelessly lost. The only minus is no first ascent information.</span>

                    <span>This thick guidebook has every area covered in Joshua Tree. There are no descriptions of the routes, but you can't expect that with the sheer number covered. Topos of most of the routes show bolts and sometimes gear sizes are included. The protection ratings are not given, i.e. G,PG,R,X. If you want just a basic source with everything in it, get this guide. I'd recommend getting the individual areas covered by Alan Bartlett's series, he has detailed descriptions of the routes for each area covered.</span>
