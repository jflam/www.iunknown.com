                    <span>If you have read any other works by Bill Givens, then there probably isn't much to say here. Son of Film Flubs is surely set to be a classic. After reading this book I was amazed at just how many mistakes there are in films out there. If you think that after you read this book you can simply put it on the shelf, you are grossly mistaken. This book will be a point of reference for you for many years to come. This is surely a hand-me-down for the kids. As long as there are movies there will be a need for this book and others like it. You will learn much as to how you will ever view another movie again. This is "GREAT" entertainment for the kids, family, and all of your friends. You will find this book to be very informative. I have rated this book with the highest 5 star rating due to my placing this book under a "G" rating and would have no problem reading this book with my kids. This is not just a book, it's an adventure in human life and our desires to be the best. It's kind of hard however to hide your mistakes with Bill around. Bill, keep up the good work. Thank You and don't ever stop.</span>
