                <span id="Label1"><div>John McPhee's twenty-sixth book is a braid of personal history, natural history, and American history, in descending order of volume. Each spring, American shad-Alosa sapidissima-leave the ocean in hundreds of thousands and run heroic distances upriver to spawn.<br><br>McPhee--a shad fisherman himself--recounts the shad's cameo role in the lives of George Washington and Henry David Thoreau. He fishes with and visits the laboratories of famous ichthyologists; he takes instruction in the making of shad darts from a master of the art; and he cooks shad in a variety of ways, delectably explained at the end of the book. Mostly, though, he goes fishing for shad in various North American rivers, and he "fishes the same way he writes books, avidly and intensely. He wants to know everything about the fish he's after--its history, its habits, its place in the cosmos" (Bill Pride, <i>The Denver Post</i>).  His adventures in pursuit of shad occasion the kind of writing--expert and ardent--at which he has no equal.<br></div></span>

                    <span>John McPhee has written numerous pieces for _The New Yorker_ and over a score of books on such subjects as oranges, canoes, and geology. His wide range of interests now centers on an object of personal obsession; in _The Founding Fish_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux) he tells us about his own passion for fishing for shad. As you might expect, he can't help but tell us a lot more, about history, ecology, and human oddities. If you don't know about shad, and even if you don't know about fishing, and don't care to know about it, you won't feel alienated away from these pages, which contain McPhee's fine prose and wry humor. (For instance, he is surprised to find a snake in his net: "I lack the sense of companionship that some people seem to have with snakes.") Shad is worth knowing about, it turns out, and so is McPhee, who has seldom put himself as a character in his own books.<P>Of course, there is much advice about fishing for shad, which seem to be a particularly elusive fish. McPhee quotes extensively from his fishing diaries, and starts his book with a funny description of an epic battle with a shad on the Delaware River starts. McPhee has seventy feet of six-pound test line "suddenly pulled by a great deal more than the current." The battle goes on for pages and pages, eventually ending in the netting of a 4 3/4 pound shad. A fighting fish, to be sure. Or a clumsy angler. Shad is not an endangered species, but of course they have been affected by the humans changing their waters. Beside the problem of pollution, there are thousands of dams on rivers that used to present only milder natural obstacles for the returning fish. Some of the dams are, surprisingly, coming down, and McPhee takes us to a dam-removing ceremony. As the title implies, shad have played a role in American history. George Washington seined for shad on the Potomac. He didn't eat them; only one shad bone has turned up in the excavation of his garbage pit at Mount Vernon (and McPhee can't help an interesting digression upon "archaeozoology"). His slaves got them, and he used shad as a fertilizer. Despite the legend, his men at Valley Forge were not saved from starvation by a providential, unseasonal run of shad up the Schuylkill River. Thoreau worried about shad in their thousands meeting a new commercial dam, and wrote the lament, "Poor shad! where is thy redress?" Thoreau advised the fish, "Keep a stiff fin and stem all the tides thou mayst meet." Words to live by.<P>Once again, McPhee has picked an unlikely subject and made everything about it vivid, interesting, and important. If you fish, you will love this book. If you don't fish, here is a book to give you an idea about why intelligent fishermen go about their often frustrating hobby with such evident pleasure. _The Founding Fish_ is a delightful small encyclopedia on everything connected with shad.</span>

                    <span>Joh McPhee creates a masterpiece here writing a book that follows the oldest fishery in the United States. Long before George Washington first cast his seine for American shad, native Americans no doubt enjoyed these tasty fish that obligingly swam up the rivers each spring. McPhee takes us on a journey up and down the East Coast of North America in search of this ancient fish. Along the way we talk to guides, local commercial anglers, noted biologists, and expert historians to learn all about American shad and the impact this species has had on society from the earliest colonial days up until the present. We trace the life history of the shad as life begins in the nursery waters of the great eastern rivers in North America. We follow the young as they head to the ocean at the end of their first summer. We learn about the life of shad in the oceans, and we stand with the anglers, hip-deep in the waters of the shad's natal rivers, as they wait to cast to the mature adults struggling upstream to begin the cycle again.<P>This is a wonderful book, full of lively stories and interesting information. It combines fisheries science, sociology, history, and angling advice in a broad colorful tapestry that transcends normal "fish books." This is a book that will appeal to people from all walks of life, because it approaches the subject from so many angles. In a way, to know the American shad and its story is to know America. As the founding fathers struggled to hammer out a new country and defend it from strife both within and without, the founding fish- the American shad- and the lucrative fisheries that built up around it were inextricably interwoven with everyday life. Although we came close to destroying these wonderful fish through habitat detsruction, the American shad stands tall today as a wonderful testament to the value of nature and the ability of America to recover an animal that was so vital to the young country. Read this book. I think you will treasure it.</span>

                    <span>His one paragraph comment on bow-fishermen (page 94), should hold enough shame to preclude both more bow-fishing and the breeding of more bow-fishermen. <BR>For you McPhee collectors; 'nuff said. For you neophytes; start with something simple like "Looking for a Ship" or "Oranges". Go from there.<BR>The best non-fiction writer in the language.</span>

                    <span>You can always count on a John McPhee book to be worth your time and money. He is an amazing author in his ability to extract interesting content from just about any topic. I am no Shad angler and this book doesn't make me want to be one, but I am a teacher of environmental policy and this book is one I have recommended to my students in both fisheries policy and water policy. There were large sections of the book I skipped because it seemed a bit over done, but that is a matter of taste. Probably if you are a dedicated angler you will find them interesting.</span>

                    <span>As an avid fishkeeper and fisherwoman, I felt compelled to buy this book. I enjoyed it, but felt that it dragged on. I wanted more information on the natural history, physiology and relation of the fish to history than we got. The book spent too much time describing McPhee's fishing and lure choices. What can I say? I love to fish, but think reading about someone else fishing is BORING. So overall, I like the book, but think it would have been better if it had been shorter. It's still worth a read though.</span>
