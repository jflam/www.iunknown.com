                    <span>The author is a remarkable and self-assured talent, deftly weaving a multitude of plots and creating characters who are vivid and memorable.  The center of this known world is a black slave-holding family, but the novel is more about the fragile hierarchy of blacks and whites, free and enslaved, poor and wealthy in antebellum Virgina, and ultimately the very violent collapse of this hierarchy, as if it is a harbinger of the Civil War.  I highly recommend this novel, but I have to agree with others who have reservations about its receiving a Pulitzer Prize.  I just do not think this novel was that good; there were times that the plots began to blur, the characters seemed faceless and the novel became tedious.  However, my reservations are minor when compared to the novel's overall beauty and spiritual purpose.  It is definitely worth the time and effort to read. </span>

                    <span>This fascinating novel brings you into the hearts and minds of those touched by slavery in the decades between the cataclysmic war between the states: black slave owners (who knew?!), white slave owners, poor whites, slaves and free blacks. With luminous prose, vertiginous shifts in time and places, and characters that never fall into archetypes, this novel compels the reader forward, into a world previously unknown. You won't be quite the same after reading this book.</span>

                    <span>The Known World is just that - the world that was known to the characters in the novel.  It is very limited in that the poverty and lifestyle of the time discouraged travel and worldliness, and yet the book is very full because the characters are universal.  I find this to be Jones' strength both in this novel and in his short stories.  Hard times destroy some and build up others.  How we react to our own Known World is determined by so many factors, only a few of which are obvious.  It is not our wealth or poverty.  It is not the character of our parents.  It is not our level of education.  But it is our soul.  Jones is supurb at elucidating this point.
<br />
<br />As for the text itself, it opened up a new world for me - the world of black slaveholders and the class structures of the antebellum south.  Great stuff!  The very fluid writing kept the book interesting and moving quickly.  The list of characters in the appendix was a great help in keeping track of the many characters.  It is meant to be referenced, especially at the start when the characters are still being developed.  </span>

                    <span>"The Known World" is the author's first novel eleven years after publishing an anthology of short stories, "Lost in the City." The names, locations, and characters are all fictional and created in his mind during eleven years of planning. The depth of detail of the plantation in Manchester County has been compared with Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. The Mirage Book Club members' take on the book was mixed and atypical. One member liked the first chapter but not the rest of the book; the second member was impressed with the images and descriptions of the scenes but not the meandering of the narration; some said the book was well written and explored an unknown view of slavery; a few were very impressed with the book: "Jones did a very good job discussing and disclosing slavery, and the title of the book was very fitting," said one member. "And the non-linear story telling and consistent narration was constructed masterfully." another member said, "There are two major considerations here: 1. the system [slavery] is unchangeable and slaves have no choice but to comply, and 2. unlike Faulkner's South who represents only whites, Jones writes about blacks too, as did Ernest Gray and a few other African-American writers."
<br />"The book was tedious to read yet some characters were interesting; Alice was stunning," said a member. "I didn't believe the story." next person read the whole book and found it informative, "A pleasant way to write about slavery." Another member was not convinced, "Winning the Pulitzer Prize could be a political matter." But another person found the book very interesting and enjoyable to read. "I liked Fern Alston, a noble person in a deeply corrupted political society." A member who likes every book she reads said, "I learn something from the book we read, though this one was a very different read, I liked the characters especially Augustus and Alice [she was crazy but she was fun]; but another member found the characters unreal and the descriptions tedious. "The prose was well constructed but the dialogues were excessive and inconsequential." A doctor/member listened to the audio version. "The author is telling a very believable story," said he, "An untold version of slavery."  The moderator's husband talked about the voice, the writing style, and the dialogues. "This book compares well to the notable novels about slavery," said he, "The author is African-American and when he was working on his M.F.A. in creative writing in Boston he read an article about a few black citizens of the South who were slave-owners. Then he collected shelves of books about slavery, the stories about the slaves who were ill, pregnant, and crippled or hobbled but still forcefully worked six days a week from sunrise to sunset," said he. "The author also collected stories from the earliest published black writers many of whom were slaves and abolitionists. The voice is constant and the narrator is omniscient, he is everywhere, sees everything, and knows what's going on in every cabin.

                    <span>I highly recommend this novel for anyone interested in excellent writing and interesting moral stories.  The opening chapter is a difficult start but stick with it.
<br />
<br />Mr. Jones incorporates several plots: Henry's father and his quest to free his family; the slaveowner's treatment of his slaves, his white family and his mixed race family; the consequences of being a free black man owning black slaves.  The author does an excellent job of illustrating the only distinction between a free man and a slave is a scrap of paper.
<br />
<br />This isn't just a story about former slaves owning slaves.  It is also about slaves with the responsibility to oversee other slaves.  The novel opens and ends by focusing on Moses, the overseer, not Henry, the slaveowner.
<br />
<br />I disagree with a previous reviewer.  The plot is linear with heavy foreshadowing and background stories interspersed.  Mr. Jones also incorporates interesting bits of historical "facts."  As mentioned above, I found the first chapter very slow, but it was an enjoyable book and I look forward to reading more books by Mr. Jones.</span>
