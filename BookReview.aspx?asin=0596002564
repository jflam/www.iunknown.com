                <span id="Label1"><i>Using Samba</i>, Second Edition is a comprehensive guide to Samba administration. It covers all versions of Samba from 2.0 to 2.2, including selected features from an alpha version of 3.0, as well as the SWAT graphical configuration tool. Updated for Windows 2000, ME, and XP, the book also explores Samba's new role as a primary domain controller and domain member server, its support for the use of Windows NT/2000/XP authentication and filesystem security on the host Unix system, and accessing shared files and printers from Unix clients.  In <i>Using Samba</i>, you'll begin with an introduction to Windows networking concepts that will help you quickly understand how it works, how it is similar to Unix networking, and how it differs.  The first chapters will guide you through the process of installing Samba, configuring Windows clients, and implementing a Windows domain. Subsequent chapters show you how to configure additional services and fine-tune the operation of the Samba server. Anyone who manages a network that has both Unix (including Mac OS X) and Windows systems will want to read this book. </span>

                    <span>O'Reilly sets the standard by which all other technical publishers should aspire; their books are technical, dense, and personally, I love the pithy, no nonsense tone. I have never been disappointed with an O'Reilly book. This book continues the tradition of above par books and I can attest that hands down, this is the best book available on Samba.<P>Remarkably, the information inside is aging very well. While it doesn't cover the most current version of Samba, this book is by far the most informative and helpful on the subject available. <P>While the book is fortified with examples, screenshots, and an easy to read style, by far my favorite portion is on troubleshooting (complete with a "fault tree"). It is just a way of systematically approaching connectivity problems in relation to the samba server. <P>I mean, really, what exactly is "System error 53?" This book won't tell you outright, but it will help narrow down the problem to solvable proportions. <P>The included CDROM also includes a mirror to the official Samba FTP site, including sources, binaries, documentation, and utilities.<P>When I have Samba configuration problems, or questions pop up about Samba, this is the book I reach for. If pressed for time and pressed for answers by coworkers, I have been known to pull it off the shelf and lend it out.</span>

                    <span>Network administers will invariably face the task of integrating Windows systems with Unix or Linux ones. Samba provides an excellent solution to this problem, but for people starting out, Samba seems like a daunting task.<P>Not so with this book. Prior to reading this book, I had no experience with Samba whatsoever. Before long, I found myself setting up Samba on a linux server and setting up file shares to Win2k systems. The massive smb.conf configuration file no longer looks menacing, but rather, its easy to read now.<P>I see why this has been adopted by the Samba team. Its very easy to read, very relaxing in its pace, and very thorough in its treatment of Samba topics. I do not believe there is a more comprehensive on Samba to date. Even the reference sections in the back are very nicely organized, and very easy to use.<P>What really tops this book off though is its treatment of Windows networking. For those who have little or no understanding of Windows and how networks are organized, this book covers the topic very well. Unix/Linux administrators will be glad they read this chapter.<P>In closing, I strongly recommend this book to Network Administrators, particularly those using Unix/Linux. This book is very comprehensive, but very easy to read.</span>

                    <span>Oh my goodness this book is detailed. This is truly a case of teaching a man to fish rather than feeding him. This book covers everything in grizzly detail. If you're not prepared to sit down and chew your way to being a Samba guru then get something else. This book is a long and I must admit a dry read but it's very powerful. It doesn't make light of the topic and it takes a while to read but like anything of value it's worth the effort. Excellent book, if you're using Samba in an office environment you need this book, you'll find out how to do all kinds of things you only dreamed of.</span>

                    <span>For a long time I knew what Samba was, but I never had the need to use or configure it. When a need to use Samba finally came up, I had a difficult time making it work the way I wanted. I waded through several man pages and on-line HOWTO's, but I just wasn't getting the big picture, so I purchased this book.<P>My only regret is that I waited so long to buy it. This book is very easy to read and understand. I was even putting off buying the book because of the impending release of Samba 3.0; I was afraid the book would be obsolete after I bought it. Much to my surprise, this book also covers Samba 3.<P>It has plenty of nice screenshots to help you through (client) configuration of various windows versions and even OS X. <P>Sample configuration files are provided, which can help you get up and running in a hurry, but it does a good job going into the detail of the configuration files to help you "tighten" things up later on. One of the appendices even features a two sentence description of each config file option - a welcome addition.<P>Unlike a lot of on-line documentation, this book is easy to read. Initially, I was just trying to get my smb server working, but I couldn't help but read well beyond the information I initially sought. I'm now prepared to configure samba as the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) for our network.<P>There's also a good portion of the book devoted to using smbclient to browse existing networks.</span>

                    <span>This is THE book for samba configuration. No two ways about it. This book rules.<P>These guys really want you to succeed an not only working a half-decent smb.conf file to implement a file server or print server but REALLY work your servers by creating stable, secure configurations where you do know what the options mean so you are implmenting knoweldge rather than mimicking the actions of others: lending robustness to your servers. It also help when you need to troubleshoot that you understand what you've done. Listen to these guys and that's what you'll accomplish: understanding. There is also good documentation on configuring various windows clients (as well as some insightful opinions on windows and it's failings and foibles: eg. Windows XP home being almost useless in a domain environment)<P>Lots of really good knowledge here. Pick it up and read it NOW! And then read it again. <P>To top it off, it is also very well written and easy to read! You now have no excuse not too...:)</span>
