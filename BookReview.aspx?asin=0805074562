                <span id="Label1">Jeff Hawkins, the high-tech success story behind PalmPilots and the  Redwood Neuroscience Institute, does a lot of thinking about thinking.  In <I>On Intelligence</I> Hawkins juxtaposes his two loves--computers  and brains--to examine the real future of artificial intelligence. In  doing so, he unites two fields of study that have been moving uneasily  toward one another for at least two decades. Most people think that computers are getting smarter, and that maybe  someday, they'll be as smart as we humans are. But Hawkins explains why  the way we build computers today won't take us down that path. He shows,  using nicely accessible examples, that our brains are memory-driven  systems that use our five senses and our perception of time, space, and  consciousness in a way that's totally unlike the relatively simple  structures of even the most complex computer chip. Readers who gobbled up Ray Kurzweil's (<I>The Age of Spiritual Machines</I> and Steven Johnson's <I>Mind Wide Open</I> will  find more intriguing food for thought here. Hawkins does a good job of  outlining current brain research for a general audience, and his  enthusiasm for brains is surprisingly contagious. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>Jeff Hawkins' day job has been the creation of the Palm Pilot and the Handspring Treo, along with the Grafitti writing system used on those devices.  His "hobby" - and a very serious one it seems from this book - is studying how the human brain works.
<br />
<br />Hawkins has been bothered by the lack of a unifying theory of what the brain actually does that makes it intelligent and the absense of a good book on the topic for the lay-person.  On Intelligence is his response to those concerns.  The book is one big hypothesis on what is going on inside all of our heads that separates us from even the fastest computers.  The crux of the issue is that our brains are pattern storage and pattern recognition devices that use those two functions to incessantly make predictions about what is coming next in the world around us.
<br />
<br />The evidence and explanations that Hawkins offers up are compelling and fascinating and his theory conceptually makes sense when you think about it.  In the end Hawkins happily admits - and we as the reader need to remember - that what he is doing is offering up a hypothesis for science to work with, prove and disprove as the study of the human mind advances.
<br />
<br />Highly recommended for the interested lay-person by an interested lay-person.</span>

                    <span>I have always been curious about how the brain works, and why it can do things that computers that work a million times faster cannot begin to achieve.  I thought this book might be too difficult for me because I am not a scientist, but it was not compicated.  It tackles what I used to think must be an infinitely complex subject in a simple and interesting way for the average person, through great writing, common sense explanations and simple analogies.  They do an excellent job of avoiding getting into the details that confuse and bore non-scientists.  I started reading it out of curiosity, and then I could not put it down.  If you have a brain, hope to have a brain someday, or have any interest at all in how brains work, you should read this book! </span>

                    <span>In his now classic work, The Computer and the Brain, the late Jon von Neumann constructed a systematic point by point comparison of the brain against what was almost universally viewed as it's artificial counterpart; the computer and despite first being published in 1956 it has remained the seminal work on this subject - until now.  That almost fifty years lapsed before a work emerged whose thoroughness and revolutionary nature provides serious challenge to accepted dogmatic would be an insight into the neglected state of affairs of any field - when this is further compounded by the technological explosion in personal computers and the wealth of data we have just recently been able to begin harvesting about the brain it makes for an almost criminal indictment against all those prior to Jeff Hawkins who were content not to question the accepted view of the brain as being essentially a computer.
<br />
<br />It is exactly these two subjects of brain and computer that Hawkins acknowledges as being the twin passions animating his writing of On Intelligence.  Such passion is truly evident in both his chronicling of how he came to hold these views as well as in his detailed explanations of what his new understanding of the brain's inner works are.
<br />
<br />One's heart must go out to a writer who is unafraid to put forth grand ideas even as they freely acknowledge that all the evidence is not in yet.  Like Einstein waiting for his conformation that starlight is bent when passing too close to the sun, Hawkins too is confident that in time as we are able to fill in the missing puzzle pieces it will all fall in line as he has predicted.
<br />
<br />This is a great book, written with heart and passion and is sure to cause readers to see the brain (and themselves) in an new light!</span>

                    <span>Jeff Hawkins presented a credible framework for anyone interested
<br />in understanding intelligence and actually trying to start
<br />implementing it, although "intelligence" is not something that
<br />can be fully explored in less than 300 pages and Jeff admitted
<br />that he does not have answer to everything in the topic. Being
<br />a graduate student in AI field in the 80's, I share a lot of
<br />frustration the author felt over the years. A workable frame is
<br />what we badly needed to jumpstart an almost dead field.
<br />
<br />I see it as a practical way to proceed. Jeff Hawkins may
<br />well be the next Wright brothers!</span>

                    <span>In the field of artificial intelligence it seems there are as many definitions of intelligence as there are stars in the heavens. Each of these definitions seems plausible, and interestingly, they seem to get more difficult to satisfy with time. Thus progress in artificial intelligence seems to be non-existent, since the criteria used to designate a machine as being intelligent ten years ago are no longer used today. Researchers in AI used to believe for example that if a machine could beat a human in chess then it should definitely be deemed intelligent. That belief is hardly held by anyone in the AI community at the present time. 
<br />
<br />The author of this book proposes yet another definition of intelligence, and it is one that is inspired by his understanding of how the human brain functions. His justifications are interesting, but they are highly speculative, and border on mere philosophical musings. It would have been a better book if the author refrained from the random walks in conceptual space that are characteristic of philosophy, and justified his conception of intelligence with what is really currently known in neuroscience. He does quote the research of neuroscientists that have produced a detailed map of the monkey cortex, which revealed many different regions connected together in a complex hierarchy. The author then makes the assumption that the human cortex hierarchy has a similar hierarchy. This is not really an unreasonable assumption if viewed from the standpoint of neuroanatomy, but from the standpoint of the cognitive abilities of humans versus those of monkeys, it might indeed be an assumption that deserves intense scrutiny. 
<br />
<br />	The author definitely wants to view intelligence as being one that can function over many different domains, i.e. an intelligent machine will be able to not only play chess for example, but could also analyze stock market data or perform some other function typically thought of as requiring careful thought. He expresses this by saying that the human cortex is "universal" in that it can be applied to any type of sensory or motor system, and that the "algorithm of the cortex" can be expressed independently of any particular function or sense. Certainly humans can think in many different domains, but one cannot conclude from this that humans possess the general intelligence that the author believes they do. There is in fact a large body of research that indicates that the human brain has a modular structure (the author discusses this research very briefly), with each module being responsible for functioning in a particular domain. If one of these modules ceases to function, this has no effect on the functioning of the others. This is a view of the brain as having a domain-specific structure. A domain-general notion of intelligence would mean that the brain can deal with several different domains, but that the same reasoning patterns or processes are used to think in these different domains. If one of these reasoning patterns or processes becomes non-functional, the rest of them will suffer. One could still view the brain as consisting of modules expert in different domains, but that these modules are "entangled" with each other in the sense just specified, i.e. damage in one module will affect the others. 
<br />
<br />In fairness to the author, there is also research in neuroscience that lends support to his notion of general intelligence and a single algorithm that can deal with all of the data presented to the human brain. He gives a few references that discuss this research, and he definitely emphasizes the need for feedback and the related notion of `auto-associative' memories. The brain in his view is a "pattern machine" and if one is to construct truly intelligent machines one must make use of this pattern manipulating capability of the human cortex. Thus intelligent machines will be a result of this "neocortical inspired" computing, and the author spends a lot of time explaining why these machines will mimic the ability of the brain to solve a problem using memory, and not by computing a solution. The cortex, in his view, creates "invariant representations" which can handle the intricate variability of the world it is confronted with. He summarizes this viewpoint by saying that the neocortex stores sequences of patterns, recalls patterns auto-associatively, stores invariant patterns, and stores patterns in a hierarchy. His explanations of how it does this are interesting, but again are very speculative, and in the absence of a prototype for a machine that possesses this kind of intelligence, it is difficult to assess the validity of his assertions. 
<br />
<br />This reviewer strongly disagrees with the assertion from the author that there are no machines today that express true intelligence. A strong case can be made for the existence of myriads of intelligent machines in the world today, but this case would again be dependent on a particular definition of intelligence. Machines that have intelligence as the author defines it are nowhere in sight, and this is no doubt due to the lack of commercial value in the domain-general intelligence that the author advocates. The intelligent machines of today can learn, adapt, and manage, and do many other different things, but they only do these things in specific domains. There is absolutely no need for these machines to have expertise in more than one domain, both for the sake of efficiency and also because of economics. In managing a network for example, there is no need for a machine to have expertise in some other area, such as chess playing or backgammon. Business demands thus dictate the kind of domain-specific intelligence that is so prevalent in hundreds of intelligent machines performing many useful functions in business and industry. </span>
