                <span id="Label1">In defending your systems against intruders and other meddlers, a little knowledge can be used to make the bad guys--particularly the more casual among them--seek out softer targets. <I>Counter Hack</I> aims to provide its readers with enough knowledge to toughen their Unix and Microsoft Windows systems against attacks in general, and with specific knowledge of the more common sorts of attacks that can be carried out by relatively unskilled "script kiddies." The approach author Ed Skoudis has chosen is effective, in that his readers accumulate the knowledge they need and generally enjoy the process.<p>   The best part of this book may be two chapters, one each for Windows and Unix, that explain the essential security terms, conventions, procedures, and behaviors of each operating system. This is the sort of information that readers need--a Unix person getting into Windows administration for the first time needs an introduction to the Microsoft security scheme, and vice versa. A third chapter explains TCP/IP with focus on security. With that groundwork in place, Skoudis explains how (with emphasis on tools) attackers look for vulnerabilities in systems, gain access, and maintain their access for periods of time without being discovered. You'll probably want to search online resources for more specific information--Skoudis refers to several--but this book by itself will provide you with the vocabulary and foundation knowledge you need to get the details you want. <I>--David Wall</I><p>   <B>Topics covered</B>: How black-hat hackers work, what tools and techniques they use, and how to assess and improve your systems' defenses. The author explains how Windows, Unix, and TCP/IP can be exploited for nefarious purposes, and details a modus operandi that's typical of the bad guys. </span>

                    <span>This is a "fun to read" book that fully describes the methodology of hacking attacks. It is by far the most enjoyable book I have read on the subject. The book is not a textbook or a reference book, yet I found that I learned a lot while I read it and I have continuously referenced it for specifics of the techniques that are described.<BR>Ed starts by providing short intros to UNIX, NT and IP networking, which provide valuable info to readers who don't have good backgrounds in all three. He then walks the reader through the typical steps of an attack. Each of the sections, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining and Maintaining Access and Covering Your Tracks contain well-written, up-to-the minute descriptions of the current methodologies found in the field as well as descriptions of the tools that are used.<BR>He references the authors of the tools and points to their web-sites. There is great info on Sam Spade, THC-Scan, Cheops, nmap, nessus, IDS evasion techniques, buffer overflows, L0phtCrack, John the Ripper, Dsniff, Hunt, Netcat, TFN2K, BO2K, RootKit and others. Yet this isn't a set of man pages or an attempt to prove that he knows more tools than anyone else does. The usage of each tool is described in the context of the methodology that he is explaining.<BR>My favorite chapter is "Putting it all Together: Anatomy of an Attack", where Ed describes three different "real-life" attack scenarios. In each scenario, fictional hackers use the tools and methodologies described in the earlier chapters to break the security of fictional target companies. This chapter really ties it all together!<BR>Anybody who has heard Ed speak at numerous conferences will recognize his fun, fact-filled, informative style. This book is suitable for system administrators, technical experts, security practioners and business executives. I would recommend this book to everyone interested in the security of their systems and networks.</span>

                    <span>Counter Hack is a great book overall. It encapsulates all that should be a good technical book. It's easy to read, easy to follow, contains lots of useful information, and doesn't bog down the reader with useless specifications or incredibly obtuse details. <P>From the view of a security newbie, this book provides an all-encompassing view of hacking and counteracting it. The book starts out with a simple introduction to various system and network technologies, and then details the ways to hack into, and then prevent hacking into these technologies. The book takes a great view in each chapter. First it explains the evil hacker's view and how they could exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Then it follows it up with how to shore everything up and prevent such hacking.<P>This book also goes into the tools, websites, and methods to hack and to counter hack, providing an invaluable reference without annoying the reader with too much information. Include this with its remarkable readability, and I would say this should be required reading for anyone administrating networks or writing software applications.<P>In short, I could not imagine a better security book around.</span>

                    <span>Overall, highly recommended, it's a no doubt five stars quality book. Even though I borrowed this book from library, I just place an order to purchase my own copy. Excellent reference material!<P>This book covers two major parts: (1) All-you-need-to-know Overviews, and (2) Hacking Skills. Ed only takes about 20% of his entire book portion for giving readers the overview of all important knowledge such as Networking,Unix & Windows. For those overviews chapters, they are all well-written and extremely easy to follow even for complicated concepts. By themselves, they already worth the book value, and they're excellent for refreshing those key & important knowledge & concepts.<P>The second part of the book mainly addresses various hacking approaches. The contents are exactly same as Ed's desktop seminar 'The Hack Counter-Hack Training Course', which is a computer-based training video on CD-ROM. However, this book provides much more details and in-depth explanation on how-things-done. Again, it's really well-written to depict the complicated hacking techniques. If you purchase the Ed's The Hack Counter-Hack Training Course, I strongly recommend you to buy this book as your reference material. They should go in pair.</span>

                    <span>I got a copy back in November 2001, but the book still deserves all the praise. It simply shows that a well-written infosec book doesn't have to be "fresh" or to be in the umpteenth edition to be fun and useful.<P>It has all the components of a great book: logical presentation style, wide material coverage from concepts to command line switches, humor, plenty of details on attacks and defenses.<P>The book presents a typical attack sequence (from recon to maintaining access) and goes into details on all its stages. A distinctive feature of the book is that the security tools descriptions are present not as the "man page rephrase" (a senseless stream of options and parameters), but instead woven into the fabric of the attack flow, thus making it much more interesting.<P>The book is focused more on the attack side, while containing small tips on protecting and blocking various described attacks. I also liked author's coverage of UNIX rootkits. Another awesome part of the book is three scenarios in the end. I was lucky to be present when then author presented the "Monstrous Software" attack case (#3 in the book) at the seminar and it was just as hilarious as it was enlightening.<BR>Overall, the book is still a very useful addition to any security book library. Perhaps a second edition is in the works, Ed? More web attacks, novel application hacking and wireless stuff will sure come handy.<P>Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.
