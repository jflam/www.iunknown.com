<h3 class="title">My TiBook is here!</h3>

<p><P>It arrived about an hour ago. Here's some really quick initial impressions:</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>It looks really BEAUTIFUL.</LI><br />
<LI>It's got that new laptop smell.</LI><br />
<LI>The AirPort setup was seamless. It connected with my encrypted 802.11b network at home with no problems whatsoever.</LI><br />
<LI>The installation / automatic software update feature worked flawlessly as well. I'm now happily running OS 10.2.3 on my TiBook.</LI><br />
<LI>Installing Office X (thanks Anson!) was equally seamless. I like the fact that I'm running under a standard user account and that software installers automatically prompt me for a password before installation. I don't know if I'm an administrator or not (I suspect that I am?) but there's a lot more for me to read about before I'm truly comfortable with my TiBook.</LI><br />
<LI>I just finished an MSN messenger chat with a friend. I really like the fact that the MSN messenger icon jumps up and down on the&nbsp;dock when a new message arrives. That's so much cooler than flashing icons on the taskbar :)</LI><br />
<LI>I'm bummed that my MSN Messenger contact categories didn't migrate.</LI><br />
<LI>I hate touchpads so I plugged in my wireless MS optical mouse. That worked fine out of the box, both the scrolling wheel and the right mouse button. I just downloaded the MS Intellipoint drivers, so I'll see if there's much of a difference there.</LI><br />
<LI>I'm now downloading Windows Media Player for OS X since all of my music is in WMA format. I want to get an iPod, though so I'm contemplating re-ripping as MP3 ...</LI><br />
<LI>I'm really missing ClearType, though. When looking at the NY Times web site on both of my T23 and my TiBook, you can see a really big difference. After looking at my TiBook for a couple of hours now, though my eyes are beginning to make the adjustment.</LI><br />
<LI>It doesn't fit in my TUMI knapsack, though. I need to go find a new bag this afternoon.</LI></UL></p>

<p>To solve your ClearType blues, you might want to check out TinkerTool:<br />
http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool2.html<br />
Also, you'll want to make sure you have "font smoothing" turned on for LCD</p>

<p>Congrats on the new TiBook.<br />
I don't know what Apple is doing with new machines now, but they used to ship machines without the developer tools installed.  If you register with the developer program (free) you can always get the latest tools from developer.apple.com, along with beta builds of the Java VM, other libraries, etc...<br />
And, yes, the first account created has admin privileges.<br />
I'm pretty disappointed with Windows Media Player for MacOS.  Playback is jerky, and codecs are missing.  I'm hoping that either MS or Apple does something about that.<br />
	You may want to consider installing some OS X native versions of software.  Chimera is a nice, native feeling browser.  OmniGroup has some really nice OS X software, including OmniGraffle, my current fav drawing app.  Fire is a nice, multi-protocol IM client.  <br />
	And  even though OS X ships with Emacs, I'm still partial to BBEdit.</p>

<p>Thanks, Eric. I downloaded the dev tools, and hopefully will write Hello, World sometime today (once I figure out how to get the !@#!@# CD burner to work).</p>

<p>If you haven't already purchased a bag, check out the Apple-branded TiBook bag from Brenthaven. I've a huge fan of Brenthavens in general, and this one works great for the TiBook: upright configuration, fits like a glove, great shoulder-straps, plenty of extra space, and not too bulky overall.</p>

<p>It's interesting that you should mention this - my Brenthaven bag arrived this afternoon  So far, I'm loving the bag. I did some experiments and I found that I could fit my T23 and my TiBook in the bag if need be. This is definitely not the case with my old TUMI bag that has served me so well over the years.</p>
