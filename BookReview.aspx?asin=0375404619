                    <span>As a newcomer to the US, I am perhaps more aware of the role of race here than I am in the UK. However, despite living here 2 years, was still at a loss a loss as to its' origins and why it occured here.
<br />
<br />This book helped me see the American "South" in a new light. Gone are my perceptions that large sections of the old confederate south are your typical "KKK style bigots", but it has been replaced with a recognition that the racism that the African-American community experienced may well still be there.
<br />
<br />Sure the burning crosses are gone but the "racism of the mind", the unspoken racism that most people are too ashamed to raise but which must still be presents among some, both in the North and in the South, is still very much alive and well in the US.</span>

                    <span>"That's the way the erasure of the past tends to work, by selective memory and willed amnesia and the wearing away of time. And yet there are always some folks around who are willing to remember things whole."<br>	Paul Hendrickson's book asks an impertinent question, really--"When did you stop being a bigot?"  He took one of Charles Moore's remarkable Life magazine photographs, taken the week before James Meredith registered at the University of Mississippi in 1962, and went looking for the people depicted, two of whom are still alive. It's a photo of six Mississippi sheriffs and one deputy, standing sociably in a group, getting ready to defend the Ole Miss against the entrance of Meredith; one of them is preparing armbands, and one is wielding a stick.<br>	The warmth and courtesy with which Hendrickson is received are truly remarkable. He drives around the state showing people the Life magazine photo, and spends hours discussing 'that civil rights mess' with the two surviving sheriffs and their kin; over and over, they let him in, and fix him some dinner. He looks into newspaper archives, and tracks down James Meredith and his sons, one of whom takes a graduate degree from Ole Miss in almost total privacy (until Hendrickson comes along).<br>	I think these people welcome Hendrickson because he sincerely wants to understand how Mississippi's racial past has settled into its present; it's a compelling question of sin and sorrow, of good and evil, and the dailiness thereof. He's frequently surprised, both by what they say and by how he reacts to it. I am moved especially by Ira Harkey, a newspaperman who was driven out of the state for his moderate editorial stance, who gently remonstrates with Hendrickson for demonizing Harkey's old foes. To call them simply bigots, or cowards, is to miss the human story.</span>

                    <span>Sir, I am also a New Yorker.  I take issue with your assumption that someone writing a review with which you do not agree is a bigot, and further, that the bigot in question is a Southerner.<p>P.S. "Southerner" is a proper noun and should be capitalized.<p>Amazon, please remove or edit "Don's" offensive review.</span>

                    <span>As a Southerner, I read with interest this account of the integration of Ole Miss University and the legacies of the man who integrated it (James Meredith) and those who tried to stop him (among them, seven white sheriffs photographed by Charles Moore for Life Magazine).  Hendrickson has thoroughly researched the events leading up to Meredith's first day at Ole Miss - the lynchings, the riots and the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering - and this section makes for a compelling read.  <p>However, the author's attempt later in the book to decipher some meaning from the lives of the sons and grandsons of a few of the participants falls short.  He did not ask his subjects the right questions - he simply skimmed the surface - perhaps he was afraid to risk their anger?  Likewise, he rarely interviewed any of the wives of the participants.<p>Others have commented on Hendrickson's "south bashing."  Certainly, he is patronizing to a few of those he meets; he describes one sheriff's grandson as never having gone to a symphony or the theatre as though these things were the markers of intellect.  Still, I am not sure it this is "anti-south" or just the cultural elitism of a Washington Post writer.<p>Hendrickson's writing is lively, but at many times sticky and way too precious.  I'd recommend the first half as an interesting read on the events at Ole Miss.  Skip the rest, unless you want to learn about the daily life and views of your car mechanic, bus driver, home depot salesman, grad student or next-door-neighbor.  Trust me, these people exist all over the country, not just in the South, and they're just not that interesting.</span>

                    <span>Hendrickson takes a moment (frozen in a photograph on the eve of James Meridith's entry into Ole Miss in 1962) and builds a universe around it.  I recognize the time, the people and the place.  As a sixth generation Mississippian who lived through the era of the civil rights movement but then left never to really return, this book takes me home. Mississippi belongs to all of us and in some instinctive way we who are her sons, black and white, love her.  The words quoted in this book from James Meridith captured that feeling --- "To me, Mississippi is the most beautiful country in the world in all seasons.  In the spring, all is green and fresh, the air is clean and sweet, and everything is healthy ... I feel love because I have always felt that Mississippi belonged to me and one must love what is his."  Time and again, Hendrickson took me to familiar places, caused me to laugh and to cry and made me remember "... how often I have lain beneath rain on a strange roof, thinking of home."</span>
