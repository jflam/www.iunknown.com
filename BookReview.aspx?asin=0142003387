                    <span>I have read The Things They Carried and I must say I have not read anything more horrible in a long time.  I hated Tim O'Brien for it, because simply put, it was an awful book, but my faith in Tim O'Brien was revived after reading this book in a quick 12 hours (it took me this long because I could not put it down and read it non-stop, that's how good it is).  So for those that hail Tim O'Brien a classic author based upon The Things They Carried, I suggest you read or re-read July, July to see why he really is a grat author of our time.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale.
<br />Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort.</span>

                    <span>Tim O'Brien has a corner on the market of tough-guy Vietnam vet lit. From "The Things They Carried" to "In the Lake of the Woods" and much of his other work, post-Vietnam misunderstanding, bitterness and regret are recurring themes. While "July, July" is not specifically about that tragic war, Vietnam is central to the themes of a thirty year reunion looking back on the events of the late 1960's and forward. We encounter the lives of several disparate individuals whose lives intersect and deviate from one another. None of these have been spared unhappiness or hardship. From the class clown, to the popular girl, to the popular guy, the radical, the mature go-ahead type, the obese schlub, and so on, we get a broad cross-section of the class of '69 from this typical Minnesota school. 
<br />
<br />The one criticism I have is that at times it felt like O'Brien was painting some of his characters with broad strokes, and this tended to create single-layered characterizations, rather than multi-dimensional characters. Some of the couplings that developed between the characters did not seem believable. The book could have been 200 pages longer and it wouldn't have suffered from it. Other than that, it was very entertaining, imaginative, and passionate. I find that O'Brien writes most convincingly when he transports us to the swamps of Vietnam, and it was true here. A good book from a skilled author. </span>

                    <span>When Tim O'Brien burst onto the scene a decade or more ago with his collection of stories, The Things They Carried, it was clear America had a literate and intelligent documenter of the War in Vietnam.  The title story of that collection in particular was stunning, a beatifully written and highly evocative piece about violence and death.  Since then O'Brien has continued to produce terrific books.  Their qualities are deep senstivity and muscular prose.  In The Lake of the Woods and After Cacciato have been followed now by July, July, a good book about graduates of a college who meet thirty years after graduation and stir up fears and desires long suppressed but never quite buried.  In important ways their stories mirror the plight of America at the start of the new millennium.  It's a delightful novel, worth reading, as is all of O'Brien's stuff.  It maybe just can never quite measure up to impact of The Things They Carried.</span>

                    <span>It is July of 2000, and the members of the class of 1969 at Darton Hall College are having their 30-year reunion, one year too late. During the course of the novel, we meet several of those not-so-gracefully-aging flower children, now shopworn and wondering what their lives were really all about. And as the reunion progresses, we journey back into each character's life, to other Julys in other years, when important choices were made that could not be reversed.
<br />
<br />While the story and its characters are a bit confusing at first, jumping from viewpoint to viewpoint, so it's difficult to keep straight who is who, who loves who, who is married to who, that is all intentional and the meaning comes clear as each character's story unfolds. Because that's what memory is like, not a smoothly unfolding continuum but a jumble of moments -- the most important moments making up a patchwork of a life. The book feels uneven from time to time, or rushed, or as if some characters get short shrift while others -- particularly David, who represents the Vietnam experience -- appear far too frequently, but none of that really matters.
<br />
<br />Because these perfectly ordinary people are, in the end, completely compelling, and so are their perfectly ordinary lives. Breast cancer, Vietnam flashbacks, jiltings, divorces, affairs, the stupid mistakes we all make and we all can relate to are lovingly detailed here. And these characters, despite their many, very human faults, are our friends, our spouses, ourselves -- and all the more endearing for it.</span>
