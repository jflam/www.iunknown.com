                <span id="Label1">This is the horror of World War II on the Eastern Front, as seen through the eyes of a teenaged German soldier.  At first an exciting adventure, Guy Sajer's war becomes, as the German invasion falters in the icy vastness of the Ukraine, a simple, desperate struggle for survival against cold, hunger, and above all, the terrifying Soviet artillery.  As a member of the elite Gross Deutschland division, he fought in all the great battles, from Kursk to Kharkov. Sajer's German footsoldier's perspective makes THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER a unique war memoir, the book that The Christian Science Monitor said &#34;may well be the book about World War II that has been so long awaited.&#34;  Now it has been handsomely republished as a hardcover containing fifty rare German combat photos of life and death at the Eastern Front. The photos of troops battling through snow, mud, burned villages, and rubble strewn cities depict the hardships and destructiveness of war.  Many are originally from the private collections of German soldiers and have never before been published.  This is a deluxe edition of a true classic.</span>

                    <span>The Forgotten Soldier is an incredibly powerful story that lays bare the inhumanity of war. It does not matter that this is the memoir of a German soldier, because politics are not important in this story. This is a story about the fear and terror of combat; the death and destruction wrought by both sides on the Russian front. Anyone who reads this book will never forget it. I read this book for the first time 25 years ago, and it changed forever the way I thought about war. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</span>

                    <span>The author does an admirable job of exposing the reader to the horrors and realities of the battlefield (in this case, WWII Russia). Rarely has a book so effectively provided civilians such acurrate insight. Unfortunately, the book is not factual. It is a novel in spite of the author's claims. The known and universally accepted facts do not jibe with the author's "recollections". It is, without doubt, one of the best novels of its type. If you are looking for a truly autobiographical account of the German side of the war, I would recommend without hesitation "Panzer Commander" by Hans von Luck. Read "Forgotten Soldier" for its emotional impact and its sense of 'being there'. Read "Panzer Commander" for its historical accuracy. The two books are an exceptional combination.</span>

                    <span>This is simply one of the most memorable and important books that I've ever encountered. I first read it in 1994 and it remains as vivid in my mind today as it did on the day ten years ago that I finished it. I have heard questions regarding its historical accuracy but can only say that his account of the nature of war can be supported by other German memoirs of the Eastern Front such as "The Black March." Was the GrossDeutschland Division in all the places that he claimed? Perhaps not, but I will say that, as the Eastern Front disintegrated, it was far from unusual for scratch companies to be formed regardless of where the units derived. Either way, it's a magnificent read. His desription of the Hitler Jugend before the battle of Belgorod is absolutely priceless with their banners reading "The World Belongs to Us." In chapter four, his romance with the Berlin girl Paula happens to be one of the most engaging and believable relationships I've ever run across in print. I've read it aloud to high school students and they loved it. The book should appeal to anybody who has experienced passion.</span>

                    <span>The Forgotten Soldier is to World War II what All Quiet of the Western Front is to World War I. The story traces the war time biography of a French soldier from the Alsatian region who enlists in the German army and fights on the Russian front. <P>The story is a gritty view of warfare and the camaraderie of soldiers undergoing shared hardships. This is not a biographical view of major battles or a digression of a commanding officer on tactics. This is a face buried in the mud, frozen toes, deathly afraid, empty stomach, survival story set in the harshness of a war that was fought in a grim manner. The focus is on the personal and emotional aspect of the soldier's story.<P>For additional reading on the soldier's life in World War II try Beyond Valor by Patrick O'Donnell.<BR>P-)</span>
