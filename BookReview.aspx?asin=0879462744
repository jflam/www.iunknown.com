                    <span>This book is always interesting to read. It has a lot great info on every stat you can think of.  Bill James has a talent for baseball statistics that will be valued for years to come.  If you want a great book on hitting technique I would get The Science of Hitting by Ted Williams.  Wonderful book that shows you how to hit over .300.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The new edition has some added features like projected career totals and injury projections, but the meat of it is similar to what appeared in 2004.  For stats junkies who just want the numbers, it's a great book.  For those who prefer Prospectus and their comments (for better or, often, worse), this may be a disappointment because of its lack of commentary on players.
<br />
<br />There is some discussion of items like the career projections and injury projections, but no essays that make his Abstracts or other books like Win Shares so popular.  I'd definitely consider this a must for 2005 - a concise, easy to use guide to the essential stats that can be kept on your coffee table all season - but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't share an obsession with stats.</span>

                    <span>I keep this one on the table whenever watching a ballgame on TV or fooling with a fantasy club.  Every active player's career stats, with useful stats created by Bill James, like runs created, stats on manager moves, and ballparks.  Useful and well-organized.</span>

                    <span>Bill James started out as a wacky guy who saw baseball differently from the so-called "experts." Today, those experts refer to his theories and expound beyond them. He demonstrates that it is much better to think baseball through than to chew tobacco and say things like, "Don't think, you can only hurt the ball club," which is what Rod Dedeaux used to say when I was at USC. Baseball is best approached the same way marketing, science or politics is approached - using numbers and stats, mixing experience with experiment.<p>STEVEN TRAVERS<br>Author of "Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman"<br>STWRITES@aol.com</span>

                    <span>This came as a total letdown, since I was expecting it to be like Bill James' Handbooks of the past.<p>Instead, it's basically a listing of active players with statistics, almost zero commentary, and offers little over what you can get over the internet.<p>Stick with Baseball Prospectus: stats are just as good, but the commentary is plentiful, enlightening, and often very funny.</span>
