                <span id="Label1">It's about time! Julie Morgenstern has written an organizing book that covers a new way of looking at the task of organizing effectively without labeling or blaming the person behind the lack of organization. Rather, she says, people who don't organize just never learned <I>how</I> to organize, through no fault of their own--after all, it's not a skill that's taught in school. That said, she gets down to work helping you figure out an organizing system that will really work for you, not a system based on cookie-cutter filing concepts or special storage units.<p> Morgenstern's "from the inside out" system begins by laying out the possible reasons for a failure of organization: technical errors (like having a complex organizing system that breaks down), external realities (like not enough space for your belongings), and psychological obstacles (like fear of failure--or success). Then, her Analyze and Strategize steps help create a plan of action based on your needs and goals, and the brief chapter called "Attack: Getting the Job Done" offers basic ideas for making space. The largest section of the book, "Applying What You've Learned," addresses the specifics of organizing workspaces, home offices, living spaces, and storage areas. Each section has a "How Long Will It Take?" box that gives a realistic time estimate, and Morgenstern's "Julie's No-Brainer Toss List" for each area gives the permission and encouragement that most of us have been waiting for to get rid of things we'll never use again. The section at the end, "Tackling Time and Technology," is worth its weight in DayTimers and PalmPilots. Whatever your organizing issues are, you're not a hopeless case, and you don't need special equipment--just a little understanding of the problem and a willingness to plan before diving in.</span>

                    <span>Julie Morgenstern's personalized approach to organizing is a breath of fresh air.  Most organizing books out there tell you what works for them, the author.  Ms. Morgenstern teaches her readers how to find out what will work for us!  Reading this book and putting these methods into practice has changed the way I deal with the "stuff" in my life and my house has never looked, felt, or worked better.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I got this book a few years ago and I continue to use the ideas not just to unclutter but to create a lasting improvement in the way my life runs and in the way that our space is organized for the whole family.  I was beyond disorganized and could easily compete with some of the worst-case scenarios mentioned in this book or in any other organizing/decluttering book.  I was also feeling bad at why so many common methods that seemed to work so easily for others just didn't work for me.  The premise of this book is priceless -  there is no single right way to do things - it all depends on your needs and your personality.  Forget "typical" ways of doing something or "shoulds" or what other's do or what works for others or anything else along those lines.  Forget trite rules such as "if you haven't worn it in 2 years, throw it out" or feelings that you can't have your collections or hobbies the way you want them or that you even need to get rid of items that you love even though you don't have room to display them.  This book starts with figuring out what you like, what  you want, what you need in your life, and most importantly what your  habits and skills and personality are like and then using all those to accomodate your "stuff".  For example, you don't have to always walk in the door walk over to the coat closet and hang your coat in the closet.  Just because that makes sense and you may feel (or other's might keep telling  you) that it's really not that much work - a few extra steps, not even an extra minute.  If that's not you, then there's no point in berating yourself or finally giving up because you can't do it.  Figure out where you do end up putting your coat (e.g. on the floor right near the door when you walk in or or on the banisters) and go with that - put up a hook or a coat stand.  One of my favorite examples in the book which I think really exemplifies the approach is one of her clients who always  had shoes piling up next to  her bed.  Instead of saying put a shoe rack in the closet or some other typical place and learn to use it, this book's approach is to accept that for that person,  her habits and behavior patterns require her to have her shoes near her bed.  Any organizational tool or idea that puts her shoes anywhere else is eventually going to fail because it goes against this person's natural habits.  Solution:  put something next to the bed, where she is naturally placing the shoes anyway.  This may sound simple but if you follow the whole book it really will  help you to achieve organization in your life that is sustainable because it goes with your habits instead of telling you that you need to change and setting you up for failure when you can't do what you're "supposed to do."  And yes, there's a lot about taking a look at your possessions but not at the expense of anything that you want (and no judgments about what you want vs. what you need - it's all about your personal, subjective wishes, recognizing that no two people are the same).  Rest assured that if you want to keep something, you can - without having to justify it's value or make sacrifices.  </span>

                    <span>At first I didn't like the premise of this book -- I wanted to get working and have a clean, organized home office, not think about the "purpose" of the rooms/areas. I love buying organizational and storage equipment, hoping that I'll find the perfect solution to my clutter issues. Eventually, I go back to my old habits and move on to something else.
<br />
<br />This book taught me that you need to make it easy on yourself. When you lose your keys constantly, you need to make a place for them as soon as you walk in the house. If you hate mopping your floors all of the time, then make a nice place for shoes right by the back door. The premise is good... I need to re-read this book and motivate myself to work on other areas of my house!</span>

                    <span>While waiting for the newest editions to be released, I'd like to say OFTIO 1st edition was the best book ever written on organization.  I, myself, had never even heard of getting organized until I read this book. 
<br />
<br />Julie's approach makes the most sense out of all I've read. Her practical approach using the Analyze, Strategize, Attack not only makes getting organized easier, it is fun, and real. I've used this approach with my own organizing, and it WORKS!
<br />
<br />In OFTIO, Julie takes getting organized and using real life examples, demonstrates how to approach difficult areas. </span>
