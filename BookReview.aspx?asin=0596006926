                <span id="Label1">Users will find a lot to like about the new iPhoto 4. With Smart Albums, they can organize photos similar to the way iTunes creates playlists. And they can share photos over a network using the same Apple technology for sharing music. There's much more, and our new Missing Manual covers everything in detail and with scrupulous objectivity. But this witty and authoritative guide goes much further, giving readers the basics they need to make iPhoto really work:  <b>Essentials of photography</b>.  Using iPhoto without a grounding in camera technique is like getting a map before you've learned to drive.  This book offers a friendly guide to the digital camera, and professional tips for making everyday snapshots look spectacular.  <b>Editing basics</b>.  Even great photos need a little touching up. This book shows how to master iPhoto's brightness and contrast controls, cropping tools, new Enhance and Retouch commands, and more.  <b>Finding an audience</b>.  iPhoto excels at presenting photos.  The book goes into detail about creating and uploading a Web site gallery, creating QuickTime movies from your pictures (both for DVD and on the Web), interactive DVD slideshows, AppleScripting iPhoto, important information on backing up and managing batches of photo files, and putting together one of Apple's linen photo books, including hints on how to arrange the pictures, what book formats work best for what kind of material, how to override the installed designs, and how to make up your own!  <i> iPhoto 4: The Missing Manual</i>, 3rd Edition covers all of these procedures, step by step and offers details on even the smallest nips and tucks. </span>

                    <span>"iPhoto 4: The Missing Manual" is an update of the 2003 book, "iPhoto2" and, like the original, is another in the well-respected O'Reilly Media "Missing Manual" series. "iPhoto4" covers the latest Apple iPhoto software while also providing basic instruction in near-professional quality digital photography.<P>	Derrick Story and the Mac community's favorite writer, David Pogue, continue as authors. Besides covering the latest and newest features of iPhoto 4 like its Control Bar, speed enhancements, Star Ratings, Smart Albums, and more, this latest edition of the book continues providing practical guidance on selecting and using the latest consumer-level digital cameras and equipment. The emphasis is on providing information and guidance to move beyond mere snapshooting. It does take something more to become able to make quality images, both in acquiring the image in the camera and processing it afterwards. And, of course, having quality images is not of much use unless one knows how to store, display, and distribute them to friends and family.<P>	In five parts covering digital cameras and photography subject items, iPhoto basics, creating and producing photo projects, advanced iPhoto tips, and troubleshooting, the authors provide all the guidance an amateur or advanced amateur needs for shooting, editing, and sharing digital photo resources.<P>	New sections of the book include how to upgrade from iPhoto2 to 4, how to maintain and upgrade photo libraries and a special section on camera-phone photography.<P>	This is an excellent volume and value for beginner to advanced amateur digital photographers.</span>

                    <span>You have a Mac, you have iPhoto 4, and you have a digital camera. This book will help you get the most out of all three. I was pleased to find a wide variety of hints, tips and advice covering all skill levels. My favorite tip was how to view the invisible PDF that is submitted to the Photo Book printer. If you plan on publishing a Photo Book, this tip alone pays for the price of the book in peace of mind. <P>The book is divided into four sections: how to take pictures, editing your pictures in iPhoto, sharing your pictures with iPhoto, and finally "iPhoto Stunts".<P>The first section has little to do with iPhoto and more to do with helping you do everything you can to get the best pictures possible before loading them into iPhoto. There wasn't anything really new here that you wouldn't find in any decent book on how to take good pictures, but it is handy to have it all in one book... You don't need an extra book on the basic rules to taking good pictures.<P>The next section describes the iPhoto library, where it keeps the files, what happens when you crop, retouch, enhance, or use the other simple editing tools. It notes that iPhoto is not for serious photo editing and points out a few other products that would be better suited for advanced editing. The step-by-step descriptions for each of the editing tools included with iPhoto are very easy to understand and follow.<P>The following section describes the many ways iPhoto helps you share your pictures. Among them are printing pictures, sending them to Apple for printing, creating a slideshow, publishing to a personal web site or to your .Mac account, creating a Photo Book, creating a Quicktime movie or an iDVD slideshow. There are plenty of screenshots and information for each of these, so you won't get lost between each step.<P>The last section is comprised of tips and tricks to satisfy your inner-geek; how to export pictures to your PDA, how to get pictures from your cameraphone, and several AppleScript tricks. There are also excellent tips on how to burn a CD or DVD to share with your family and friends running Windows. There is also an appendix that covers each iPhoto menu option individually and a troubleshooting section on common problems.<P>A very well done book - it really is "The book that should have been in the box".</span>
