                    <span>First, let me say that I'm a huge fan of Munro. Let me say that "Open Secrets" is THE book (okay, one of the books) I recommend to people for books that I love. And most of her early stuff ain't bad either. Let me say that as a way to lighten my negative opinion about this book. I think this book can be summed up by one of the characters in the first story (I'm paraphrasing) who's thinking about how as she got older she realized that life took more than she had and left her with less. (Something to that effect.) These stories read as if this were Munro's problem too, as if she's given her best and now she's still got to give more and she's out of gas. The stories seem tired. Case in point: she replaces the brilliant connections and observations she used to make in a paragraph with ten-fifteen pages of incidentals. So much seems like padding. Anyone has a hard time topping themselves as they get older, granted. And I think it would be hard for any mortal to write a book like "Open Secrets" in the first place, and I think it's doubly tough to try and top that. Frankly, I think she didn't top it this time or get very close. And I don't know if she's trying so hard. Since "Open Secrets" she's had a "Best of", this collection and the National Book Award. After reading these stories I think the award was given for the body of work she's created and not for the book itself. "The Love of.." feels like a book written to capitalize on someone's reputation and not to capitalize on what lies ahead. And who knows? Maybe she has another "Open Secrets" in her to share. I hope so.</span>

                    <span>Get this collection simply for The Children Stay, one of the<BR>most effective evocations of ache and regret ever set down on paper (and then, because she is Alice Munro, she quickly shows us how ultimately meaningless regret can become in an individual life, given time). In her stories, there are no right or wrong choices, there is no fate, and the stories often extend long past the consequences of her characters' actions, for better or worse, often, whatever they've done, however extreme, they are not punished nor rewarded. They are not saved. The moments of recognition or realization are sterling, perhaps, but not permanent in her characters' lives. They go on.</span>

                    <span>We all know that there are quite a lot of people who believe that Alice Munro is one of the greatest short story writers alive, and I could not agree with them more. But let me say what I particularly like about Alice Munro, what distinguishes her from other great writers.<P> First of all, there is a unique impression of authenticity. There are certain conventions in fiction about what is regarded as important or interesting; Alice Munro ignores them. She knows that tiny incidents can be the defining ones. She knows that spending a weekend with one's own daughter can be an unbearable challange which almost drives you mad. These stories do not gloss over the mundane aspects of life we have to struggle with most.<P> Second, Alice Munro's stories believe in human dignity and choice. Hers is a moral universe. It's not just the title story which shows us a person making a choice. We tend to just let things happen to us and pretend we cannot do anything about them; these stories show that sometimes we can (but they do not deny that very often we cannot). There is also a great story, "Jakarta", which implies that such choices are not valid forever; it's not enough to decide against betraying your husband today. The decision may feel momentous, but if you decide otherwise tomorrow it doesn't matter all that much. The problem is, however, and the story shows that too, that when you take those decisions you are very often incapable of feeling their impact. <P> Read these stories! This is a book for grown-ups. It will help you understand the world.</span>

                    <span>This collection of anachronous, dense short stories intrigued me. As a first-time Munro reader, I at first found it difficult to appreciate the patterns, details, and lack of plot. Eventually,however, a common thread develops and the reader is drawn in to these dream-like stories. "Save the Reaper", contrary to what other reviews might say, is the jem of the collection. The look exchanged between the little boy and the grandmother near the end make this story the central story around which the others revolve. The understanding look that says, "Don't worry, I'll keep your secret" provides a central theme for the collection. "The Love..." provides portraits of secrets, the uncertainty of the thoughts and actions of loved ones, and the burden that comes with this knowledge. A must-read for someone learning to get past looking for a plot.</span>

                    <span>I have a hard time reading short stories sometimes, but these were excellent. The first one, which titles the book, is almost a novella, very well crafted. With a murder at the center of the story, you read about how this death has affected different characters, and their take on it. My second favorite story is My Mother's Dream, a very vivid account of family dynamics at a time of loss and happiness. <P>Each one of these stories left me satisfied, with a sense of completion, and that is something i often miss when reading short stories. I highly recommend this excellent work by Alice Munro.</span>
