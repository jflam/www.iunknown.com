                    <span>It's really a great book although it's out of publish now.Many feature included database connection pool,ISAPI thread synthronize...that's wonderful for serious web developper. Of course I like the author's english.it's about 200 pages only but I won't escape a word(Everybody know right now when we got a book from Wrox,it's always more than 1000 pages and bad organized)</span>

                    <span>I was a bit disapointent in the book.  I thought it could have covered more.  It is only 190 or so pages of real material.  It does not cover nearly enough about cookies or session management.</span>

                    <span>Like many ISAPI books, this one falls into a trap of weak coverage of filters. This is really what I purchased the book for, since the SDK  documentation is so poor in this area. Unfortunately, this book didn't help  much, either. The filter examples, although somewhat helpful, do not deal  with one of the most difficult topics of filter architecture - namely,  dynamic content manipulation. Instead, the author chose a simpler example,  similar to the SDK UCASE example, which did not involve manipulation of the  data length.<p>I also found appendices B (HTML tags reference) and C (HTTP  reference) to be quite off-topic for the book. I would rather have saved  25% off the price of the book to remove these appendices, since the  information in them is readily available online.<p>The coverage of ISAPI  extensions is more well done than the rest of the book. The examples are  thorough and have some meat to them.<p>Of course, the final short point of  the book is that it deals with IIS 1.0. This means no mention of the IIS 4  Metabase, and some obsolete information. Unfortunately, there is really no  more recent alternative.</span>

                    <span>I work with C++/ISAPI almost every day. This book is by far the best I've found for learning the practical applications of ISAPI. Coverage of threads, database apps, and MFC is the best I've found in this category.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book for learning ISAPI rapidly.  Tracy does an  excellent job covering the different uses of ISAPI with good examples and  motivations.  In addition to Yuri, I was also particularly pleased with  coverage of things that fell to the periphery of ISAPI, but are nonetheless  essential i.e. multi-threading, sockets, and synchonization objects.  This  is one of the top 5 technical books I've read this year.</span>
