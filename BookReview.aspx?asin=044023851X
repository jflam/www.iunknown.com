                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. It showed how immigrants had a hard time when they first arrived in the United States. It showed how many families were torn apart by the testing of Ellis Island and that countless people who were very  hopeful to live in the U.S. and start a new life were sent back to their old countries. Rose is the main character of the story. She comes from Ireland and her uncle first moved to the United States of their family. She came 3rd-class with her Father, Mother, older brother and two younger sisters. She is the oldest child in her family. In Ellis Island she passed the test, but her younger brother had an eye disease and the opfficials said he couldn't enter the United States until it was cleared up and he had to go back to his homeland. Rose and her mother and two sisters go to live with her Uncle, Aunt, and step-counsins. Her two step-cousins are her age and look down on her and call her a "greenhorn" and treat her unkindly. They didn't want them to bring their belongings into their spacious apartment in fear it would dirty everything, draw bugs, and have lice inside. Rose decided to get a job to earn money so someday they would have lodgings of their own. She went to a flower place and quickly quit after some harassment from the boss. After her mother decided to leave after having enough from her sister-in-law and neices, she decided to go home. Rose wanted to stay so badly and yearned to have a life in the United States. She knew if she went back to Ireland the only life ahead of her would be marrying, having children, and taking care of the house. Her mother agreed and her younger sister decided she wanted to stay too. They went to their uncle and got some money and moved into their own place. They looked for a place to rent and they decided to stay with a Russian man. He was skeptical about letting them stay. When they met his daughter, Gussie, she decided that they would and befriended Rose. Gussie worked at the Triangle Shirt Waist company. She brought a sewing machine home one day and taught Rose how to make the shirts. Rose soon started and make many friends. Two of her closest friends names were Rose. She continued to enjoy her life. Her sister didn't want to go to school and she rebelled and worked. Finally Rose gave in and let her work at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory too. She was very happy until the fire that occurred at the factory. From then on her life changed.
<br />I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it to anyone. It also had a lot of history in the book along with how the fire affected people and the pooor working conditions in the factories. It also showed how many immigrants were looking for the country with "gold paved on the street" when all they found were slums with hundreds living in them and not the country they wanted to be in. It showed how people had to work hard to get ahead and some people acutally did. A lot of the people were prejudice about the new immigrants because they felt their jobs would be taken away and that they didn't belong there. Most of the immigrants were together and didn't separate. Back then it was very dangerous. I loved how this book showed history and how a girl coped with one of the most horrible fires in history.

                    <span>This book doesn't even deserve one star. I read it last year for my history project and I hated it. The writing was poor, and the Triangle Fire wasn't presented well. The characters were shallow and idiotic. The only thing I remember from the book is a part where they're trapped on the 8th floor of the Triangle Factory and then one of the girls screams, "if we're going to die, we're going to die TOGETHER!" and pulls her friend out the window with her. I only remember that because I thought is was hilarious that the Mary Jane Auch really believes that people could be that incredibly stupid. Do not waste your time with this book. It is the worst book I've ever read, with the possible exception of The Island Of The Blue Dolphins. But that would be another review.</span>

                    <span>Ashes of Roses by Mary Jane Auch was a very inspiring book to read. Sixteen-year-old Rose Nolan and her family have finally reached America, the land of opportunity. They are so excited that they never think that something bad will happen. They are devestated when they find out that part of their family has to go back to Ireland. Well life must go on so that is what the Nolan family does.
<br />
<br />With her mom and her two younger sisters, they set off to find where they are suppose to stay. Where? At her dad's brothers place of course! That is when it even goes further down hill. The family doesn't know that they are coming! What are they going to do?
<br />
<br />Mary Jane Auch did a fantastic job of writing this book, I stayed up untill midnight reading this book because it was so good. I was camping, and my flashlight went dead and I was devestated that I couldn't read this book it was that good!
<br />
<br />I reccommened this book to people who like a good historical book, a real page turner, and are not afriad to cry because of book. I sure liked it and I am planning to get my friends to read it too.</span>

<br />Ashes of Roses 
<br />
<br />
<br />In the book that I read, Ashes of Roses it tells about an Irish family that consists of a mother, father, three girls, and one boy. After the long trip over so excited to be coming to America the family is hit with terrible news. The little boy has an eye infection and can't be escorted from Ellis Island to America and must be sent back. Having no choice the family musty send the boy and his father back to Ireland. Then the four girls go to stay with their Uncle Patrick and his family. The stay there didn't last long pretty soon there was a fight and the mother Margaret was determined to go back to Ireland. The two eldest girls stay behind and rent out an apartment from a man and his daughter. Rose the eldest girl gets a job with his daughter. Then the building burns and the two girls stay with him to comfort him. Then they make their way in their new life in America.
<br />A description of the eldest daughter Rose is she is determined to make her way in America no matter what. Traits that I share with her are I have a lot of determination. Also I like to be independent when I have to be. How I am different from her is I didn't live back when she did and I don't know how it is to be an immigrant. These are some ways I am different and alike from her.
<br />Yes, I did like this book very much because it showed someone young with courage and someone independent. My favorite part was when Rose's building where she worked burned. The reason why is because she had lots of courage. She also took it very well and got on with her life. I would strongly recommend this book to a friend.
