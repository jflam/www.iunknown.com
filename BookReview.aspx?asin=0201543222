                    <span>Having originally come from a non-programming background, I found this book an excellent stand-alone introduction to programming in general. The use of libraries allows you to learn one aspect of the language at a time instead of throwing everything at you at once. By the end of the book, you've learned all the fundamentals thoroughly and you understand enough to write the libraries yourself. The libraries are good helper functions that I've found useful in my later code and even in my code at the industry level. (Practicing decomposition and code-reuse is essential for developing a solid, long-term programming style) <P>The book emphasizes good programming methodology rather than just concentrating on memorizing the syntactical. You can easily look up standard ansi C syntax in reference books like "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie (which I highly recommend), but you can't always find a book that covers basic programming concepts in general. The use of libraries instead of standard ANSI functions allows you to think flexibly, realizing that there are many levels of abstraction and that there are many ways of programming the same thing. This is especially beneficial when/if you go on to learn other languages. However, I would say that C is a good language to start out with because it encompasses more of the lower level details that may be hidden in other languages but are essential for understanding why your program works, isn't optimized, etc. <P>Once you've finished this book, you can easily ease into the second book in this introductory series, Programming Abstractions in C, which takes you to the next step in becoming a good programmer. It explains many standard algorithms liked hashtables, linked lists, etc. The two books combined build a solid foundation for programming in C and leave you prepared to go into more complex algorithms and other languages. I highly recommend this book (I always keep it close at hand).</span>

                    <span>Eric Roberts is a brilliant professor whose book makes learning C programming a real joy. The format is clear, the examples are pertinent, and the book does not "talk down" to the reader, as do many other computer books on the market. If you want an introduction to programming, there is no better choice than this book.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a wonderful beginners book. It gave me the basics and then allowed me to go on and try new things by myself. By the end I really felt like I could write my own programs in C.<P>I only gave it four stars because I am a harsh grader and its a textbook, so you can't give it five.</span>

                    <span>I borrowed this book from library and believed I had made a right decision.<P>	Quoted from the book, Mr. Roberts have been teaching computer science for over 20 years, I'm not sure how long he has taught C language but I suppose this book is written in a way that he believes is most beneficial to the readers, based on his teaching experience.<P>	C is a cryptic and complex language, so the author teaches in a stepwise manner, he hides the complexity by introducing his private libraries and data abstractions. So the readers implement the functionality of C, which is independent from the complexity of C; once the readers have enough grasp at C, they may move on to explore the complexity of C.<P>	The author have done these with good intention because data types in ANSI C are limited in size, for example, the data type int is different from our perception of integer in daily life. The address operator & may be confusing as well.<P>	How did I use the book? I rewrited all the examples presented in book without his private libaries. I did the exercises in the book without his private libraries as well. Instead of copying all his codes and getting them work, I tried to make errors: for example, in the simple hello world program, omitted the preprocessor operator #, then read the error messages. I also tried to improve the efficiency of my algorithm.<P>	This maybe a good introductory book for people who have experience in programming in languages other than C since the syntax of C may confuse them, but owning it is not recommended.</span>

                    <span>Please, please, do not buy this book.<BR>I am a Grad Student at NIU and we use this book for the basic C class here. This book is useless! Most of the book needs the "specially made for the book" header files included with it to run the C code; therefore the book does not teach real C. If you go on to any thing higher in Computer Science this book will be of no use to you, due to the way it is written. ...DO NOT BUY BAD C BOOKS LIKE THIS!</span>
