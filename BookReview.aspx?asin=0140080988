                <span id="Label1">Matteo Ricci (1552-1616), an Italian Jesuit, entered China in 1583 to spread Catholicism in the largely Confucian country. In order to make a persuasive argument for the educated Chinese to abandon their traditional faith for the new one he was carrying, Ricci realized that he would have to prove the general superiority of Western culture. He did so by teaching young Confucian scholars tricks to increase their memory skills--an important advantage in a nation with countless laws and rituals that had to be learned by heart. Ricci attracted numerous students with this method; more important, Ricci came to have a sympathetic understanding for China that he communicated to Rome, and thence to the European nations at large. Spence's portrait of Ricci is a gem of historical writing. <I>--Gregory MacNamee</I> </span>

                    <span>Having been hipped to the existence of the phenomenon of memory<BR>palaces by the books of Thomas Harris, (I'd forgotten all about them<BR>after reading one of Tom Wujec's earlier books) I was looking<BR>forward to finding a how-to book on the subject.<BR>The Memory Palaces Of Matteo Ricci, however, is, again not it.<BR>I already felt burned by Francis Yates' "Art Of Memory", which<BR>is more about Hermeticism than the purported subject.<P>Interesting though it may be, the book is mainly about Ricci's<BR>life and times as a Jesuit missionary in China, something I would<BR>have gotten from any biography about the man, which in fact this is.<BR>There is some cursory mention made of the principles of using loci<BR>for the purpose of memory, but that's it. Not even Ricci's own<BR>method is ananlyzed or discussed in great detail.</span>

                    <span>This book is worth reading for the account of Ricci's memory system alone. The way the Jesuits used the power of the sensory imagination to remember texts or chinese characters is inspirational. Spence explains the secrets of creating such a system, though this ain't no self-help book. But more interesting still was the way that Ricci used his imaginative interpretations of chinese pictograms to convey Christian images and ideas to the Chinese; and the way that he performed memory feats to impress and gain access to high chinese circles for his work.</span>

                    <span>I wrote my BA of Humanities thesis on Matteo Ricci and found Spence's book valuable for its information but mildly frustrating. "Memory Palace" is an excellence source for facts about Ricci's life for those who are not fluent in multiple languages or do not have access to the research material that Spence does. I turned to Spence for his commentary on Ricci's various writings that I did not have access to and for various tidbits of facts. Furthermore, Spence does a good job of illustrating the world that Ricci lived and worked in. For example, I was enlightened on the relationship of the Jesuits to the Portuguese King and how the Portuguese port of Macao in China operated. It was good background information to supplement the primary text I was using.<P>However, the frustrating part of this book is its organization. While it's an interesting idea to organize it according to the first four Chinese characters in his mnemonic system (or "memory palace"), it makes for a near meaningless train of thought; I ended up skimming the lengthy chapter on "water." I'm still disappointed by the end because Spence offers no real conclusion or summary, just an enigmatic statement. I had previously read Spence's "Death of Woman Wang" and I realize that it is Spence's style to amass historical information with unorthodox organization (I think it's his selling point). It's creative, but not very useful. Fortunately, the book has an excellent index, so it's fairly easy to re-find significant passages.<P>For those that want to read an actual narrative of Ricci's mission, I highly recommend the English translation of Trigault's transcription of Ricci's mission journals; this was the primary text for my paper. I found it very interesting and suprisingly high in entertainment value, considering its origin.<P>Trigault, Nicolas S. J. "China in the Sixteenth Century: <BR>The Journals of Mathew Ricci: 1583-1610." <BR>trans. Lous J. Gallagher, S.J. (New York: Random House, Inc. 1953).<P>Also recommended for his examination of the religious issues involved with Ricci and the other Jesuits preaching Christianity in China is Jaques Gernet's "China and the Christian Impact." To sum up, it answers this question and more, "What happens when you try to insert the Christian God into the ancient writings of a sophisticated society?"<P>Gernet, Jaques, "China and the Christian Impact." (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).</span>

                    <span>Jonathan D. Spence has written a book which can fall into a number of categories. On one level, it is a biography of a Jesuit who worked as a missionary in China during the Post-Reformation period. On another, it is an examination of his remarkable memory. On yet another, it vividly describes the China of this era and the efforts to bring Christianity to this closed society. The structure of the book is unusual for the genre, but is surprisingly successful. Ultimately, the book becomes a sort of psycho-historical account of a most remarkable man in a most remarkable place in a most remarkable time. Images from this book will linger in your mind for some time to come. Recommended for those interested in religious history, missions, the Jesuits, China, or artificial memory. A more technical companion piece is Francis Yates' _The Art of Memory_.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book thinking that it would tell the story of how Matteo Ricci got to present Christianity to the very top echelons of China: how he got to China in the first place, the imaginative ways in which he presented Christ to the Chinese, and the reactions of others - both Christian and non-Christian - to his preaching and his accomplishments. As it is, the story presented in this book covers only a few of these topics, and then in no logical order. I just don't think that what is undoubtedly a fascinating story is well told! I don't recommend buying this book.</span>
