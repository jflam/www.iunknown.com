                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed watching this on TV back in 1992, and it was great to see it again recently on DVD.  I recall Jim carrey's performance being more prominent that it actually is. His scenes and dialogue are quite short, but are impressive. If you have only seen him in his funny roles, you will be interested to see him here in a more dramatic role.  William McNamara (from COPYCAT) is the main focus of the film as the favourite son who has a secret.  
<br />
<br />The film suffers from feeling a tad dated, but the impressive cast make up for it.  This made for TV film was directed by Ken Olin (star of THIRTYSOMETHING) and looks at a dysfunctional family.  It impressed me how the casting agent picked actors to play the siblings who actually looked like they could be brothers and sisters.
<br />
<br />DVD SUMMARY - The film was shot originally on videotape and it shows through the soft image presented on DVD.  No effort has been made to clean up the print.  Sound wise, you get a stereo soundtrack.  Extras include a TV advert for the film when it was first released on video.
<br />
<br />OVERALL OPINION - A movie that is definitely worth seeing, but perhaps rent it first before buying.</span>

                    <span>Jim Carrey plays a lush, Lori Laughlin plays a beard to William McNamara and Bibi Besch gives an amazing performance as she cracks up near the end fo the film. Top notch acting in a TV-movie that was never really appreciated for its social commentray on disfunctional families and the effects on generations that sweep problems under the rug.</span>

                    <span>Fox DVD will undoubtedly showcase Jim Carrey for his supporting performance in "Doing Time on Maple Drive," a stellar cable TV movie from 1992, but buyer beware:  his is a straight, supporting dramatic performance.  He is very good, but the real shining star of this small Ken Olin-directed gem is the talented William McNamara, who is unforgettable as the "good" son in a seemingly perfect, but actually dysfunctional, family led by James B. Sikking and Bebe Besch.  "Chicago Hope"'s Jayne Brook rounds out the cast as a daughter who evidently married beneath her status and joins alcoholic older brother Carrey as the profound disappointments in a family who has laid all its future hopes and dreams on its children.  Apparently, it's up to youngest son McNamara to rise above the rubble his siblings have made of their lives and carry on the family's grand promise.  Unfortunately, he has a secret that will come crashing down on everyone involved.
<br />
<br />When the story opens, McNamara is bringing fiance Lori Loughlin home to meet the family.  And it's a joyous homecoming, but it's clear something is wrong with the relationship.  Then the unthinkable happens and Loughlin discovers McNamara's secret:  he is gay and has left a long-term boyfriend to marry her simply to please his parents, who supposedly don't know the truth.  Then she leaves and he is left to explain to his family why his bride has abandoned him and why he may very well be their biggest disappointment of all.
<br />
<br />The great thing about "Doing Time on Maple Drive" is how honest it is, and how refreshingly free of melodrama the writers and director Olin have made it.  McNamara's secret is revealed slowly, and when the family finally finds out about it, their reactions are honest and true.  That the mother takes it hardest of all is a refreshing twist, and Sikking's father has a final heart-to-heart with his son which is beautiful, yet heartbreaking, to behold.  What is refreshing is that the film isn't about homosexuality as much as it is about family dynamics and how important it is for parents not to base too much of their hopes and dreams on their children.  The ironic thing is that McNamara will undoubtedly be a success in life, and should be a source of undying pride for his parents, but because of his sexuality he will always be the family's embarassing secret.
<br />
<br />The performances in "Doing Time on Maple Drive" are universally excellent, with McNamara and Sikking the standouts.  Besch is also pitch-perfect as a mother who is loving on the outside, but as cold-hearted and unforgiving on the inside as was Mary Tyler Moore in "Ordinary People."  Brook and Loughlin offer solid support, but Carrey is a revelation, especially those who missed his stellar dramatic work in "Man on the Moon" and "Eternal Sunshine."  Made just before "Ace Ventura" made him a comedic superstar, his alcoholic son is tender and achingly true.  And director Ken Olin handles everything with appropriate restraint and a total lack of exploitation.  
<br />
<br />"Doing Time on Maple Drive" is a terrific TV movie and a welcome edition to DVD.  Don't let the subject matter scare you off.  It is respectfully and tastefully handled, and for once serves a more universal truth than simply preaching to the choir about homosexual rights.  After one viewing, you may ask yourself the same question I have for years:  Why is William McNamara not a major star?  You may be as baffled as me.  *****

                    <span>In this film we have: The alcoholic son; the homosexual son who is trying to be heterosexual to please himself and his family; the overlooked daughter and her husband with marital issues; the ultra conservative, emotionally unavailable father who is extremely hard on his children; and the mother who cares WAY too much what other people think and would rather hide behind a lie she has known for quite sometime. Not to mention the poor girl who thinks her fiance is straight, has to face her own pain in finding otherwise. <br>For a TV movie, this film is great. This is about a dysfunctional family. It is not only a "coming out" story, but also about an alcoholic son portrayed by Jim Carrey, who, along with the daughter's husband, seem to be the only people who can see how screwed up the family really is. The gay son, who on this occasion, brings home his new fiance, is forced to come out of the closet. He is so used to trying to put a pretty face on everything and not showing things for what they really are...which he seems to get from his parents. Basically, all at one time the s--t hits the fan, so to speak. It is definitely not an uplifting film, but shows how a dyfunctional family who hides their secrets and refuse to come to terms with their problems, will eventually fall apart and have to find a way to rebuild again, on different terms, through unconditional love and support. This is a wonderful film to show teenage children the dangers of alcoholism, and how important it is to love and support your children unconditionally regardless of their issues and sexual orientation. It can show the catastrophic results that can and usually will occur when people don't face their problems. What should parents care more about, their family image or their children? This would be great to show Jr. High, High School, and College students. I saw it when I was in high school and it helped me tremendously. I then showed it to a friend in college struggling with his sexuality and his religious parents who would not accept him. He came to terms with it as did his parents. They now accept him for who he is. Just goes to show how facing your problems and trying to understand an issue, will only help you and your loved ones in the future.</span>
