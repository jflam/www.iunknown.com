                <span id="Label1">A heckler is in the audience; the overhead projector breaks; the allotted speech time runs out--these are just some of the panic-producing crises, interruptions, or distractions easily dealt with in this first-aid guide for business speakers. Here, first-timers and experienced pros alike will find everything they need to organize, write, and deliver effective, entertaining speeches--from installations to toasts and roasts. The guide pinpoints every possible speaking contingency--from failed electricity to a bored audience--and for each one tells how to prevent it, what to do about it, and what to say about it. Its treasury of witty, off-the-cuff lines and audience participation devices helps speakers access the perfect words to cover any situation and captivate any audience.</span>

                    <span>I have many books on presenting and though they come and go on my desk this book stays there all the time. Why?<p>I'm sick of books that promise you that with just a few easy tips you'll be a great presenter overnight. In many cases I wonder if those authors have ever given a presentation. "What to say when . . ." is clearly written by someone who's been in the trenches and who appreciates the fact that presentation skills need lots of work - and why you need to have ways out of the tricky situations. In many ways it's like being with a small group of top presenters swapping war stories round a dinner table; the attitude is just as important as the information.<p>Second, this book actually gives you hope that when something bad happens in your presentation you might well be able to recover the situation. When you hear of how experienced speakers saved the day you will stop reacting to setbacks with total panic and instead think "How would the Walters deal with this?"<p>From the presenter's point of view, the most important message in this book is almost lost in the introduction. In a sidebar by Nate Booth, he makes the point that we'd rather not know - that sooner or later, something unexpected IS going to happen to you. I see so many presenters adopting a formal and distant approach in the hope that everything will go well, and then collapsing when things don't go according to plan. If you accept that nothing is perfect, you'll be taking the first step to relaxing in front of your audience - and giving a much better presentation.<p>The book is also readable for amusement. There are many examples of how to use humor to defuse tricky situations, and of course many examples of accidents that in retrospect are hilarious. My favorite is the story of the guy who skipped down the aisle to receive an award for running a department with the longest accident-free record. The inevitable happened, of course - but in a way that's much funnier than you could imagine. What was that? Oh, you'll have to buy the book to find out.</span>

                    <span>Nice book with some good advice on staying out of trouble on the playform and lots of down-to-earth tips on what to do and say when the going gets rough. Nine out of ten situations described are possible real life scenarios and the suggestions almost always make good sense. Which is really important for a book like this. Best read just before you're going out to a "hard talk" with a live audiance and need to make sure that you win the day. Its even funny. Recommended.</span>

                    <span>This great book is wonderfully organized, and very comprehensive to boot! The humourous stories help drive the points home, and the "lines" to say are generally easy to remember.<p>I think by reading through the entire book, you get a good feel for what is appropriate and inappropriate, and can then "wing it" if you haven't gotten a memorized response at hand.<p>As a public speaking professional, I will keep this in my collection, and review regularly, just in case!</span>

                    <span>So, you think you're the first person in the world to stumble on the way to the podium. Or have a projector bulb burn out. Or experience feedback from the sound system. Or be heckled from a know-it-all, or a drunk, in the audience. Or lose your train of thought. Or be asked a question you don't want to answer. Well, you're not--and this book shows what to do when your worst public speaking nightmare occurs. What to Say When You're Dying on the Platform describes hundreds of potential mishaps and what you can do to A) prevent them from occurring and B) shows how you can maintain your composure and confidence if they do occur. The primary message of What to Say When You're Dying on the Platform is that most mishaps can be prevented, or minimized, by planning and careful preparation. The secondary message is that the way you handle a joke that bombs or a know-it-all in the audience is more important than the interruption itself--if you respond with the right smile, comment and/or pause. If you remember just one of the hundreds of suggestions in this book, the book will more than pay for itself.</span>
