                    <span>I picked up this book to get a better understanding of the Civil War in general.  I wanted a book that covered everything.  Well be careful what you wish for!  This book covers seemingly EVERYTHING.  So much in fact, that I feel like I already forget some of the bigger points of the conflict because I'm focusing on some minute detail... for example Sickles (who lead Union troops in Gettysburg) was the first man in the US to successfully plead Not Guilty by reason of temporary insanity.  Interesting?  Sure.  A necessary part of a broad Civil War education?  Probably not.  Overall, this is a great (albeit challenging) read.  Stay focused, and try to separate out the important from the trivial and you should get a lot out of it!</span>

                    <span>There are tons of Civil War titles out there, and I have read only a handful of them, but I can't imagine them getting much better than this.  McPherson does a great job of putting it all into one volume (albeit it a long volume).  There are a few chapters on the build-up to the Civil War covering numerous presidencies and conflicts.  Once the war kicks off, McPherson will spend one or two chapters on military battles and then a chapter on other aspects of the war (e.g. the South trying to outrun the embargo or the North's recruiting problems, etc.).  It took me a while to read it, but I was very satisfied.  I feel like I know the basics of the Civil War and that this book is a great starting point for anyone's journey into the war that defined America.
<br />
<br />Also, if you're not up for a long book, see Ken Burns' "Civil War" series on video or DVD.  It's amazing.</span>

                    <span>I found McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom to be a great history not only of the Civil War, but also, as the cover suggests, the Civil War Era (includes years preceding the war). McPherson does an excellent job of plainly explaining the events that led to this bloody conflict, its causes,not to mention the war itself. It also does well detailing the great ramifications that resulted from the war, from the rise of free labor capitalism in the U.S. as well as the shaping of the modern political parties. The only problems I had with the book were the maps, which tended to contain too much information per map, and the footnotes, which became somewhat annoying. Otherwise, recommended to anyone wishing to study the Civil War Era. </span>

                    <span>If you wish to read the account of the American tragedy from a true historian, and not a socialist mutt, pick up Shelby Foote's brilliant, un-PC, 3 volume set. There's really nothing else to say. James McPherson is to history as Lenin is to Russian peasants...........a butcher!</span>

                    <span>"Battle Cry of Freedom" has been on my mental must read list for a few years.  But, other commitments (mainly law school) prevented me from sitting down and reading too many books, especially a 867-page tome.  But, now that I have a certain amount of free time on my hands, as well as a renewed interest in things historical, I finally got the chance to read it.  In a word: MASTERPIECE.
<br />
<br />I'm not going to dissect the books factual accuracy or McPherson's thesis and conclusions.  That's for another time.  (Since the book won the Pulitzer, the odds are good that all of that was done right; the copious footnotes and bibliographical material lend credence to that.)  
<br />
<br />The merits of the book are the issue, and they are many.  First, despite its considerable length, McPherson's writing is brisk, crisp, and engrossing.  The first chapter or so, which reviews the developments in the United States, north and south, leading up to the Civil War, specifically the impact of industrialization on the population of the country, can be a little slow.  However, when McPherson begins to examine the relationship between the north and the south, particularly the split on the slavery issue, the books really takes off, and I had great difficulty in putting it down.
<br />
<br />McPherson's prose is very vivid.  His arguments for the inescapable import of slavery to the Civil War are abundant and persuasive.  But they are balanced arguments, acknowledging the ambiguities of the issue, as he differentiates pure abolitionists from those who feared slavery's impact on the free-labor, and acknowledges that not all abolitionists particularly wanted the freed slaves to remain in the United States.  He is also very honest about Lincoln's initial interest in preserving the Union, regardless of the slavery issue, and charts Lincoln's shift from this stance into an essentially abolitionist by necessity as the war progressed.  He also details the subsequent schism in the Confederacy wherein slavery became hindrance to independence, and debate about conscripting blacks into the army (critiques by other reviewers that McPherson discounted this are incorrect).  
<br />
<br />McPherson is also pretty evenhanded in his discussion of the war itself.  He takes time to discuss the political, social, and economic impacts on both sides of the war, creating a full picture of this horrible conflict.  The names you know become a little more real: Lincoln, Davis, Grant, Lee, Sherman, Jackson are just that much more real to me.  While McPherson doesn't spend a huge amount of ink examining these men, he gives us vital facts about their lives, and is quite content to allow their actions speak for them.  His examination of those actions are frequently instructive.
<br />
<br />While McPherson's main interest is the politics of the war, he is no slouch when it comes to examining the battlefield.  Even in the dispassionate recounting that McPherson the historian provides does little to alleviate the horror of the war.  McPherson paints a brutal picture of a country tearing itself apart, and the lives lost as a consequence.
<br />
<br />The aspect of this book that impacted my world view was the acknowledgment that the country was different after the war.  This is an obvious statement.  But McPherson explains a point that I "knew" but never really thought about: the South represented, in McPherson's words, the mainstream of the world, that is, it had more in common with the majority of Europe.  It was the North that was "radical".  All in all, I find myself pleased that the radical view won out.  </span>
