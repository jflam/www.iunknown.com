                <span id="Label1">Long ago (1995), four object-orientation specialists came out with a book called <I>Design Patterns</I>. In it, the four--whose book became so famous that they became known as the Gang of Four--forwarded a convincing argument that most programming jobs fell into a couple of dozen general categories, and that generic solutions to these programming problems--design patterns--could carry the day a lot of the time. The book remains part of the Holy Writ of object orientation, and indeed if you study it carefully you can save yourself from having to reinvent the wheel every time you set about writing software. <p>  Not long ago (2003), Microsoft came out with a new programming language called C#. It's object oriented, and does lots of nifty stuff with networks. <I>Design Patterns in C#</I> shows you how to implement the 23 "Gang of Four" design patterns in this new language. Steven Metsker's approach is mostly architectural, with lots of object relationship diagrams and relatively little code. He says right up front: "This book is for developers who know C# and want to improve their skills as designers." Among the most valuable parts of his coverage are his comparisons of similar patterns. These clarify, for example, when to use a Builder pattern, as opposed to a Factory or Abstract Factory. The approach helps you become a good C# architect. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to implement the 23 classic Gamma-Helm-Johnson-Vlissides design patterns in C#. Questions scattered throughout the text help you improve your C# skills while you read about pattern architecture.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I really liked this book.
<br />
<br />My background was in VB6 and classic ASP, until just over two years ago.  I was introduced to C# and I've never looked back.
<br />Reading about C# best practices led me into design patterns and that naturally led me to this book.  It was the first book I've read on patterns (aside from a few articles online.)
<br />
<br />Concise - Metsker doesn't waste my time with unnecessary text (such as lame jokes or repetitive text).  If I don't get something the first time, I go back and read it over.
<br />
<br />Readable - The information in the book is dense, and there are certainly sections that may be confusing initially. However the book thoughtfully organized, the spacing and layout are comfortable, the author's voice reminiscent of a friendly college professor
<br />
<br />Specific - His implementation of patterns take advantage of C# specific features.  This is important, and I would not have recognized this without the input of C++ developer.</li>
<br />
<br />
<br />In addition, this book helped to clarify a number of Object Oriented and Component Oriented concepts (such as delegates, interfaces, and iterators).  Likewise, it shed light on the .NET FCL (streams and enumerators)
<br />
<br />Regarding the exercises in the book; I was irritated with them at first, however I found that they were really useful for making the concepts stick once I quit being lazy.  On the flipside, the book is quite useable even if you skip over them.
<br />
<br />The only real negative is the metaphor of the fireworks company.  It's not intuitive and it takes a while to sink in.</span>

                    <span>I had high expectations of "Design Patterns In C#" by Steven John Metsker but unfortunately the book didn't live up to them. This book is part of the "Software Patterns Series" of books that was started off by the classic "Design Patterns" by "The Gang of Four"(GoF), as they are known. That book is amazing and should be part of every software developer's library.
<br />
<br />Metsker's book assumes the reader has studied the GoF book and is knowledgeable in the basic 23 design patterns covered in it. Therefore, this book is intended to be a supplement to the original classic, expanding on it to show implementations in C# and leaving the in-depth rational of the design patterns to be described in the original. I feel like this was the correct approach to take because the original masterpiece does such a good job at introducing the subject of design patterns and giving the reader a solid foundation.
<br />
<br />My main complaint about "Design Patterns In C#" is the "challenges" this book includes throughout the text. I have no problem with exercises for the reader to try but the way this book presents them makes the actual text useless as a reference. 
<br />
<br />In many chapters, the major UML diagram and/or coding example showing how to implement a given design pattern is left with missing parts for the reader to fill in. This book's audience is experienced developers, who are looking for the author's opinion on the proper ways to implement a given design pattern using all the features of C#. Because of the "challenges" sections, the author is leaving out the exact parts of the book the developer needs. It is very frustrating to have to consult an appendix every couple of pages before making sense of the text following a "challenge". This book should have left out the "challenges" and instead imitated the original "Design Patterns" book by becoming a no nonsense reference for software architects.
<br />
<br />My other, smaller, complaint about this book is that it uses one large source code base for its examples instead of giving the reader a separate, small example for every pattern. If the author had chosen to use a small example for each chapter then they would have remained more independent of each other and easier to use as a reference. But, as I covered above, the author pretty much killed any chance of this book being a useful reference.
<br />
<br />This book wasn't all bad. The author did do a good job of showing which specific features of the C# language, such as interfaces, applied well to the various design patterns and made their implementations cleaner. I also liked that the author used UML instead of the older OMT used by the GoF book. To be fair to the original book, UML was not standardized at the time of its writing. Overall, I would recommend against purchasing "Design Patterns In C#" because of its "challenges" sections.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>If you're a "notch above beginner" in regard to patterns (like me), then this is not the book for you.  How strange that something as concepually simple as patterns can be so difficult to weave into applications.  This book doesn't help.  Steve chooses to use an arcane fireworks company as the standard example and then adds unnecessary complexity by incorporating complex code.  (At one point, Steve goes into the calculus of fireworks trajectory!)  Very frustrating to struggle with the application of patterns when the sample code itself is mindboggling.
<br />
<br />Every once in a while I pick the book up to remind me how incompetent I am.  I don't like books that make me feel that way.
<br />
<br />Look into O'Reilly's "Head First Design Patterns" instead.</span>

                    <span>Let's get real. When talking about C# and Design Patterns, there are so many people with different levels and areas of experties. Some knows VB.NET well and nothing about C# and Design Patterns, some knows Java and Design Patterns well but nothing about C#, some knows nothing well, ...
<br />
<br />So, who will benefit from this book most?
<br />For people knows about Design Patterns but not C# and .NET, you will learn how C# implements design patterns.
<br />For people knows .NET but not Design Patterns, you will find this book more approachable than GoF. You can use this book as a supplement or introductory book for GoF's discussion.
<br />For people knows nothing about .NEt and Design Patterns, this is probably not the book you should pick. Learn some .NET and OO stuff.
<br />
<br />For me, I did some Java and design patterns in the paste. After reading this book, I have a deeper understanding of Design patterns, while I gain more knowledge of C#. 
<br />
<br />So, if you think you need to know more about design patterns, I would recommend this book without reservation.

                    </div>
                    <span>Pros
<br />
<br />Steven knows what he's talking about. All patterns are nicely organized. I really liked chapter introductions and summaries because they were at times much clearer than chapter content itself. Small typos here and there didn't bother me that much. Overall, the book is proof-read quite well.
<br />
<br />Cons
<br />
<br />Each chapter presents a number of challenges, or quizzes. They appear intermittently with text and therefore distract you from the discussion each time because their solutions are listed in the back and you have to flip back and forth to follow code.
<br />
<br />In a couple of places Steven throws a quiz at you and afterwards presents the subject at hand. Normally, you present material first and then quiz. Doing it the other way around is quite a strange educational technique.
<br />
<br />Steven is an author of a number book on Java, and it shows in his C# code. Nothing wrong with Java per se, but c'mon! For example, he refers to the book Concurrent Programming in Java as an excellent resource when discussing multithreaded programming in .NET. 
<br />
<br />The singleton implementation found in this book is downright wrong! It may lead to deadlocks and is not thread-safe. You can find a more efficient implementation of a singleton with a double-check lock at Microsoft's Patterns and Practices.
<br />
<br />Conclusion
<br />
<br />The book *is* valuable. I didn't think it was a waste of money. Still, it fails to be the best book on the subject of Design Patterns in C# around.</span>
