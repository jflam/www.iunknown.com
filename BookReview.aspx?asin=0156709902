                    <span>There are rare pleasures in reading, one of which is stumbling onto a 'new' author. Ms Flanner could craft a detailed word picture almost with a single stroke of her pen. She wrote what she saw, actors, authors, lives and deaths of Knowns and Unknowns. She was there at the events, both great and small in a Paris she knew well and obviously loved. She is able to give the period between the wars a flavor and texture that makes it live and breathe. In some ways it is a gossipy diary, in others a police blotter, a literal whos-who of the literary scene of the time. Entries vary from a few pithy lines to several pages, ranging from light and humorous to somber and serious. And all extremely well written.</span>

                    <span>Flanner (nom de plume: GenÃªt), a former New Yorker essayist and who lived in Paris for many years, describes the cultural and social life of Paris in the 20s and 30s. She pens wonderful glimpses into what Parisians were thinking, feeling, and doing -Parisian ways of living, wine, and art. C'est magnifique.</span>

                    <span>Like many other American tourists, when I visit Paris I am searching for the Paris of Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.  Amazingly enough, even though over 50 years have passed, a lot of that Paris has survived and is just waiting  to be rediscovered.  A lot of what I can't find on my own I find in those  columns that Janet Flanner wrote from 1925 to 1939 for the NEW YORKER and  which have been collected for PARIS WAS YESTERDAY.<p>Janet Flanner (pen  name "Genet") was the resident Paris Correspondent for THE NEW  YORKER.  Her assignment was to write columns about "what the French  thought was going on in France,"  Flanner became much more than a mere  observer of the Parisian scene.  she was an active participant.  Be it a  death, an opera premiere, a swindle, a political disaster, a bit of gossip  about a celebrity, or nostalgia for an even earlier era, Flanner wrote  about them, and wrote with wit and an occasional tongue-in-her-cheek.<p>The  following example of her tongue-in-cheek approach, one among many, comes  from a 1928 column entitled "The Italian Straw Hat."  It seems  that the French wanted parity with Hollywood when it came to Motion  Pictures and wanted to pass a law requiring the acceptance in the U. S. of  a French Film for every Hollywood made film shown in France.  The first  picture they wanted to export to the U. S. was a film entitled, in  translation, THE ITALIAN STRAW HAT.  Her comment about this film was,  "While THE ITALIAN STRAW HAT is not, as touted, the funniest comedy in  Europe today, it is the funniest comedy about a straw hat to be seen on the  boulevards,"<p>In Flanner's columns you can read about Chevalier and  Josephine Baker (not together), about the excitement when the Louvre got a  new Berthe Morisot and a new Monet Painting donated the same day, about  more excitement over the premiere performance of a Ravel Piano piece, about  a mysterious murder and a new political pecadillo, and finally about more  somber times when World World II and Hitler loomed just over the  horizon.<p>If you'd like to feel that you are in LES DEUS MAGOTS, or CAFE  FLEUR, and listening to Sartre or Cocteau wax elegant or if you'd like to  hear the gossip about the gendarmerie asking Marlene Dietrich to leave  Paris because she had the audacity to wear trousers in public  or if you'd  like to meet James Joyce in THE SHAKESPEAR AND COMPANY BOOK STORE, or if  you'd like to attend one of Gertrude Stein's intellectual discussion and  meet her companion, Alice B. Toklas, then this book is for you.<p>I highly  recommend PARIS WAS YESTERDAY to anyone who is interested in a different  view (not that of Hemingway or Fitzgerald) of the era of the "Lost  Generation."  I recommend it to anyone who likes a book for its wit  and charm.  If you're not interested in Paris, but just like a bit of  celebrity gossip, there's still a lot here for you.  There's a reason that  Janet Flannery's column ran for so many years.  She'sgood!</span>
