                    <span>I should preface this review by saying that I am probably not the typical reader the author had in mind when writing this book.  As a marketing consultant, I was recently was engaged to develop retail feasibility study and project plan for an Internet retailer planning their first bricks and mortar store.  Although I have retail marketing experience, I bought this book to make sure that I had all bases covered and to get some fresh ideas on visual merchandising, retail POS systems and operations for small retailers.<p>This book is a great tool for a would-be entrepreneur thinking about starting their first retail business.   It covers all the basics needed to plan, set up and manage a retail business, from writing the business plan to making the business a reality.  The author makes good use of case studies which illustrate some of the retail successes and failures that he has observed.  Another feature I found particularly useful are the tips on all aspects of retailing that could take years of trial and error to learn on your own.  Last but not least the CD contains a wealth of useful forms and checklists.<p>Some areas that I would like to see developed in future editions are:<p>*  Visual merchandising and store layout - more on principles and examples of floor plans<br>* Software suggestions - small business retail POS systems, planogram and merchandising design software<br>* Sample budgets and project plans<br>* Links to online sources of information - where to find designers, software, sales staff etc<p>To summarize, an excellent book on retail basics and if Rick Segel writes an "Advanced Retailing for Dummies" book, I will be the first customer.</span>

                    <span>I'm a CPA in Redmond, WA with a heavy retail clientale. (I'm also the author of QuickBooks for Dummies and Quicken for Dummies.)<p>This is a great book for people looking to start successful retail stops. Tons of great ideas. It's also a great book for established retailers looking to improve their profitability.<p>My one gripe with the book is that the tax advice and information is wrong. But your accountant or attorney can and should provide that information to you.<p>...P>Steve</span>

                    <span>The most interesting parts of this book were the ones about customer service. Generally I HATE shopping, because salespeople are either all over you the minute you walk in the door, or else they ignore you. (I bet everyone has experienced the <br>you're-inconveniencing-me-while-I-gab-with-my-friend-on-the-phone syndrome!) It makes you want to buy everything from the Internet-hey....<p>Sorry I'm being so negative, I just feel that too many stores have forgotten that they exist TO SERVE THE CUSTOMER! Okay, I've vented and I feel better now! My point is that Retail Business Kit For Dummies HASN'T forgotten that. The author (Rick Segel) is adamant that retailers should wow their customers and be appreciative of them. I especially like the chapter on soft suggestive selling-no, it has nothing to do with sex, it's all about offering hassle-free, non-pushy service.<p>In closing, I think every store owner and manager should read this book. It would make the retail world a much more pleasant place for customers-which would, in turn, make the stores more profitable. Obviously, that's the bottom line.</span>

                    <span>Hi, Amazon.com shoppers. I would like to say a few words about Retail Business Kit For Dummies. I work in the retail industry, and I was drawn to this book because I heard Rick Segel speak several years ago. He was so funny and inspirational, and I really enjoyed his presentation, unlike some speeches I've heard that put me to sleep. So, I was curious about this book. Let me say that I was not disappointed. I felt that Rick's personality really came across, which made the material very fun to read. (IMHO, it doesn't matter how valuable the information is if it's written in a dry and boring style.) I think the little anecdotes and true stories that he scatters throughout are a great way to illustrate the points he makes. For example, I really liked a story he told about a jewelry store owner who sent out a very elaborate (read, expensive!) invitation to a private sale to his best 78 customers. Almost 50 of them came to the event and spent money, results that totally blew away the response he had gotten to the thousands of cheap postcards he sent out in past promotions. The moral? It pays to focus on your very best customers, even if you have to spend a little more.<br>Basically, I learned a lot of tips and tricks of the trade that I can share with my colleagues. What a great book! To anyone who's reading this review, check it out! It gives you a ton of great insights you'll appreciate.<br>Thanks for listening (well, reading!) and have a great day!</span>

                    <span>I loved this book! Actually, I've read several of the Dummies books and liked them all; they really do put complex information in "plain English."  Retail Business Kit For Dummies is no exception.  After reading it I feel that I could run right out and open up a successful store! I'm not ready to quit my day job just yet. But someday . . . !</span>
