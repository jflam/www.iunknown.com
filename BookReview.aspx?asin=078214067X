                    <span>"Windows XP Power Tools" is a fantastic collection of tips and tricks for really using Windows XP to it's fullest potential.  Each of the advanced techniques is fully explained in a way that you can feel comfortable implementing it without concern that you will be breaking something else.  Topic coverage is extensive and includes advanced setup information such as startup and shutdown control, networking, OS components, FTP hosting, hardware, remote access and VPN connections as well as maintenance information on items such as the registry, security, automated tasks, the command console, policies, and recovering from disasters.  <p>If that weren't enough reason to purchase the book (which, believe me, it is), it also has a CD with many useful utilities.  If you want a book that is well written and comprehensive with detailed instructions to make you a real power user and troubleshooter then this is an excellent choice - A highly recommended book.</span>

                    <span>Regardless of your Windows XP level, professional systems administrators using XP Professional to first time home users using XP Home Edition can find value in this title. The author has succeeded in putting together an easy reading and comprehending, one-stop reference that puts Microsoft's Windows XP Resource Kit and Step by Step books to shame.<p>The book does an excellent job of addressing the needs of users where Windows XP is their first OS away from Windows 9x, while not bringing the information level down for seasoned NT/2000 administrators who need a source of information for the features so poorly documented by Microsoft.<p>The printed portion of the book covers everything from Windows Shortcuts, Policies, the Recovery Console and EFS to slipstream deployment of service packs, designing network topologies, web mastering with IIS and VPN Connections. The included CD-ROM includes many useful shareware/professional utilities and tools (and unlike some other included CD-ROMs, many of the titles are used quite frequently within the industry). A nice note about the CD-ROM and the book is that the author hasn't written an 800 page advertisement for the utilities - the CD-ROM can stay sealed in the pouch, never seeing the light of day, and the book will still stand on it's own.<p>The back cover says it's a must-have. I've used Windows XP since it was in beta, deployed the release to my network users, and certified in the OS by Microsoft - and I couldn't agree more.</span>

                    <span>Windows XP Power Tools is a jewel for advanced and power users of Windows XP, both the home and professional versions. It is well organized and can be read from cover-to-cover or by individual sections. Each section covers the topics in detail with excellent examples and illustrations. <p>Windows XP Power Tools is not just a rehash of vendor documentation or other authors that leave out important information. Rather, each topic is presented in enough detail to be complete and really useful.<p>To me, a good technical computer book allows the reader to stand on the shoulders of the author to get a jump-start on rapidly evolving technologies. The author, Jim Boyce seems to have broad shoulders on which to stand. <p>If you are an advanced computer user and want good, focused information on Windows XP, then get this book.</span>
