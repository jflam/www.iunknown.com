                    <span>We had a great time writing this book, and trust you will find it useful in your PL/SQL development.  This book is a principle rewrite including coverage of beginning, intermediate, and advanced features.  Some of the highlights are:
<br />
<br />* Demonstration of using JDeveloper as an interface for PL/SQL development, including debugging
<br />* Expanded chapters discussing Records & Collections
<br />* Coverage of external routines that you will not find anywhere else
<br />* Two chapters on Object-Oriented Programming with PL/SQL
<br />* LOBs, LOBs, and more LOBs, including indexing using Oracle Text
<br />* Scheduling tasks using DBMS_LOB and DBMS_SCHEDULER and using UTL_SMTP and UTL_MAIL
<br />* Use of built-in packages like DBMS_PIPE and DBMS_ALERT with examples you can use in your own development
<br />
<br />DEVELOPERS:  Use this text as prep for certification, programming ideas, or use our online reusable code for your own application designs!
<br />
<br />DBA's:  Develop toolkits for your database, understand PL/SQL performance features, use DBMS_SCHEDULER/DBMS_JOB for your own task scheduling, and use UTL_MAIL/UTL_SMTP for generating mail messages.
<br />
<br />EDUCATORS:  This book is easily adapted for the classroom, and is already in use by top technical universities to teach programming concepts and PL/SQL.
<br />
<br />To get the most from this book, get the online code.  It has always been available from Oracle Press at www.OraclePress.com, but is also available at www.PLSQLBook.com.  If you have any difficulties in getting the code, or have feedback on this book, contact Feedback@PLSQLBook.com.

<br />Thanks, and happy reading!</span>

                    <span>I got the book for some of the new 10g features and have found it helpful.  The examples were very great once I found them.  After some digging I found the code for the examples online, but according to amazon there was supposed to be a cd...WHERE??
<br />
<br />I recommend the book, but know that you need to download the examples (nice format for the code btw).</span>

                    <span>I've only been completely through various sections that are relevant to projects that I am now working on.  However, even though it isn't written for the novice, the general info has already proven to be an incredible refresher that takes the reader into great depth and with a wide variety of real world examples that make sense and work.  No more old broken examples that never did work.  Yipee!!! 
<br />
<br />Of particular interest to me is the information on working with different composite data types.  Also, if you want solid and extensive info on handling exceptions with PL/SQL, I highly recommend the book.  From a readability standpoint, it is by far the best Oracle book that I've come across, taking rather dry confusing information, organizing it, and laying it out in a logical and useable fashion.
<br />
<br />Managers... know this book since it will be the title your new 10g PL/SQL hires will have been taught from.  Particularly advantageous to those who teach will be NOT having to rewrite examples and the resulting loss of hair and sleep.
<br />

                    <span>SQL developers experienced with non-Oracle databases or Oracle developers who are looking for a good reference manual should definitely pick up a copy of this book.  Inexperienced SQL developers will probably get more out of Oracle Press' other excellent book PL/SQL 101.
<br />
<br />This book begins exactly the way experienced developers would expect-it starts out at a running pace.  The book takes the next hundred-or-so pages just discussing PL/SQL basics.  Where this book excels is in its examples.  Each and every PL/SQL principle is clearly illustrated with many clear and relevant examples.  The author then begins into a discussion of advanced PL/SQL techniques, which includes a discussion of cursors, built-in functions, and records.
<br />
<br />The middle section of the book covers management and syntax of Oracle packages and functions.  This excellent discussion covers such issues as package scope and permissions.  This discussion naturally leads into advanced PL/SQL techniques including transactions, pipes, and various built-in DBMS packages.  Finally, the book rounds out its PL/SQL discussions by reviewing use of Large Objects (LOB).  In this section, the author discusses use and retrieval of data in this format.
<br />
<br />I would highly recommend this book to experienced Oracle or even non-Oracle developers who want to sharpen their PL/SQL skills or who are looking for a really good PL/SQL reference.  This is a must-have book for anyone serious about their PL/SQL development work.
