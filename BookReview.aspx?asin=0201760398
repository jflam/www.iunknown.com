                    <span>This book reads as if the author was writing personal notes to himself. Right off the bat, the text had a very esoteric and exclusive feel to it. I suppose it could be used as a reference, but for someone trying to expand their knowledge of the language, and especially for people trying to learn ASP.NET for the first time, I highly discourage this as your first purchase.</span>

                    <span>If you have experience with object-oriented software development, all you need do is read the Preface of this book and you know it's what you are looking for.  The book is designed for the experienced Web developer. It's perfectly positioned for those who've been working up the asp.net learning curve for a year or so.  If you're not looking for "here's a class, here's a variable, this is what they are for, etc." the book is for you.  Clear simple examples walk you through the architecture with lots of astute reinforcing visual aids.  Great explanations of event handling, data binding and state management - the nuts and bolts type stuff.  I particularly like the insightful two book printing approach one for C# and one VB.NET - no filler here!  If you're a bit new or fuzzy with asp.net prime yourself with a beginning type book first or get a beginning type book for reference while reading this one because it is not a beginners book. But don't be shy.  The writing style is respectful of learning.  I regard this as one of the better technical books.  The author is a trainer for DevelopMentor - if you've ever taken one of their courses you know what I mean - it's defiantly a guerrilla of a book!</span>

                    <span>I have about 5 books (mostly ebook format) on ASP.Net from the step by step to advanced and Fritz's book is an eye opener. Most of the ASP.NET books fail to mention why some quirks/details with ASP.Net the way they are. EAN is like a pointer and half way through the book, I had so many 'aha' moments that I was left wondering WHO IS THIS guy? Don't expect explanations about variables and such (go refer ASP.Net Web Developers Gude pub. by Syngress) and thankfully so. You will have a better understanding of ASP.Net by the end of the book than syntax which you would be thankful for when you start writing ASP.Net applications in real world. I have yet to finish the book but I couldn't wait to put in my 2 cents about this book. A definite must on your bookshelf (www.safaribooksonline.com)!!!</span>

                    <span>There are so many books out about ASP.NET it can be a very difficult task to choose one. To me there seems to be two types of books. One is the example intensive (at times over laden) book. The other is the "how it works" type of book. The market seems to be flooded with example intensive books, but appears light in the "how it works" type. This book is a fantastic "how it works" book. It has good examples but is not drowning in them. The book's strength is its explanations of ASP.NET core topics, and the little tips and tricks that readers will pick up along the way.<p>This book is well written and flows nicely. Without a doubt it is an excellent book for beginners and intermediate levels, but I would bet that even advanced users would pick up tips and tricks from the book. <p>Summary<p>Chapter 1: Architecture<br>This chapter explains the basic new architecture behind ASP.NET. <br>Compilation vs. Interpretation, Code-behind, new Page architecture, Shadow Copying, Directives, and new Intrinsic Objects (HttpRequest, HttpResponse, etc) are a few of the topics covered.<br> <br>Chapter 2: Web Forms  <br>This chapter is all about Web Forms. ViewState, HtmlControls, <br>WebControls, and Events are some of the items discussed. One section I liked the best was the "Day in the life of a page". It explained the step by step events that occur during a page's lifetime in a very clear and concise manner.<p>Chapter 3: Configuration <br>This is an excellent chapter that discusses the new XML based <br>configuration in ASP.NET. Web.Config, Machine.Config, and <br>configuration hierarchy are examined. processModel and other elements are also discussed.<p>Chapter 4: HTTP Pipeline  <br>This chapter goes over the HTTP Pipeline, and all the actions that take place each time a requests comes in. It goes into great coverage of how that request is routed through the architecture. It also goes over Context, Applications, Custom Handlers, and a few other related topics. This is a great chapter.<p>Chapter 5: Diagnostics and Error Handling <br>This chapter shows us how to get out of the classic response.write method of debugging ASP apps by examining the new diagnostic and error handling capabilities of ASP.NET. Page Tracing, Application-level Tracing, Error Handling, and Unhandled Exceptions are all discussed. <p>Chapter 6: Validation <br>This is a chapter that explains form validation (client and server-side), validation control architecture, and the validation controls. <p>Chapter 7: Data Binding <br>This chapter starts by explaining the fundamentals of binding data to controls, and then goes into IDataReader Binding, DataSet Binding, and picking when to use a DataSet vs DataReader. The chapter ends by discussing templated controls (DataGrid, Repeater, and DataList). <p>Chapter 8: Custom Controls <br>This is the largest chapter of the book (69 pages). This chapter <br>covers custom control fundamentals, state management consideration when designing custom controls, composite controls, and user controls. Designer integration with VS.Net as well as validation and data binding within custom controls is also covered. This is an excellent chapter.<p>Chapter 9: Caching <br>This chapter discusses the new caching opportunities that exist in ASP.NET. Output caching and how it works is discussed. The <br>VaryByParam attribute is also examined, as well as page fragment <br>caching. The chapter also covers data caching, and consideration and guidelines for using it. <p>Chapter 10: State Management <br>Application state, session state, cookie state, and view state are all covered in this chapter. I think this is a great chapter because it discusses the pros and cons of each type of state, which will help developers be able to determine which type of state management would be best for their specific situation. Good discussion, with great insights. <p>Chapter 11: Security <br>A short chapter on security ends the book. Server and client <p>authentication start the chapter out, and then we go into ASP.NET security. The authentication and authentication elements in the web.config file are both discussed, as is role-based authentication. System identity is the last topic discussed. <p>I give this book a 9 out of 10. It would be a great addition to any developer's library. There is also another version of the book with examples in C# for you semicolon worshipers. Well done!</span>

                    <span>Excellent ASP.NET Book. My compliments to the author. No .net marketing, clear language and excellent chapters on configuration,validation,and especially custom handlers.My library is mostly Wrox, but lately their books lost a lot of quality. I will take an extra look at .NET Developer Series from Addison-Wesley from now on</span>
