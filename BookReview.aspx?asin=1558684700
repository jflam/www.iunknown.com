                    <span>This is one of the better Colorado photography books out there.  While the photos are not consistently great, they are consistently good.  Wunrow spent a lot of time hiking to remote areas of Colorado, which is to be commended.  I do recommend 'Colorado II' by David Muench over this book, but I have ranked 'Mountains of Colorado' as the third best book on my list of 'Best Colorado Picture Books' (which can be seen by clicking on my name and looking at the Listmania lists).</span>

                    <span>Catch a glimpse of some of the more rare and overlooked vistas that this  amazing state has to offer. Wunrow offers an incredible visual aesthetic in  both photography and book design that takes the reader on a voyage to all  corners of this wonderfully diverse state. A keen eye for composition,  combined with strenuous backcountry hiking to areas unknown to even avid  backpackers like myself, the images are striking and sometimes haunting.   Former Governor Lamm's essays are engaging and well written, and form a  wonderful complement to the photographs. Highly recommended for anyone  looking to enjoy the most uniquely magnificent and previously unpublished  views of America's most beautiful state.</span>

                    <span>I moved to Colorado in 1989.  Without fail, when friends and relatives come to visit, they marvel at the beauty of the scenery, awesome landscape and amazing sights nature has handmade in Colorado's mountains.  This book  has made a perfect holiday gift for all those friends and relatives who  only dream of being here in Colorado every day!  From winter to summer,  the Mountains of Colorado has it all!  Without a doubt, the most beautiful  photpgraphs I have ever seen!</span>
