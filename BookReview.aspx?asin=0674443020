                <span id="Label1">The leaders of the American Revolution, writes the distinguished historian Bernard Bailyn, were radicals. But their concern was not to correct inequalities of class or income, not to remake the social order, but to "purify a corrupt constitution and fight off the apparent growth of prerogative power." They wished, in other words, to mend a broken system and improve upon it. In doing so they drew on many traditions of political and social thought, ranging from English conservative philosophers to exponents of the continental Enlightenment, from backward-looking interpretations of ancient Roman civilization to forward-looking views of a new American people. Bailyn carefully examines these sources of sometimes conflicting ideas and considers how the framers of the Constitution resolved them in their inventive doctrine of federalism.</span>

                    <span>Bernard Bailyn's "The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution" is a truly masterful work. Bailyn gets to the heart of the radicalism of the American Revolution: a deep suspicion of government power, particularly centralizing power. 
<br />
<br />I also must agree with reviewer Ken Riley about the non-influence of Christianity in revolutionary thought. Bailyn shows the the Enlightenment influence of Locke, Montesquieu, Algernon Sidney, Harrington, and even Rousseau. The attempt of fundamentalist Christians to portray the Founders as evangelicals and the Revolution as a Christian revival is both dishonest and criminal. This book was written long before such right-wing nonsense became popular. The American Revolution was an Enlightenment revolution and the most radical of all modern revolutions. Bailyn clearly shows the ideological ideals as one of liberty, freedom, suspicion of all government power, the ancient rights of Englishmen, and the sovereignty of the people.
<br />
<br />These rights are traced back to ancient Roman law, Anglo-Saxon law,and as stated by another reviewer Danelaw. Nowhere are there references to the book of Exodus,Deuteronomy. or Leviticus as the source of anglo american philosophy. Conservative and religious fanatics who peddle their version of history are either lying or totally ignorant of the truth. Bailyn smashes all of these false theories and presents the origins of the Revolution in all it's glory.</span>

                    <span>Long before there were bloggers and political pundits there were the pamphleteers.  Bernard Bailyn shows just how important pamphleteering was in getting the message out.  Take Tom Paine's Common Sense for instance.  More than 200,000 copies were distributed throughout the colonies, making it a runaway bestseller in its day.  He championed universal suffrage, the unicameral legislature and a clean break from England.  He was countered by John Adams, who, in Thoughts on Government, felt a more prudent course was in order.  Bailyn gleens from these famous pamphlets and many others and presenting a very compelling history of the American Revolution.  It was a revolution in thought as well as government, that eventually saw Adams' Federalist ideas seize the upper hand.  But, Pennsylvania initially adopted many of Paine's ideas, creating the only unicameral legislature in the United States, and extending voting rights to most men.
<br />
<br />My book is heavily tagged, because there is so much to draw from these pages.  Bailyn lays the foundations for the political discourse that would shape our nation.  At times this discourse could be quite vehement in its pronouncements and its denunciations. It was never boring. Tom Paine emerges as one of the heros in this book, championing The Rights of Man, which have a far greater impact 50 years later when Andrew Jackson rode into the White House declaring himself a champion of the common man.</span>

                    <span>This is the critically acclaimed book by Bernard Bailyn that stands in contradistinction to Charles Baird's Economic Interpretation. With unusual courage, Bailyn attempts to understand the founders as they understood themselves. In the preface, Bailyn recalls the "intense excitement" and "sense of discovery" he felt at Harvard Universtiy when he studied the ideological themes of revolutionary America. This excitement and sense of discovery is passed along to the reader.<p>This is a very scholarly work. The extensive footnotes are fabulous. I especially enjoyed the chapter called "Power and Liberty". Bailyn develops the pre-revolutionary idea that the ultimate explanation of every political controversy is the disposition of power. Power is defined as "dominion" or the human control of human life. With dozens of fascinating examples, Bailyn illustrates why power is essential to the maintenance of liberty, but dangerous and in need of restraint lest it extend itself beyond legitimate boundaries. <p>I found it refreshing to read a book about America's founding that didn't condescend or politicize. It wasn't until I read this book that I fully appreciated how impoverished my public school education was on the topic. You wont be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>This book really opened my eyes to the 'ideas' behind the Revolution. There are so many books written on 'what' happened or 'how' it happened but really penetrating the 'why' of it has been a challenge or, at least, overly simplistic or optimistic. <p>It is arguable that a majority either did not want a break with Britain or were not overly aware that such a break was being considered. Most considered themselves to be English and thought that the English constitution had simply become corrupt, progressively moreso, and here in the land they had colonized was an opportunity for British subjects to replicate the best the English constitution held.  <p>Bailyn approaches this topic from an angle that very few have thought about prior, at least not in such detail and on such a scale, that of reading through the writings of the pamphleteers.  Orwell and Marx were pamphleteers.  Remember, this was long before mass media. Television, radio and other forms of instant communication were not to be found. The pamphlets were one of the prominent means of communicating ideas. <p>It is in exploring these ideas and ideals that we begin to see from another angle just what it was that led to the break with Britain. It was gradual and it was subtle, not intentionally so in the beginning nor premeditated.  Call it the Zeitgest, but it was not so simple as we are often led to believe. Bailyn explores in depth through what was written in the pamphlets and really seems to get into the minds of the writers and those whose ideas were the impetus toward a full scale revolution.   <p>This book provided me with a fresh perspective. While his prose is lucid and clear, the subject matter is thick with detail and requires active engagement with the book. But this makes it all the more worth your while.  I really believe that if you seek to understand the Revolution, you must have this book.</span>

                    <span>When it comes to American history, it is arguably so that the most important dates or events, whivhever you prefer, is the American Revolution.  The dates run from about 1764, with the passage of the Sugar Act to 1783 the Peace of Paris was decided, or even as late as 1787 when Delaware became the first state in the Union.  However you look at it, there is no one text that gives you a better, more thorough telling and understanding of the most important time in out history, before we officially had a country to even have a history, than The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution by Bernard Bailyn.  This is the most thorough and most balanced fusion of primary documents and secondary analysis.  Every topic is important every conclusion is crucial to understanding the truth about this great and terrible period in our history.  It receives my highest recommendation.</span>
