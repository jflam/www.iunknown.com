                <span id="Label1">With its support for fast and efficient COM components, the Active Template Library (ATL) 3 is probably the preferred method of writing code with today's Visual C++. There is perhaps no better choice for getting started with ATL than <I>Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming</I>, a guide that covers all the basics for anyone with some C++ experience who is new to this powerful library.<p> This title strikes a valuable balance between exploring the ATL wizards in Visual C++ 6 and explaining (and tweaking) this tool-generated code. Early sections look at the basics of COM, from basic interfaces and conventions. At first, code is written manually without ATL. The book then turns to the Visual C++ wizards for writing COM components. A notable section here covers the many "maps" that are used by ATL to show off where to customize events and other custom features. The authors also do a good job with the basics of dual interfaces (for OLE Automation) and remote COM (DCOM).<p> ATL 3 can be used to manage windows and dialog controls, and the book points the way to working with basic and advanced dialog components (including common controls). This text culminates in a tutorial on ATL controls (which can be used on the Web inside Internet Explorer). The authors provide a step-by-step guide to creating a fully functional ATL component (which displays URLs inside a TreeView). <p> The new ATL 3 offers a lot to developers, and <I>Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming</I> shows you how to take advantage of its built-in strengths. ATL is still tough terrain to master, but this title matches the right level of technical detail with tutorial code that really does put this powerful library into the hands of every C++ developer. Read it to start mastering the premier framework for Visual C++. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: COM basics, the IUnknown interface, MIDL and type libraries, in-process and out-of-process COM servers, ATL COM wizards, ATL architecture and maps, containment and aggregation, IDispatch and OLE Automation, dual interfaces, scripting with Visual C++, Visual Basic and Visual J++, DCOM basics, marshaling, threading and apartments, ATL window classes, ATL classes for dialog controls, connection points and events, control properties, persistence and property bags, tutorial for full ActiveX controls, property pages, stock and ambient properties.</span>

                    <span>This book promises so much. It has well thought out chapter headings, great diagrams and what appears to be great content. But when you start reading it, the book manages to make the simplest things complicated and convoluted. 
<br />
<br />I would have given it zero stars if I could...it is that bad. 
<br />
<br />I know it sounds extreme, but from this book you won't even understand the concepts you have already mastered.
<br />
<br />It was so bad I abandoned it at chapter 3 and have marked the cover "for reference only".
<br />
<br />Having bought many, many books from Amazon, this is my first review where I felt so strongly about this book, that I took time out to write this, so that others do not waste their money and more importantly, their time. This book was that bad and I do not exaggerate.

                    <span>When I started with ATL COM I had but little choice apart from this book. Since there are too many heads on each and every WROX book they spoil the broth. IT IS NOT FOR THE BEGINERS NEITHER FOR THE INTERMIDIATE. And now that I have got around 2 and 1/2 years of experience I still find it intimidating. <p>Best way to Start will be <br>1) Read Inside COM (Microsoft) Inside Out. <br>2) Graduate to Andrew Troelsen's Developer's Workshop to COM and ATL 3.0. The best that any one can get.<br>3) And Do read the MSDN.<br>4) For those who want then to jump into COM+ bandwagan read through Pradeep Tapadiya's 'COM+ Programming: A Practical Guide Using Visual C++ and ATL'<p>That will make you day. And hey don't forget to read the postings at develop.com and anything written by Don Box/Jefrey Richter.<p>Bottom Line - STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK</span>

                    <span>I am a fourth year college student, and I have currently finished chapter 3 of this book (It's over Christmas break, so it's a little slow). I read the Amazon reviews and found some of them rather misleading. <p>Many readers gave this book bad reviews simply because they didn't have the proper experience to read this book. At the back cover of the book, it states that "You should be fairly experienced in C++ and Windows programming." to read this book. Furthermore, it recommends one to read Ivor Horton's Beginning Visual C++ 6 before reading this book. Those recommendations are laughable, and led to a great number of people to buy the wrong book. <p>First, if your background is primarily in VB, and your experience of C++ only came from 1 or 2 semesters of C++ lessons from college, you may need to brush up on your OOP skills. The book discusses in detail certain advanced features of C++ such as exception handling mechanisms (global unwinding). It also makes heavy use of C, for example, it uses frequently <static_cast> and <reinterpret_cast>. I thought I was a pretty experienced C++ programmer when I took CS201, but that class does nothing to prepare me for this book. I would suggest anyone who needs to brush up on C++ to read Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language before taking on this book.<p>Secondly, the book suggests that it is geared "primarily at Visual C++ 6 developers". It's terribly vague. The suggested reading of Beginning Visual C++ 6 will not help you much since it primarily covers how to use MFC. The ATL 3 book makes heavy use of Win API 32 function calls, and I would suggest that people read Charles Petzold's Programming Windows for the GUI part, and Jeffrey Richter's Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows before commencing work on this book. If you don't know the material covered by those two suggested readings, you would be very confused by ATL.<p>Finally, it wouldn't hurt if you tried your hands on MFC for a little, but so far (up to chapter 3), I didn't feel that there was a great deal of knowledge needed about MFC. I couldn't recommend any good books for MFC since I haven't read any. By the way, I think Ivor Horton's book on Beginning Visual C++ 6 sucked. He sucked even more in his Beginning Java 2. Oh well, poor guy :(<p>After you have acquired all the proper experiences, the book would appear fairly involved, but not overwhelming. Things are clearly explained when you read them carefully. Like many Wrox books, though, it doesn't discuss some of the finer points twice, but overall, the book should serve as a good primer on ATL for those studious enough to make it.</span>

                    <span>This book reads poorly. The author clearly understands the technology, but just as clearly does not know how to communicate that effectively in the written word. The writing is overly verbose ['In the previous discussion we obviously ommitted any reference to a topic that desires more exploration.'] Good writing--esp. technical writing--needs to be clear and to the point. This book is a difficult read, and I gave up after 12 pages. It is the editor's job, and the publisher's responsibility to insure that a technical book is clear to the average reader in the target audience. I wasted 40 bucks...don't you.</span>
