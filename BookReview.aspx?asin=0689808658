                <span id="Label1">Robert Sabuda is to pop-up art what the International Grandmaster is to chess, and it isn't for nothing that he's described on the back of this book as a "paper engineer." As the title suggests, this whimsical, old-fashioned, elegant book embodies the Traditional Song of Abundant Giving--each verse of "The 12 Days of Christmas" is illustrated with a different pop-up creation. Some are relatively simple, such as the partridge (made of just two pieces of hinged paper) that opens its wings above some pears. Still, there is something unexpectedly bold about how the bird literally flies out over the top margin of the page. Other pop-ups are more characteristically bravura creations: the "Ten pipers piping" are crafted explicitly as decorative paper cut-outs, but the scissors that cut them are part of the pop-up, too. Perhaps the most complex of the set is "Eleven Ladies Dancing." Interpreted as an old-fashioned music box, the 11 ladies dancing are little ballerinas, and the music box is complete with drawer, back-mirror, and winding key. Sabuda's masterful <I>The 12 Days of Christmas</I> is full of nostalgia for the magic of childhood celebration--kids and adults alike would be happy to receive this book as a holiday gift. (Ages 3 to 103) <I>--Richard Farr</I> </span>

                    <span>A wonderful version of the traditional song. There are many different folds and techniques used in this fairly compact book as well as interesting literary devices which lift this well out of the commonplace. Each odd numbered day of the song is given one and a half pages which are full of a miracle of cutting and folding.( apologies for the rhetoric but I LOVE this book ). The pages are in large blocks of colour which offset beatifully the mostly white pop-up creations and the, very different, white text.Each even-numbered day folds out from the half page left into an equivalent full page which is also coloured with white card pop-ups which are delicate paper cutouts All of the gifts are truly represented, but with a twist. All are also common gifts or images of a traditional Christmas. e.g The five Gold rings are shiny gold rings set on a white reindeer's antler-tips. The eight maids a-milking are Christmas cookies on a tray. The wonderful swans are in a snow-globe that also incorporates perspex through which we see not only the swans swimming , but also the snow falling! One has to look hard to find the eleventh lady dancing on the music box. The use of colour on each page is superb. Not one part of the book detracts from any other part. We are now all lookign forward to finding a copy of Sabuda's ABC book . This also has the same use of white cut-outs moving against a single colour background. There is so much that is excellent about this book that it would take a long time for the novelty to wear off. There are several layers to it and never does Sabuda seem to rely on the tricks of paper engineering to carry the book. It stands out in so many areas. With my children ( and others) we have readit, sung it, played with it, copied it and discussed the traditions behind the song and the gift versions in the book. Yet whenever it comes down off the shelf ( It is a seasonal treat or for rainy or sick days - or College assignments! ) everyone gets excited all over again.</span>

                    <span>This is a book I get out every Christmas and is displayed with great care. My children love this book but can only look at it under my supervision due to the delicate nature of the detailed pop-up pages. Would make a great gift for anyone and is truely a favorite reading during the holidays.</span>

                    <span>This is the only book I ever remember reading from Robert Sabuda. And this book is a lot diffrent from other books you may have seen or read, this is a pop up book, and every time you turn the page or open a pocket, a ptucre of the ideam of the number oyu are on jumps out at you, like a ptcure of a deer (I think) that you seen with 5 gold rings on it antlers. Really you should know how the song goes, so I am not going though the whole song, and if I did that, it would take to long because for a lot of it, I have to repeat the lines over and ovver and over again from 1 to 12. In a lot of books, you see a year that the book was published and other infromation about the book, but you don't get it, there is about 13 pages in this book, and on some of it numbers share the same page as the preious number. I don't know who wrote the song or why they decided to keep repating the lines over and over and over again. And is the 12 days of Chirstmas supposed to start the 12 days before Christmas, or they are 12 days of December 25. And if you celbrate Chrsitmas, you may want to add this to your trations if you don't, or do this as a Christmas tration if you have kids in the fututre.</span>

                    <span>The classic Christmas song is illustrated in all of its verses in this charming book. The pop-up pictures are delightful, and some of the depictions actually are exquisite, halfway between oragami and sculpture. The art is the work of a visionary. This is a lovely book for children, but adults really may appreciate it more than little ones do.</span>
