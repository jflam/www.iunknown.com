                <span id="Label1"><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The genome's been mapped. But what does it mean?</H4><P>Arguably the most significant scientific discoveru of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life.</P><P>Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means for you, for your children, and for humankind.</P></span>

                    <span>I am not a big fan of science. I was never inspired by the subject, too many long and confusing names. Instead I fancy myself a writer, and reading is more my passion. With this brief background out of the way, I must say that book -Genome by Matt Ridley is very good read.<BR>	Everyday the public hears about advances in the field of science such as cloning, mapping human DNA sequences, and genetic engineering. To many people, these misunderstood concepts instill fear and paranoia. We fear what we do not understand, and with this in mind, Mr. Ridley sets out to explain to people like me what is happening in language that we can understand.<BR>	The book itself is split up into 23 chapters, one for every chromosome of our genome. Then he focuses on one gene from the chapter's chromosome and looks into its role in the development of our species. Recognizing the difficulty of attracting a reading base of people who gave up on understanding science years ago, Ridley gives each chapter an eye catching name such as Sex, Intelligence, and Immortality. He then embarks on a colorful and intriguing journey through the human genome that leaves us wanting more. But wait that is only the beginning. Ridley refrains from boring us with a textbook writing style (the hip bones connected the thigh bone, the tight bones connected to the foot bone) and instead chooses to keep us awake by describing each chromosome with a captivating story related to that chromosomes' purpose. In covering such a massive subject, Ridley provides just enough specific storytelling to keep us focused. These concise narratives on subject such as asthma (Chapter 5) or Prader-Willi syndrome (Chapter 15) are very nice, because aside from the fact that they educated you, they can make you sound very smart at a party. Did you know that 97% of our genome is "genetic junk," and not useful to us at all, or that "we are, to a ninety-eight per approximation, chimpanzees" (Chapter 2)<BR>	But the most attractive feature of this book is the energy "mock my zeal if you wish" (Chapter 1) with which Ridley puts into his writing. To get people excited about something, you have to be excited yourself. This book brims from page 1 to 313 with passion and enthusiasm, and the reader is swept away in torrents of thrilling possibilities and provocative argument, after which we are left begging for more. <BR>	So there you have it, Genome by Matt Ridley, an entertaining and understandable look at the exciting progress and the promising future for the study, exploration, and eventual mastering of the recipe of life, the genome. But all of the excitement should be calmed with a bit of a warning from the man himself: "the genome, great book that it is, may give us the bleakest kind of self-knowledge: the knowledge of our destiny, not the kind of knowledge that you can do something about." (Chapter 4)</span>

                    <span>The field of genetics is doubling knowledge every few weeks. So Matt<br>Ridley had set himself an impossible task in writing one of the last<br>books before the completion of the Human Genome project. Yet, he has<br>created a book of unique value to all of us as the full impact of<br>genetic knowledge begins to take over our world.<P>Forget 99 percent<br>of what you have ever heard about genes. The school wasted your time<br>with obsolete knowledge that wasn't in the ball park, in most<br>cases.<P>What Ridley has done is given us a roadmap of the kind of<br>territory and effects that occur within our genes, and among our<br>minds, bodies, and genes. The interrelationships are extremely<br>complex and diverse. Beware any simple judgments about what genetics<br>mean, as a result.<P>What was most impressive to me was the remarkable<br>potential to use genetic information to shed light on all kinds of<br>issues. For example, the genetic record can give insights into the<br>development of species, past expansion of nomadic peoples, language,<br>personality, stress, memory, sex, instinct and the effect of the<br>environment. <P>To give us each a full panoply of ideas about<br>genetics, he adopted the interesting structure of having one chapter<br>about each chromosome. The chapter is not exhaustive, but picks on<br>one or a few aspects of what is known or is in the process of becoming<br>known.<P>Fear not! I never took biology, and know little biological<br>jargon. Yet the book portrayed the ideas and information simply and<br>clearly enough that I don't think I got lost anywhere.<P>The only part<br>of the book that I did not like was a completely unsatisfactory<br>discussion of what free will is in the last chapter. Skip that and<br>you'll enjoy the book a lot more.<P>How accurate is the book? In five<br>chapters, I had read source books or articles referred to by Ridley,<br>and each was well chosen for what he was trying to do and scrupulously<br>described. Of course, we are still up against the fact that we know<br>very little on this whole subject.<P>This is the most stimulating<br>science book that I have read in a long time. I even liked in better<br>than The Selfish Gene, which I thought was a terrific book (which is<br>also referred to and discussed in this book). <P>I found that the<br>book stimulated a lot of new thinking on my part. Fifteen minutes<br>with the book led to four hours of conjecture on several occasions. I<br>liked that feature of the book.<P>Have a great time reading this book<br>and thinking about its implications for your own life!<br><br><br><br><br></span>

I wish he had left out his entire discussion of human history for instance. The stuff about meat, metabolism and the brain in evolution, for instance, is rather ridiculous really, because there are so many millions of people who live their entire lives without meat. The factual arguments he gave for it are simply not true. <P>Made me wonder what else he got wrong, and although parts are quite interesting, I found myself losing interest because I saw stuff that was misleading or untrue.</span>
