                    <span>i ordered this, based largely on the concept, which seemed like a book on gay history that was much needed to fill in the gaps. instead, the book comes off as if Kaiser got a nice advance and then needed to submit *some* kind of manuscript, but he had lots of other things to do, so he did the absolute minimal amount of new research. instead, he relies heavily on taped interviews with 6 or 7 gay men to fill out the pages. The chapter on the '70s, one of the most important decades in gay history, has nothing more than former bartenders saying that "the Mineshaft was wild, man" and a politico friend of his talking about how he semi-came out of the closet. No sense of the "gay metropolis" here, just a random series of unconnected anecdotes. I hope he got a nice advance, but this book isn't really worth actually BUYING - just check it out at the library, in all its dismalness, and see for yourself. </span>

                    <span>Highly detailed, highly readable, and more than a little dishy, Kaiser's chronicle of post-WWII gay life and culture is told through the stories of the individuals -- activists, celebrities, writers; many fascinating, some tragic -- who shaped it.  The book's focus on New York gay males is a limitation, of course, but this is still a rich and essential volume in 20th century gay history.</span>

                    <span>There is much to enjoy in the Gay Metropolis (subtitled the landmark history of gay life in America since World War II).  The history is presented as a series of observations and anecdotes from many people who lived in the gay scene during this time.  The subtitle is a little misleading as the book is really only covering New York and not America and there is no he said, she said as it is basically (with a few very interesting exceptions) only men who are covered in this book.  It is by no means a definitive history but it is an entertaining read as the stories are usually told well and are intimately personal.  As the book goes on, most readers over the age of thirty will learn nothing new but it still reads quickly and pleasantly.  A fun volume for the general reader of a slice of the Big Apple gay life.</span>

                    <span>A charming history of gay life in New York City (and by extension, the world) from 1940-1996. Scholars will dig the history, gossips will exult in learning who was doing whom. It has those tersely journalistic minichapters that keep you reading "just one more" until three in the morning. A good book for toilet visits, subway reads (about two stops to digest a section), or curling up on the couch by an open window in winter waiting for snow. It is by turns witty, lurid, hilarious, informative, erotic, and touching--all the elements which comprise daily life in New York City. The Gay Metropolis is an intellectual turn-on, whether you're gay, straight or in between. You don't have to be gay to read it, though it might make you wish you were if you're not.</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful, wonderful read!  Go and get this book for yourselves to read. Find out who you are, and where you came from, and where you have the power to go.Obtain strength from others you read in this book. Charles  Kaiser has concentrated on New York, but it does not detract from an  overall understanding of the 20th Century gay tapestry. The use of New York  could probably be seen as symbolic for the broader gay  commonwealth.Probably a wise move. The decision to make this mainly an oral  history was most likely a wise one as well.It brought this book, and our  community's history to life in a way that traditional academic writing  cannot possibly achieve. Kaiser has very pertinently compared our situation  with all other minorities, and it's what we have in common that counts, not  the differences.<p>The treatment of our history in different decades was  the most interesting feature - the 2nd World War, and the 1990's being the  most interesting and illuminating episodes, in an episode-filled book. The  history of the '80s was the hardest to read, but to appreciate what Kaiser  writes of the 1990s, it's necessary to read the book from beginning to  end.<p>As a group, we still need positive reinforcement, and this book does  it beautifully. You won't regret reading it, and I am indebted to a  wonderful straight friend for bringing this back from New York as a present  for me.</span>
