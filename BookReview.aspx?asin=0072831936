                    <span>I used this book for my undergrad introductory corporate finance class and the structure of the book is just great. The early chapters does a superb job getting across the basics of finance (NPV, IRR), while the later ones give a general look at more complex issues such as dividend policy and corp fin for M&A.

                    <span>First off, I never had any particular interest in the area of Finance.  I simply purchased this book as a required text for the core finance course in my MBA program.  All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The course was very informative, with a top-notch professor leading us through the material.  But even more than the lectures, this book was my primary resource for guiding me through the principles of Corporate Finance.  Ross does a great job of clearly explaining each topic, then supporting his explanation with effective examples.<p>Even though the book is well written, I can't deny that it was still challenging for a finance novice, such as myself.  But Ross's clean, to-the-point style was a refreshing way for me to approach a previously unknown topic.<p>Of all my textbooks, I typically keep about half of them as references, and sell the rest.  This book is definitely a keeper.</span>

                    <span>Along with Brigham's MBA text, this book is one of the elites for an MBA finance course.  One thing many of the negative reviewers don't seem to realize is that this is for graduate students.  If you've never had an undergraduate class in finance, you don't belong in a course using this book.  If you don't know the principles of finance or how to use your calculator/spreadsheet, that is your problem.  You're a graduate student - grow up and prepare yourself for graduate study!<p>For students who are ready for graduate study, this book is wonderful.  It is complete in its coverage of corporate finance topics, and it provides ample practice problems and end-of-chapter exercises to test your understanding along the way.  The CFA exam recommends this as the basic reference book for exam preparation because, comparatively speaking, it is very user friendly.<p>Those who complain about the level of difficulty or the lack of "entertainment" value need to learn how to take responsibility for STUDYING a text instead of just reading it.  Either that or move to a discipline that is less rigorous.  The books only get more difficult to handle as you work your way up in finance.</span>

                    <span>This is the WORST book I have used in my study of finance.  It is full of errors and it is written in such a way that it is extremely hard to understand for an average student.  There are lots of calculations that are unexplained, assumtions are made that are never addressed,and it is just plain vague in virtually all subjects it discusses.  Buy  a different title if you actually want to learn about finance.</span>
