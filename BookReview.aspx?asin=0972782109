                    <span>I'm a businessman and I've been reading management and personal growth books for years. I highly recommend this book. I read it in just a few hours, (it is very clearly written), and I have since given copies to every one of my managers and employees. I consider it a must read for business people, but it really hits home at home as well. <P>I have read and reread Shad Helmstetter's earlier book, "What to Say When You Talk to Your Self," and agree with a lot of other people that it is one of the best self-help books ever written. This one is even better. The reason is because it lays out the most practical solution for building a life or building a business, or anything else you want to do, that I have ever seen. I was applying the ideas even before I finished reading the book.<P>Dr. Helmstetter is world famous for being a leading behavioral researcher and self-help author. With his thirty years of research and experience, and now with what he has to offer in this new book, I would say he is at the top of the list.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Shad Helmstetter has scored another home run with his powerful new personal success book. He tells you exactly what is the difference between people who succeed -and truly enjoy life - and those who don't. And what's even better, I found it to be presented in an easy-to-understand way. <P>I've read a lot of success books and this one is different; it's in the "best" category. Dr. Helmstetter has boiled down his 30 years of learning and research into a 3-part strategy that makes getting what you want a sure thing. They are based on his three major breakthrough discoveries: <P>1. Personal Coaching: All self-help works better, when you have help. In fact, it's best to take the "self" out of self-help. <P>2. Self-Talk: Change your Self-Talk and you will change your programs. Change your programs and you will change your life.<P>3. Active Goal-Setting: Successful goal-setting follows specific steps. If you want your goals to work, they need to be set and tracked in the right way.<P>I interviewed Shad Helmstetter on "The Inside Success Show" and he was great! His book is one of the best personal achievement books I've read, and his style is very personable, which makes it a fun read.<P>Here's some other things you can learn from Dr Helmstetter:<P>** How Shad Helmstetter started doing Life Coaching 30 years ago<BR>** Why your mental programs "control" your life and how to change them<BR>** What you can do to program you children for success<BR>** How to use goal setting to really get what you want <BR>** Why you must use all 8 essential steps when set goals<BR>** How to find the right coach (and avoid the bad ones)<BR>** And much, much more ...<P>Dr. Helmstetter is a genius when it comes to personal achievement and I highly recommend his book.<P>Randy (Dr. Proactive) Gilbert, best-selling author of "Success Bound"</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is one of those exceptional new books that actually makes a difference. After reviewing several of Dr. Helmstetter's previous books, (most notably, "What To Say When You Talk To Your Self") I was hoping for the best, but wasn't sure what to expect. His new book "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" not only surprised me, as a totally helpful book with new insight, it blew me away. This is the stuff to which all good self-help books should aspire.<P>No matter how many previous books I had read by Dr. Helmstetter, it is true that he had kept coming up with more of the basic "truths" of "getting better." So in reading this book I was hoping for more of the same (new truths) but not expecting anything life-changing. (After all, how many new "paths to personal success" can there be?) But that is why I was so impressed with this one. What he wrote in this book, for most readers, chould be life-changing.<P>After studying human behavior and personal motivation for thirty years, in "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?," Dr. Helmstetter made the great choice to give his readers, in one, very simply easy-to-read book, the best -- and the most practical personal growth steps he has learned in his many years of studying what makes things works for us, and what stops us. In this book he delivers what I suspect may be his final answer.<P>Instead of a rehash on how and why "success" works, (and Dr. Helmstetter makes it clear early on that this is NOT about just financial success), instead of reading another self-help book, I found myself sitting at the arm of someone who has not only been there, but who talks to the reader as someone who knows you, and someone who has been there. The message he delivers, clearly and simply written, would be a great "life plan" or "daily plan" for anyone who wants to get past the "distractions of every day living," as he calls it, and get on with their lives - and actually DO something with every day that we wake up.<P>The substance of this book has to do with what Dr. Helmstetter has found to be the "key players" in an average individual's life success. Those are such things as a very different kind of goal-setting, changing our old mental programs with Self-Talk, and, what I believe may be a major breakthrough from the earlier self-help books we have read, "taking the 'self' out of self-help." <P>What impressed me most about Dr. Helmstetter's solutions to each of these self-help challenges, is that, instead of just telling us to work at the problem, be positive, and get better, (the theme of a lot of other books I have reviewed), he gives the reader steps that are so practical, that I was convinved, even early in the book, that anyone could do them, on an average day, without anyone having to make life-changing choices to try them out.<P>We've had some very astute self-help authors enlighten and help us during the past two or three decades -- Napolean Hill, Maxwell Maltz, Norman Vincent Peale, and Dale Carnegie to name a few. Unfortunately, though they are no longer with us, their books, and what they taught us stays with us. As someone who has reviewed and recommended their books, I am happy that the torch has been passed. Dr. Helmstetter continues to explore the outer reaches of our potential, and in spite of the scientific side of his research into human potential, continues to write books that bring the best of what he has learned home to all of us. Fortunately, as a tribute to his writing, and the ease of reading this book, (I read it in two evenings), Dr. Helmstetter understands real people. His entire book could was read -- and understood -- by my teenage son. <P>This book is going to change a lot of lives -- for the better. It is also a great tribute to someone who could have just written another "self-help" book, but he didn't. In "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" Dr. Helmstetter gives us an exceptional insight into the world of personal growth, brings us up to date, and gives us the most practical solutions that he has found. Whether you're working with losing weight, getting your family right, or launching a new career, this book gives you a path to follow.<P>I've read the other reviews about "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" on Amazon.com and they all look good. They should. This is one book you cannot miss. Better than every other five star book this author has written. This one is five stars or better.</span>

                    <span>A lot of the other reviews about this book have said that the author, Shad Helmstetter, has clearly done it again. I agree -- only this time, even more so! He's done it! I not only love this book -- I receommend it to everyone.<P>This book goes beyone the self-help books I have read or reviewed in the past. First there were other great authors like Napolean Hill, Maxwell Maltz, Dr. Peale, and Dale Carnegie. Meanwhile, Shad Helmstetter was doing research in the field of personal growth and motivation and writing great books on what he found. When Dr. Helmstetter wrote "What To Say When You Talk To Your Self" he wrote a classic (which I still highly recommend), and with that book he entered the rarified field of exceptional authors in personal growth. <P>After reading the next ten books he wrote, when I learned Dr. Helmstetter had released a new book, I was personally hoping for his "final answer". The new book, "Who Are You And What Do You Want?" not only met my expections, it blew me away. I have never read a book on personal or business growth that is more practical and to the point.<P>In "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" he brings the best personal growth ideas together, for the first time. You'll find that it makes so much sense that you'll be trying out the ideas while you're reading the book. I was amazed at what I found out about myself, and about what I wanted to do next.<P>One of the things that surprised me about this book is how simple Dr. Helmstetter makes his case for what to do next, regardless of where you are now, or what the problems is, or what the goal is. There is not one line of pop-psychogy jargon in the entire book. True to his writing style in his previous books, you get the feeling when you're reading that he's talking to you as a friend who's been there.<P>As someone who reads and reviews a lot of books in this field, I tend to get skeptical. But after reading the first few pages of this book, I knew I was reading another classic book in personal growth. I read on the cover of the book that Dr. Helmstetter's books are published in 65 countries. This one should make it worldwide.<BR> <P>A number of years ago, when I first read "What To Say When You Talk To Your Self" I thought that was a book that could not be topped. But "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" rises above even that. This one gets five stars plus! If you want to get your personal life or your buisness life figured out, and get the clearest picture you may ever read of what to do next, written by someone who you know, in every word, cares about you, get this and read it. It is thiry years of discovery in self-help and personal growth written plainly in two evenings of reading. Wherever your are in your life, or whatever your challenges or what you want to do next, this is one of the most clear and helpful self-help books I have ever read. I agree. <BR>Whether it's becoming more successful in your career, making your family work, or losing the next ten pounds, this one can actually help. <P>Out of five gold stars, I agree with the other people who have reviewed "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" This book gets ten.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Helmstetter's new book is definitely a breakthrough and well worth reading anytime you'd like to get better at anything! In this book he has brought together the three best concepts in self-help he studied in twenty-five years of research, and the combination is something awesome. Like a lot of other people, I've read quite a few self-help books with good concepts, but this one is far and above the best. It puts it all together and makes it simple, and gives very practical advice and steps to follow.<P>The section on active goal setting alone makes this book ground-breaking. It even shows you why many goal-setting programs stop working after a while and gives you a way to set goals that takes only a few minutes but really works. By the time I finished reading I had already started setting my own goals differently, especially the short term goals which end up being the most important. <P>I had also never read anywhere the idea of taking the three different personal growth concepts that the author writes about in this book and then putting them together and using all three at the same time. This is a brilliant solution to so many of the problems people have when they are trying to change or get better. But because the author spent so much time studying these concepts and the people who used them, he has been able to simplify the whole process of self-improvement and show us how we can use these same concepts and apply them immediately. <P>Another thing I found very valuble was the update on programming and the best ways to change your self-talk. This section clearly shows why Dr. Helmstetter is not only the leading pioneer in the field of self-talk and programming, and how the brain gets programmed for success or failure, (I read his first book on the subject fifteen years ago), but he's still the best when it comes to the latest research in that field, and then writing about it and showing us what to do about it. You should still read his earlier book "What To Say When You Talk To Your Self" to get the basics, but the new book brings it all up to date from there, and tells you what Dr. Helmstetter has learned from twenty years of follow-up research. <P>I wish I could have read this book fifteen years ago. It definitely brings together what I was looking for in self-talk, self-help, goal-setting, motivation. I will look forward to any new book from Dr. Helmstetter, but I don't see how you can do better than this. "Who Are You Really And What Do You Want?" rates 10 stars!</span>
