                    <span>I have over 10 Schaum's guides for my various courses.  I would say this OS guide is perhaps the best one along with the Seymour Lipschutz's erudite "probability" (not to be confused with Murray R. Spiegel's befuddled attempt for Schaum's).<p>The last reviewer's comments seemed unwarranted especially since this book has more then enough problems on semaphores even if it's not as strong on file systems.  This book is spot on covering the important parts of the classic operating systems curriculum from the sublime Tannebaum to the feckless Nutt.  This book has an abundance of sample problems from all the major topics: File Systems, Interprocess communication, Device I/O, Networks, Security, and the dreaded Virtual Memory.  Besides this the author covers algorithms, from the Philosophers to Bankers, from Hard drive c-scan to Paging LRU.  I find the author easy to understand, complete, and very much in tune with what you will likely be tested on.  I can honestly say this 200 page book was more valuable to me then the pescribed text.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a rigorous review to supplement my Operating Systems course and I found that this book certainly fell short of that.  I wanted more practice for the kinds of questions we would get on exams, but many of the topics addressed were treated at too simplistic of a level.<p>I also would have have preferred a range of examples dealing with topics like semaphores and mutual exclusion, deadlock, file systems, but instead all the sample questions were disappointing and I found myself actually wasting time with this book.  It would have been more productive to have just stuck with the textbook.  Usually Schaum's does a good job, but I think they seriously fell short with their Operating Systems book.</span>
