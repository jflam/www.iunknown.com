                    <span>Not suitable for MFC begginers, but very good and informative book for professionals. It is writen in very good manner - it is easy to read and understand even complex topics<br>MFC Internals are described in attractive way, so is not boring to read a book.<br>So, I like a way the books is writen and I like its content.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best book for MFC and what it does inside. This is not an  introductory book and if you are new to MFC you'd be better served by  reading Kruglinki's Programming Visual C++.</span>

                    <span>Are you still amazed what's going on behind the scenes? If yes, buy this!  It's a great book to enjoy exploration of MFC. Navigate with it and then  try yourself. You'll probably find America... I would say, authors have  taken a great pain to construct such a good material.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very difficult to understand without extensive knowledge of MFC programming to start with.  I thought learning MFC with learning what happens under the hood of MFC at the same time would make me a better MFC  programmer, but that is not the case.  The book assumes quite a bit of MFC  knowledge to start.  I have had a large amount of experience with C++ and  Java with through knowledge of object oriented programming.  I am also  familiar with Visual Basic.  I have other MFC books to couple my learning  of MFC with, but this book is only for the pros who has been developing MFC  apps for a while.</span>

                    <span>I think this is possibly the definative text on MFC all the rest are superficial at best! This book is for people with 2 years + experience in VC++ programming. I am saying this because only then you really begin to  appreciate what MFC is all about and you have a good grip on MFC already.  This is not for the weak hearted or the lazy! Also Scott Wingo when is the  next release?</span>
