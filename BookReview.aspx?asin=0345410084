                    <span>I first got to know Hunter S. Thompson through the worst possible way: the movie version of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Don't get me wrong, I loved the film then and I still love it now, but it is one of the riskiest ways to get introduced to this brilliant author.
<br />The thing is, I became instantly smitten with Johnny Depp's performance and I was completely won over by the brilliant humour, but after the film was over, well... it was a fun ride but, hey, that was it. Besides the humour, and the prodigious drug taking, there was not much insight that I got out of it, so Hunter dropped off my radar for some years.
<br />All of that changed when I picked up the Rum Diary two years ago, recognized the author, and decided to give it a spin. Boy, am I glad I did that, otherwise I would have missed out on one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century!
<br />Hunter S. Thompson is a MONSTER writer, and he is one of the most original, funniest and insightful voices I have ever heard in my entire life! He is brilliant, a master of hyperbolic realism, and reading his books is like engaging in a late night conversation with a genius: it can be funny, disconcerting, gross, insightful, frenetic but always unforgettable.
<br />Hell's Angel's - the book that first cast the spotlight on Hunter - is a perfect example. I didn't buy this book because I was particularly interested in the Angels - I'm not! - or even motorcycles -  I don't really care about them, to be honest. I bought it, because I knew that it would read like the brilliant account of a writer who is so talented that he can make any subject interesting, whether you had any interest in it or not!
<br />I exaggerate, of course. You have to be attuned to Hunter's sensibility first, to his Fear and Loathing, to his take no prisoners sense of humour - which has the calculated subtlety of a nuclear bomb! - but if you are, man, what a ride!
<br />This book fits like a glove in the main theme of Hunter's oeuvre - The American Dream, or rather, What became of the American Dream - and what starts as a character study on one of the last embodiments of the Dream turns out to be something quite different...
<br />There are many layers in this book, some frightening insight, brilliant analysis and, of course, a superb sense of humour.
<br />If you are familiar with Hunter, you already know this but if all of you've read, or heard about, revolves around "Fear and Loathing..." give this one a try. There is a lot more to the Good Doctor than what his wild legend might suggest.

                    <span>I read this work while recouping from an operation. I could really identify with his tale of life with the Angels as I at only twelve years old was on the yearly, family summer vacation at Bass Lake when the Angels arrived in the evening. I now at 52 remember the experience as graphic as HST desribed it as I ran up to the highway after being awaken by the ground shaking noise of I do not know how many hundred knuckle, pan, and shovelheads slowly cruising around the Lake with a right hand on the throttle and the left hand holding an open bottle. It showed an expression of freedom that most will never know. It was one of the best books that I will ever read. </span>

                    <span>The 60's were a time of social protest and upheaval. Many changes both good and bad came to American society. This strange period also allowed for many innovations and changes to be brought to journalism and literature. Hunter S Thompson emerged from the mountains of Kentucky to become a journalistic legend. His brand of gonzo journalism was a perfect fit for the times. He was the whiskey drinking, drug abusing wild man always willing to go over the edge to get the story. 
<br />
<br />During the mid-60's, Thompson decided to ride with the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. There was a lot of press about this gang and he wanted to get the real story. He wanted to understand and reveal the psychology behind these vagabond outlaws. 
<br />
<br />This required gaining their trust to be allowed to ride with them and hang out with them on runs. He convinced them of his intent to write a truthful account of their culture and lifestyle. They were always wary of reporters who merely wanted sensationalist shock stories. This distrust provided Thompson with a major challenge. Many members never warmed up to Thompson at all. 
<br />
<br />Thompson was able to gain enough trust to learn a lot of their rituals and beliefs. Sonny Barger, the leader of the Angels was intrigued with the idea of having an honest book written about their "club". Thompson rode with them, partied with them and went with them on runs. He ultimately ended up getting stomped on by several members of the gang who didn't want the book to be published. This beating effectively terminated Thompson's relationship with the Hell's Angels. 
<br />
<br />The result of this association is "Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrifying Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gang". This book was first published in 1966 and it must have been shocking for that era. It was raw and graphic in its frankness. It was the book that made Thompson a legend (even before Fear & Loathing). 
<br />
<br />The Hell's Angels were hardly model citizens. They were dirty, crude drunken drug abusers. Fighting and rape were among their hobbies. One ritual upon entering the club is that members would all urinate on the jacket of the new member. This is certainly not a book for the queasy or faint of heart. 
<br />
<br />The Angels combine conformity with outsider status. They become outlaws to society yet conform to their own group standards. Their violence is standard to mob violence throughout history. Many members have lives outside the club but once together they become a gang. When that happens baser instincts begin to emerge. Soon they begin to behave like English soccer hooligans. 
<br />
<br />Thompson does an outstanding job of trying to piece together all the different elements of this society. Scorn for police and law is coupled with a curious patriotism. The Angels hated war protesters and offered to go to Vietnam to fight. President Johnson declined this offer. They get drunk, take drugs, commit crimes and yet are extremely loyal to one another. The phrase "Honor among thieves" apparently has some truth to it. 
<br />
<br />Many passages in this book are hard to take. The misogyny and violence is startling. Thompson is to be commended for trying to reach the truth. He does not set out to make them look bad nor does he romanticize them. This book is a fascinating account of this underbelly of American society. It will shock and disturb many but I believe there is much that can be learned in this book, but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Thompson, but very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.</span>

                    <span>Hell's Angels is a Thompson classic. It is a tale that not only covers the Hell's Angels from the inside, but also an expose on irresponsible reporting that drove America into a frenzy over the outlaw motorcycle group. While the book is dated as a whole, I feel that Thompson's depiction of the American response to the Hell's Angels is very relevant today. It showed me that our society that is seemingly ruled by fear, uncertainty and doubt has indeed been present for quite some time now.
<br />
<br />Overall, Hell's Angels is an amusing, funny and at times shocking read. Highly Recommended.</span>
