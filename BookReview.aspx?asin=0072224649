                    <span>I found this book to be exactly what I needed (and had been looking for for quite a while): information that capitalized on my UD4 experience and helped make the transition to DWMX, concrete examples that led to building two great sites, a side-by-side comparison of Cold Fusion MX to help me figure out what all the CF hullabaloo was about, and a sense of humor in the writing.<BR>As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, there is one time where the book calls for an extension that must be purchased ... and a couple of times where extensions must be utilized which reportedly do not work with MX (they do work-the author's book support site tells you how to make very minor code tweaks). This should not be enough to make anyone decide not to purchase the book. The author's book support site ... is truly supportive and helped me with above issues very quickly. <BR>Buy the book. It's absolutely essential.</span>

                    <span>I will not be able to say enough about this book in a single review. Dreamweaver MX is an absolute treasure chest and a developer's dream, but before I bought this book, I had no idea. I have used Dreamweaver for years, but Dreamweaver MX is an altogether different beast. First and foremost, the author has a very engaging writing style. I was not bored or worse yet, overwhelmed by the coverage. Second, he has put together some very cool applications. He walks you through the development and deployment of every application, allowing you to get up and running with Dreamweaver MX in no time. If you know Dreamweaver, you can use this book to take advantage of the new MX functionality. If you don't know Dreamweaver, buy this book, and the author will teach you to build practical web applications. This is a solid 5-stars.</span>

                    <span>I was really disappointed when I got this book. I opened it up and it was written exclusively for Windows users. :-( I wouldn't have ordered it had I known. <P>Additionally, the projects are not anything I will likely ever do and some of the step-by-step instructions are somewhat on the basic side and a real waste of space. (I already know how to fill a rectangular selection with colour.) Plus, the necessity of other third party softwares (which are also Windows exclusive) left me with nothing to gain from this book.</span>
