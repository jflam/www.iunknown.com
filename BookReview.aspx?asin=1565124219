                <span id="Label1">Picture a magical, sugar-fueled road trip with Willy Wonka behind the wheel and David Sedaris riding shotgun, complete with chocolate-stained roadmaps and the colorful confetti of spent candy wrappers flying in your cocoa powder dust. If you can imagine such a manic journey--better yet, if you can imagine being a hungry hitchhiker who's swept through America's forgotten candy meccas: Philadelphia (Peanut Chews), Sioux City (Twin Bing), Nashville (Goo Goo Cluster), Boise (Idaho Spud) and beyond--then <I>Candyfreak: A Journey through the Chocolate Underbelly of America</I>, Steve Almond's impossible-to-put down portrait of regional candy makers and the author's own obsession with all-things sweet, would be your Fodor's guide to this gonzo tour.<p>  With the aptly named Almond (don't even think of bringing up the Almond Joy bit--coconut is Almond's kryptonite), obsession is putting it mildly. Almond loves candy like no other man in America. To wit: the author has "three to seven pounds" of candy in his house at all times. And then there's the Kit Kat Darks incident; Almond has a case of the short-lived confection squirreled away in an undisclosed warehouse. "I had decided to write about candy because I assumed it would be fun and frivolous and distracting," confesses Almond. "It would allow me to reconnect to the single, untarnished pleasure of my childhood. But, of course, there are no untarnished pleasures. That is only something the admen of our time would like us to believe." Almond's bittersweet nostalgia is balanced by a fiercely independent spirit--the same underdog quality on display by the small candy makers whose entire existence (and livelihood) is forever shadowed by the Big Three: Hershey's, Mars, and Nestle. <p>  Almond possesses an original, heartfelt, passionate voice; a writer brave enough to express sheer joy. Early on his tour he becomes entranced with that candy factory staple, the "enrober"--imagine an industrial-size version of the glaze waterfall on the production line at your local Krispy Kreme, but oozing chocolate--dubbing it "the money shot of candy production." And while he writes about candy with the sensibilities of a serious food critic (complimenting his beloved Kit Kat Dark for its "dignified sheen," "puddinglike creaminess," "coffee overtones," and "slightly cloying wafer") words like "nutmeats" and "rack fees" send him into an adolescent twitter. <p>  <blockquote>...the Marathon Bar, which stormed the racks in 1974, enjoyed a meteoric rise, died young, and left a beautiful corpse. The Marathon: a rope of caramel covered in chocolate, not even a solid piece that is, half air holes, an obvious rip-off to anyone who has mastered the basic Piagetian stages, but we couldn't resist the gimmick. And then, as if we weren't bamboozled enough, there was the sleek red package, which included a ruler on the back and thereby affirmed the First Rule of Male Adolescence: <I>If you give a teenage boy a candy bar with a ruler on the back of the package, he will measure his dick</I></blockquote><p>  <I>Candyfreak</I> is one of those endearing, quirky titles that defy swift categorization. One of those rare books that you'll want to tear right through, one you won't soon stop talking about. And eager readers beware: It's impossible to flip through ten pages of this sweet little book without reaching for a piece of chocolate. <I>--Brad Thomas Parsons</I></span>

                    <span>If you have any sense of awe in regard to childhood, and Americana, Candyfreak is worth your time . Reading this book reminded me of growing up, hanging around the candy store (or counter), and the salivation of opening the wrapper of newfound sweetness.

<br />Candyfreak is what its name infers, but aren't we all that way too?  </span>

                    <span>Almond writes with pulsing personality and sensual joie de vivre.
<br />
<br />This book is a unique mix of journalism, obsession, and personal revelations.
<br />
<br />The weakness... visits to the candy companies become repetitous.
<br />
<br />The strength... scenes of the author's childhood, his frailties, his stabs at adult love, and his disquiet about America. 
<br />
<br />Almond's most poignant writing involves his sadness and doubt. Read this for his courage and candor, his observations on our individual quests and our strange society.

                    <span>Imagine an adult who is just as fascinated by candy as he was when he was eight years old. That is Steve Almond, mid-thirties, English professor, candyfreak.
<br />
<br />It's even better being a candyfreak when you are an adult, because you can buy all the candy you want. And you can even eat all the candy you want, if like Almond, you are an ectomorph who never gains weight. 
<br />
<br />Candyfreak, the book, is a journey through the history of candy in America, and one man's relationship with candy. When Almond is talking about candy -- visiting candy factories, reminiscing about candies past, or discussing the attributes of candy, he is quite good. I enjoyed being reminded of some of my old favorites such as U-No and Kits and Sixlets. But when Almond gets more personal, I found myself skipping chunks of the book. This surprised me, because I usually like memoirs and personal essays. I found I just didn't care about Almond's personal quirks or even his politics, even though I usually agreed with him.
<br />
<br />An index would have been helpful, to look up those specific candy bars you are wondering about. Even if you think you aren't interested in the history of candy bars or in candy trivia, you will find yourself compelled to find out what is in a candy bar called "Chicken Dinner" or "Vegetable Sandwich," or why it's called "Three Musketeers."

                    <span>it's pretty amateur writing-- a better edit would have helped a lot, and some stronger direction for the author. (in the list of links in the back of the book, the description for one is "This person rocks my world." --um, you couldn't give us anything more than that? like, why?) the stuff about the author's childhood is mildly intersting; it's a lot better when he finally visits the chocolate factories. the descriptions of the owners of the factories is great and the interviews are fun too... that's where the book really picks up.</span>

                    <span>and call this sweet.  It is a good read, especially having first listened to the man speak at an author event, knowing that he really is a living breathing candy freak.  You really should take this into consideration while reading it, because it certainly makes the story that much more fun.  But the underside of this "sweet" story is how big business is killing what was once the sweet spot of America, the mom and pop shop.  That's the saddest part of this otherwise, fun and entertaining adventure.  But despite whatever your politics, you cannot help but agree that big business is killing us, and so is the food they're producing.  For all you youngsters out there - yes, there was a time when a person opened a business to produce products simply because the owner was passionate about them. And for that, the quality showed. This book gives you a glimpse of those now fading days. Just listen to your grandparents pine for the good old days, when Cracker Jack actually gave you a prize that didn't break the first time you played with it.  How many of the prizes they offer today will find their way to Antiques Roadshow one day?  And do they even offer prizes anymore?  Heck, do they even make Cracker Jack anymore?  In fact, the way quality is going, antiques themselves will one day be a thing of the past (Yogi Berra, is that you?).  But until the last family owned candy factory is closed for good, take it upon yourself to read this book to learn that a handful of these factories do still exist in various regions across the country.  Then vow to yourself to seek out and only patronize the local mom and pop shops instead of the chains, and help bring back the sweet spots that built this nation. </span>
