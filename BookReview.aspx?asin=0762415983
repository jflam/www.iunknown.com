                    <span>I have had this book for quite a few years and finally decided to read it.  I found that this book (often quoted in corporate america) was good but not the best book on strategy that I have ever read.  I believe that his writings were very well done and provided some good insight as to how to strategize and understand your enemies.  I believe that a solid person with good life experiences would understand many of these situations already.  There was some valuable information though and I can see how this information was conveyed into corporate culture.  </span>

<br />This edition of "The Art of War" (from Running Press) is indeed a small volume - a miniature book that will just about fit in a shirt pocket.  The contents, however, are quite impressive.  Sun Tzu's book is not only the earliest known treatise on warfare and  strategy, it is still considered to be quite profound and one of the most important ever written.
<br />
<br />If you would like a more hefty volume - a real book - you might want to consider getting "The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Special Edition" (ISBN 0976072696 ) which contains two separate versions of the Giles translation, one with and one without commentary and annotation.
<br />
<br />Regardless of which edition you get, you will be richly rewarded.  To share the thoughts and considerations of a genius, across a time span of two and a half millennia, is a rare privilege.  </span>

                    <span>Well, I decided to check out Sun Tzu's art of war, since it's one of those books that you always find people discussing. Although I did not read this translation, but one that I found in a local bookshop, I was quite disappointed. The book gives you some understanding of the warfare of Sun Tzu's era, but I found the parts of it that can be applied to modern life are scant. What's more, what *can* be applied to contemporary life is all very obvious anyway. It can really be summed up in the following sentence: don't be stupid. So, for people looking to gain some valuable insight, it will probably be a disappointment. For those looking to discover something about the warfare of Sun Tzu's time, this will probably be a pretty good book to read.
<br />
<br />Like another reviewer mentioned: "Art of War's popularity outstrips its actual greatness."</span>

                    <span>Both this and Machiavelli's "The Price" are small books but the knowledge in them are priceless.
<br />
<br />Sun Tzu has many great points the greatest being "if you do not know how to win, then you can not win."  Sun Tzu teaches you to think strategically, how to appraise your advisary, how to apparise the timing and locations of your perspective conflict, and how to appraise yourself.
<br />
<br />Sun Tzu is basically telling the reader that conflict can be broken down systematically and that once you learn how to read the conflict you can make decision were you gain the most and lose the least.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Now my beef with that yuppie who wrote "Sun Tzu is a sissy".  You sir are a Jackass, Sun Tzu says aviod conflict where you are going to lose, not to aviod all conflict.  Of course if you will gain in a conflict you should pursue it, but Sun Tzu does say perpetual conflict is unhealthy, which is true.  Perpetual conflict wears you down and eventually you will make a mistake and disappear in the long line of jackasses that never learned this.  Just because sucessful people in business are predatory does not mean Sun Tzu was wrong.  Those people that heavly invested in the Stock Market right after 9-11 were following Sun Tzu's advice, they seen their advisaries were weak(all the morons leaving), they seen the time was right(fatalistic the world is ending BS in the news), and they acted(got heavly invested in the market).  Shortly after that the market rebounded and now they are out with a healthy profit.
<br />
<br />Sun Tzu's systematic thinking is the cornerstone of good judgement, just because you read at a public school in Texas's sixth grade level does not mean Sun Tzu is wrong.  you are just  a bafoon tring to make a quick buck on a catchy name.  Ya jackass........</span>
