                    <span>I have reviewed alot of Oracle SQL books and you would have to spend alot of money to get what this book delivers.  You get the skinny on SQL.  It mainly covers Oracle, but mentions the other databases thoughout the book.  I go to this book when I need the syntax of how to construct a SQL statement.  Very good book.</span>

                    <span>When I was doing sorta minimal SQL and mostly concentrating on programming, database administration and debugging, the fairly sketchy SQL books I happened to buy first were good enough. <p>But recently I've started doing lots of web-database development, writing much more complex queries and having to be a lot smarter about SQL. This book has been quite helpful.  Yes, there are a lot of words here, and yes, I would have trimmed a couple of chapters.  But the book explains a great deal of complex info and is written very clearly.  It's clear that the author is tied to real world -- I gather from his bio that he's a web application developer in real life. Wish I'd bought the book earlier. <p>When I want to quickly remind myself of some common bit of syntax, there are other books where I can find the info quicker.  But when I have those "gee, how am I going to do *this*?" moments, this is the book I grab.</span>

                    <span>And just read the SQL reference in whatever DB product you have (Oracle, SQL Server, Informix, etc).  Nothing new here except added verbiage which just takes longer to sift through.</span>

                    <span>SQL has come from the dusts and cobwebs of Codd-Date academia journals to a business use language. Rafe has written one of the best books I have browsed through. I develop in MS Access and the jump from Access to SQL  Server or Oracle is intimidating. Even though MS says that the transition  is easy, these are essentially different animals with different properties  and behaviours.<p>The content design means that one can improve on one's  knowledge of any (generic) product and still have an intro to a specific  product.<p>The tips pages on the inside covers are a very good idea.<p>In  such a high quality book however, the quality control of content does have  a few bad spots.<p>And Rafe, stay away from words like  "egregious" - we're here to learn SQL not English</span>

                    <span>The copy my company owns is so good, I decided to buy one for myself! This is an excellent reference to SQL and database design in general, from a basic discussion of the normal forms to the most complex applications of  SQL. I use it as a learning tool as well as a reference. It features easy,  understandable examples and discussions of the real-world differences  between databases, application servers, and development techniques. Highly  recommended.</span>
