                <span id="Label1">From bringing in new clients to delivering the final proofs, this book covers all aspects of the highly competitive business of high school portrait photography. Studio owners will learn how to create interest in their product by drawing clients to their studio through appropriate advertising that both targets teenagers and appeals to their parents. Ideas for postcards, CD-ROM business cards, T-shirts, and other materials to help boost a studio's visibility are detailed. Once photographers have learned how to create interest in their product, they will learn how to create an attractive environment in their studio-what styles and types of images should be on display, and how to discuss make-or-break issues such as pricing. Technical advice is also provided on indoor studio- and window-lighting setups, outdoor photography, lighting, sets, exposure, and more.</span>

                    <span>Wicked cool. I learned so much from this book and my business reflects it. Vayo is both descriptive and imaginative. The pictures reflect the many ideas you would never think of. This book brings a lot to the table for both amateur and professional photographers.</span>

                    <span>Pretty pictures and informational text, can't ask for much more than that right? Vayo is not a writer by trade, but she certainly knows the business of photography--and customer service. This book is a quick how-to read for anyone interested in the business of senior portrait photography, and the themes can be carried over to pretty much any other form of commercial photography. She just knows what she's talking about.</span>
