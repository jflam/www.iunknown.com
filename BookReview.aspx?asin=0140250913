                <span id="Label1">Where's your next disease coming from? From anywhere in the world--from overflowing sewage in Cairo, from a war zone in Rwanda, from an energy-efficient office building in California, from a pig farm in China or North Carolina. "Preparedness demands understanding," writes Pulitzer-winning journalist Laurie Garrett, and in this precursor to <I>Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health</I>, she shows a clear understanding of the patterns lying beneath the new diseases in the headlines (AIDS, Lyme) and the old ones resurgent (tuberculosis, cholera). As the human population explodes, ecologies collapse and simplify, and disease organisms move into the gaps. As globalization continues, diseases can move from one country to another as fast as an airplane can fly.<p>  <blockquote>While the human race battles itself ... the advantage moves to the microbes' court. They are our predators and they will be victorious if we, Homo sapiens, do not learn how to live in a rational global village that affords the microbes few opportunities.</blockquote><p>  Her picture is not entirely bleak. Epidemics grow when a disease outbreak is amplified--by contaminated water supplies, by shared needles, by recirculated air, by prostitution. And controlling the amplifiers of disease is within our power; it's a matter of money, people, and will. <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I></span>

                    <span>With recent news blurbs concerning the possible threat from strains of the West Nile virus in the northeastern part of the country this summer, the urgent importance of this book is quietly being reinforced. This important effort by journalist Laurie Garrett is a whopper; a long, carefully documented and quite readable text giving an overview of the worldwide efforts of the "insect fighters' at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) of the U.S. Public Health Service and other agencies ranging from the U.N to state, university and local agencies to combat a panoply of both new biological agents like HIV, Ebola, and the West Nile virus as well as new and much more virulent and drug-resistant strains of old enemies like tuberculosis, bubonic plague, a number of venereal diseases, and complex new public health concerns like Toxic Shock Syndrome. <P>Ms Garrett's highly detailed and exhaustively documented thesis, written while on a graduate fellowship at Harvard, is both frightening and hard to ignore. She posits that through our environmental arrogance and stupidity, the general medical strategies of the western societies, and our consistent overuse of antibiotics, we are quickly losing the continuing fight to keep the general public of both the postindustrial nations and the less developed world safe from the wild panoply of microbiological agents that are out there in the environment, and we are, through our encroachment on wilderness areas never before populated by humans, unnecessarily introducing segments of the population to new microbiological agents who then find a vector or path into human habitation and resultant infection. Moreover, the increasing levels of world commerce and concomitant travel among the nations of the world mean that someone infected in the jungles of South America or equatorial Africa can be in a restaurant in New York City or at the beach on Martha's Vineyard several days later as the agent starts its formidable and often highly contagious microbiological attack. This is truly scary stuff.<P>One becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of the general public and for our relative lack of public health preparedness as one winds through the pages of this long book. The approach is one of individual story telling, and while this makes the book much more readable and entertaining, it also tends to repeat a lot of information that one could otherwise avoid. Yet this is truly a minor quibble with a facintaing and fact-packed book that often made me feel like I was taking a graduate seminar in "Current Issues in Infectious Epidemiology". It's tone is both approachable and yet scholarly, a rare treat to enjoy, and Ms Garrett's obvious intelligence and ability to communicate shines here, as she makes complex environmental, infectious disease, and human issues converge in an understandable and compelling way. <P>Finally, she makes an excellent case for increased public awareness as well as immediate political action to restore and reinvigorate the vitality and capability of our local, state, and national public health agencies, and certainly has increased my own awareness and concern for the ongoing scientific effort to battle the microbes. If her argument that many of the gains of the 20th century in public health (and the healthy longevity we enjoy as a result) are increasingly at risk is correct, we must take action to combat the wide range of problems she discusses to avoid a serious long-term breakdown in our public health system. This is an important book that has sparked a serious national and international public debate about some critically important issues that could literally potentially affect billions of people across the globe. I recommend it, hope it will be even more widely read, and hope you read it, too.</span>

                    <span>This immense book is one I'm now reading for the fourth time, cover to cover. Ms. Garrett presents some complex ideas about virology, microbes, and the science of disease investigation - but presents it in a reader-friendly way. Her audience is exposed to what we see today with SARS, when we wonder what, exactly, the CDC and WHO are doing out there. It describes them nearly in the terms of an NTSB go-team, which is a concept most aren't aware of.<P>Beyond the factual interest in diseases, Ms. Garrett also delves - quite successfully - into the policy arena. She points out, better than anyone else I've read so far, how things we think don't matter to us in fact really do. If you've ever skimmed through the world section of your news, thinking ah, what do I care, some third world people are diseased. In this age of travel, urbanization, and other very simple things - it DOES potentially affect you. There is a trickle down effect that is amazing to watch unfold, and Ms. Garrett does a wonderful job of taking readers, step by step, from one epidemic to another, until it dawns on the reader - this doesn't end the way we want it to.<P>I'd call it recommended reading for anyone interested in the subjects addressed, in foreign policy, in getting a better grasp of our world...in short, for everyone.</span>

                    <span>Garrett presents much very interesting information about some of the most deadly diseases in the world, like Machupo and Lassa fever. There are fantastic accounts of how these diseases have been tracked to their sources, or attempted to be tracked to their sources, and how they have been combated thus far. The point is quite well made that these threats are still looming on the horizon and humanity will need to be continually finding more effective ways of control. However, along with all the true accounts and bits of scientific relevance is a running liberal commentary, which is to be expected from somebody with ties to Harvard, I guess. It slows down the narrative with its inevitable logical contradictions, especially when dealing with the AIDS issue and "alternative lifestyles"--homosexuality is shown to be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS, yet the problem is not homosexuality, but ineffective control measures...hmmmm (and somehow, even things like States' rights get brought in). The book is at times exciting and frightening, but you have to be able to stomach a large dose of liberal hogwash in your diet to be able to choke this one down. Personally, I had trouble with some bad after-taste.</span>

                    <span>Outstanding! This book is an excellent read! I read the Hot Zone 2 years ago and this is even better. Garrett gives fantastic insight and detail concerning many deadly viruses that have attacked humankind in the 20th century and continue to threaten us. Not only this, but she goes on to highlight the feats and bravery of the scientist that have gone to battle with these horrific microbes over the past century. A stunning account of how disease is a part of nature, yet we as humans often aid to its spread. A sobering, eye opening book. As unsettling as it is, some nights it was hard to put down. One of the best books I've ever read. Bravo for Ms. Garrett</span>
