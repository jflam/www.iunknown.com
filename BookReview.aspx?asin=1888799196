                    <span>This text is an excellent reference which contains many<BR>cases on clinical malpractice . The author details the<BR>facts of each case and presents legal outcomes together with<BR>the individual stories behind each legal complaint. This book<BR>is a goldmine for anyone even considering the formulation of<BR>a legal claim against a doctor or institution. The author<BR>explains many of the fine legal nuances in plain English.<BR>Here is a typical sample:<P>"The jury gave Mrs. Cook over one million dollars. It was the<BR>first malpractice case in which TD resulted in a million-dollar<BR>verdict for the plaintiff. It was not all that much money, considering the outcome. Mrs. Cook has severe contorting movements that she cannot control. There are no medicines that can help her. The standard ones we use reserpine and tetrabenazine, tend to cause severe depression in susceptible individuals. And no one could be more susceptible than Mrs.Cook."</span>

                    <span>If anyone is interested in reading about a physician(neurologist) who has learned the ropes of the court system and whoentertains the reader with forensic medical tales, this is the book to read and savor. Although Dr. Klawans is a frequent medical expert witness for both sides of the versus, he does not hesitate to use the term "hired gun" for impartial medical experts and minces no words in describing the shortcomings of the tort system. In case after case, Dr. Klawans describes how the system works as he plays the role of expert for both plaintiffs and defendants in medical malpractice cases. I recommend this book particularly for physicians who need a distraction from the present travails of corporate socialized medicine (managed care). It will also help them get through the ropes of the court system, if and when he or she is summoned to participate in courtroom proceedings and chances are, he or she will!<P>Miguel A. Faria, Jr., M.D., Editor-in-Chief of the Medical Sentinel of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) and author of Medical Warrior: Fighting Corporate Socialized Medicine.</span>

                    <span>As a newly-trained neurologist, I was fascinated by these tales of neurology and the law, from both plaintiff's and defense's viewpoint. Though the stories are dated, the general principles are all too true, and teach physician and patient alike why lawsuits occur.</span>
