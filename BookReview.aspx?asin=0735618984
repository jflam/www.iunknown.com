                    <span>If you are planning a massive desktop deployment than this is book you should use. I had no previous experience in doing an unattended install and this book walked me through the entire process following the distribution sample provided in Chapter 7.  Mr. Honeycutt has left no stone unturned.  His book gives you in-depth technical information and tools to deploy and manage Microsoft Windows XP Desktop. With it, you get prescriptive guidance to help choose the best deployment method and tools for common scenarios; perform attended and unattended installations; automate the deployment process, control policy and profile settings for desktop operating systems and applications; automate deployments for Office and other programs; and more. The book comes with a CDROM containing extra documentation, tools, sample templates, and scripts. Just add your Windows XP I386 files and half the battle is done.  This is a great book and well written.  Thanks Jerry for writing something for my simple mind!

                    <span>This book is a great resource for helping to plan the deployment of XP.  I've been able to use many of the ideas and tips from the book to help redesign my deployment plan for my own company.  A great job was done by Jerry in writing and explaining the different ways to deploy XP.  Excellent Job, Excellent Book!!!</span>

                    <span>The "Desktop Deployment Resource Kit" is exactly what I have been
<br />looking for. Standardizing all of my desktops to Windows XP will be a challenge and the most challenging part seems to be honing in on what my team needs to know.
<br />
<br />This book lays it out so you can read through topics quickly while keeping the big picture in play.  When I begin my project I am sure it will be a constant companion to help me though some of the tough spots.
<br />
<br />Thanks Jerry!
