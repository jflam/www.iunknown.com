<h3 class="title">Thanks for fixing the most annoying feature in VS</h3>

<p>This feature that Scott Swanson describes is <span class="caps">BY FAR </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottsw/archive/2004/04/21.aspx">the most annoying feature in <span class="caps">VS.NET 2002</span> and 2003</a>. When you hit <span class="caps">CTRL</span>-ALT-F2 to bring up the Help Index, my immediate next keystroke is <span class="caps">ALT</span>-L to guarantee that the focus is set to the "Look For" box. How many times have you brought up the index, started typing and started changing the freaking filter drop-down selection instead? It does a nice job of locking up your computer for a few minutes while it thinks. I'm <strong>very happy</strong> that it's (finally) being fixed in Whidbey - the filter combo is no longer in the tab order. </p>

<h3 class="title">Seriously scary stuff</h3>

<p>Over lunch one day, an attendee who attended the Jesper Johansson's "How to get your Network hacked in 10 easy steps" talk scared the h*** out of me. Some really scary observations:</p>


<ul>
<li>How powerful pre-computed hashtable attacks are. Apparently you can crack 10 character passwords stored in the <span class="caps">SAM</span> in 1 minute via pre-computed hashtable attacks. This is a very powerful motivation for introducing salted hashes into the <span class="caps">SAM.</span></li>
<li>Pointers to where you can download <a href="http://www.rootkit.com">rootkits</a>. There's some interesting discussions there on how to hide processes from task manager / user mode code.</li>
<li>One particularly scary attack is the <a href="http://www.rootkit.com/newsread.php?newsid=72">VideoCardKit</a>. In this (theoretical?) attack, the subversive code hides in flash memory of various pieces of hardware on your computer: <span class="caps">BIOS,</span> video <span class="caps">BIOS, HDD</span> controller <span class="caps">BIOS</span> etc. Wow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Tech Ed Reflections</h3>

<p>After an entirely uneventful and on-time flight back to Toronto, I finally have some cycles to reflect on Tech Ed. A reliable network connection also helps :)</p>

<p>I had a chance to catch up with a lot of old friends at Tech Ed. I'd like to wish the good folks at <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> all the best. It was a lot of fun catching up with Fritz, Aaron, Keith and Mike. </p>

<p>I had a chance to meet <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> in person. His code generation <span class="caps">BOF</span> was one of my highlights from this year's Tech Ed. Scott is seriously funny too - I hope he didn't mind my hijacking his <span class="caps">BOF</span> for a few minutes to rant about the abuse of <span class="caps">XML.</span></p>

<p>A few other bloggers came up to me and introduced themselves at the <span class="caps">BOF. A</span> shout out to <a href="http://benjaminm.net/default.aspx">Benjamin Mitchell</a>, and <a href="http://bristowe.com/blog/">John Bristowe</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/akipman">Alex Kipman</a> and I got a chance to bond over some good food, drinks and music. It was fun meeting some of the other folks who work with Alex - maybe once he starts blogging he can drag Marie, Justin and Scott into the fold as well. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/">Josh Ledgard</a> points out in my comments that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottsw">Scott Swanson</a> already has a blog. It's amazing the power of context since I'm sure there's lots of guys named Scott that work at <span class="caps">MS </span>:)</p>

<p>It was fun to finally meet Richard Ersek, a PM on the <span class="caps">IIS</span> team who I worked closely with to put together our pre-conference tutorial. The <span class="caps">IIS</span> and <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> teams are finally in the same org now at <span class="caps">MS,</span> so folks in the <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> community will be hearing a lot more from Richard in the future. </p>

<p>A <em>really</em> big surprise this year was running into <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000446.html">Mark Miller</a>, the evil genius behind <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/?section=/Products/NET/CodeRush">CodeRush</a>. I see that <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/default.aspx?key=2004-05-27T21:27:38Z">Keith I Hate Software that requires admin privileges Brown</a> has discovered why Mark needs to stop writing software as a local admin. Mark and I are old friends from our Borland Conference days - it's good to see that Mark is as high-energy as ever. </p>

<h3 class="title">I'm outing you, Alex!</h3>

<p>MSBuild Program Manager extraordinaire, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/akipman">Alex Kipman</a> has sort-of started a blog. While the blog is there Alex hasn't actually <em>posted</em> anything yet. So, this pointer is my attempt to enlist public peer pressure to get Alex to start posting :)</p>

<p>If you're at Tech Ed, make sure that you drop by Alex's session: Visual Studio 2005: Managing the Enterprise Build Process with MSBuild on Friday at 1pm in room 31ABC. If Alex finishes the demos that he was building in his hotel room earlier this week, you should all be in for a real treat!</p>

<h3 class="title">Hanging out with the MSCOM folks</h3>

<p>Earlier this week, I had a fun time hanging out with the Microsoft.com operations folks who are led by Jeff Stucky and Casey Jacobs. We presented our Migrating to <span class="caps">IIS 6</span> pre-conference tutorial together on Sunday, and had a some time to bond the night before over some margaritas at Casa de Bandini. Ours was a tag-team presentation. I presented the architecture, features, and administrative tasks while Jeff and Casey explained how they use <span class="caps">IIS 6</span> in a large production environment.</p>

<p>Large production environment is, um, an understatement. Here's some statistics about Microsoft.com:</p>


<ul>
<li>80 Gbps egress rate</li>
<li>250,000 requests / second</li>
<li>700,000 concurrent connections</li>
<li>950 web servers</li>
<li>250 <span class="caps">SQL</span> servers</li>
<li>75 million unique users / day</li>
</ul>

<p>When Windows Update V5 is turned on, the team is expecting to see 100 million users / day! Windows Update leans heavily on content caching networks such as <a href="http://www.akamai.com">Akamai</a> and <a href="http://www.savvis.com">Savvis</a>. These networks ensures that your download comes from the closest (in bandwidth terms) available server.</p>

I couldn't really bring myself to tell Jeff in absolute terms that I had to leave - even though I knew in my heart that it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>I've been leading a nomadic lifestyle for the past 7 years, and now that I have a new family it's getting harder and harder for me to get on a plane these days. I've been in discussions for some time with a local company here in Toronto about building a new company (more on this later). After talking things over with Carolyn, I realized that being local would be the best thing for our family.</p>

<p>So, while moving on was a bittersweet event for me this week, it was a step that I knew that I had to take. Onward.</p>

<h3 class="title">Off to Tech Ed!</h3>

<p>I'm off to Tech Ed today. I'll be giving my pre-conference tutorial on Migrating to <span class="caps">IIS 6.0</span> on Sunday, and I'll be free for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>I will have some interesting announcements to make from down there, but I don't believe in cryptic countdowns :) </p>

<p><span class="caps">BTW</span> comments are disabled on this blog until further notice. The amount of automated comment spam that I'm getting is simply ridiculous. If you want to reach me - all you have to do is send an email to jlam @ iunknown.com (and make it past my SpamBayes Bayesian filter).</p>

<p>I'm loving <a href="http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/">Jonathon de Halleux's blog</a>. He's the author of <a href="http://mbunit.tigris.org/">MbUnit</a>, which contains some very interesting ideas about unit testing in general. He's got a very cool visualization library as well, QuickGraph, which he has used to generate execution graphs using <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Lutz Roeder's ILReader</a>.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<h3 class="title">Constraints and unit testing</h3>

<p>One thing that I would like to enforce in my unit tests are constraints. Examples of constraints are things like read-only properties and sealed classes. If a developer comes along and removes one of those constraints by making the property read-write, or by unsealing the class, those changes are not detectable by simply recompiling the code.</p>

<p>One way to enforce constraints is to write unit tests that assert their existence. To help folks out, I've written the beginnings of a utility class that can be used with NUnit tests. Here's the source code for that class for folks who are interested. Feedback about these ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>

Public Class AssertEx : Inherits Assertion

    Public Shared Sub AssertReadOnlyProperty(ByVal t As Type, ByVal propertyName As String)
      Dim pi As PropertyInfo = t.GetProperty(propertyName)
      Assert(String.Format(&quot;Read-only property {0} in class {1} cannot be read from&quot;, propertyName, t.FullName), pi.CanRead)
      Assert(String.Format(&quot;Read-only property {0} in class {1} can be written to&quot;, propertyName, t.FullName), Not pi.CanWrite)
    End Sub

    Public Shared Sub AssertWriteOnlyProperty(ByVal t As Type, ByVal propertyName As String)
      Dim pi As PropertyInfo = t.GetProperty(propertyName)
      Assert(String.Format(&quot;Write-only property {0} in class {1} can be read from&quot;, propertyName, t.FullName), Not pi.CanRead)
      Assert(String.Format(&quot;Write-only property {0} in class {1} cannot be written to&quot;, propertyName, t.FullName), pi.CanWrite)
    End Sub

    ' TODO: Implement a visibility property assert - must be internal for example. need to use GetAccessors()
    ' and assert visibility based on property get/set method visibility

    Public Shared Sub AssertNotInheritableClass(ByVal t As Type)
      Assert(String.Format(&quot;Class {0} cannot be derived from&quot;, t.FullName), t.IsSealed)
    End Sub

    Public Shared Sub AssertNonSerializable(ByVal t As Type)
      Assert(String.Format(&quot;Class {0} cannot be serializable&quot;, t.FullName), Not t.IsSerializable)
    End Sub

    ' TODO: Assert that a class must be abstract

    Public Shared Sub AssertNotCreatable(ByVal t As Type)
      Dim cis() As ConstructorInfo = t.GetConstructors()
      Dim ci As ConstructorInfo
      For Each ci In cis
        Assert(String.Format(&quot;Non-private constructor found in a class {0} that must not be creatable&quot;, t.FullName), ci.IsPrivate)
      Next
    End Sub
  End Class
