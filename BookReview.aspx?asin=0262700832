                    <span>Nature, and natural selection, are not PC. We and all livingcreatures exist because of this process. It is impossible that ourenduring behaviors have not been shaped in some way by natural selection. This does not mean that all human behavior does not occur within an environment, which is crucial. Genetic determinism does not exist. That said, I don't think that Thornhill and Palmer have shown that humans male have an actual adaptation to rape(may instead be a by-product of male sexuality). I think that this book should not have been written at this point. The evidence is not there, which is not to say that it will never be there (to be fair, the evidence for social scientist's theories is even more flawed). More research is needed, which the authors concede, but it is somewhat damaging that this book was written before having this sort of proof. If the hypothesis has not yet been supported, why write a book about it that attempts to be comprehensive? This book does a good job of explaining the position of evolutionary psychology/sociobiology and of illustrating the ways that is has been misrepresented to support a feminist/cultural anthropologist political agenda that seems to not be interested in basing itself in science. It is amazing to me that most people cannot comprehend the obvious- the mainstream refusal to understand the difference between ultimate and functional causality or the naturalistic fallacy is a formidable obstacle. Nature is amoral. Humans have a capacity for morality. If rape is shown to have some biological basis (which it must), this says nothing about excusing men for their behavior. We can all agree that rape is wrong and something that we must work to prevent. Studying ALL of the reasons that compel men to rape, is crucial, and finding the ultimate, biological reason is the best way of all we have to learn how to prevent human rape.

                    <span>Take a good look at the title "A NATURAL History of Rape"; just ask is Rape natural behavior for man or human? Do you need scientific statistics historically (?)to know it is unnatural inhuman behavior! So what is the book trying to advance in scientific and social circles? That it is natural and there are biological bases for it; and what does it matter whether the reason behind rape is need for power or need for sexual gratification or both?<P>Is one reason more acceptable than another? If man or woman does it for sex it is OK, it is in the biology or genes! <P>Perhaps this book legitimizes and gives greater social-scientific acceptance of something we would not normally accept, in the same way society is made to accepts or dilute its resistance to violence, pornography, wanton-sex, pornography, propaganda of all kinds in the politics, media, science, and the marketplace! <P>The quality of human life is eroded everyday through rape of our minds (by implanting memes or mind-viruses like this). Our Natural Human Self, which has a cosmic/divine electromagnetic connection with our physical-animal-instinctual-impulsive self is being eroded everyday through the pollution of food chain, air, water, oceans and our bodies ridden by foreign elements in the name of vaccine-public health drugs (thinktwice.com)and our minds numbed by dumb TV and media,solicitations of all kind. <P>Human are the only species given free will (and we have been equated with animals precisely to put a blinder on that) and how each of us use our free will to advance or regress ourselves evolution wise says a lot of who we chose to be. <P>Only truth will set you free from all falsehood and enslavement. The funding and proponents for this kind of "Scientific" work comes from special interest (a few who rules the mass through our herd mentality). We have to remember there is much secret-cultish, prejudicial, superstitious and coercive behavior within mainstream science and technology. Not everything that comes under the name of science, advance it. It is actually intended to do the opposite: Thy shall not think for or by thyself!</span>

                    <span>I study evolution with a strong focus on the evolution of the sexes. I was initially attracted to this book because I am interested in exploring the evolutionary aspects of sexual violence. Investigating this topic from an evolutionary perspective is complicated by the fact that human sexual violence often works against natural selection, unlike in other species. Despite the interesting nature of this rarely talked about subject, this particular book was not based in good science. The evolutionary links were weakly drawn. The few studies he cited did not address the full scope of sexually violent acts, they were inconclusive, and even contradictory to his own points. The conclusions he drew were opinion, though he did occasionally make that fact clear. The author did not scientifically examine his own cultural biases and the result is a book that asserts his personal agenda. I also found this book lacking in that the author did not include studies of Bonobos, considering they are the primates genetically closest to humans (closer to us than they are even to other primates) and they are one of the few species that do not commit rape and infanticide.<P>A book that studies the connections between evolution and sexual violence would need to be researched far better than this, and in order to draw well informed conclusions it would need to take into account all forms of sexual violence against women, children, and men. In addition, when studying the biological aspects of human behavior there must also be attention paid to the sociocultural aspects of the behavior. Most behaviors are functions of both genetics and nurture. This is true for both humans and animals. As humans we are subject to our biological drives, but we are also intelligent beings who function within free will, choice, and consciousness. ... If you are interested in evolution please continue your education beyond this book. ... There is so much to learn. Evolution and human behavior are fascinating subjects.</span>

                    <span>According to the authors, rape is a tactic that men use to short-circuit women's ability to choose their mates. Essentially, the problem is a consequence of males' sexual desires and what they call the "sexual choosiness" of women. That theory doesn't explain why men rape men, why women rape men, or why women rape women. (The only reference in the book to homosexuality, p. 41, is an occasion to repeat the ancient stereotype that homosexual relationships "illustrate men's evolved motivation for sexual variety without commitment.") The theory also doesn't explain why men sodomize women. And the authors' conception of WOMEN'S sexual desires is crude: apparently, all women want nothing more than "pair-bonding," i.e. a stable committed sexual relationship with a single male. For example, the authors explain bestiality as a "means of experiencing sexual stimulation somewhat like that experienced in intercourse with a human female without having to be chosen by one" (p. 60). They don't seem to imagine that women can engage in bestiality too.<BR>All this is presented in patronizing language (Americans don't know enough about science, etc.), with continual potshots at earlier studies that do not take an "evolutionary" approach to rape--meaning the "evolutionary" approach that they happen to favor. (In fact, evolutionary biologists do not all believe that rape can be explained through natural selection or sexual selection.)<BR>Finally, the authors misrepresent the character of rape in order to further their argument. Consider p. 76: "Rapists rarely engage in gratuitous violence, defined as expending energy beyond what is required to subdue or control the victim and inflicting injuries that reduce the victim's chance of surviving to become pregnant." That just isn't true.</span>
