                    <span>This is a very easy system to learn, still it's among the most powerful and profitable systems ever created. Even if you want to go professional it should be one of your first choices. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to beat the dealer, aren't a math genius and wants to have some fun.</span>

                    <span>"Knock Out Blackjack" is a reasonably good Blackjack Book, but it over-sells itself.  Most card counting systems will work - with about the same results - which are not as spectacular as "Knock Out Blackjack" would have you believe.  
<br />
<br />For a more honest apraisal of what to expect with card counting systems and a good explanation of the standard Hi-Lo method, you should get "How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken" by Ford.  Its card counting section is accurate, effective and relatively easy.
<br />
<br />If you really want to get serious about card counting, you should get "Professional Blackjack" by Stanford Wong.  It will require more time and effort than most people are willing to spend, but it is as good as card counting books get.
<br />
<br />Another good choice, if you are really serious, would be "The Theory of Blackjack" by Peter Griffin, but you should brush up on your math first.
<br />
<br />Card counting does work, perhaps not as dramatically as "Knock Out Blackjack" implies, but it also takes patience and practice as well as a good sized bankroll.  The implication that any system will make the casinos easy to beat is not quite honest.</span>

                    <span>I've read a lot of BJ books and played the game all over the country with varying house rules.  This book is a great guide.  If you stick to basic strategy, except when the count calls for an adjustment, and remain unemotional about the money, you can make some cash.  Have patience and stick to the system.  The game can be beaten consistently enough for it to be a profitbale hobby.   I recommend the book and these guidelines to anyone who wants to make a serious run at the 21 tables: 1.) Practice counting every chance you get; 2.) Play single or double deck until you master the count (it's easier to start this way because if you lose the count you don't have to wait long for the shuffle); 3.) Read as many books as you can and find your counting niche; 4.) Make sure you have the proper bankroll for your bet spread, above all else.  The ultimate goal is to be able to count down a 6 or 8-deck shoe.  Big decks make for longer runs with a positive count and better camouflage.</span>
