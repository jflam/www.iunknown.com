                    <span>I'm not sure what to rate this book yet so I'm giving it a 3.  I'm about 2 days in and couldn't get past the day 1 exercise.  I thought I'd post here incase anyone experienced the same.  
<br />
<br />I had a number of problems getting the first page to load (listing 1.2).  It ended up being a problem with my .NET SDK install.  Anyway the fix for this is to goto the command prompt and go to c:\windows\microsoft.net\v1.1.4322\
<br />
<br />Then run:
<br />aspnet_regiis -r 
<br />
<br />This will re-register all your .NET dlls.
<br />
<br />Other then the huge headache of getting the first lesson working I'm looking forward to getting deeper into the book.  </span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of Sams Teach Yourself in 21 days series, but I have to admit that this book isn't worth it.  It skips around and doesn't explain in detail what the code is trying to do.  Having bought Sams Tech Yourself ASP 3.0 in 21 days, I was very pleased with this book.  But when I purchased Sams Teach Yourself ASP.NET in 21 Days (2nd Edition), I left, very disappointed.  I wanted to learn both VB.Net and C#.Net.  The book advised it would explain both, but this is not true at all.  While it has sample code in both languages, a lot of the time, it used VB.net.  And when it covers C#.Net, the code doesn't work half of the time.  I only wish Sams looked more closely before they allowed this book to be published. </span>

                    <span>Chris Payne seems to know what he's talking about with ASP.NET development.  Not knowing his audience is the major flaw.  Is this book aimed at professional developers with lots of experience or beginning developers trying to learn ASP.NET?<p>If I were to answer this questions as a reader, I'd say that it doesn't help either kind of developer very much. The book seems to lack focus and consistency with regard to its target audience.<p>As an example, how is a beginning reader going to feel when he has all the essentials of VB.NET, C#, and all the object orientation and server objects dumped on him in two chapters (days 3 and 4)?  How about Day 6 in which user controls and custom controls are dumped on the reader without adequate explanation and Chris keeps saying things like "this code is standard" (p. 197) while avoiding writing any useful or jargon-free explanation?<p>On the other hand, this book isn't appropriate to an experienced developer either.  Lots of items will be boring to an experienced developer. There is often lack of detail or theoretical explanation. Then there are standard things that will bore the experienced developer. Here's the standard, simplified explanation of objects again.  There's the explanation of loops and if statements to skim over.  The "Hello World" example in Day 6 that makes things complicated, yet uninteresting seems especially inappropriate.<p>Visual Studio.NET is barely mentioned, although I suspect most ASP.NET devopers will be using it.  Many practical issues (deployment, caching, etc.) just get ignored or glossed over, also.<p>In the end I found this book frustrating since it doesn't serve either a beginning or an intermediate/advanced developer very well.  If you're serious about learning ASP.NET you can learn it from this book, but the author hasn't done the work for the reader to make it well-paced, easier, or more enjoyable.  You'll feel like you're pushing through sludge as you work through this book.<p>It does present the material it claims to, but you get the feeling that this book was written quickly, with little sympathy for the reader, and no time for revisions.  It's a loss for the reader that it was written this way since the author seems to know his stuff.  Now if he could only explain it a little better.</span>

                    <span>I have many years as a VB developer and found this book leaving me with the feeling of "where do I start, and what am I missing?"<p>I then picked up Murach's ASP.NET web programming with VB.NET. <br>ISBN 1-890774-20-0.   Murach's book is the best on ASP .NET.<p>Thank goodness for Amazon, I sold the Sam's book, hopefully that person will be able to get use from it, I could not.</span>

I found this book full of errors and poor explainations. If you are reading this don't buy it if you don't know how to program.</span>
