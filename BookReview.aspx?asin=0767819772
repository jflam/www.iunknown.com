                <span id="Label1">Peter Greenaway (<I>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover</I>, <I>Drowning by Numbers</I>) continues to delight and disturb us with his talent for combining storytelling with optic artistry. <I>The Pillow Book</I> is divided into 10 chapters (consistent with Greenaway's love of numbers and lists) and is shot to be viewed like a book, complete with tantalizing illustrations and footnotes (subtitles) and using television's "screen-in-screen" technology. As a child in Japan, Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt reads a list of "beautiful things" from a 10th-century pillow book. As she gets older, Nagiko (Vivian Wu) looks for a lover with calligraphy skills to continue the annual ritual. She is initially thrilled when she encounters Jerome (Ewan McGregor), a bisexual translator who can speak and write several languages, but soon realizes that although he is a magnificent lover, his penmanship is less than acceptable. When Nagiko dismisses the enamored Jerome, he suggests she use his flesh as the pages which to present her own pillow book. The film, complete with a musical score as international as the languages used in the narration, is visually hypnotic and truly an immense "work of art." <I>--Michele Goodson</I></span>

                    <span>I'm quite surprised to find so many 5 star reviews of this "erotic" film.  I chalked it up to Ewan being quite young & desperate, not yet a star, to appear in such a laughable film.  Perhaps I just don't find full frontal nudity of Asian men that attractive, but it was a silly premise writing all over each other.  I love artsy, weird foreign films, but unfortunately my husband tires of them, especially when I bring home ones like this.</span>

                    <span>this film goes well beyond the narrow norms/confines of erotica; for it stirs one's senses - takes one to another level - of how we look at enjoy and appreaciate the art of love(making)
<br />
<br />this film is both beautiful, subtle, alarming and invigorating ... intense ... 
<br />
<br />peter greenaway really captured the very depths of what lies buried within (some of) us.
<br />
<br />for me, this is certainly one of my all-time best movies pertaining to the complex subject of love.

                    <span>The Pillow Book is about book lovers.  You might think you are a book lover, but this film takes the concept, deconstructs it and takes it beyond your sensibilities Ð well my sensibilities, anyway.  It pushes the envelope Ð and whatever the envelope ever was. Greenway is not for your standard pop-corn munching movie watcher. There is a shock or two, less than in The Cook.  I will tell you that his storytelling is unique, operating on very quirky logic about love (although very poetic about parental love), vibrant in a celebration of perceived good provoking its world of nightmarish opposites. The characters are not very appealing spirits, but their motivations are interesting. This story is told in layers of images, the past folding on the present, reverence in battle with sacrilege, and life hiding in very stylized art.  Moving images are appliqued over other movie frames.  It is like opera.  There are a lot of arias for the eyes and some beautifully haunting music for the ears. At times, like in an opera the images sing together.  The erotic nature of the film is not just the nude bodies making love but the language and how it lives as a fetish and aspired toward immortality or mythology. My knowledge of Asian culture is very little, but The Pillow Book has indelibly taught me something, except I need to translate from the Japanese, the Chinese, the English, the Yiddish and the Greenway.   </span>

                    <span>Highly over-rated. It's like when an artist pisses and ejaculates over a picture and calls it 'nature', then people go 'ooooh aaaaaah!such genius!'. That pretty much summarises it.</span>

                    <span>Two of the most beautiful things in the world are the written word and the human figure. Even the ones that are not special in themselves embody meaning and subtlety. When Greenaway uses the figure to carry words, he creates imagery that can not be forgotten.<p>There is so much in this movie that I hardly know where to begin. It starts with a child. Her father's birthday ritual is to tell her a story, always the same one, and to paint calligraphy on her face. Maybe it's a little silly, but it's sweet and loving.<p>Over time, the girl loses her innocence but gains the strength of adulthood. Her memory of that charming ritual develops, too. First, it loses its childhood innocence; it becomes a passion for her, and the standard by which she measures her lovers. In the end, the ritual gains even more strength and becomes the vehicle for a deadly obsession.<p>I must warn the potential viewer that the movie's second half goes places far beyond where sanity stops. It is not for people with tender sensibilities.<p>I'll come back to this movie for it sensual beauty. I won't come back too often, though. The raw rage at the end is just too hard.</span>
