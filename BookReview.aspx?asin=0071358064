                <span id="Label1">Six Sigma is a data-driven management system with near-perfect-performance objectives that has been employed to acclaim at leading corporations like General Electric. Its name is derived from the eye-catching statistical target of operating with no more than 3.4 defects per one million chances, but Peter Pande, Robert Neuman, and Roland Cavanagh--associates in a firm providing Six Sigma implementation, training, and management services--contend its principles can be applied in businesses of all types to routinely reduce costs, improve productivity, increase market share, and achieve other positive results. <I>The Six Sigma Way</I> is their comprehensive self-help guide to adapting and using the system under various conditions. Its first two parts cover fundamentals and provide specific suggestions for aligning the process with individual needs and goals. (These include sections on balancing potential costs and benefits, clarifying objectives, and defining time frames.) The final part, which accounts for more than half the book, focuses on implementation through a detailed yet flexible five-step "road map" tied to a company's core processes, key customers, current performance, "high-potential improvement opportunities," and future practices. While the procedure is quite complex, diligent managers should be able to bring at least basic components to their organization with the tools and techniques provided. --<I>Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>For those who want a clear, concise (if not comprehensive) introduction to Six Sigma, this is the place to start. The authors offer an enticing glimpse into the real-world application of Six Sigma tools and techniques. While not to be considered the be-all, end-all (see authors like Breyfogle or Pyzdek for that), The Six Sigma Way is the book to read if you're contemplating a Six Sigma effort and need fundamental knowledge, a starting point for more thorough treatment of the subject (which can be daunting in its comprehensiveness). Highly recommended, especially with the companion guide.</span>

                    <span>From livejournal notrealnews<p>Jack Welch, the retired CEO of General Electric, has hailed his recent affair with Harvard Business Review reporter Suzy Wetlaufer as a breakthrough in the business concept of "Boundaryless Thinking". "I could have easily spent the rest of my life trapped in the narrow view that my marriage meant lifelong monogamy," said Welch, a smug look on his face, "but with boundaryless thinking, I was able to take the concept of marriage in a whole new direction. Just like the things I did at GE."<p>Boundaryless thinking was one of the tenants that allowed Welch to get GE out of the failing appliances business and into the credit business, which now comprises more than half of GE's corporate makeup. It was a concept Welch highly stressed and touted in his autobiography "Jack: Straight from the Gut." He intends to follow it up with a new book, "Cheating on your wife the Six Sigma Way: How CEO's of GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies are Honing Their Extramarital Performance".</span>

                    <span>I never read the book, but the CD is such a masterfully "abridged" version of the book that it manages to tell you for hour HOW WONDERFUL six sigma is, while totally neglecting to tell you WHAT SIX SIGMA ACTUALLY IS, or HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED. In short, the CD contains nothing but self-marketing bull. If you have money to waste, go buy it.</span>

                    <span>The book was very easy to follow.  I found it especially helpful that the Six Sigma Way gave tips as to which chapters should be read for each level of Six Sigma implementation.  Since my company already had it implemented and I was only reading the book for an understanding of what my company was doing, I was able to skip the unneeded portions about implementation.  This was a big time saver.</span>

                    <span>I invested over a year researching the best way to manage processes in my company before coming to the following conclusion.  Six Sigma is worth implementing but only in conjunction with Optimal Thinking. Six Sigma without Optimal Thinking can produce suboptimal results.  Put "Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self" in the hands of all employees and this book, train them in the concepts, follow up with coaching, and you will have the best of the best. If you can't do it all, just get the books in the hands of those that matter.</span>
