                    <span>This was a very well done book. I had some experience in Visual C++ which is what caused me to buy it in the first place.<P>It covers a lot of material, but is not repetitive. Some books I've seen repeat the same stupid steps over and over. This book is not like that. It includes a lot of very relevant information and doesn't waste space telling you how to setup your project. As such, you must know how to use Visual C++ fairly well. While it doesn't go into any subjects in depth, it at least covers many different things.<P>I highly recommend this book if you already know how to program things in Visual C++ and would just like to learn more.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best programming texts of any description that I have ever read. The sample code segments are not just "dumped" on you, but are presented with clearly understandable explanations of just what that code is doing.<P>The descriptions of how to use the Developer Studio user interface is an appendix. You should read it first, as it provides in-depth instruction for this rich, rather complex user interface.<P>This book delivers on everything it promises. Although there is no cd, the source is easily available online.</span>

                    <span>Kate Gregory, Special Edition: Using Visual C++ 6 (Que, 1998)<P><P>This makes a fine companion to Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days (in fact, in the foreword, TYVC++6 is one of the books Gregory recommends reading before diving into this). Unfortunately, the major drawback of that book is reflected in this; the author touches on graphics programming only as much as anyone else writing Visual C++ 6 books does these days (with a preponderance of VC++6 books not doing anything at all with graphics, and the graphics programming books focusing on DirectX, you're pretty much out of luck in learning GDI programming). However, she does get into a number of advanced topics that TYVC++ only touches on: database access, the Standard Template Library, and other things that most C++ programmers only learn if they're forced to for work. An excellent choice as the second book aspiring Visual C++ 6 programmers should reach for. *** Â½</span>

                    <span>I bought several books like this one, so for more details take look at book with ISBN: 0789716356 where I have written down long rewiev on what I expect from books of type: "Using*", "Beginning*", "Starting*".<P>This book has covered many problems and questoins that no other book has covered, for ex. code written by class wizard - well in my case I don't care what it means.<P>What I expect from book that is called "Beginning*", "Starting*" is to show me how to use Combo boxes, how to use tree views, how to use app wizard to make siple "dialog window" based app. that do trivial task. I would like to see SHORT examples (=easy to remember) how to open some database table, read data into list box. I expect this book to have a tons of small simple, yet, nice looking examples that do basic things. I expect that book has chapters that makes you say: 'This chapter learned me how to insert ActiveX control and I have seen two short, simple, valuable examples that I will save on my HD so I can reuse them one day', Or 'Now I can build app that can store settings to INI file', etc.<P>Well I didn't find what I was looking for in this book. This review might not help you because maybe I was looking for weird things, or I wanted to have a cookbook. But anyway, if you are looking for the same thing I was, then this review might help you.</span>
