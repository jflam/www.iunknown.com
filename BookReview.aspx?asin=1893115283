The information in this book comes straight from the horse&#146;s mouth&#151;both authors have been key members of the Visual C++ .NET compiler development team and have spent most of their time implementing the language and educating others about managed C++.  </p> <p> The book is divided into two parts. Part One covers the basics of MC++. It starts with an introduction to MC++, and gives a brief overview of the .NET Framework. Next, it delves directly into the various features of MC++, including managed classes, interfaces, value types, properties, enumerations, pointers, arrays, operators, delegates, attributes, events, and exceptions. </p> <p> Part Two of the book is devoted to the transition between the managed and unmanaged worlds. It starts with a general introduction to interoperability between managed and unmanaged code. The following chapters describe the Platform Invoke service, interoperability between COM and .NET, and various data marshaling techniques. The last chapter of Part Two shows how MC++ can be used to write interoperability layers over existing components with minimal overhead. </p></span>

                    <span>I've been doing a reasonable amount of MC++ recently and I started with this book. I've found it concise and to the point. As a previous reviewer said, "the authors go straight to the point assuming you are not a dummy". The book is in two parts, the first covers the fundamentals of writing applications/components in MC++. The second part covers interoperability. I found myself referencing both parts frequently...</span>

                    <span>This book is what you are looking for if you are considering MC++.<br>Personally I use MC++ to create wrappers around processor-optimized libraries available for C/C++. Then I use them from C# and VB.NET.<br>Some reviewers say the book doesn't add much to the MSDN docs. However, this book is a lot more readable and I think it's worth it.<br>One more thing, the book is written by developers for developers. I really enjoyed that, the authors go straight to the point assuming you are not a dummy.</span>

                    <span>At first sight, the book may seem just a compilation of managed extension for C++ specs from MSDN.  However, having read the book, I can say it provides valuable insights into managed extensions and even contains some tricks exploiting knowledge of mapping managed extensions into CLR.<p>This is the book about general-purpose software development with MC++ (C++ with managed extension).  It will not tell you how to write .NET windowing or data access code, but it describes general principles and ideas helping write better code for .NET with MC++.<p>The book starts with simple MC++ constructs and finishes with mastering managed/native interop questions.  Throughout the book, MC++ elements are compared with standard C++ equivalents.  I don't think it was necessary, because the book is intended for skilled C++ developers who can easily see parallels themselves.  However, knowing some differences was very important and interesting for me.  Still in some places the author tends to advertise MC++ using some (unfair in my opinion) comparisons between standard C++ and MC++.<p>One shouldn't expect to know everything about MC++ after reading the book.  A lot of experimentation is required to fully understand the power of MC++ over other languages targeting .NET.  I think that the author could do a better job describing some effective techniques (available in the public domain, see [web page name]for example) that would have made the book a more exciting reading.<p>I recommend this book as a first step on the way of exploration MC++ capabilities.</span>

                    <span>This book does not contain any more than the managed extensions specification document that ships with Visual Studio.net.

Also more samples on interop between C#, MC++ and native C++.</span>

                    <span>"Essential Guide to Managed Extensions for C++" is required reading for any C++ programmer who wants to learn about writing C++ for .Net.  What this book covers is virtually everything that a C++ programmer will need to write code using Managed Extensions for C++ (MC++). The first section is an excellent tutorial of the various features of MC++. This sections starts with a  brief overview of the .Net framework. It continues with an introduction to MC++ with a very good low-level description of how managed classes differ from native classes.  The remainder of  this section contains the best explanation of managed extensions that you are likely to find.  Topics are discussed in terms that make sense for C++ programmers. For example, delegates are discussed in terms of function pointers which they replace. The code samples are designed to give a clear explanation of the topic being discussed. The second part covers interoperability issues between managed and native code. For performance reasons C++ developers will sometimes need to mix code types so the explanation of how to avoid performance degradation when mixing managed and native code will be very useful. This section also includes descriptions of how to mix COM and .NET components and how to write wrapper classes for native code. For the C++ developer worried that C# is "the" .NET language, the authors show that MC++ is an important part of the .NET world and provide the information that C++ programmers need to develop for .NET.</span>
