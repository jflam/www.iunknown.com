                    <span>My brother told me about W.P. Kinsella in 1984 and I've been a huge fan ever since.  I've read everything I can find by him, starting with "Shoeless Joe" and this might be my favorite book of his.  He has written at least three collections of baseball short stories and this is easily the best.<p>Most of the stories are not so much about baseball, it's more a case of using baseball as a background and common thread to tie the stories all together.<p>These are the kind of stories you can read over and over again.  One of my favorites was the story about the fans who decided to turn the latest player's strike into a chance to replace astroturf with real grass.  With the stadium shut down for the strike, they came in and returned the field to a natural state.  I've always thought that when the players strike they should strike to get rid of astroturf; a cause many fans could get behind.  <p>I don't know of any baseball fan who would not enjoy these stories.</span>

                    <span>A collection of baseball stories - or rather, stories involving baseball and baseball players in some way. Kinsella is at hist best when he stays close to earth - hopeful bush leaguers, women trouble - but tends to go way over the top when he tries to involve more "magic" (in his own words) to the game and the story. The Iowa Baseball Confederacy suffered from this problem, and so do a few of the stories in this collection. But when his "stories aren't about events, they're about the people they happen to", he has a wonderful touch. Some of my favourites in this collection are "Drive me to the moon", about a Rookie leaguer and his affair in a one-horse town in Canada, "Barefoot and pregnant in Des Moines", about a big league star and his marriage. Some of these stories are true gems and fully warrant the five-star rating; others are filler, but then even the most classic games have their straightforward 6-3 groundouts.</span>

                    <span>W. P. Kinsella writes with poignance and wit, capturing both the humor and the occasional tragedy of the game.  This collection displays some of his best work.  <p>My alltime favorite among this collection is "The Last Pennant Before Armageddon."  In the wake of the Cubs' collapse this fall, a work like this has real prescience and is somehow reassuring that there was a higher purpose behind it all.  <p>Still, there are other strong stories in the mix.  In one, the narrator is offered the chance to trade places with the recently-killed Yankees catcher Thurman Munson.  Another, more whimsical story takes you inside the clubhouse of the 1951 Giants, as a surprisingly literate team debates whether The Greaty Gatsby is an allegory.<p>For me, "The Last Pennant Before Armageddon" is reason enough to buy this book.  In the wake of the 2003 NLCS, I feel a dire need to read it . . . repeatedly.</span>

                    <span>Kinsella is short stories.  Period.  I started reading this book as an average teenager who hated baseball, sports and those who played them.  I come away from it, my opinions about "jocks" shaken.  If you do  read it, look for the themes of desolation, failure, dreams, and a  "grief cycle" which is really Kinsella's Theory of Life.   Extradonairy....beyond description.</span>

                    <span>This book was not only enjoyable, but touching.  The stories that Kinsella pens in this wonderful collection will change the way you look at the world.  Baseball is is more than just a pastime, it is an American legacy.   This book brings the romance and passion of the devoted heart of a culture  to a vibrant vitality of existence, and will capture the reader in it's  embrace. The traditionalists will love the story about astro-turf, and the  tenacious Cub fan will love the prophetic story about armageddon. I dearly  loved this collection.</span>
