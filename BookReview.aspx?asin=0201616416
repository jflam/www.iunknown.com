                <span id="Label1">Kent Beck's <I>eXtreme Programming eXplained</I> provides an intriguing high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development teams.<p> The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form the basis of XP.<p> Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process. <p> In the afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software lifecycle, and adopting XP.</span>

                    <span>Even if you don't plan on adopting XP, this is worth a read.  It's concise, reads quickly and has a nice table of contents.
<br />
<br />The chapter on the four variables in projects was one of my favorites.  It will give you a clue what to say next time everything needs to be done yesterday.  The chapter on test first development was also useful and I've had great success with its techniques.
<br />
<br />This book is worth a read even if you're initially turned off by XP.  Even though it's on a specific development strategy, much of the information is useful everywhere.

                    <span>I have been using Agile programming methods for some time, so I decided to find a book to describe the details of Extreme programming. Extreme programming is an important variant of Agile programming so it is worth studying in more detail.
<br />
<br />I bought this book with the expectation that it would be a serious description of how to apply extreme programming and how it relates to other methods. No such luck. The book does explain practices and philosophies, but is primarily an emotional pep talk in favor of Extreme programming. This is to much "Zen" for me. And it seems that the pep talks mostly compared it to the trational waterfall model. In this comparison it is no wonder that extreme programming seems so good. But the book gives seriouos indication of why this method is best; as it claims it is.
<br />
<br />So overall, it is an adequate book that does fairly good job presenting what extreme programming is all about but it could have been so much better.
<br />
<br />Whatever you do, don't read this book as your first book on software engineering. For that purpose I recommend Steve McConell: Rapid Development. Reading books on agile development should happen after that - otherwise it might be hard to see things in the right perspective.</span>

                    <span>If the first edition of this book was a warning shot across the bow of heavyweight methodologies, then this new edition is a call to arms for any team that wants to develop better software faster, and have fun doing it. XP is now being used by teams and in contexts unthinkable when the first edition of this book was published. 
<br />
<br />This edition is a completely new version of the book. For example, there are new chapters on Taylorism, lean manufacturing, and the theory of constraints. There are many new ideas and XP is now explained more in terms of its values and principles than through strict adherence to twelve specific practices. 
<br />
<br />In this new edition, Kent Beck expands on the vision of the first and shows us how XP--through the application of its values, principles and practices-has become more than just a lightweight method for small to medium teams. XP represents an evolving way of thinking about software development. I can think of no better person than Kent Beck to show the way.</span>

                    <span>In his second edition Kent has defined Extreme Programming as a journey and not a destination.  This new edition is a realization that all projects start out with some good and some bad mixed together.   This new edition also has more for people in enterprise situations.
<br />
<br />Kent underscores his belief that a team's values are the most important criteria of a project.  Extreme Programming is no longer a restrictive set of practices to be measured against.  Kent encourages people to start with the set of practices he has seen work but then go even further by using the principles to create new practices for unique situations.
<br />
<br />In the end what Kent has written down is more uniform practices, greater stress on the values, and a set of principles that are equal in importance to the practices.  These are things I notice eluding people who read the first edition.</span>

                    <span>The release 1st edition of this book is still considered by many to be the kick start for the growing adoption of a software development process called Extreme Programming. After 5 years, the 2nd edition faces a much different world but also with much different content and approach. The world has learned much and so has the author. I'm glad to see that this 2nd edition reflects that development.
<br />
<br />Beck has revised his thinking throughout the book. Some obvious examples include his current preference towards using ideal time over abstract time units in estimating, the fifth value among the initial four, the new set of principles, and the rehash of the practices.
<br />
<br />Extreme Programming Explained is not a detailed how-to for adopting the process it describes. Actually, it doesn't really describe a process at all. What it does describe is a system of values and principles and a set of practices to support these. Even though Beck does give each practice (divided into primary and corollary practices in the 2nd edition) their share of explanation, the focus is still strongly on the "what" and "why" instead of the "how".
<br />
<br />As someone who has read a dozen books on the topic already, I was delighted to find almost every page to provide something intriguing that either created or challenged my own thoughts. Especially the latter half of the book, dealing with topics such as TOC, scaling, Taylorism, the Toyota Production System, and the hot potato itself -- offshoring -- offered a lot to think about.
<br />
<br />This is what a 2nd edition should be like, every single chapter reflecting new insight gathered over the years.</span>
