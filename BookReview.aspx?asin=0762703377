                    <span>Derek Hutchinson is a master kayaker with a gift for teaching.<P>His "Basic Book" is just what the novice kayaker needs. For those who have not yet purchased a kayak, Hutchinson surveys the various types of boats and their respective strengths and weaknesses, with lots of helpful tips on what to look for in a new or used kayak. His discussions of clothing and equipment (particularly his discussion about paddles) is excellent and well-crafted to ensure that the beginner is properly dressed and equipped for his/her local conditions. He even offers such escoteric tidbits as making sure that your new kayak is left upside down overnight to adequately vent the styrene gas that might have built up during the manufacturing process (thereby preventing contamination of your gear and possibly making you sick).<P>Hutchinson's descriptions of basic paddling is very good...each subject is well illustrated with diagrams and photographs, and his instructions are written with a brief, clear and complete command of the subject that clearly bespeaks his decades of experience. The all-important sections on safety, rescues, and (gulp) capsize procedures are also very well written and illustrated.<P>I think the only thing better than buying and studying this book would be taking one of his kayaking courses (he has been designated a senior coach by the British Canoe Union).<P>In short, this expertly written book will answer many of your questions about kayak purchasing, outfitting, paddling technique and safety. For the money, you can't possibly go wrong.</span>

                    <span>This is a perfect book for the beginner, written by THE master himself, and for 6 bucks! If you really want to learn contact your local kayak shop and find out when Derek will be in your area (or somewhere close), and take his two day introductory class. He dosen't charge more than other instructors, but you will learn more in two days with Derek, than most people learn in two seasons. Learn from the best. By the way, that's me on the cover taking his two day course.</span>
