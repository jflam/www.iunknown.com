                    <span>My friend's and I will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good. My friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along, but since I have a dog, I thought it would be interesting, but it wasn't, so I had the honor of throwing it out myself. 
<br />
<br />Typically, I would donate the book or give it to charity, but I don't think anyone would enjoy it. It's just this author's drivel. It doesn't focus on the president's and their pets at all like the title suggests.
<br />
<br />I could see where another author could have created a really fun book about presidents and their dogs.

                    <span>What trash!  I'm glad I didn't buy it and browsed it in a store. In an article where the author was attending a party and obviously drinking too much, he put down Chihuahuas calling them rats and putting down cats too. He was apparently using this event that benefited resuce pets to push his ridiculous book. 
<br />
<br />If you don't like animals, which he doesn't seem to, he should maybe write about drinking.  He seems to know that best.  I would have given him a no star rating, but you have to give a least one star to leave a review.

                    <span>I was not familar with Mo Rocca until I heard a radio interview with him and decided to but this book.  He was considerably funnier and more entertaining in the radio interview.
<br />
<br />As other reviewers have explained, this is the story of the secret contributions made by presidential pets throughout US history.  Mixed in are references to numerous cable news personalities and reporters, some shots at past presidents and our current one, and a conspiracy involving the holy grail of presidential pets.
<br />
<br />Some familiarity with TV news personalities (OK, a LOT of familiarity) is necessary to fully appreciate the inside humor.  Although Fox News is hit particularly hard, Rocca spares no one.
<br />
<br />The problem with this book is it's inconsistency.  It reminds me of old average Saturday Night Live or Monty Python episodes, where moments of brilliance are interspersed with skits that just didn't work.  The climax is very funny, but leading up to it were  many spots that dragged or just seemed dumb rather than humorous.
<br />
<br />My copy will probably be ending up on EBay as well.</span>

                    <span>This book is about Mo (if you mean self-effacing), Mo's career (if you mean completely made up), and American journalism (if you mean making fun of everyone on TV).  And it also has real history, pet related and otherwise. This book is so funny, with its pop culture cleverness and political smartness.  And, well, who couldn't use a good laugh now that the elections are over?

                    <span>This book is more about Mo, Mo's career & american journalism, than the Presidential pets. If you are not American & not heavily into their tv journalism this book is not for you.
<br />Oh there is a small section at the end that mentions the pets.</span>
