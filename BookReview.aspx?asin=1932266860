                    <span>If a book like 'Spam Kings' can be considered a biography, then Inside the Spam Cartel is the technical manual. Written from the perspective of a spammer, it is a first-person account of the technology used in spamming. The book details not only the technologies used by spammers, but also the techniques and the subversive modi operandi. 
<br />
<br />From a technical perspective, the book shows how to determine where a spam e-mail originates and how to read e-mail headers to determine a message's path. Inside the Spam Cartel also explains various phishing scams and how they are propagated. Spam is an enormous irritant, but phishing is so nefarious that it has the potential to disrupt a large sector of the economy. 
<br />
<br />Like a genie from a bottle, spam is out of the can and it will never go away. But organizations needn't resign themselves to being victims. Whereas Spam Kings identifies the enemy, Inside the Spam Cartel helps you fight him.

                    <span>I must admit upfront that I am a basic newbie in this spam game this is the first time I read any book that deals with spam specifically. I will not therefore be able to compare it to any other spam book on the shelves today. I will, however, say that this book is very different from any book dealing with spam in that it has a neutral point of view and sometime sides with the spammers on some issues (sometimes I agree with the author). The main point in this book is that you do not need to put every spammer in jail to get them out of business but rather create more effective filters and educate the end users. 
<br />I picked this book up mainly because I wanted to know how do spammers make money an keep them selves in business and how actually clicks on those email links and reads the spam email. Both of these questions were answered in the book, and I was able to see that spamming could be a profitable thing making more money that the average hardworking Joe. The book also goes into lots of detail on how spammers bypass some filters, make their products sell, the current law, and so on. In the end this book was an informative, enjoying, and easily readable book I have seen in a while.

                    <span>I do a lot of incident response and antivirus work. While my initial response when a new virus or worm outbreak slams my network is to go into emergency response mode and be more than a little frustrated about giving up my nights or weekends to chase down malware, I often sit back when the dust has settled and admire the creativity and engineering genius that goes into some of the malware. 
<br />
<br />Spammer X, the author of this book, talks about spam in a similar fashion. It is a dirty, sneaky business, but when you stop to look at the engineering and ingenuity that goes into collecting addresses and distributing the spam it is almost awe inspiring. It would be nice if such programming genius and creative thinking were put to better use, but it is genius nonetheless. 
<br />
<br />This is one of the best books I have seen about spam. Rather than simply talking about bayesian filters or other blocking technologies or concepts, this book goes into detail about the business side of spam and how they get around your blocking and filters. 
<br />
<br />It may be a little disheartening to think you can't stop it, but it reads like a novel and it is very enlightening. I highly recommend this book, especially to admins trying to stop spam.

                    <span>I read a lot of computer books. (Don't we all?) Usually I pick up the book on XP, or SQL or whatever, read enough to solve the problem of the moment and move on. Not this time. 
<br />
<br />This book reads like a pretty good novel. The book showed up at the office, I casually picked it up and opened it to somewhere in the middle. I had a hard time getting back to work. I wound up taking the book home and would read a chapter here and there, just like reading a mystery. 
<br />
<br />I've go to say that I've changed the way I view SPAM. I guess that it really isn't any more offensive than the commercial breaks on TV where you get three or five people up screaming about the tremendous deals on their cars, or furniture, or carpet cleaning. 
<br />
<br />While I still may be annoyed at the clutter in my mailbox, I can at least appreciate the effort that the spammer has had to go through to get it past the filters, the firewalls, the host blacklisting and all the rest. 
<br />
<br />The answer to stopping SPAM is, of course, really quite easy - if no one purchased the Viagra, body parts enlarger, home refinancing, visited the porn site, or attempted to get some of the secret fortune in Nigeria it wouldn't pay; then SPAM would stop. But apparently it does pay, and pay well enough that it's worthwhile to keep it up in spite of the efforts of people to stop you. Still, you would probably not want to tell your mother what you do for a living. 
<br />
<br />Great Book, Highly Recommended.</span>

                    <span>The first thing I thought while reading this book was how easy it still is for a spammer to do his work, in spite of the numerous spam filters and anti-spam machinations around. Spammers have become very adept at getting around spam filters to fill our mailboxes with unwanted commercial email. The book's author is a spammer himself and he points out, why aren't there laws against receiving junk mail in our mailboxes when that is (if not more so) just as annoying as spam email? And it seems that no matter how much energy is put into fighting spam, it will likely be around for a long time. So it really is a "cat and mouse game" between the spammers and the anti-spammer activists.
<br />
<br />The author speaks of numerous ways that he and other spammers work, including getting around the spam filters, or finding domains to use to send spam that have been "abandoned" by bankrupt companies but never shut down. He speaks of "spackers," "hackers" who work with spammers to find e-mail lists to send spam out to. He also alludes to phishing or scam spams, even detailing his experience with answering one of the infamous "Nigerian 419 emails," pointing out how those scammers are able to dupe some people out of their money. He also makes it clear that he does not condone email scams. He also makes a point to refute the theories that say spam costs takes up time and lots of bandwidth, when it's clear no spammers will come forward to talk about the amount of time and bandwidth it really does take up. He speaks too of the future of spam (no it isn't going away), and even includes a short "spam FAQ."
<br />
<br />While some might take the book's intent to be showing others "how to spam," the book's premise is of course more about "knowing the enemy." This is a book primarily of interest to network admins, security professionals and the like, but as an average computer user I still found this topic fascinating.</span>
