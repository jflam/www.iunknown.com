                    <span>I really enjoyed reliving some of the great stories surrounding the Dodger franchise while reading this book. The interviews focus on the behind the scenes controversies as well as the on the field exploits of Dodger teams of the 50's through the 2000 season. For a Dodger fan much of the material is familiar but the book provides a chance to hear the players and front office guys tell their versions in their own words. <br>The Yankees may be the Bronx Zoo and the all-time leaders in colorful characters but the Dodgers certainly are not far behind in that category.<br>I highly recommend this to baseball lovers and particularly to Dodger fans. I learned some new things about the team and I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about Dodger history.</span>

                    <span>A little while ago, I gave 5 stars to a book called "The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told."  While I stand by that rating, that book still pales in comparison to this one.<p>The Dodgers have a rich history and with the exception of the Yankees, are probably the most successful and stories baseball franchise.  This oral history gives a behind the scenes look at the incidents that shaped L.A. Dodger history.<p>Every big event from 1958-2000 is covered, from the move to Los Angeles to Koufax's retirement to the Big Blue Wrecking Crew to Kirk Gibson's famous home run to the selling of the team to Fox.  Delsohn does a good job at allowing both sides to speak about controversial issues and allows the reader to use his or her own judgment as to where the truth lies.<p>For any fan of baseball, I recommend this book.  For any fan of the Dodgers, I would say this is a must-read.</span>

                    <span>I read True Blue in a day while on my summer vacation last year.  It contains interview snipets with most of the big names in Los Angeles Dodgers history, but lacks the depth and insight a more sophisticated fan would require.  From a sociological perspective, Delsohn missed one of the most important aspects of Dodger baseball from the 1970s- the presence of Glenn Burke, inventor of the "High Five," who became baseball's first acknowledged homosexual, and the Rick Monday American flag rescuing incident.  In addition, other Dodger stars are basically ignored if they were not in the middle of some major event.</span>

                    <span>This is a very enjoyable, very engaging book that is well-organized, well-written, and just plain fun. It's a great trip down memory lane, reading again about the thoughts of the players I watched growing up and recollecting and reliving the events of those years. The bottom line on this book is that if you are a Dodger fan, it is must reading. Thank you, Mr. Delsohn, for a great time!</span>

                    <span>In 1958, I was ten-years-old and living in Los Angeles when the Dodgers hit town, and I've been a life-long fan ever since.  So it was with great anticipation that I dove into "True Blue," by Steve Delsohn, as it is sub-titled "The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It," and I thought to myself, what could be better than hearing the inside scoop from the horse's mouth, so to speak?  It was a question that was soon answered, and I also realized that as interesting as this book was, it simply wasn't the book I wanted it to be.  <p>	Delsohn tells the story through the comments of those who were either a part of the organization at one time or another, or close to it in some regard, like the sportswriters who have covered the team since their move to L.A.  Delsohn conducted 124 interviews in all, from which he gleaned the insights provided here.  And while it's interesting to hear in their own words the reflections of such luminaries as Duke Snider, Maury Wills, Mike Marshall, Bill Buckner, Steve Garvey, Eric Karros and Tommy Lasorda, the bulk of the comments seem to come from the writers, like Dodger Historian Tot Holmes, ESPN correspondent Chris Mortensen, L.A. Times columnist Ross Newhan, Tim Kurkjian of ESPN's magazine, Mark Heisler of the "Times," Richard Hoffer of Sports Illustrated and author Roger Kahn among others.<p>	All of which, again, makes for an interesting read, but what the book lacks is depth.  Beginning with a brief background of Walter O'Malley's origins with the Brooklyn Dodgers and some insight into how and why the team ended up in Los Angeles, Delsohn then moves from 1958 on through the 2000 season, decade by decade.  And it's a quick read that leaves you wanting for more.  He touches upon the highlights of each era, especially the historic moments on the field and off, like the rise of Sandy Koufax into one of the premier pitchers in the game, to the unprecedented joint hold-out (the first in baseball history) by Koufax and Don Drysdale at the beginning of the 1966 season.  He also chronicles the `70s infield of Garvey, Lopes, Russell and Cey, who would stay together for eight seasons, keeping an existing infield intact longer than any other in history.  Then there was the phenomenal Fernando Valenzuela and "Fernando mania" in 1981.  The infamous Al Campanis affair, which erupted after the longtime General Manager of the Dodgers appeared on a segment of "Nightline" is covered as well.  All the championships, the near misses and seasons that misfired altogether, the careers of managers Walt Alston and Tommy Lasorda and all the ups and downs of the team, including the tumultuous exit of Mike Piazza in 1998 are covered.  <p>	Other elements, however, that are such a part of the Dodgers illustrious history are neglected, like the story of Hideo Nomo, who is mentioned only in passing.  And while the interviews that make up this book do give a sense of intimacy to the story, it nevertheless leaves you with the feeling that there is so much more that hasn't been brought to light.  So, as a historical document, "True Blue" comes up short, and in the final analysis it comes across as more of a coffee-table book; interesting enough to browse through from time to time, but ultimately unsatisfying.</span>
