                    <span>If you have the concept of software product lines down, this is a great book, but if not you can easily get lost or confused, so it becomes difficult reading. If you want to explore software product lines, buy this book, then while you are waiting for the book to arrive read the website http://www.softwareproductlines.com to get up to speed on the concepts.<P>Software product lines will become a must whether you develop enterprise software or embedded software. This is so much more than we ever discussed about software resue.....</span>

                    <span>So, if you've already made the decision to go with software product lines, this is an excellent book. It's got a huge amount of reference material, is well-edited, and clearly has the benefit of a lot of practical experience.<P>Unfortunately, if you're debating with or just want to learn about software product lines, this book isn't for you. I didn't see a single example of when software product lines are *not* appropriate for a set of work that needs to be done and, in general, this just assumes that you already have the sort of work that fits this model and dives right into the details. Also, the "29 practices" are spread over just under 300 pages, and make it hard to understand the big picture. It would've been nice to see even one-page descriptions of the patterns in context to be able to pull it all together more easily.</span>

                    <span>Book compiled from numerous interviews as opposed to real practitioners. I've worked with product lines and was quite excited when this book was published. However, I was rather disappointed. It doesn't really provide the insight into how do I sit down and create a product line.<P>The first chapter is a great introduction to product lines. The next couple of chapters are okay, but rather fluffy. The rest of the book is really academic and formal and I didn't find it particularly useful. These chapters were also very difficult to read (tedious and dry). Too much pontification; too little real information.</span>

                    <span>Imagine! you are a well founded software engineer and try to establish<BR>the product line approach in your company.<BR>Imagine! managers ask you to proof that the product line approach will<BR>have a "good" return of investment.<BR>Imagine! you open page XXX in your book YYY and start reading section<BR>ZZZ.<BR>Imagine! you develop a concept for a business case in 2 hours though you<BR>haven't attended any business class ever.<BR>Surprise! the you is me<BR>Surprise! the XXX is 365<BR>Surprise! YYY is Linda's and Paul's Product Line Book (Software Product<BR>Lines: Practices and Patterns)<BR>Surprise! ZZZ is the "What to build PATTERN".<P>The Product Line Patterns are the heart and the most condensed<BR>experience of the SEI Software Product Line Framework. Though most<BR>people do not recognize the patterns give you the balance between too<BR>specific and too general process descriptions. The three cycles Core<BR>Asset Development, Product Development, and Management of the framework<BR>are good for simple overview purpose and therefore appropriate for the<BR>management level. The 29 practice areas guide you through activities and<BR>methods; therefore they are basically at the operational especially the<BR>engineering level.<P>But it is the patterns that help you to sail though some of the practice<BR>areas to achieve a certain goal. The patterns set the process and the<BR>workflow. They are different for different problems and environments;<BR>that's what a workflow should be.<BR>Hunting for the world wide valid process description that is specific<BR>enough to be meaningful is like trying to invent the perpetum mobile.<P>Suggesting only one product line process would therefore mean that it is<BR>very general or that it is valid only for certain organizations,<BR>markets, goals, products, and people. The patterns are specific<BR>processes that help to achieve only certain goals in a predefined<BR>environment. Though I think the framework patterns can be improved and<BR>extended they are much more meaningful to the product line community<BR>than any other product line process description I have seen up to now.</span>
