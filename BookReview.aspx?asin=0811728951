                    <span>Photographer's Guide to Yellowstone is very useful for finding good photo spots and for choosing the best time to shoot.  He also gives a valuable warning about protecting lens from geyserite spray.  However his "how to" tips can lead to a lot of murky and oversaturated photos, particularly when photographing the blue, azure, and aqua colored hot pools in the thermal areas.  Not every shot should be taken with a polarizer!</span>

                    <span>This book is written for someone with little photography background.  If your just starting in photography or if your just starting in outdoor photography it gives you some good helpful hints.</span>

                    <span>I found this book extremely valuable, and I wish similar books were available for every photogenic destination (a few others are). Given limited vacation time in each park (Tetons & Yellowstone), we were able to plan ahead and be at the right place at the right time(s) of day to get excellent shots and then onward to other activities.<p>The author was exactly accurate about what time the rainbows appear from successive North Rim overlooks, for example, and we hiked between them with great results. Ignore the recommendations about filters if you like, but select from the location descriptions to maximize your trip photos of the famous (and semi-secret) views. Yes I brought home a lot of cliche images, but my friends and family don't know that and they're thrilled with the "classic" enlargements.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be an exceptional guide to both photograph and tour Yellowstome and the Tetons!  The author included valuable informations such as the best times of day to take pictures in the parks, and also suggested methods to use to get the best shots!  In addition to the outstanding photos in the book, the author also told how to get the best results.  It turned out to be an invaluable resource in planning our visit, and I would highly recommend it those planning to take pictures and those who just want to see beautiful scenery!</span>

                    <span>Author provides some good information about locations, access, and such, but the photographic advice is to be taken with some caution. Since he uses high-saturation film, enhancing filter plus a polarizing filter at its maximum effect for nearly every shot, everything looks muddy and oversaturated, with no true whites evident even in the winter shots. Show me the crisp colors which your eyes can see when in these locations!</span>
