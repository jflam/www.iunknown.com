                <span id="Label1">It's 1808 and that Corsican upstart Napoleon is battering the English army and navy. Enter Mr. Norrell, a fusty but ambitious scholar from the Yorkshire countryside and the first practical magician in hundreds of years. What better way to demonstrate his revival of British magic than to change the course of the Napoleonic wars?  Susanna Clarke's ingenious first novel, <I>Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell</I>, has the cleverness and lightness of touch of the Harry Potter series, but is less a fairy tale of good versus evil than a fantastic comedy of manners, complete with elaborate false footnotes, occasional period spellings, and a dense, lively mythology teeming beneath the narrative. Mr. Norrell moves to London to establish his influence in government circles, devising such powerful illusions as an 11-day blockade of French ports by English ships fabricated from rainwater. But however skillful his magic, his vanity provides an Achilles heel, and the differing ambitions of his more glamorous apprentice, Jonathan Strange, threaten to topple all that Mr. Norrell has achieved. A sparkling debut from Susanna Clarke--and it's not all fairy dust.  <I>--Regina Marler</I></span>

                    <span>To begin with, imagine Harry Potter as written by Jane Austen. While that is an imprecise high concept version of "Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell," it embraces the two most important aspects of the book would-be readers need to reconcile themselves with. If you are uncomfortable with magic -- not magic realism, not imagined magic, but actual magic done by the characters -- the book is not for you. Likewise, if the notion of reading nearly 800 pages written by Susanna Clarke channeling Jane Austen sounds hard to bear, wait for the movie.
<br />
<br />But for those who find either of those bearable -- or, better yet, an exciting prospect -- "Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell" is a strange and wonderful novel that you will live in for longer than you expect and shorter than you will end up wishing.
<br />
<br />One of the first truly adult fantasy novels -- which is to say, it emphasizes real emotions, subtle and conflicting motivations and genuine love over special effects, gore and sex -- Clarke's novel is full of characters who can be both repellent, attractive and pitiable, sometimes all in the space of one paragraph. The novel, even if one has given into temptation and read too many detailed reviews, is full of surprises, both of the large plot twist sort and or the small character moments sort. The ending, in particular, is a bittersweet wrench, perfectly in keeping with the rest of the novel, and yet slightly surprising and heartbreaking despite that.
<br />
<br />With the love between Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the scholarly passions of Mr. Norrell and a host of "theoretical magicians," the strange and eventually fascinating Childermass, the various cloying toadies, the sweet and in-over-their-head Greysteels, Clarke creates more delicately detailed and compelling characters than most novelists manage in a whole series of novels. And it is as much the love between Jonathan and Arabella that drives this novel as it is the love of magic of the two protagonists. But there is magic a-plenty, including spectacular magic wrought on the battlefield against Napoleon, whom one feels almost sorry for as Strange gets more and more comfortable in his role as Wellington's magician.
<br />
<br />But the plot is longer and more complex than that, and Napoleon is mostly a stepping stone for the magicians in their quest to return English magic to its rightful place, and their real enemy is subtle and devious, and more than a little insane. Their enemy is one of the most interesting antagonists in fiction, and Clarke successful makes him a mythic sort of villain. At the same time, she also manages to create a great deal of mystery around the ancient Raven King, creating a mystique around a totally made-up character that has the weight of real world myth and legend.
<br />
<br />Despite the novel's historical period and many ties to real world history, it's not necessary to know anything about the British fighting Napoleon, the poetry and life of Lord Byron or anything else of the sort. Clarke provides more than enough to understand and enjoy the setting, although the more one knows about history, the more Clarke's very low-key winks at it are revealed -- Byron's and the Shelleys' legendary Swiss vacation that, in many ways, gave birth to the modern horror genre gets a dismissive reference from Strange at one point, who obviously does not yet know the historical significance of the house on the lake and those who stayed there, for instance.
<br />
<br />I normally whip through a novel this size, particularly if I love it, as I did this one, in a weekend, or a week at most. Instead, I found myself putting the book down and not wanting to go further, wanting to savor and digest the book in small doses. Now that I've finished it, I only have a small short story by Clarke (on the official novel Web site) left to me of it.
<br />
<br />If the initial description -- Harry Potter as written by Jane Austen -- sounds good to you, don't hesitate. The sooner you enter the 19th century England of Strange and Norrell, the happier you'll be. This is easily one of the best novels, of any genre or literary merit, I've ever read.</span>

                    <span>Most books, I think, suffer when wrapped in hyperbole from the press. Very, very few of them can live up. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, however, not only lives up, it surpasses anything wonderful written about it. There are simply no words to describe how glorious this book is. And, make no mistake; this is definitely not, "Harry Potter for grownups." The magic is different, it's darker, and it's far more wintry, despite Clarke's occasional, and charming, flights of fancy. <p>The tone of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell reminded me far more of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens (two of Clarke's favorite authors) than it did of J.K.Rowling. For one thing, there's nothing modern about this book. The tone and atmosphere are definitely nineteenth century. Even the spelling of many words is nineteenth century, e.g., "chuse" for "choose" and "shewed" for "showed." Although many readers may find this annoying, I loved it and thought it added greatly to the charm and authenticity of the book. <p>Clarke seamlessly weaves her own magical world into actual history. So seamlessly that there were times when I caught myself actually believing in Clarke's make believe world. The book is replete with footnotes, something I usually detest. However, Clarke's footnotes are delightful and only add to the verisimilitude of her story. <p>Despite the fact that this book numbers nearly eight hundred pages of small type, it's not at all "wordy" and there is absolutely no "filler." Don't, by any means, be intimidated by this book's length. It's so well constructed and so well paced, it's actually a faster read than many books only half its size. <p>The ending, which can't be predicted, is bittersweet, heartbreaking, unforgettable and, best of all, inevitable. It also sets up a sequel, something I read Clarke is working on now. And, although much of the book enjoys a rather leisurely pace, Clarke picks up this pacing near the end, so that the reader, once he or she reaches the last two hundred pages or so, feels almost compelled to finish the book, no matter what he or she has to do or how late at night it is. <p>Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is, quite simply, a "ripping good yarn," masterfully crafted and flawlessly written by a woman who promises to be one of today's most imaginative storytellers. Don't miss it; to do so would only be denying yourself one of the greatest pleasures in the world of literature. Yes, it really is that good. Another novel I MUST recommend -- a very engaging read (of a different sort) I picked up off Amazon -- is THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez, a very entertaining novel I can't stop thinking about.</span>

                    <span>I just finished today and was much more moved by the book's end than I expected to be.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, loved the characterizations, loved the historical detail and the dry dry humor, but wasn't very emotionally involved until the end.  This is the kind of book you can't expect to like if you are impatient for things to "happen."  Things do happen, but it is minute attention to detail, manners and mores of the time, and an enjoyment of language that gets you there.  I'm looking forward to the next one, whever and whatever it may be!</span>

                    <span>Others have detailed the texture of this book by outlining its density and forewarning of its length.  They are correct. This book is the literary equivalent of an Amish quilt.  It is heavy, warm and cozy with small sparkling tales that serve as the patchwork for the whole.  This is the most lovely book I've had the pleasure to read for many years.  It is wholly dissimilar in style and substance to Harper Lee's _To Kill A Mockingbird_, but stands in my mind as its equal in terms of great literature.   </span>

                    <span>I found it both really hard to get into this book and really hard to stay with it as well.  Although it is well written, language and construction wise, and the ideas it contains are interesting, the delivery failed to grip me as a reader.  The author has adopted an early 19th century writing style, which although clever, is possibly one of the things that helps keep the early 21st century reader from easy immersion in the story.  I also found the footnotes irritating - there were just too many of them and I found they distracted from the 'flow' of the story rather than enhancing it.  The main negatives however, were the lack of almost any attractive / sympathetic characters and the very slow pace of the narrative.  The combination of these two factors led me to 'plod' through the book out of a sense of duty (given the hype) rather than reading with a sense of keen enjoyment.  There was no reading through to the wee small hours with this book and nor did I ever tell myself that I could just 'squeeze in a few extra chapters' before the main business of the day - and end up reading practically all day! </span>
