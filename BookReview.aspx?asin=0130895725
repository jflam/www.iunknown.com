                    <span>I am a student at a university, studying computer science. My professor recommended a book that the students should get to learn the c language. I got the book he requested and just wasn't getting it. After a friend had told me about "C, How To Program" by Deitel and Deitel, I bought and began reading the book. I felt more confident and did better in school. The book has exercises and a cd that enhance your knowledge of C even more. It goes beyond what my professor is teaching and each chapter converges with the sequence of his teaching. The book also combines C++ and Java of which I will need throughout my college experience. What a deal and this book has saved me so much time. I am very thankful and hope they continue to publish more books. I am now a faithful fan.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best book on programming I have ever seen. If you want to learn how to program, and I mean REALLY program, not just fooling around with little useless "hello world" type programs, then do yourself a favor, buy this book! This is the most complete treatment of programming that I have ever seen. It goes from the beginning, assuming no prior knowledge of programming, and by the middle of the book, you will be writting your own virtual computer, as well as a computer language and a compiler for it! The first 14 chapters are on C and focuses on structured programming. This is the most comprehensive treatment I have ever seen on the subject. It shows you how to 'design' software, and how to emplement and design useful algorithms to solve programming problems. Also the book is filled with highlighted tips on how to increase the performance of your programs, how to avoid common errors, software engineering tips, and how to write pretty looking code. Most books never even mention any of these things, and only contain useless snippits of code to show you the syntax. Unfortunatly, knowing the syntax of a language does not make you a programmer. The next ten or so chapters of the book introduce object oriented programming with C++. An intense treatment of the subject, while staying easy to comprehend and follow. And the last ten to 15 chapter cover gui programming with Java. You will learn how to write real multimedia applications! To make a long story short, this book is great in every way. All of its sections tie in nicely with each other and it flows well and easily. Also, the numerous examples tips, and excersises are great. Where most books make you do silly and useless excercises, here is one of the excersises from this book for example, in chapter 30 excercise 20 you have to write a complete gui drawing application. This just shows you how indepth this book goes. This book will teach you how to program. And the stuff you learn in this book can be applied to any other programming language. This book doesnt aim at just teaching you C, it aims at teaching you how to program, using C, c++ and Java as a tool. There is a big difference. Thanks Deitle & Deitle!</span>

                    <span>When i read the title, i thought the introduction for c++ and java would be one or 2 chapters at the most, i didn't know that this introduction would take a little more than half of the textbook. i was very dissappointed. i thought that all the book was covering C in more detail than others, and probably advanced topics on c. if i wanted c++ or java, there's alot of books that cover that, but i really wanted a whole 1000+ pages on c alone. oh well, i guess i have to go back to C primer plus. that' book is fully deticated to learn the c programming language.<BR>don't get me wrong, this a really good book, but don't by it and expect it to fully cover c.</span>

                    <span>assembly language was my first language i started with, then i wanted to move to learn C, i have recommended by a friend that the best book is "the c programming language", i started to read but i failed to learn anything because the book is very condensed and the author explains the material for someone who have learnt already high level language, so it does not work with me, so i just threw the book, then i bought deitel book, i found it a great book for beginners i finished it in some weeks, the book size is very big because of the too many comments and exercises so dont be afraid, but i give this book 4 stars only because the author did not explain some code samples as well as required, at the last chapters of the c section, and specially in data structures section, as i recommend that you read it from another book because i did not understand it as well from deitel book, i would recommend c primer 4th edition, the chapter of data structure is excellent better than deitel's data structure chapter..</span>

                    <span>There is a reason why Deitel books are used at so many colleges. I've used and reviewed enough Deitel books, including teaching myself, to know that the Deitels know their strengths. Based on the poor reviews I've read, It's clear that people, not surprisingly, are flat out jealous of their success. That's just human nature. There are many programming books I wouldn't recommend at any price! As with my review of the Deitel C++: How To Program, third edition, even more so if you're just learning C, I strongly recommend getting "The C Programming Language, 2nd edition," by Kernighan/Ritchie. I had programmed extensively with Pascal in the "real world" (It's come a long, long way), and that both made learning C, as well as differences and similarities, vastly much more simple. If you're taking a C course, this book is an excellent reference. If this is the text used, there is no better text book for C. If you're teaching yourself, This should be your primary C programming book with at least the aforementioned Kernighan/Richie book. REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU'RE LEARNING THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, THE DEITELS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE OF US WHO USE THEIR BOOKS, ARE VERY RESPONSIVE AND QUICK TO REPLY TO QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, ETC. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL? THIS AND OTHER OF THEIR MATERIALS ARE FANTASTIC, AND THEY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE--STUDENTS, PHDs, INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. I can recommend trash C and other books, but I'll pan them where they're listed. This book also contains a couple of brief chapters that provide C++ and Java concepts. That doesn't help you learn C, but it's a nice addition, especially if you plan to learn and use more than just C.</span>
