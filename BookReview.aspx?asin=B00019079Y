                    <span>Movies which begin with an interesting premise and then proceed to allow that premise to disintegrate are usually in that predicament because of an incomplete vision - by the filmmaker - of just what it is that he really wants to say. At this point story goes out the window, and what story cannot provide cinematography and editing are asked to substitute. They are used to hide the fact that the story has either disappeared or there never was one in the first place. And that is the main problem with Demonlover. 
<br />
<br />The director shirks his responsibility here. In similarly mind-entrapping movies like Fight Club (my favorite of the genre, brilliantly conceived and executed) we are yanked and cranked, our senses are stretched, things are not what they seem, but it all makes a kind of weird sense in the end. It does not cheat its own pre-established logic. 
<br />
<br />In Demonlover there is no proper logic (and it takes itself way too seriously - often a bad sign). Fantasy can have - must have - some internal logic by which it operates. It may not be a logic we are used to, but it does contain a logic of some kind to which it must be true. With Demonlover there is no internal truth, no operating system, no soul: we are simply hung out to dry. For example, in this R-rated version at least (I cannot speak to the NC-17 version as I have not seen it. Evidently there are twelve more minutes in that version though I have no idea what those twelve minutes consist of) the sly promise of titillating sexual perversion is danced around for two hours and then, finally, shied away from entirely leaving even that vain promise unfulfilled. There are murders that do or do not take place. We are never shown what really happened. And my supposition must be, in this case, that the director is using the tired - but still apparently fashionable - dodge of saying, well, you, the audience, you decide what is real and what is not real. Because I can't. This is a huge and utimately dispiriting cop-out. It's not artistic license here but artistic failure, a failure of courage and conviction. For an artist - if, indeed, not for all of us - that is the worst kind there is. </span>

<br />I absolutely loved watching this movie for the first hour. I disagree with comments slamming the visual style - the slick, over saturated, nervously jumpy, and tremendously atmospheric filming work perfectly to pull us into Diane's growing obsession with (or dependence on?) the over stimulation of the high-tech porn aesthetic. Moody and atmospheric, this film is filled with eye candy ranging from gorgeously detached shots of Tokyo to loving studies of Diane (played by the lovely and here compellingly transformational Connie Nielsen) and even a light smattering (though very light for those of us watching with one hand in our jeans) of hentai and 3-D porn. The movie is completely successful at setting up compelling characters, intrigue, and settings, but as so many other reviews suggest, it does fall apart on story. I spent ninety minutes thrilled, ten minutes just plain confused, and then seventeen minutes disappointed when I realized the film had left not only our reality (which is to be expected) but also its own. It could be argued that we ended up in what was left of Diane's reality but I'm working here to force up a story...the film figuratively and literally leaves us stranded in the desert. There's an unpleasant whiff of pedantic moralizing (the more we become involved with sex, violence, chaos, and objectification the more we...uh...become involved with sex, violence, chaos, and objectification) and a few shrill moments that break the otherwise flawless amoral, multinational, descent-into-helpless (and/or desired) submission to the commerce/sex/violence triad trance of the film, but there's still a lovely, liquid quality to the journey that successfully comes to a boil just a few seconds before evaporating completely.  
<br />
<br />And it is, overall, worth watching. The cinematographer and director come to the table with powerful visions, the soundtrack is the closest thing to an emotional through line we get, the acting is persuasive and absorbing, and the sets are fascinating and fully actualized. Now, if there had only been a writer involved, we might have really had something here...

                    <span>  Well, I just finished watching Demonlover the Director's Cut and read all the reviews here and I didn't see that anyone picked it apart the way I saw it so I'll have to do it myself. A lot people mentioned Lynch. I didn't see that. What I saw was, possibly, a guy who was reworking three of his favorite movies. First was Wages of Fear and the way he used the "three language trans world feel" and the forever throat cutting approach and second was Lost in Translation with that slick, aloof Metro disconnection style of cinematography. You've seen it now in everything from Taxi Driver to The Bourne Identity and a hundred others. Thirdly and most importantly, this is a reworking of Videodrome with a very little bit of eXitenZ thrown in. Instead of seeing from Max's viewpoint though, we're seeing it from Harlan's(I hope I got his name right), Max's assistant. I think it's a less interesting point of view, though. The porn and it's restrictions, the double dealings, things not being what they seem to be, the S&M and subsequent personal involvement in it and even the murder sequence could be compared to one: waking up in bed with the older woman associate and secondly to the assassination (?) of Max's partners. You could even say there's a little Tron there if you look hard enough right at the end. Mostly though, it's Videodrome and if there's any chance you haven't seen it and you happen to think this is a good movie, then you better watch Videodrome and see what great filmmaking is really about.
<br />
<br />Now I love Eraserhead, Santa Sangre, Videodrome, The Hudsucker Proxy, Spider, Belle de Jour, Saragosa Manuscript, Fellini's Satyricon, Amores Perros, 21 Grams and any number of complicated, even convoluted movies so when I say I think this is a waste of time it's not because I couldn't follow it. Incidentally, those other movies I mention are all must see films, if you haven't already.
<br /> 
<br />I'll very easily illustrate a simple reason why it's not so good. I've never seen Gina Gershon, no matter how crappy the role was, ever be anything but a joy to watch. I wasn't even sure it was her I was watching. I missed her name in the opening credits and she was so dull I didn't think it was her for a while. In fact I wasn't positive it was her till I read the other reviews. I glanced at the closing credits just long enough to get the name of the star with the bad (b..b) job. And what about the shot of Chloe lying naked on the bed playing video games. Was that just for the director? The description of the sex scene by Inframan is a hoot and is another clear example of poor direction in this trite meandering mess. 
<br />
<br />The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is it does have enough style to keep you watching and hoping. But it in doing so it becomes pretentious and that's pretty hard to be in these times.</span>

                    <span>Olivier Assayas creates a visually stunning film in a dark world where multinational corporations invest in anime porn with further interest to invest in 3-dimensional animated pornography.  The investments in 3-D pornography attract large amounts of money as several clients seek investment opportunities.  This also creates an atmosphere where corporate espionage becomes a tool to maneuver competitors as it could lead to a monopoly on the market of animated pornography.  The only thing that drives the people in the business of animated pornography is the trail of money, which becomes a path of greed, violence, and murder.
<br />
<br />The story begins on a plane flying from Japan to France where Diane de Monx (Connie Nielsen) poisons one of the executives in her company in order for a rivaling company to gain access to information in a briefcase.  This leads Diane into a spiraling exploit as she is put in charge of the Japanese account that manages the business of animated pornography.  When she enters the business transaction she is aware that she is being followed by an unknown source.  Nonetheless, Diane takes charge of her position and advances through the world of pornography while balancing it carefully with the company and the laws of France.  However, she displays no concern for people as she ruthlessly proceeds in order to further her self-interest.
<br />
<br />In the environment of Diane's own self-interest there are other people that are also looking out for their own interests by counter-espionage.  This leads Diane into a world of internet pornography and sadistic elements of interactive torture over the internet.  These people are, however, much more ruthless than Diane as they have no limits to how far they are willing to go in regards to making money.
<br />
<br />Demonlover becomes a quagmire of moral values as Connie Nielsen's character wanders a path where she loses herself to pride, greed, and desire.  On this path Diane finds herself lost and in a desperate attempt tries to survive as her life soon becomes expandable.  Assayas intends to display the corruption of the character and how this corruptive treatment affects the awareness of the character in an uncompromising situation.  Initially the story flows smoothly as Diane's life does, but as Diane becomes entangled the story loses itself very much like the character loses itself in the complex environment of deceit and greed.  This provides an interesting point of view which is similar to David Lynch's Lost Highway, but Assayas never creates the hallucinatory effect that Lynch does and the film does not regain its balance as it becomes apparent what has happened to Diane.

                    <span>I'll keep this brief, because a long critique would imply that the film is a substantial enough work to require a thorough going over. It isn't.  If you're morbidly curious, you'll find plenty of on-line discussants here who have imagined a far more intelligent film than the one I seem to have seen.
<br />
<br />The story--and I use that word reluctantly--is about some very, very, very big businesses that are involved in buying and selling. They are promoting, merging, importing, exporting, doubling, tripling, dot-comming in expensive offices with bathtubs.
<br />
<br />People must hurry. Everything is important. Secretaries have to run over to Kinkos at 3am to make copies of pie-charts.  Do you have the file??  It was supposed to be on my desk an hour ago.
<br />
<br />Someone's head will have to roll.  We cannot let "Competition, Ltd" get even one whiff. Or one Sniff. Imagine, a sniff for some snuff. People getting porno'd to death:an idea whose time has come and whose come is timed--no one should get more than he's paid for.
<br />
<br />Speaking of which, payment that is, the theatrical run of this mess grossed under one million dollars, world-wide. I am only greatful that so few people shelled out money to see it. With so many really good "foreign" and "indie" movies hoping to get a crack at commercial exhibition, we don't want to reinforce the negative impression that many "meat and potatoes" film-goers have of anything that doesn't carry the USDA seal.
<br />
<br />Thank you for allowing me to vent, and believe me I'm happy that there's a whole bunch of us who are starved for some real Substance and Beauty. We may disagree sharply over a particular film, but together we have let the film industry know that there's actual money to be made from "Art".
