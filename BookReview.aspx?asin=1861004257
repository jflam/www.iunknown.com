                <span id="Label1">For any developer who needs to understand and use Java's considerable built-in support for encryption and security standards, <I>Professional Java Security</I> delivers a capable guide to both the theoretical and practical aspects of implementing security on the Java platform. With a concise presentation that moves well and covers a wide range of topics, this book fills an extremely valuable niche for any working Java programmer.<p>  Classic titles on encryption and cryptography (such as Bruce Schneier's <I>Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C</I>) look at security from the ground up as if developers needed to write everything themselves. The good news is that with features like the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), Java security is standard equipment with today's Java 2 platform. This book does a great job at giving a quick overview of the way today's encryption algorithms (including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, and digital certificates) work, along with the way to apply them in Java. The authors anchor the theory here with practical explanation and code for using such encryption algorithms as Blowfish and RSA, plus using digital signatures and certificates and tapping SSL for secure communications over the Internet. <p>  While books on cryptography usually describe protocols with anonymous players (with names like Alice, Bob, and the like), the authors here use more imagination, retelling a scene from Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> in which King Claudius sends a message via Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern to do away with Hamlet. No, you don't need to have read the play to understand, but this scenario and its permutations highlight in a more entertaining fashion than other titles the issues in secure communications and the ways things can go wrong.<p>  More advanced material on securing JDBC database connections, and even on how to create custom encryption algorithms and plug them into the JCE, will let the more expert reader do more. (The authors demonstrate this latter process with sample code that implements the well-known RSA encryption algorithm.) For the busy working Java developer, coverage of the basics here will let you implement security in Java without having to reinvent the proverbial wheel. Smart, concise, and extremely useful, <I>Professional Java Security</I> is a truly valuable resource for creating secure Java applications with features that every working Java developer will want to know about and use. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview of enterprise security issues, defining a security policy, Java security features, support for security in Java code (accessibility, serialization, sealed JAR files, and privileged code), introduction to cryptography and encryption, introduction to symmetric and asymmetric encryption, authentication, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), symmetric encryption with Java (including password-based encryption, ciphers, and sealed objects), asymmetric encryption in Java (including file encryption with RSA), message digests, digital signatures, digital certificates, signing JAR files (permissions and applets), additional security in Java with servlets and EJB, the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), using SSL in Java applications, securing JDBC database connections, case study for a secure online banking application, building a custom JCE provider (using the RSA algorithm), additional security techniques (securing e-mail, timestamping, secure logging, using a nonce), and quick reference for using MySQL with JDBC.</span>

                    <span>I have one last class to finish a graduate degree in Computer Science and a substantial paper is one of the requirements. Since I have taken several classes in security and a passing interest in Java, I decided to look into Java security constructs. I picked up several books for this and I have to say that, despite all of the other reference materials at my disposal, I kept coming back to this book! First, it is well written. IMO, anything that is going to be published should be proofread and grammatically correct. Second, I expect the examples to work given a similar environment. This book does both. I have ran 4-5 examples and they have worked as advertised. The writing is clear and concise. Professionally, I work with databases and I appreciated the coverage of database and JDBC security. <BR>The only other book worth considering is the Inside Java Platform2 Security book by Li Gong. An excellent read. Pick them both up!</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book to get you started on issues such as encryption, public/private keys, message digests, certificates etc. The authors do know what they are talking about and I enjoyed going through it.<P>At the same time, I sometimes found repetitive text and code examples that are too elaborate. I find that most books these days try to cover too many topics and are unable to do justice to all of them. It almost seems like an obsession to achieve a certain number of pages or the buyer won't notice the book on the shelf. I'd probably blame the publishers and editors for that trend.<P>I would have preferred if the authors had added more depth than breadth to the book. For instance, I would have preferred if they had stuck to cryptography and skipped other aspects of java security. They possibly could have gone into further depth (behind the scenes) on the Java classes and their usage patterns. Also they could have dedicated a whole chapter or appendix to JCA and JCE, compared to the few pages they did.<P>But do not get me wrong, this is an excellent book which could have been made better by shortening some sections and elaborating some others.</span>

                    <span>I've never worked with security before, and found this book to be a GREAT introduction. Only under-average chapter is the one on JAAS. Furthermore a description of every term in the back of the book would have been great (believe me there's a lot of new terms in security for new newbie).</span>

                    <span>The cover of this book has photos of the authors, who have the boyish good looks of candidates for a 1990's boy band. The contents of the book belie the apparent youth of the authors. They both know the topic well and how to explain it. The not only know about how Java security works now, they also know about the quirks and peculiarities of the history of Java security. They don't seem to mention it anywhere in the book, but the authors created a nicely modified version of the GPL version of the Terraterm ssh client. Having read some of the Terraterm code I admire them for even making sense of it.<P>Unlike many of the Wrox technical books this is not a million page, multi author, multi topic tome but 520 pages that keep strictly to the title topic. There is plenty of information on the net about Java security but it is often hard to find and not explained well. This book goes right from the basics of explaining algorithms to giving substantial code examples for creating secure tunnels to manage database connections. I have read about public and private key algorithms several times in the past but the analogies used in this book really re-inforced my understanding. They explain the ideas behind some of the different encryption algorithms by using analogies with the characters in Hamlet the Shakespearean play. They go through the various permutations of how Hamlet could send a message to the king of England using a box locked with various key combinations. The analogies get longer and more involved with each algorithm, but they worked well for me.<P>Chapter 10 has a long example and explanation on how to create an SSL tunnel server, whereby they JDBC calls are redirected between a client machine. The idea is that you configure your client system to refer to a database on a local machine but the SSL tunnel server intercepts these calls and transmits them over the secure connection to the machine running the database. A matching program on the remote machine then redirects the calls to the actual database. This is a very similar concept to using an ssh tunnel, but you can run both portions on any machine that has a java system. This is a little like having a Java based VPN. <P>In one of my jobs we used the example code as the basis for a system for synchronizing files and directories between two different machines. This was an alternative to using rsync over ssh, as it it gave us operating system portability "out of the box". If we had not had the code from this book for the key ideas it would have either taken much longer, or we probably would not have started it at all.<P>One thing that would be good in a revised version of this book would be a step by step guide to installing SSL in Tomcat. It is not hard, and you can find how to do it easily on the net, but many people who buy this book will want to do it.<P>If you are thinking of putting Java applications on the web you will want them to be secure. Knowledge is the key to security and this is the shortest best informed route that knowledge. You probably need this book.</span>
