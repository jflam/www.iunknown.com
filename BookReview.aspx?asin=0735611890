                    <span>Well, As A guy who has his own web page, I find that it is very important to have a neat looking website, in order to aquire an audience.  However, getting a website to look excelent, requires hard work.  So, After Checking This Book Out At the Borders Store, I thought this book might be a nessecity for my webpage.  Basically, HTML is the origin of all web designs, and anything computer related.  This Book Has NEVER let me down, and has become my new best friend!  At First, I had to re-read a lot of things in order to get everything straight, but now its a lot easier!  I think you should get this book, because believe it or not, It WILL pay off in the long run!  Your shooting yourself in the foot if you DONT get it !!!  So, what are you waiting for?  Get This Book!</span>

                    <span>I am not new to programming but I was sure new to the field of web design. Looking for a book that would clearly explain the fundamentals of HTML and an introduction to XML was hard to find but I must say that this book was well worth the time invested to look for that kind of book. This book clearly explains the basic html tags and Cascading Style Sheets with examples that are trivial to follow. After going thru more than half the book, I was already feel confident to put these new skills to practice. As I said before, this book is excellent if you would like to get into web design. However, I would not recommend this book for an intermediate or advanced web designer because the material may be too simple for them.</span>

                    <span>I wrote a review of this some months ago with praise and admiration for this book. I thought that the book would end up on my shelf along with piles of other technical and instructional manuals. However and to my surprise, I've discovered that for the past 4 months this book has been a constant companion. I've turned to it for many small facts that slipped my mind from time to time. <p>The well-worn pages are testimony to a well-read book.</span>

                    <span>After designing a seven page read-only web site with Netscape Composer (which generates HTML source code) I found that potential Web hosts tended to become twitchy at the prospect of Composer's "inelegant code". Their concern is that not only would the code not be XHTML compliant (the standard for the future that is being implemented now), but that some of the code simply would not run on some browsers.<p>Swoon... I needed a quick fix book that would explain enough about XML and XHTML for me to go in and manually convert the Composer-generated HTML code for XHTML compliance. I also needed to be able to use a checking tool to verify that the altered/upgraded code would pass the test.<p>Thank goodness for Michael's book. My first bonus was discovering that Netscape 7.1 actually generates HTML 4.1 code, which is basically current. My second bonus was finding that Michael has a very readable style and gets to the point quickly. To be honest, I just speed scanned the vast majority of the book and used it as a reference guide while I dove in almost immediately to perform the XHTML conversion.<p>The way MM explains things, the conversion was a very simple process, and the icing on the cake is that he explains how to use the WC3 Validator online free checking service, which allows you to safely and simply upload your source code for a given web page, and have it checked in real time. One cute bonus from the Validator site is that when your code passes the test, you can download an icon indicating that your code for that page is XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant.<p>I'm sure there are many good books out there of a similar nature, but for me, this book by Michael Morrison works for people who just want to get in there quickly and do it. Like many busy men and women, I don't have time to read War and Peace, and MM appears to understand that need for speed and clarity.<p>Finally, while there is some breezy humor and a very friendly feel to the book, it does not descend into the infantile 2 cent jokes and puns that some books have been known to contain.<p>Excellent.</span>

                    <span>I must admit that when I decided to embark upon my adventures in web programming I was overwhelmed by the shear number of books on the topic of HTML & XML. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the style and approach of this book. Michael Morrison covers HTML, DHTML, XHTML, XML and CSS. But the book isn't limited to simply programming language, it also emphasizes the importance of style, content, appearance and special effects.<p>The author covers material in manageable portions, then displays the code, again in manageable portions, and follows up with easy to understand explanations that review the topic. This brilliant cycle is repeated through out the pages of each chapter. What is significant is that he puts all the code snippets from the chapter together at the end to show the reader what the end result is. And the reader can even follow along with a text editor to see his/her own work! The code is clean, the examples are easy to understand and the author is consistent. Bravo! <p>On the other hand, there were one or two topics that left me wanting for more information but I was readily able to facilitate my hunger by browsing the web. All in all, this book was a huge help and I recommend it supremely.</span>
