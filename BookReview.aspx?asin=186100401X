                <span id="Label1">Java is a powerful and fast maturing development platform used to create client/server applications on any platform. XML is the most recent markup language, a standard format for the universal sharing of data and an intrinsic part of all major development both on the Web, and in the wider business community. Enterprise web applications are increasingly combining Java and XML technologies to provide more efficient ways to integrate Internet presence with business systems in the world of e-commerce. <P>  <P>This core professional compendium breaks down into three main sections. The first presents the basic XML standards, Java APIs and programming tools for handling XML. The second part presents a selection of Java techniques which make up the building blocks for XML-based applications. The section is Java-centric, and presents the common scenarios for XML data I/O, building on the basic tools presented in part one. The final and largest section of the book shows how XML applications can be built on top of the techniques shown in part two, and demonstrates how XML can be used to solve real programming problems. <P>  <P>If you want a hefty box of XML manipulation tools at your disposal and would like to discover how the language could be used in your Java applications, then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>I have been working with XML for a while now, and this book offered a great coverage of most aspects of what XML application developers need to know. I am not able to keep up with everything happening in this very broad part of the industry - and this book provided enough coverage of the areas I'm not able to focus on on a regular basis to help me stay current. I'd recommend it for anyone who's working with specific areas within XML and want to stay current with the broader scope of what is going on. I'd also recommend it for anyone who is new to XML and wants to know the various Java APIs out there.</span>

                    <span>This is surely one of the Best Books availale in Market for Java Developers. I have been waiting to read a Book which covers all the latest XML API and how use them using latest Java Tools. Thanks to Wrox Publications for bringing this book to us. It covers how to do XML programming using all the latest Java API line I/O Sockets, Developing Presentation Logic, Developing Configuration and Deployment logic, Using XML in B2B applications. In short no other book in Market provides such a clear understanding of how to develop Java Based XML Applications. <P>Also it clearly explains how to use the latest Java Based XML Parsers like Xerces, Xalan and more. Friends if you need to get upto date with all the latest Java Based Parsers and different XML API, then this Book is really the Best one.</span>

                    <span>As happens with so many technical publishers, WROX is now seemingly cashing in on the reputation they established a few years back by writing excellent, well laid-out technical books that appealed to true programmers.<BR> Now, WROX hastily assembles a team of developers, has each one write a chapter in isolation, then releases all of their chapters back to back with little to zero editing, leading to a redundant, incoherent treatment of the subject, with page after page covering the same introductory material with subtle but insignificant differences. An oh, of course, there is the 250 page XML intro filler in the front, and the 300 page XML reference guide filler in the back, brining the actuall useful content page count down even further. <BR> No thought is placed on the overall coherence of the book or it's educational goals. <BR> It's clear that as WROX has grown, they have not been able to maintain the same level of quality they once had. Their editors are clearly not involved in the process, and arent creating anything that amounts to higher learning. <P><BR>There is NOTHING in this book on the more complex aspects of the subject matter, just a rehashing of what youll find in tutorials and in other generic XML books. My biggest complaint is the completely surface treatment of SOAP. No real mention is made of custom serialization, no examples exist for this. <P><BR><BR> Look for books from other publishers on this subject that are still "hungry". <P><BR> WROX is just cashing in at this point.</span>
