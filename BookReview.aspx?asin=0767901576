                <span id="Label1">If you dropped the Buddha into a modern metropolis, would he come off sounding like a 16th-century morality play or more like a drive-time disc jockey? Lama Surya Das doesn't spin platters for a living, but he does have a hip delivery that belies his years of sheltered training in Buddhist monasteries. In <I>Awakening the Buddha Within</I>, he borrows a time-tested bestseller format for a 2,500-year-old tradition that comes off as anything but ancient. With the "Five T's of Concentration," the question of "need or greed," and the story of the monk who bares his backside to prove a point, Surya Das invokes a path of wisdom that is as accessible and down-to-earth as a worn pair of loafers. It's not an easy path--it demands thought, effort, and discipline. But Surya Das is there for you, lighting the way to wisdom training, coaxing you into ethics training, and laying out step by step the path of meditation training. And if that's not enough to get you to live in the now, consider these words of the enlightened lama: "You must be present to win." <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>(4.75 Stars)<P>I really liked this book. I liked that it speaks in a current voice and is still full of wisdom.<P>I dig Buddhism books that give examples and situations of what they are talking about. This book has classic stories and classical examples of old Tibetan Lamas and has current stories and examples of the author in now times in New York City.<P>The famous phrase that really sums up the experience of reading with the author - Lama Surya Das - is the Deli Lama - again Awakening The Buddha Within is full of great Tibetan wisdom of old and it's related to today.<P>The emphasis in Awakening The Buddha Within is the eight-fold path. This is one of the best journeys down the eight-fold path I've taken.<P>Each aspect of the path is explained in detail, spirit and examples. It really is one of the best explanations of the eight-fold path I've read and experienced.<P>If you're a student of Buddhism and want to explore the eight-fold path this is definitely the book for you.<P>If you're new to Buddhism to this is a fantastic 2nd step to being introduced to the Buddha within.</span>

                    <span>This a fun-to-read introduction to the Buddhist path. Whether you are simply curious about Buddhism or are looking for some spiritual nourishment, this book informs and enlightens.<P>Lama Surya Das skillfully explains how ancient Buddhist wisdom can help us find peace and meaning in our fast-paced American lives. He conveys the beauty and richness of Tibetan Buddhism without making it so exotic or esoteric that is becomes inapplicable to our Western lives. He also has a warm sense of humor. ("America the Buddhaful" is the title of an essay by Lama Das.). <P>Das weaves the fundamentals of Buddhism with the story of his own spiritual journey. Find out how a nice Jewish boy from New York (his mom calls him "The Deli Lama") transforms himself into one of the leading teachers of Tibetan Buddhism in the West. For Das, an ex-high school jock, it's a long way from the locker room to the windswept monasteries of the Himalayas!</span>

                    <span>Lama Surya Das is one of the most well-known western lamas (priest and spiritual master teacher) hailing from the Dzogchen tradition. He was born in the U.S., and has studied Zen, vipassana, yoga, and Tibetan Buddhism with the great masters of Asia, including the Dalai Lama's own teachers.<P>Das' approach to Buddhism is sometimes controversial for the same reasons that it is so popular. He brings forth the ideas of Buddhism in a way that is graspable for Western minds, and he outlines practices that are compatible with Western lives. One of the main difficulties with many other informative and instructional books is that they require belief in concepts such as reincarnation which is not likely to happen for most Americans. Or they describe things in vague terms unfamiliar to us and leave us doubting the validity of what has been said. Das stands above most other authors in that he has tweaked his writing to make it applicable to American lives now. <P>In addition to the thought-provoking content of this book, Das is a good writer. The book is fun to read, because it is filled with attention-grabbing stories and amusing phrases. <P>I highly recommend this book if you are curious about Buddhism and wonder how the tenets might be applicable to Western life. It is quite useful for those who wish to incorporate Buddhist philosophy into their daily activities, or for people who just wish to have more peace and happiness in their lives. This book is also a wonderful gift for a friend who is unsure that Buddhism has a place in the modern world if you are already convinced.</span>

                    <span>I recommend Lama Surya Das' three books to anyone interested in Buddhism, spirituality, or the search for happiness. His background as a Jewish kid growing up in NY allows him an understanding of the Western world that even the Dalai Lama doesn't have.<BR><BR>His books are written in a plain-talk style instead of a textbook style.<BR><BR>But, most importantly, he explains how you can incorporate Buddhist practices and beliefs into your daily life without abandoning your native religion and/or converting to Buddhism.</span>
