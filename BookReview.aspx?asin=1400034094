                    <span>           This Book is very good at describing the details of the Gulag, and its history in general. It lacks behind in a few areas though, areas which are very critical. The Numbers.
<br />           The Numbers in this book are about the bottom rock low you can use. 30 Million passed through? The best numbers indicate 40 Million DIED, with many million more passing through. The Numbers are clearly very low, but that is partialy due to the Extreme lack of any evidence left in this world, and can only be use by the assumption of partial evidence, which is what the soviets WANTED You to see, with all the dreadful documents about the most dreadful parts being burned in WW2 while the Russians retreated from Ukraine and Russia while the Germans advanced, and the archives were annihlated in order to prevent the passing of the dark knowledge into the people.</span>

                    <span>The question for me in such tragedies of mass murder or forced labor or the inhumane way man treats man is "why".  I think that Ms. Applebaum comes the closest to explaining the why of the Gulag as anyone else has.  She is honest about the shortcomings of some of the information from memoirists and from USSR documents but continues on in order to make sense of the whole tragedy.  I am not any happier knowing what happened, I am more frightened actually that it will happen again and that so many don't even know that the Gulag happened at all.</span>

                    <span>In the history of the XX Century, at least as seen from the "Euro-centric" point of view, there were two great evils. One was Nazism, the other one was - Communism. Unlike Nazism, however, the general perception of Communism was, and still remains today, ambivalent. So often we hear of a "great socialist idea gone wrong". Indeed, for a reader of Marx or Engels the Communism may seem very attractive remedy for the wrongs of a Capitalistic society. Yet the social and political revolution, so essential to "Marxism-Leninism", through dyctature inescapably leads to terror where the goals fully justify the means and all of the sudden killing or otherwise "eliminating" entire social classes of people, e.g. individual farmers ("kulaks") becomes a small price to pay on the altar of building "society of social justice and equality". 
<br />
<br />Anne Applebaum with her new work, through the analysis of the forced labor camp system, does a superb job of presenting Communism, especially Stalinism, , in the right perspective. It was an evil entirely on a par with Nazism, if not even worse. Only the confusion around the "theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism" and the fact that atrocities of the Soviet system had "domestic", if you will, character and were largely hidden from the plain view of a "Western eye" made this false perception possible. It has to be changed and this book is a great contribution to this end.
<br />
<br />Having read so many laudatory comments from the fellow readers I can't possibly come up with anything new to commend this book. It is indeed the most comprehensive, most synthetic and most in-depth depiction and analysis of the Soviet forced labor camp system, the best since the famous "Gulag Archipelago" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 
<br />
<br />But I would add another reading recommendation, a book that was, as far as I can tell, the first to describe and analyze experience of living in the Gulag beyond just a memoir, one that any careful reader of this work will instantly recognize for Anne Applebaum acknowledges it as one of the main bibliographical sources and quotes from it very extensively. It is "World Apart" by Gustav Herling. Himself a Gulag prisoner and survivor Herling put his experiences of living in a forced labor camp on paper shortly after the WWII and published in 1951 in England. Unlike the voluminous works by Solzhenitsyn and Applebaum this one is relatively short and concise. And it is written in such a literary manner that it captivates reader completely, making him feel as if he were right there himself experiencing on his own skin the horrors of Gulag and seeing in his own eyes what can happen to a human being under such extreme circumstances.
<br />
<br />One of the main thesis of Applebaum's work is that to understand the essence of the Soviet concentration camps one needs to treat it as a part of the history of the Soviet Union: "...the Gulag did not emerge, fully formed, from the sea, but rather reflected the general standards of the society around it. If the camps were filthy, if the guards were brutal (...) that was partly because filthiness and brutality (...) were plentiful in other spheres of Soviet life."
<br />
<br />This point can and, in my view, needs to be taken one step further. For the history of the Soviet Union is a part of a still broader history of Russia itself. In this context another book comes to my mind. One by the Marquis de Custine: "Journey For Our Time". First published in France in 1843, it describes impressions of a French traveler (de Custine himself) to Czarist Russia in 1839 then ruled by Nicholas I. "The basic resemblances between the military and despotic rule of Nicholas I (...) and the absolutism of the Soviet regime are unmistakable". Indeed, one is left with a profound impression of how little changed between Czarist Russia and Bolshevik Soviet Union. This impression will, no doubt, be only further reinforced after reading another masterpiece, I highly recommend, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "Notes from the Underground".</span>

                    <span>The average person does not know about the Russian Gulags and the millions it killed. As Applebaum points out, it is a forgotten holocaust that continued many years after the Nazis.
<br />
<br />Applebaum give a comprehensive outline of the dynamic Russian political landscape and how it affected the Gulags and then peppers it with eye witness accounts of prisoners who were being directly affected by the governments policy at the time.
<br />
<br />This really is an eye opener. Nazi genocide seemed so much simpler compared to the reasons Stalinist Communism could send you to a Gulag for. I couldnt help but think  of Orwells big brother, double speak and the thought police when reading Appelbaums book.
<br />
<br />The significance of history is only through what is remembered. There definitely needs to be more written about this important piece of history.</span>

                    <span>Having read dozens of books on the Holocaust over the years, I was surprised at how emotionally draining I found this book. Statistics are inevitable in this subject - and also important: past disputes over the numbers of Stalin's dead (for example by Robert Conquest and his detractors) had to be fought.  But Applebaum takes us beyond the numbers into the heartbreaking stories of the individual victims.  Making extensive, but not uncritical use, of survivors' memoirs, she brings the horrors of the Gulag into distressingly sharp focus.     
<br />
<br />She also proffers some possible explanations for the Gulag system beyond merely asserting that Stalin was an evil paranoiac (which he undoubtedly was).  I was interested to learn, for example, quite how strong the economic motive was for turning hundreds of thousands of innocent people into slave labourers.  Stalin and the senior Bolsheviks saw this as a perfectly legitimate way of rapidly developing remote and primitive parts of the Russian hinterland.
<br />
<br />I now wait, no doubt in vain, for one of the many surviving Western defenders of the Soviet system to admit their grotesque willful blindness and to apologise to its millions of victims.    </span>
