                    <span>I have read about every book on the golf swing. This one has changed my game forever. Other than Hogan's Five Fundamentals, I have never experienced such an immediate change in the way I swing the club than since reading this book. It was like a light went on and in a instant, I UNDERSTOOD the objective. I have read it dozens of times and bought more than one copy for friends. It examines many errors of teaching, and takes the reader to the "four magic moves" that must be mastered to create a repeating and efficient swing.<P>This book lit a fire in my and my love for the game, and the feeling that I can "get it", continues to burn.</span>

                    <span>I went from a 3 handicap in high school to what G.P.Wodehouse describes as a "goof". When I couldn't play every day my game went to pot. I had never developed a solid swing that I could repeat time after time, I was clueless. I am now 41 years old and this book changed my life. Well, my golf life at least. I love the game again. Joe Dante teaches the "magic moves" in a way even I can understand and I'm a hardheaded old dog to whom new tricks are hard to teach. <P>The key to golf is delivering the club head to the ball square to the target (accuracy) while generating maximum club head speed (distance). Dante's early wrist break method is the key to consistent accuracy. His lateral hip shift is no secret to golf but it is the key to clubhead speed. The magic is that Dante teaches these moves in such a clear and concise way that, if you follow directions and practice his method, you will improve your golf swing and scores!</span>

                    <span>I have enjoyed the game for decades and have dozens of golf instruction books and videos in my library. It is highly unusual, in my opinion, to see much of anything that is unique and calls into question the core assumptions that are the foundation of most of these golf guides. This book is one of those rare ones that will cause you to ask some questions about what you think you know about the golf swing. I really like the Ralph Mann book "Swing Like a Pro", but I think I might like this one even more. Even if you do not follow the four magic moves covered in the book (I think the last one may well ensure future back problems), a reading of chapter 2 (called something like "sweeping out the rubbish") is worth the price of the book on its own. For me, I am going to try to firm up my grip and experiment with the author's early wrist set. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I have been studying the game of golf for 27 years now, and I can talk from experience. It is very easy to become misled regarding the golf swing, and to meander down many roads to find the nuggets that will assist you in executing the swing correctly. I've been there and done that. This book clears away much confusion. The explanations of what to do to swing properly are unmatched. It is an enjoyable read and, to me, one of the best breaths of fresh air regarding golf that is available. Get this book and work with it if you want to bring your scores down, and hopes up!</span>

                    <span>This book is a masterpiece. Dante et al begins by dispelling a multitude of golf's most common misconceptions and maligning advice. Each myth is expounded upon nicely so that there are no doubts as to why these time-tested pearls are mostly or dead wrong. This whole first section cleans the slate so that you're primed for the real matter.<BR>The manner in which this book is written and illustrated are first class. I've never read a golf book more descriptive, concise and correct! The reading is easy and the instruction intelligent and bold. There will be no doubt in your mind on how the swing should be conducted. Don't be dissuaded by original date of publishing... as stated above, it is timeless. <BR>If you're looking for a profound book that's not overly technical, easily understood, true and tested, this is it!</span>
