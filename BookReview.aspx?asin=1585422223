                <span id="Label1">Harried from recent changes in her life, the last thing Kristin von Kreisler needed was another dog. But when she came upon Bea, a scrawny beagle abandoned by the roadside, she couldn't turn her away. Bea became part of her family, and changed it forever. <br><br> Disheveled, malnourished, and terrified of human contact, for months Bea seemed damaged beyond repair. But gradually, she began to trust von Kreisler. After resisting her touch again and again, the dog one day leaned in and nuzzled von Kreisler's neck. From that moment, Bea began to give love as well as receive it. With the typically unforgettable personality of a beagle, over the next decade and a half she taught von Kreisler the value of living utterly in the present, of meeting each day with a good bark, of going on in life without being dragged down by past grief. <br><br> Written with rare eloquence and down-to-earth wit, this memoir of Bea and von Kreisler's 15-year love story will charm "beaglers" and touch the heart of anyone who's ever loved a dog.

                    <span>On one level, this is the story of Bea, an abused, bedraggled, emotionally broken beagle who has escaped from a research lab. The author finds her by accident, takes her home and, through infinite patience and understanding, gradually brings out the happy and sociable animal Bea was meant to be. The wallop comes in the final chapter, a powerful, solidly grounded and reasoned call to arms against unnecessary animal testing-and most of it is unnecessary-that every year takes the lives of some 20 million animals in the U.S. alone. A must read for every pet-owner.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for anyone who loves beagles, or anyone who has taken in an animal in need and nursed that animal back to physical and emotional health! Dog lovers will fall for Von Kreisler's touching, amusing story of Bea's transformation from battered-and-broken lab animal to cherished pet. Well written and entertaining, this book made me laugh and cry. I've already recommended it to all my family, friends and fellow beagle rescuers!</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was an eye opener about how terrible the effects of cruelty can be on an animal, but love and patience win out in the end. This is a very personal story about Bea and how thee author and her husband bring this abandoned victim back to the world, how it affected their own life and relationship. Very funny at times, sad at times, but uplifting and encouraging.</span>

                    <span>I have been owned by three beagles in my life, and I speak about them in a much more animated fashion than the author of this book does. I was thrilled to get it; I love any dog story, and if it's about a beagle, so much better. But I was disappointed with the way the book flowed. Much time was spent on the time right after aquiring Bea, and dealing with her adjustments, and a fair amount of time was spent on her declining years. But I felt the middle part was really missing. It was more about trials and tribulations than about the satisfaction of seeing a dog become an adjusted member of the family. I found the book depressing and sad, and the last chapter was too preachy for me to handle. She also borrowed liberally from her prior book. Very disappointing all the way around.</span>

                    <span>I saw this book many times up for auction at the Beagle Rescue sites but was afraid to purchase it because I thought it would be too sad. I read the book slowly one night and found it to be a heartfelt story about a much loved pet. As a beagle owner, I could relate, and laugh, about the stubborn beagle behavior of Bea. A little preachy in the end about what you can do about animal experimentation but otherwise a great read for beagle lovers.</span>
