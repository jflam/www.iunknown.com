                <span id="Label1">PR pundits and business owners Friedman and Yorio tackle the fear factor of women who want to quit their day job and build a business. They ask, "Are you the girl to run the show?"  They answer with a sassy list of pros and cons ("You will be able to get to your child's school play, but you will think about money all the time.") and with tough questions ("Could you negotiate a reasonable rent with an unreasonable landlord?) <p>  Every chapter is packed with interviews, charts, quizzes and witty directives about self-employment. Among their greatest hits: what's in a name, choosing logos, ten inspiring business chick flicks, legal eagles, business speak and visibility in professional associations. Friedman and Yorio sweat the small stuff. They explain, for example, why you shouldn't eat spaghetti at a business lunch and how to ask revealing questions of a potential employee or computer consultant. The authors' premise, "let women be women" is most compelling when they explore the unique challenges women face--from finding female role models to being a boss "without being a bitch." <p>  They are on shakier ground with the arguable assumption that all women share distinct gender styles and strengths. This type casting and the "girl friend" tone can sometimes belittle the book's smart and strategic ideas for becoming the boss. Still, it is hard to imagine a more readable, practical book about the challenges of being in charge. <I>--Barbara Mackoff</I></span>

                    <span>I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone (males too) who are considering opening a business. The book is developed in a way to give you sound advice and data of how to get started without sounding like a scientific textbook. There are going to be other supplementary materials that you will need to use to complete your business plan, but for the most part, THIS IS WHERE TO START!!!!</span>

                    <span>I love this book. This is aimed for women who want to start their own business. It's the only business book that I've read and its pretty easy to follow, the girls breakdown what you need to know, how to go about doing your own business, they're very inspiring and encouraging. They give you advice on how to deal with a lot of stuff when it comes to having your own business. Everything about having a plan to starting and keeping your business. Its so wonderful. There are lots of books out there about having your own business, and this is the one to buy if you're just starting out.<P>The book covers subjects like: if you're ready to own your own business, which business is right for you, legalities like licenses, permits, financials, funding, a business plan, promoting your business or product, what to do when you're the boss, acting like a professional, technology for your business, they also cover proposals, presentations and other business writing, at the end they give websites and other advice to finish off the book.<P>I'm glad that this book has been published, the advice in this book is very realistic. You can apply this advice in your life. These girls know what they're talking about.</span>

                    <span>Caitlin Friedman and Kimberly Yorio wrote "The Girl's Guide To Starting Your Own Business" for female entrepreneurs looking for advice and encouragement.<P>Several years ago, when working as publicists for a New York publishing company, Friedman and Yorio realized that they were essentially running a little PR company-supervising employees and managing budgets-within their larger organization. But, they didn't receive the financial rewards. So, they decided to start their own PR business.<P>Friedman and Yorio write: "...we visited bookstores and conduced on-line searches to find information that would help us navigate the terrifying waters of self-employment. What we found were books that ranged from the vaguely helpful to the downright unreadable. We found books on marketing and books on funding, books on partnerships and books on parachutes. We found a lot of books about how to sound like a man and think like a man. But who wants to do that? ... What we never found was the book that said, 'You can do it, girl. All you need is ____, ____, and ____!" This book will fill in the blanks. And there are a lot of blanks."<P>Friedman and Yorio do a good job filling in the blanks. They discuss the good things and the bad things about running your own company. Selecting an attorney and an accountant is covered. Hiring, firing, and managing employees are also discussed as is office technology. And, some down-home advice is given for home-based business entrepreneurs, such as don't lie down on the couch or you'll fall asleep. And, "The to-do list is your friend."<P>A short list of questions helps readers decide if they'd be good entrepreneurs. (Hint: the authors suggest: "If you are not a hard worker-don't even think about starting your own business." Even part-time entrepreneurs work hard. They just don't work as many hours.)<P>Friedman and Yorio also tell us that we'll need to learn about taxes. They write: <BR>"Even if you hire an accountant and bookkeeper, you are ultimately responsible for knowing these laws. And for some people (us included) this is torture. Not knowing has gotten us in trouble, like the $1,000 bill we had to pay the state government for not knowing about the timing for paying payroll taxes. Rats!"<P>If you enjoy doing payroll taxes-W-2s, W-4s, 940s, 941s, and more-they say knock yourself out. But, for the rest of us, if we have two employees or more, Friedman and Yorio suggest using a payroll service company to do payroll. (If you operate as a sole proprietor or a one-person LLC, and you have no other employees, you don't need to worry about payroll taxes.)<P>Friedman and Yorio tell women entrepreneurs to find experienced business mentors. The authors write: "A great place to start is the Office of Women's Business Ownership, at www.sba.gov/womeninbusiness/wnet.html (part of the Small Business Association). They manage the Women's Network For Entrepreneurial Training (WNET), which matches successful women business owners with new entrepreneurs. Or try a local chapter of a women's business organization, such as the National Association of Women Business Owners...They frequently offer workshops, lunches, and lectures, where you can interact with many potential mentors."<P>The book contains short question and answer blurbs ("Girl Talk") with successful women entrepreneurs who run a variety of companies, ranging from literary agencies and executive search firms to restaurants and freelance writing businesses. <P>Friedman and Yorio ask the manager at Springboard Center for Women and Enterprise ("...the largest venture capital forum that specifically focuses on women...") to provide "...the skinny on the big bucks." <P>The manager notes: "One of the keys to getting VC [Venture Capital] money is access and connections. Historically, VC money has gone to men. ... It's really all about connections and who you know. Men tend to have many more connections, through business school or industry, and can get their foot in the door easier."<P>Overall, female entrepreneurs or soon-to-be entrepreneurs will find easy-reading help and quality advice in "The Girl's Guide To Starting Your Own Business." You Go Girl!<P>Peter Hupalo, Author of "Thinking Like An Entrepreneur"</span>

                    <span>I read this book with the question, "Would I have benefited from this book when I started my own business?"<P>The answer is, "In some ways, yes." The authors create an energetic spirit through their upbeat, easy-to-read style. You find yourself saying, "Sure -- I can do this!" And, although increasing numbers of women are opening their own businesses, many identify with gender-based guides. <P>The authors focus as much on product as service businesses, and they discuss businesses with employees as well as solo acts. As a result, they offer a broad base, recognizing that readers must go elsewhere to achieve depth on any one topic.<P>The usefulness of specific guidance varies a great deal. The authors are best when dealing with matters of spirit and attitude. For example: "Keep emotions at home," "employees are not friends," and "recite these ten mantras regularly." <BR> <BR>However, the section on mentoring can be misleading to a newbie. As a former academic, I had to chuckle when I read (p. 227): "Maybe the dean of the business school is a generous and knowledgeable soul who likes nothing more than to give advice to female entrepreneurs." In my experience, deans give free advice only to those outsiders who are likely to become large-scale donors. And I haven't met too many business school deans who are "generous and knowledgeable souls." These days, you have to expect to pay for mentors unless you are very, very lucky. <P>So bottom line, I'd recommend reading this book for energy and a "let's get going" mentality. You can get the specific how-tos elsewhere.</span>
