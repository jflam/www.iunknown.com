                <span id="Label1"><P> Jenifer Estess is a woman on the verge: She's about to launch her own company; she's looking buff and dating vigorously; she's driving in the fast lane -- with the top down. At the age of thirty-five, Jenifer dreams of falling in love and starting a family. Then she notices muscle twitches in her legs. Walking down a city block feels exhausting. At first, doctors write off Jenifer's symptoms to stress, but she is quickly diagnosed with ALS, a fatal brain disease that is absolutely untreatable.  <P> <I>Max out your credit cards and see Paris,</I> suggests one doctor. Instead of preparing to die, Jenifer gets busy. She dreams deeper, works harder, and loves endlessly. For Jenifer, being fatally ill is not about letting go. It's about holding on and reaching -- for family, friends, goals. <P> Jenifer's girlhood pact with her sisters Valerie and Meredith -- nothing will ever break us apart -- guides them as Jenifer faces down one of the most devastating illnesses known to humankind. That same enduring pact inspires the creation of Project A.L.S., a movement started by the sisters that changes the way science and medicine approach research for ALS and the related diseases Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and which has already raised more than $18 million. Will Project A.L.S. help scientists discover medicine in time for her?  <P> Jenifer answers these questions and others in this beautifully written and wholly inspiring memoir that celebrates a life fuelled by memory. <I>Tales from the Bed</I> forces us to reconsider society's notion of "having it all," and illustrates, more than anything, the importance of endurance, hope, and, most of all, love.</span>

                    <span>I have seen the HBO documentary, "Three Sisters," with which this book is associated, and also read this book. Both were amazing and powerful, yet different. I walked away from the book, looking to do something more meaningful with my life, whereas the film was more educational as far as ALS is concerned.<P>The book kept me up, reading all night long, in a rush to continue with Jenifer on her journey to the end. When I read the final pages, I didn't want to close the book, in fear that the connection I established with Jenifer, Valerie and Meredith would disappear. The writing flowed like a familiar memory and the humor made me smile between the tears that dropped. I feel like I've known the Estess family for my entire life, even though I was introduced to them by mere text in the pages of the book. I recommend this book highly to everyone--not just those who have ALS or know someone with ALS. After all,like Jenifer, ALS could happen to anyone of us.</span>

                    <span>The iron will and inner strength of Jenifer Estess did not diminish nor deteriorate as her body did after being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. If anything, the knowledge that modern medicine had not a clue as to the origins or treatment of this devastating, terminal illness, empowered Jenifer and her sisters, Valerie and Meredith to get going. Their search for a cure that could ultimately save Jenifer and the hundreds of thousands of other ALS victims is told here through Jenifer's honest, thoughtful, funny, and very emotional memoirs. Jenifer's pluckiness and vivaciousness, her love of her sisters, family, and friends, and her determination to keep going, to have the best life she possibly can permeate this story. Eleanor Roosevelt's adage "if life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is also Jenifer Estess's and her sisters'. This is a beautifully written book -- a page turner with a powerful message about commitment, courage and love. <BR>I recommend it with flying colors.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book on the way home from a trip for some airplane reading and could not put it down. I was somewhat familiar with Jenifer's story from seeing her and her sisters on the Today Show and other news programs when they started Project ALS. But her courageous story of life and love and what it means to be family really touched my heart - and gave me some much needed perspective in my life. I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>I deeply admire Jenifer's courage and indomitable spirit.

I am challenged to love others more and do my best to make a positive difference in spite of daunting odds.</span>

                    <span>I just read Jenifer's wonderful memoir, TALES FROM THE BED and thought it was one of the most beautiful stories I've read in years. With all that was changing in Jenifer's life, she had her sisters and still had hope, and remained funny, heartwarming, and inspiring you can feel the love that she had for life pouring through the pages. I hope that you'll give yourself the gift of reading Jenifer's wonderful story and the legacy she left behind.</span>
