                    <span>Since I am just delving into the world of retail sales, this book was helpful in pointing me in the right direction.  It explains the basics and helps identifies important areas of consideration that will determine if your business will be profitable.  Not the be all and end all in information, but a first step in what is a very long journey.</span>

                    <span>I spent a LOT of time looking for a book that would "substitute" for 20 years of retail experience.  This book is like having a mentor with that 20 years experience guiding you in all the important concepts and tactical decisions, and providing templates for planning, actions, and checking results. For a "how-to" book, it just does not get any better than this!  </span>

                    <span>For anyone who is looking to delve into the abyss of retail planning & success, this is a proper place to start. The invaluable tips & worksheets provide a good starting point. Also, the author(s) put a great deal of emphasis on determining whether retail is right for you & the fact that you need to spend at least 1 year planning. As for me, I am happy to have read this book, and plan on keeping it as a reference guide.<p>MD</span>

                    <span>This book is full of great advice for anyone wanting to get involved with retail. The authors discuss the seven most important aspects of retail: the basics of retail, merchandising, buying, personnel, sales management, technology, and customer service. (There is a chapter dedicated to each of these topics.) Also included are step-by-step calculations to help you figure out expenses and budgets. Good advice is offered in the department of how to get the best sales out of your team by hiring, training, and treating your employees right the first time around. The tear-out worksheets located in the back of the book are a helpful bonus. If you are thinking of starting up a retail business, pick up a copy of this book first.</span>
