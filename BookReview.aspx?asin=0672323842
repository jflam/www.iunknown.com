                <span id="Label1"><P>J2EE has become required knowledge for any serious Java developer, but learning this large and complex specification requires a substantial investment of time and energy. Sams Teach Yourself J2EE in 21 Days presents the enterprise Java architecture in accessible, easy-to-comprehend lessons, describing how each J2EE tool solves the challenges of n-Tier development.  Using the architecture as a roadmap, following chapters describe Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JavaServer Pages (JSP), servlets, and more, giving readers a full understanding of J2EE development.</P></P>Further chapters cover the role of XML, custom JSP tags, and how Java Connectors allow J2EE applications to interact with legacy and non-Java systems. The book finishes with sample applications that put all the pieces together, including an example using J2EE to create Web Services. Along the way, every concept is illustrated with practical, real-world examples to ensure understanding by Java students as well as experts.</P></span>

                    <span>Comparing with Sun's J2EE Tutorial this is an excellent book.  It is easy to read and explains the concepts clearly.  I read Sun's J2EE Tutorial and hated it so much.  In a month you will learn  all important concepts in J2EE.  After reading the book, you may want to read books which devote the entire book on a single J2EE subject.  This book gives you an entry point.  Plus I just don't have time to read many books.  I need a crush course on J2EE.</span>

                    <span>This book is putting me to sleep! I bought it a few days ago and have spent that ENTIRE time reading. I'm more of a visual learner, usually the TYI21D books are very hands-on. So far, this one is harshly hands-off! How can I be expected to remember all this information? I need examples, not just charts. It doesn't look like its going to get any better later in the text, I've scanned-through the book several times wondering when this terribly detailed nonsense will end and from what I've seen, it continues through the entire book. -yawn-</span>

                    <span>If you are new to J2EE, and if you are not always online, you should use this book to get the big picture of J2EE. Go through it, skip details you may not need, focus on understanding concepts, use the online-documentation later on during your coding. I was testing the examples with the J2EE RI, with BEA, and with JBOSS. Every platform has had its own problems, but at the end, the examples were running each time. During my career I was reading lots of docs, but this one is well-written, clear and concise, it covers the most important aspects, I think, and let you the freedom to skip, what you think you may not need the first time.</span>

                    <span>This book does not offer much more than the Sun J2EE Tutorial online does and that is free. I have worked through the first two weeks, and I have decided to shelve it. The book starts strong with the JNDI. There are plenty of code listings for you to type in and try with good explanations on naming, binding, and lookup. After this the book is nothing more than a rehash of the Sun Online tutorial with a different larger example application. The application is complete. You don't do anything but read about the design and pertinent Java technologies that are being used for that particular part of the application. Then you are given instructions on how to deploy the current working piece of the application on the J2EE RI, and run sample clients against it - chapter after chapter of the same thing. Though this type of learning by reading some one else code with explanations seems to be enjoyed by some. I side with Ivor Horton. Programming is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Having the reader build the application and participate in the process would have made for a better learning experience of a complex topic.</span>

                    <span>If you follow the directions for loading the software "included" you will have problems. I hope the  content is better.<p>1. The J2EE SDK is not included on the CD. The J2SE SDK  is. Why?<p>2. The installation instructions are for three different OSs. They are jumbled, rather than covering one OS and going to the next. It's a mess.<p>3. Path length limitations for Windows 2000 are not addressed. Follow their directions for the JAVA_HOME path and you get nothing, unless you are very lucky. Granted the book is not about windows but the installation instructions should be correct and complete.<p>Maybe the content will get better but if you can't get there then what good is it. Just get a reference manual.</span>
