                    <span>Every Wal-Mart shopper should read this book before their next trip to the superstore. It gives incredible insight to the corporate day to day practices that put Wal-Mart at the top of the Fortune 500 list...AND at the bottom of welcome list for many towns across America.<p>Corporate welfare abuse, how Wal-Mart takes taxpayer subsidies to build stores/distribution centers, is just one of several practices this company uses to get richer and richer.  The most disturbing "enrichment" practice by Wal-Mart was its company owned life insurance policies. The company, not next of kin, is named as beneficiary!  The world's richest company should NOT be benefiting from the death of its workers. Wal-Mart also to this day help keeps sweatshop labor alive and well in third world countries. Abandonment of stores for larger ones becomes a town eyesore and America is suffering from over 300 abandoned Wal-Marts!  Time and time again economic impact studies show that most Wal-Marts cost a city/town more in services than it can pay in taxes-thus there is no plus to having a Wal-Mart in many towns. Just Say "NO" to Wal-Mart and stay out of the aisles....! Small town quality of life is worth more than a cheap pair of underwear!</span>

                    <span>In The Case Against Wal-mart, Al Norman delivers a blistering indictment of Wal-mart's meteoric growth and practices.  Even if you think you've heard all the dirt on Wal-mart, you will be shocked by the voluminous detail Al Norman provides on the inside workings of the company and the closed-door maneuvering of corrupt City Council officials that welcome them in with streets paved with Cash.<p>He provides direct numeric information about how Wal-mart forced large American Manufacturers to the brink of bankruptcy and then to move 10's of thousands of jobs overseas to supply them with their "always lower prices."<p>Just when you think that Wal-mart has hit a new low, turn the page and Al Norman will shock and amaze you again!<p>This is "the book" Wal-mart doesn't want you to read.  Every major publisher refused to publish the book because they sell too many books to Wal-mart and were afraid of retaliation.  Make them regret it!<p>The book is a must read for activists, labor union members, or any average citizen who is sickened by the tactics of America's biggest Employer and Retailer and wants to do something about it!</span>
