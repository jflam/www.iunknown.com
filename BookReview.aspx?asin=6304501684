                <span id="Label1">Using revolutionary cameras, the directors of this French film (with minimal English-language narration) have made an amazing chronicle of the insect world. There are at least a dozen fascinating, memorable images, and the carnage is held to a minimum. Some favorites include a caterpillar traffic jam, a frog's bout with a rain storm, and a bird that turns into Godzilla for a bunch of ants. Then there's the snail mating scene that must be seen to be believed. Great for families. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. It shows everyday life among bugs in a European meadow. It shows snails mating, ants scrambling for shelter to avoid being eaten by a pheasant, a dung beetle rolling his delicious (?) dinner up a hill, and other things bugs do in their everyday lives. That's it, there's no real plot to it, it's just a documentary.<P>Okay, so it's not exactly something you'd take a girl on a date to see, but it's a very well-made film. The camerawork is truly astounding. I don't know how they got such incredible close-ups. I became totally engrossed in this fascinating tale of everyday life in a world that nobody notices, yet it's right in our very own backyards. "Microcosmos" is a great movie to show to anyone who is interested in nature (I myself saw it in a high school biology class), and it's kid-friendly too! <P>The one thing I did not like about "Microcosmos" was the overly bombastic music played during several scenes of the film.</span>

                    <span>This is a mesmerizing look into the life of insects, with "real time" photography as well as slow motion and time lapse sequences. It also shows the predators who live off them, like the frogs, and the pheasant who gobbles up ants; flowers and how their life cycle is interconnected with the insects that pollinate them, as well as the carnivorous Drosera, as it devours a wasp-like creature.<BR>There is even a portion in the night, with the nocturnal activity seen in the glimmer of moonlight, and also a marvelous rainstorm, with close-ups of the droplets falling.<BR>The two most memorable scenes are the snails who mate with grace and abandon, and seem to become "one flesh", and the horned beetles in a battle that shows incredible violence and tenacity; both these segments seem to reflect "human" qualities, and fill the mind with wonder.<P>There is a beautifully written but short introduction and epilogue, read by Kristin Scott Thomas, and a score by Bruno Coulais, which consists mostly of vocal music, sung by mezzo Mari Kobayashi, and the charming young voices of Hugo and Louis Coulais; much of the film is in silence however, with just the sound of the insects.<BR>A visual feast that is the creation of the Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou, who share credits as director/writer/cinematographer, and additional cinematography was done by Thierry Machado and Hugues Ruffel.<BR>Total running time is 80 minutes, and you will never look at a lowly snail in the same way again.</span>

                    <span>In similar vein to Reggio's seminal Koyaanisqatsi, Microcosmos is a film without commentary, other than a one-sentence introduction and a few poetic words at the close. <P>It presents the viewer with a gorgeous series of tableaux starring the amazing micro-fauna occupying a meadow. I guarantee the first thing that springs to mind when viewing Microcosmos for the first time is "how did they film that?!!" Achingly beautiful close-ups of ants, caterpillars, butterflies, snails, ladybirds, the bizarrely alien-looking mantis and dozens more give us an unique insight into the oft-ignored world beneath our feet.<P>The whole 72 minutes is one great therapeutic trip - just sit in your comfiest chair and let the vivid colours and sumptuous sound (natural insect noises occasionally punctuated with minimalist ambient music) wash over you.<P>Favourite scenes include the sissyphus-like dung-beetle, the ants at the "waterhole", the snail lovers, the spider's "aqualung", the stag beetles' battle and the jaw-droppingly stunning finale of the nascent mosquito breaking free of the meniscus of the pond on its impossibly long legs. Even the moment of microcosmic horror, when a strangely prehistoric looking pheasant perpetrates some genocide, is magnificently filmed and utterly satisfying.<P>Possibly the first wildlife film to cross the boundary into pure art.<P>I guarantee you will feel a better and more harmonious person for having viewed Microcosmos.</span>

                    <span>My first viewing of Microcosmos left me enchanted. It also left me feeling as if I'd emerged from an hour in a hot tub, and I slept like a baby. The enchantment and the deliciously soporific effect kicked in immediately with Viewing Two, and other impressions began to form as well. Impressions of gentle hilarity; of existential horror; of earthly abundance that-like fractile geometry-moves you closer to infinity the closer you look. <P>"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise." [Proverbs VI:vi.] Why, I often wonder, are we always so compelled to draw human lessons and morals from observations of Nature and her creatures? Why must we always anthropomorphize the creatures instead of taking them according to their own mysterious natures? Well, watching the scene of the mating snails makes me surrender these objections. Nakedness and tenderness can't have much more to teach us than they do in this encounter and delicate mutual exploration. The fact that the snails wind up rolling over into the grass is just a bonus!<P>The score for this film is perfectly inspired by and wed to its subject. A few words, a few bars of music, a vast silence. Brilliant.<P>Despite the fun it is to watch this film, I rarely watch it. Like food cravings, Microcosmos lets you know when it's time to watch. And then it's completely satisfying. After you've seen it, you'll never walk through grass the same way again.</span>
