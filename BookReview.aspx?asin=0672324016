                    <span>This is to inform you that I will never buy another book from Sams!  You really should be ashamed of yourselves for releasing such a poorly edited piece of garbage with your name attached.  This is particularly unfortunate because the authors have presented a fairly comprehensive review of the capabilities of Flash Mx and Flash Actionscripting.  However, because of the outrageous number of errors, both in the book and on the accompanying web site, it it difficult to follow and complete far too many of the exercises.  I wish I had a dollar for every hour I have wasted because of this book - going down blind alleys, barking up the wrong tree, chasing ghosts, etc.  Lord, how frustrating!<p>Thank you, <p>A former customer</span>

                    <span>There is good about this book and there is bad about this book. The good: This book has many examples and explains to the reader how to do lots of different things with flash. Take a look at the contents of the book and you will see that it covers a great deal.<br>The bad: This book is full of mistakes. The editor should be fired for what he did with this book. One or two mistakes in a book is OK BUT this book has an average of  1 mistake per chapter and this is NOT acceptable in a professional book. My advice is: If you can find another Flash MX book that will cover all of the same topics as this one, then get it otherwise buy a USED copy of this book.</span>

                    <span>If you are thinking about buying this book, don't. If you have already purcahsed this book, as I have, return it immediately. If it is too late to return it, the unethical thing to do is sell it to someone else, but you know what I would really recommend.<p>The organization of the book looked enticing to me, which is why I bought it. The book covered everything I wanted it to, while providing specific examples for the development environment I was going to use. However... While working through the examples I thought I was either going totally insane, or that I had gone completely stupid. This book is inacurate, inconsistant, and generally flawed to the point where a third grader could do a better job of proofreading it.<p>The reason I bought the book was because the table of contents matched my needs in a comprehensive Flash MX book, as well as a general trust in Sams Publishing materials. This book has really let me down! Had I first read the feedback here -- before buying the book at [a local store] -- besides getting a better deal, I would have saved myself many hours of frustrating toil. From now on the first thing I do when shopping for a book is to come to amazon.com and read customer reviews.<p>Save the Trees! Recycle this Book! Go buy ActionScripting in Flash MX by Philip Kerman. You'll be happy you did!</span>

                    <span>The multitude of errors in this book have coused me countless hours of wasted time. I was so frustrated trying to make the most simple action work that I contacted the makers of the book who apologiezed and blamed the technical editors then recomended returning the book and getting Action Scripting in Flash by Philip Kerman. There are several corrections on the website but this represents only a fraction of the errors in the book that range from bad code, files in exercizes misnamed to the wrong images used in examples and that can all be found in one exercize!<br>Do NOT BUY THIS BOOK !!!!!</span>

                    <span>I have just begun reading the book, and on the simplest example, there are incorrect steps.   I know A LITTLE about the concepts used in Flash, so I was able to get around the tutorial, but I would not recommend this book.  How are you to know what is right or wrong if you have never seen it before?  It is obvioulsy hard to tell if a book is accurate until you have spent your money, so choose wisely!</span>
