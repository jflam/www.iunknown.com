                    <span>Linda R. Monk, author of _The Bill of Rights: A User's Guide_, has done an amazingly fine job with this book. If you want a one-volume introduction to the Constitution of the United States, this is it. (As a lawyer I try to keep an eye out for books I can recommend to people who want to learn how U.S. law works. This one and Jay Feinman's _Law 101_ are two of the best.)
<br />
<br />In just over two hundred pages, Monk walks the reader through the text of the entire document (including the Bill of Rights), giving history, relevant cases, and an overview of competing interpretations. Sidebars present relevant quotations from, well, lots of people -- Charlton Heston on the Second Amendment, Ted Nugent on the importance of copyright, and tons of others. Monk makes her selections from across the political spectrum and she carefully refrains from taking sides herself. Terms that won't be familiar to the typical reader are defined in the margins.
<br />
<br />Despite what you may have heard, her presentation is neither 'liberal' nor 'revisionist'. (For example, her presentation on the Second Amendment is nicely handled; we hear from all sides, but Monk makes clear that a federal appellate court has held that the right to bear arms is unambiguously an _individual_ right.) In fact, she does remarkably well at presenting all major points of view on each issue within a very short space, and she doesn't slight anyone; any reviewer who thinks otherwise didn't read the book very carefully (if at all).
<br />
<br />Don't let the noise from the peanut gallery scare you off. People who don't want a 'living constitution' don't have a clue what it would be like to have a dead one. (For one thing, libertarians -- of whom I am one -- would be miserable. The police wouldn't need warrants to tap phone lines; electronic eavesdropping wasn't a 'search' until 1967, when _Katz v. U.S._ expanded the Fourth Amendment to protect us wherever and whenever we have a 'reasonable expectation of privacy'. And yes, that case is covered in here -- along with _Olmstead_, which it overruled, and _Kyllo_, which expands it to cover thermal imaging.)
<br />
<br />Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what the Constitution says and means. And that should include all Americans -- even the ones who already have copies of the Cato Institute's Constitution and Declaration booklet.</span>

                    <span>The annotated footnotes convey the modern statist revisionist interpretation of the Constitution. Oh, the Second Amendment affirms the state's right to keep firearms... States always had a problem procuring arms, so apparently they needed to affirm their right to have arms huh? --Cynicism-- Liberals love their so called "Living Constitution," where it is warm and fuzzy and beholden to the peculiar interprations of Supreme Court justices when they feel we've reached the next stage of social evolution. Every so often, they a take a deep breath, and uncover new "rights" in the "penumbras and emanations" that are actually hidden in our Constitution. They found the right to privacy for instance, which has a corollary right to infanticide (i.e. Roe v. Wade, legalisation of abortion.) Likewise, they have discovered old rights (i.e. right to keep and bear arms) really weren't rights at all, but just misunderstood...  Oh for joy! Three cheers for the junior-varsity Congress we know as the U.S. Supreme Court.
<br />
<br />Get the Cato Institute's Constitution and Declaration booklet in one and spare yourself the poor revisionist commentary.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book, especially for introducing advanced junior high and senior high kids to the US Constitution and the issues involved, or for adults who want a good overview of the Constitution, its meaning, and the sides of each issue.  
<br />
<br />It contains quotes from founding fathers and from famous and ordinary citizens from revolutionary period to the present.  
<br />
<br />The author does a good job of impartially presenting different sides of the issues.
<br />
<br />I wish the author had included the large numbers of violations of 4th Amendment (search and seizure) that have occurred to families who have chosen to educate their children at home, even when parents have indicated at the door the need for social workers and school personnel to have a valid search warrant.  Such information can be found a www.hslda.org , particularly at http://www.hslda.org/search.asp .  This is a very real and current battle being waged for the rights of citizens that is guaranteed by the 4th amendment.  
<br />
<br />If rights are denied to the few, the rights of all are in danger.
<br />
<br />Anyway, this is an interesting book, and does a good job of explaining the meaning of the constitution step-by-step, and of including controversies surrounding each issue.</span>

                    <span>I really liked this book and I feel like a better American for having taken the time too learn more about the document that made America the democracy envied around the world.  I believe that every American should take it upon themselves to learn about their constitution instead of listening to what the talking  heads and politicians tell them what it says.  Maybe then we wouldn't have some of the problems we have.  Now, I tend to be a liberal/progressive individual politically, but even I found some bias in the author's opinions, especially concerning the 2nd amendment, but that's what is so great about living in a free society:  you can make up your own mind about such things.</span>

                    <span>To put it simply but emphatically, The Words We Live By: Your Annotated Guide To The Constitution by Linda R. Monk should be in every school and community library collection in America. Divided into two major sections (Part I: The Constitution Of The United States; Part II: Amendments To The Constitution Of The United States), the highly readable, easy to assimilate text is enhanced with occasion b/w photography. From high-school students fulfilling school assignments about the Constitution, to adults wanting to refresh themselves with respect to national issues of controversy with reference to Constitutional rights and responsibilities (especially with issues arising from the current "War on Terrorism" and "The Patriot Act"), The Words We Live By is perfectly suited as an informed and informative reference.</span>
