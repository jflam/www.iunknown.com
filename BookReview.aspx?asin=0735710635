                <span id="Label1">Stephen Northcutt and his coauthors note in the superb <I>Intrusion Signatures and Analysis</I> that there's really no such thing as an attack that's never been seen before. The book documents scores of attacks on systems of all kinds, showing exactly what security administrators should look for in their logs and commenting on attackers' every significant command. This is largely a taxonomy of hacker strategies and the tools used to implement them. As such, it's an essential tool for people who want to take a scientific, targeted approach to defending information systems. It's also a great resource for security experts who want to earn their Certified Intrusion Analyst ratings from the Global Incident Analysis Center (GIAC)--it's organized, in part, around that objective. <p>  The book typically introduces an attack strategy with a real-life trace--usually attributed to a real administrator--from TCPdump, Snort, or some sort of firewall (the trace's source is always indicated). The trace indicates what is happening (i.e., what weakness the attacker is trying to exploit) and the severity of the attack (using a standard metric that takes into account the value of the target, the attack's potential to do damage, and the defenses arrayed against the attack). The attack documentation concludes with recommendations on how defenses could have been made stronger. These pages are great opportunities to learn how to read traces and take steps to strengthen your systems' defenses.<p>  The book admirably argues that security administrators should take some responsibility for the greater good of the Internet by, for example, using egress filtering to prevent people inside their networks from spoofing their source address (thus defending other networks from their own users' malice). The authors (and the community of white-hat security specialists that they represent) have done and continue to do a valuable service to all Internet users. Supplement this book with Northcutt's excellent <I>Network Intrusion Detection</I>, which takes a more general approach to log analysis and is less focused on specific attack signatures. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>External attacks on networks and hosts, as they appear to administrators and detection systems monitoring log files <li>How to read log files generally <li>How to report attacks and interact with the global community of good-guy security specialists <li>The most commonplace critical security weaknesses <li>Traces that document reconnaissance probes <li>Denial-of-service attacks <li>Trojans <li>Overflow attacks <li>Other black-hat strategies</ul> </span>

                    <span>This is the best book about Intrusion Signatures published yet. <BR>I teach computer security at a local university, and with the only help of this book, I could take care of all the practical aspects of my last course. If you have already a good background on this field, and read and understand thoroughly the book, then you can afford any related security certification test.<BR>Chapters 3 through 17, present several well documented cases, which, in turn, are discussed following the same standard:<BR>- Presentation<BR>- Source of Trace<BR>- Detect Generated by<BR>- Probability the Source Address Was spoofed<BR>- Attack Description<BR>- Attack Mechanism<BR>- Correlations<BR>- Evidence of Active Targeting<BR>- Severity<BR>- Defense Recommendations<BR>- Questions<P>Chapter 1 introduces the reader to Analysis of Logs (including Snort, Tcpdump, and Syslog), IDS, and Firewalls. Even being a quick review, it is quite useful, though.<BR>Chapter 2 explains the way the cases are studied.<P>The covered vulnerabilities and attacks include:<BR>- Internet Security Threats<BR>- Routers and Firewalls Attacks<BR>- IP Spoofing<BR>- Networks Mapping and Scanning<BR>- Denial of Service<BR>- Trojans<BR>- Assorted Exploits<BR>- Buffer Overflows<BR>- IP Fragmentation<BR>- False Positives<BR>- Crafted Packets<P>At the bottom line, this is one of the 5 best computer security books I ever read. Even for non experts, the book can be a valuable tool to improve the understanding on this field.<BR>Try it.</span>

For that, this title is perfect!<P>It's great to learn intrusion detection, packet analysis, forensics, attack methodologies, attack recognition, and similar topics. And oh, by the way, if you have any interest at all in certification, Intrusion Signatures and Analysis is the study guide for one of the hottest new certs there is: SANS GIAC Intrusion Detection In Depth.</span>

                    <span>A must-have for the serious network security professional, Intrusion Signatures And Analysis opens with an introduction into the format of some of the more common sensors and then begins a tutorial into the unique format of the signatures and analyses used in the book. Readers will find page after page of signatures, in order by categories as well as a case study section on how attacks have shut down the networks and web sites of Yahoo, and E-bay and what those attacks looked like. As an added feature, the collaborative authors Stephen Northcutt; Mark Cooper; Matt Fearnow; and Karen Frederick included review questions with throughout the book to help readers be sure they comprehend the traces and material that has been covered. Intrusion Signatures And Analysis is a recommended resource for the SANS Institute GIAC certification program. 448 pp.</span>

Further, this book gives neophytes a real sense of what can be monitered and how important intrusion detection is in security layering.</span>

                    <span>The real-world signatures in this book, along with the analysis, make this a wonderful reference book. There is, of course, no substitute for experience. However, this book provides an excellent baseline of experience for any Intrusion Analyst! From that baseline one should be able to better analyze future attacks; there is, after all, only so much an attacker can do.<P>This book was made possible by contributors to GIAC (Global Incident Analysis Center); professionals out "in the trenches" dealing with attacks of all shape and size on a daily basis. These traces were not generated in a lab; they're the same traces you will see on your network if you're looking for them. <P>I've already used this book as a reference guide and it sits on my shelf next to "TCP/IP Illustrated V1" by Dr. Richard Stevens and "Intrusion Detection: An Analysts Handbook V2" by Stephen Northcutt and Judy Novak- I use all on a regular basis. <P>Whether you are just starting out in the IDS realm or whether you're an established Analyst sitting on an enterprise of sensors this book is for you.<P>-- Brent Deterding Enterprise Manager of Network Security - Solutia Inc.</span>
