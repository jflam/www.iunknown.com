                <span id="Label1">Curtis Sittenfeld's poignant and occassionally angst-ridden debut novel <I>Prep</I> is the story of Lee Fiora, a South Bend, Indiana, teenager who wins a scholarship to the prestigious Ault school, an East Coast institution where "money was everywhere on campus, but it was usually invisible." As we follow Lee through boarding school, we witness firsthand the triumphs and tragedies that shape our heroine's coming-of-age. Yet while Sittenfeld may be a skilled storyteller, her real gift lies in her ability to expertly give voice to what is often described as the most alienating period in a young person's life: high school.<p>  True to its genre, <I>Prep</I> is filled with boarding school stereotypes--from the alienated gay student to the picture perfect blond girl; the achingly earnest first-year English teacher and the dreamy star basketball player who never mentions the fact that he's Jewish. Lee's status as an outsider is further affirmed after her parents drive 18 hours in their beat-up Datsun to attend Parent's Weekend, where most of the kids "got trashed and ended up skinny-dipping in the indoor pool" at their parents' fancy hotel. Yet even as the weekend deteriorates into disaster and ends with a heartbreaking slap across the face, Sittenfeld never blames or excuses anyone; rather, she simply incorporates the experience into Lee's sense of self. ("How was I supposed to understand, when I applied at the age of thirteen, that you have your whole life to leave your family?")<p>  By the time Lee graduates from Ault, some readers may tire of her constant worrying and self-doubting obsessions.  However, every time we feel close to giving up on her, Sittenfeld reels us back in and makes us root for Lee.  In doing so, perhaps we are rooting for every high school student who's ever wanted nothing more than to belong. <I>--Gisele Toueg</I></span>

                    <span>An Amazon review reader for years, I've never felt compelled to actually review a book myself. However PREP has infuriated me to the point where I need to vent. Never has a book simultaneously bored and riled me! The main character, Lee, is a snippy, whiny, unmotivated and throughly dislikeable person; unfortunately she is surrounded by a cast of characters equally unengaging.  If this is an autobiographical novel, perhaps we can excuse the tedious, mundane story and the intensely irritating characters. However that does NOT excuse the sloppy writing -- particularly from someone with the stellar credentials of the author. (If the book is not autobiographical . . . .well, shame!)
<br />
<br />The central character never grows, never grabs opportunities for self-improvement, never learns from her mistakes.  If you don't like her in the first chapter, sorry! "What you see is what you get."  Lee remains cynical, bitter, mypoic and unpleasant throughout.  Her teachers come across as academic lamebrains, her peers as one-dimensional typecasts.  In true "PC" mode, one is set up to believe that Lee feels alien because she is a (white) scholarship student in a privileged, moneyed cloister. In fact, few well-heeled students could equal Lee's expectations that friendship, romance, academic success and simple grounding be handed to her on a silver platter. (I vacilated between wanting to call in a therapist on her balf and wanting to throttle her!)
<br />
<br />Shame on this heralded private school teacher for foisting upon us such drek!</span>

                    <span>Of course, PREP is a fish-out-of-water/coming-of-age story, this time set in South Bend, Indiana; and it tells the story of Lee Fiora who wins a scholarship at an upscale (yes, Prep) boarding school.<p>What makes this novel particularly enjoyable is the clean and unpretentious writing and the ability of author Curtis Sittenfeld to get inside her character's head; this is a very convincing portrayal of the "angst years" of late adolescence; and many times throughout the novel, I was hit with pangs of recognition because of course I recognized myself. An excellent character study much unlike Holden Caulfield, although very authentic -- at least for this reader. It's great to come across such an intelligent and perfectly rendered depiction of the horribly self-conscious years of heartbreak and hope. Usually it's told from a male point-of-view; but here we have a new perspective: a gal's experience. And, again, it rings true. And, need I mention, there's also quite a bit of humor in the book, much of it arising organically from the characterization of Lee Fiora: it's not forced, artificially imposed. Truly artful.<p>The only thing I don't like about this book is the title -- the rest is very well done and certainly worth your time and money. So pick up a copy! I guarantee you'll be enthralled. Another book I need to recommend (very much on my mind since I purchased a used copy off Amazon) is THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez, a somewhat obscure, highly entertaining novel similar in age-range to this book -- and one I can't stop thinking about. So, without question, my last two Amazon recommendations would be: PREP: A NOVEL by Curtis Sittenfeld and THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez.</span>

                    <span>I had high hopes for this book. Seemed like it would be a good story yet the author never fully develops Lee. You never really get a clear understanding of who she was before she went to Ault-that makes it very difficult to understand why she is so emotionally crippled during her time there. I ended up getting so bored with the entire book - your empathy for Lee quickly fades once you realize how lethargic and unmotivated she is. Don't waste your time on this one! </span>

                    <span>"Prep" is about a teenage Midwestern girl named Lee, who out of the blue decides to apply to boarding school. Surprised when she's actually accepted, she isn't sure if she wants to go, but feels she has to. What follows is four years of Lee feeling she doesn't really belong because of who she is and where she comes from.
<br />
<br />I found it easy to relate to Lee; I think most of us remember what it was like to be anxious and insecure during our teenage years. That being said, I didn't particularly like Lee. She is snobby and stereotypical; and just doesn't seem to get that "life is what you make it". She keeps expecting Ault to transform her life, but doesn't want to put any effort into it herself. I thought it was kind of sad: she isn't happy at Ault, but feels it will be too degrading to go back home. But despite not liking the protaganist, I really enjoyed this book. The book was well-written, and I thought the author did a great job of getting inside Lee's mind. An interesting take on the traditional fish-out-of-water theme. </span>
