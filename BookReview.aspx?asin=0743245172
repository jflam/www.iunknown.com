                    <span>Suze Orman offers a great distillation and outline on the inner and outer game of prosperity. Her financial coaching is an excellent start to gaining more mastery over your money. Most of her advice is more relevant to US residents but the basic lessons are applicable anywhere. Great reading, easy to apply lessons, and street smart advice from a self-made financial advisor. Other great reads are Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyoshi and Money Magic by Deborah L. Price.</span>

                    <span>Essentially all the laws of money in this book revolve around one central idea - be true to yourself and express the truth about yourself through the way you handle finances - in short - don't spend more than you can afford to spend; stay within your budget instead of blowing money you don't have and with the money that you do have, do as you please, or rather, use it in a way that is meaningful to you, and plan your financial future accordingly.

                    <span>This book is great for people who are inexperienced in handling finances.  Suze lays forth ideology that should be followed if you are interested in having a good retirement and being able to provide for your family in the future.  Many of the ideas presented in this book she states over and over again on her CNBC program The Suze Orman Show.<p>Some of the thinking put forth is plain common sense - such as realizing the damage that could result from building a high credit card debt.  Some parts cause you to think about the financial implications beyond the obvious - such as the additional costs of owning a home.<p>Suze's books are geared towards individuals unfamiliar with the world of finance; people who shy away from words like "investing" and "interest rates".  If you are starting off your life and intend to plan a financially prosperous future, definitely read this book.  It could save much hardship in the future by giving you something to follow when making a major purchase such as a home, car, or college.  It will help you plan your retirement.  I would not recommend this book if you are financially competent and want to take your investments to the next level, such as diving into the stock market.  <p>The additional pages in the back for writing notes and completing "exercises" did not intrigue me.  But overall, the book was well written and Suze was able to bring her own personal parables into the book, making it an interesting read.</span>

                    <span>Amid the slew of personal finance books on the market, Suze Orman's unique approach stands out. Although she has more than 20 years of financial experience and expertise, her books don't merely dispense advice from on high. Her monetary rules may be universal and timeless, but she describes them with the sympathetic voice of a best friend. Written in the aftermath of the collapse of the Internet bubble, her latest advice book aims to comfort shell-shocked investors who are facing huge losses. Orman's primary tactic is to remind readers that money is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and that decisions about money take place in a larger personal and spiritual context. To that end, a helpful workbook is included. We recommend this book to anyone who is wary of making financial decisions in today's unsettling market environment, as well as to those looking to sort out their financial priorities.</span>

                    <span>This is yet another great book by Suze Orman.<p>I admire the fact that in her books, as in this book, she shares her relationship with money, and what compelled her to become someone for you to count upon, for your journey to money mastery.<p>In this book, Mr. Orman brings the human angle, if you will, to money.<p>So, what are the laws of money?<p>1. Truth Creates Money - Lies Destroy Money:<br>This means opening your bills, while you allow whatever negative emotion to well up from within you, as you allow yourself to compassionately respond to that emotion.<p>2. Look at What You Have - Not at What You Had:<br>If you always focus upon what you had, you will recreate every painful experience from your past.  And you will repell money.<p>Write a gratitude journal.  And anytime that you say to yourself, "I don't have ...,"  follow this with, "And I do have this," several times, as you breath full relaxed breaths.  You will attract what you need and want.<p>3.  Do What Is Right For You - Before You Do What Is Right For Your Money:<br>Don't allow debt, money, or other material symbols to control you.  Create money to express your self-love.<p>4.  Invest In The Known - Before The Unknown:<br>What are are you clear about? Why?  Could you become curious, interested and therefore savvy on other potential investments?<p>Before you invest in the known, create a vision of yourself making and appreciating that investment.<p>5.  Money Has No Power of Its Own - Unless You Give It Power Over Your Life:<br>When you decide that money has power over you, you will repell it. Money is just notes, with deceased people on each note.  Money creates options, for you, and those who you believe in.</span>
