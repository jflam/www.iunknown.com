                <span id="Label1">During the last years of his violent life, Pablo Acosta smuggled a staggering 60 tons of cocaine a year into the United States-one third of the total U.S. consumption. Set only miles from the Texas border, Drug Lord is an extraordinary inside look at how drug trafficking really works in Mexico. Based on interviews with Acosta and other insiders, Poppa weaves a tale of the smuggler's rise from humble beginnings, his violent struggle to maintain control over his empire, the treachery and over-indulgence that fostered his downfall, and his grisly death at the hands of the judiciales, the Mexican federal police he had been paying off for years and who turned against him when he was no longer of use.</span>

                    <span>Drug Lord is a series of news releases tacked together in story form. With a few interesting side trips. Terrene Poppa comes across as a journalist on a quest, but the ending is preordained and the life--drugs-ect.-- (the focus of his book) repititious. Pablo Acosta (drug lord) comes from humble beginnings and rises to power with violence and violence. A lot of people get killed, then more people get killed, and everybody is smuggling or taking drugs and then Pablo gets killed. The Mexican government in corrupt, as are an assortment of Amercan agents, but the two groups play the game, bad guys and good guys. What the book lacks is the first person power when something is written by somebody who actually experienced the life. Poppa is telling this tale from the outside, and while that suffices it leaves the reader with a hazy vision of what really was happening. Amazon thinks my reviews are partial and unfair. They're probably right, I'm too much of a critic. If though you are interested in the subject (drugs, mexico, trailer park violence) you can read this book. It's not bad, just didn't go the distance. I think.</span>

                    <span>I felt like I was reading fiction, it is hard to belive this is real life for these people. Mexican drug lord, Pablo Acosta, is a fascinating character, ruthless and violent but still only a pawn in the drug wars. the real show is run by the highest levels of the Mexico's ruling party including possibly former President Carlos Salinas de Gortar. The book illustrates how difficult it will be for Mexico to get its social and economic house in order as long as the PRI is in power. <P>I also recomend: "A Touirist in the Yucatan" for a fictionalized account of the drug wars.</span>

                    <span>Great story that exposes the ugly corrupt symbiotic elationship between the mexican drug dealers and the corrupt police and army officials. It also carefullly documents the inevitable, reccurring results...Still, with all the access to Pablo Agosta you still feel you really don't know him -perhaps there really wasn't any 'there' there--it was all about power and getting high,and killing the opposition.. There are no heroes in this story, just a grim reality which leads you to the conclusion that the more things supposedly change, the more they remain the same---no solutions offered for that part of the mexican/ american economy living on fumes. . . Oddly enough,legalization (with appropriate controls/education/treament) might offer a long term solution-these stories will inevitably get worse, more violent, and corrupt the very institutions created to suppress the drug lords GOOD Story that should have been told long ago The end was foretold early in the book so there is little suspense at the end--not great writing, but great story</span>

                    <span>Druglord is the best biography that I have ever read. Poppa did a very good job describing the life of a Mexican drug dealer. This book was very sophisticated; it was hard for me to understand what he was trying to say. Poppa used very descriptive words and phrases such as Malice aforethought, and audacious. After reading this book, I realized that the audience is mainly adults. I never imagined drug trafficking being as big as it was or as big as Acosta was. When I read this book, I was surprised when the book revealed that Pablo moved over sixty tons of just cocaine alone every year that he was in business. Then it he said that he also dealt with Marijuana and Heroin. Another thing that just blew my mind was that he paid the Mexican Federal Police (The Judicials) for protection. Poppa was so well descriptive, I had pictures and scenes playing in my head about some of the drug deals and when the American Police were constantly chasing him when he was dealing here. Overall, this was a very good book. Nobody knows how often drug trafficking happened and how much money they used to make off of it. A month ago, there was a drug bust in Iowa and it sounded just like the way Pablo Acosta ran his faction. The man used planes just like Acosta, and was dealing the same amount that Acosta was but he was making more money because the price has gone up now. I would recommend this book to anyone that like challenging books.</span>
