                    <span>This is a wonderful book for the photographer who is delving into Photoshop CS for the first time.  However, there are many editing errors.  Some of the places where Mr. Evening refers to other sections in the book obviously refer to previous editions rather than to the current edition.  There are quite a few typos which were not picked up by the editing process as well.  The indexing is not up to par either.  For instance when you search for "montage" in the index it doesn't exist, yet there is an entire chapter on the topic.  Overall, I am very glad that I bought the book and find it extremely useful in getting up to speed in my digital darkroom use of PS CS.</span>

                    <span>This is a very comprehensive book.  It demonstrates sophisticated Photoshop CS
<br />techniques.  I would call myself an advanced beginner in Photoshop PC.  While I was able to implement the various techniques described in this book, I would have preferred clearer step by step instructions.  
<br />
<br />The author buries instructions within the text. Step by step instructions would make the book more user friendly and probably appeal to a broader audience.  The contents of the CD which comes with the book was helpful.  Some of the "before" and "after" photos used to illustrate the techniques in the book looked pretty similar to me, but they are more distinct looking on the CD. I found installing the CD on my PC a bit glitchy, but that was sorted out after a few tries.
<br />
<br />In my opinion, the perfect hybrid CS Photoshop book would cross the sophistication of Martin Evening with the step-by-step instructional style of Scott Kelby.

                    <span>I found it very disconcerting that the author gives details of how to use techniques with photos and doesn't include them all on the CD ROM that comes with the book.  One learns by doing, but not if the examples are omitted from the tutorial disk. The disk probably contains about 1/3 of the pictures detailed in the book. That's inexcusable since it would have been ever so easy to add more pictures to a CD ROM that can hold hundreds if not thousands of examples.</span>

                    <span>From setting up your system and configuring Photoshop to digital printing, this book covers a lot of ground, but with enough depth and clarity to be useful. I find myself coming back to it for tips, and useful Photoshop techniques. As with any book that covers this broad a topic, there will be some gaps, but generally it is well-written and a valuable resource. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a teacher of graphic design at an art college, a graphic designer and consultant, I know it is terrifically difficult to explain a program as vast and nonlinear as Photoshop. This book's color coding between the contents and tops of pages, the clear separation of topics, the progression of those topics, and the wealth of examples (both in the book and on the included CD) make this ideal for the motivated learner and for the classroom.
<br />
<br />One tip for the reader (or instructor) and perhaps the author: the chapters on capture and resolution perhaps should be tackled earlier, and the configuration chapter, though filled with vital information, feels more like it should be an appendix.
<br />
<br />This is the merest quibble, though, and from a control freak to boot. I recommend this book, as do students to whom I've suggested it. The feedback has been unanimously positive from them, even the most inexperienced (motivated) users. </span>
