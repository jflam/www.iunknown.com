                    <span>I was disappointed in this book. The photos appear so dated that I actually double-checked the copyright date and was surprised to see that it is a fairly recent release. What troubled me most was that it seemed incohesive, with no theme or direction. Saeks usually does an outstanding job with her design books, but I'm sorry I purchased this one.</span>

                    <span>California is such a huge state that anyone tackling a book like this is faced with a daunting task. Diane manages to provide an illuminating look at the variety of interiors that make up the "California style". The photos are rich and the commentary has a sense of humor that is lacking in most interior design books. All in all, an indispensable book for all designers and their clients!</span>

                    <span>In writing about design, it's not merely about being right, but rather being able to capture the essence of important details that convey a coherent message. Diane Dorrans Saeks has done just that in California Interiors.<P>This sophisticated book is the definitive source for California interior design and the spirit that inspires it. It is certainly comprehensive, but more significantly, it is compelling in its focus. Every detail makes you want to investigate closely with a magnifying glass, yet it is the overall statement that lingers. And as beautiful as this book is to look at, its real importance and value is found through the insight offered in its text. It not only offers a record of what has been done, it also serves as an inspiration to discover what has yet to be achieved. It is a great resource to have, an inspired gift to give and a wonderful one to receive. California Interiors will keep calling you back, and I can say that each visit will be filled with rewards.</span>

                    <span>Europeans love California almost as much as Californians love California. They value the intellectual and artistic contributions from California as free from continental conventions. Ms. Saeks has given us a beautiful and telling book that looks at California design through the European eye. The author captures the projected images and real substance embodied by California life.<P>European curiosity about California includes how we project pop culture, innovate technology and engage in utopian experiments. This book addresses, understands, explores, explains, shows and celebrates the spirit and intellect that inform this Promised Land of the American West. All the themes are here: Natural World, Ceremonial Space, Personal Innovation, California Modernism, Technology, and Craft. This book is the next best thing to visiting artful friends who live in personal houses located in storied landscapes.<P>California has always lionized outsiders, and "California Interiors" has the spirit of all the forces that make California one of the goofiest, most beautiful and highly creative places on the planet. Where else could you see the Eames Case Study House a page flip from sage John Dickinson, this-close-to this year's IT girl Kelly Lasser? The project photographs and printing are spectular Taschen quality.<P>Europeans in general and at Taschen in particular have design all figured out. They know what's good, has value, lasts, engages, indulges, uplifts and is new. They know what California design will be remembered for...as it emerges. There's beauty on every page of "California Interiors". Buy this book.</span>

                    <span>I've read all of Dianne Dorrans Saeks books and own many of them. I eagerly await each new addition so I was very dissapointed in California Interiors.It appears to be written and photographed for a European market. It's all stuff we've seen over and over again with no cohesive theme. The graphics aren't up to her usual standards, the book doesn't seem to have any design. It looks as though it's a first time effort.</span>
