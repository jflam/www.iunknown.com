                    <span>The book is easy to use and understand, good choice for beginners, but might be a bit wordy for advanced users.
<br />
<br />Its structure is very similar to a reference book, runs along the UNIX commands in 17 chapters, and provides enough information and examples to their usage. It contains three appendices summarizing the UNIX files and directories, the UNIX commands and their flags. It contains no theoretic essays at all, so if you are interested in the inner working or philosophy of UNIX, this book is not for you.
<br />
<br />I liked that it uses a color (red) to distinguish the commands and flags from the output. I was glad to find links to the related topics inside the book, but missed a bibliography. And I missed one or more full chapters paying attention to the most popular implementations such as Solaris, AIX.

                    <span>I found this book has some useful tricks that compensates for the chapters that maybe useless to someone who been using UNIX for sometime. This book made my life easier since I needed a book where I can get some of the useful Unix commands yet a little description with it to help me get by</span>

                    <span>Last semester, I found myself in a class that assumed the students were familiar with working in UNIX. However, I was not and was having a very difficult time. Out of desperation, I picked up this book. In no time, I was having a much better time figuring out what to do. UNIX Visual Quickstart Guide was easy to follow. The descriptions were to the point without a bunch of unnecessary words and detail.</span>

                    <span>Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Unix is a Peachpit Press "Visual QuickStart Guide" that relies heavily on pictures and examples to quickly instruct users in the basics of operating in Unix, from creating and editing files to writing simple scripts, sending and receiving email, accessing the internet, and much more. The collaborative effort of Unix computer experts Deborah S. Ray and Eric J. Ray, Unix is an extremely easy-to-follow reference highly recommended for non-specialist general readers seeking to learn about and acquire a familiarity with the Unix environment.</span>

                    <span>This book contains a lot of worthless material due to the fact that my job does not require knowing, such as the topics on the internet, e-mail, and installing UNIX software, but of course, for other users this stuff might be useful. The small bit of information that was useful has certainly made a large difference in my daily workings with UNIX, which more than compensates for the sections that were not useful. Such topics include the uses of the semicolon, piping, redirecting, and scripts. The book is easy to read, sells at a good price, and contains good reference appendixes.</span>
