                <span id="Label1">In this endearing story by Newberry Medal-winner Sharon Creech, a wise old Italian granny skillfully imparts life advice (and cooking lessons) to her winning but sometimes obstinate 12-year-old granddaughter.<p> Best known for <I>Walk Two Moons</I> and <I>The Wanderer</I>, Creech makes good use of another inventive format: Rosie's story unfolds first, over making and eating <I>zuppa</I>, and then Granny Torrelli tells parallel stories from her own childhood to help Rosie with her current predicament. Granny Torrelli's tales are laced with endearing, fun-to-say Italian: "I didn't like it, not one piccolino bit," as is her attempt to help Rosie mend her rift with her best friend Bailey ("That Bailey boy!"), for whom she's starting to feel more-than-friendship feelings.<p> The details of both Rosie's and Granny Torrelli's respective stories are often quite funny (from Braille jealousy to secret guide-dog training for the legally blind Bailey). But, as usual, what Creech does best is slyly proffer small, nourishing morsels of wisdom--not unlike the cavatelli, the "little dough canoes," that Rosie, Granny Torrelli, and that Bailey boy labor over in the book's sweet second half. Just be warned that you might find yourself starving by the end of the story.  (Ages 9 to 12)  <I>--Paul Hughes</I></span>

                    <span> I loved this book because of the grandma. The genre of this book is Coming Of Age. In the book Grandma Torrelli tells a lot of stories from her childhood and when she moved to the United States. When Granny was a child, she lived in Italy. While Rosie [the main character] tells Granny why she is mad, Granny tells her stories that she remembers- the stories from her childhood. For example, Granny tells Rosie one about her Buddy, her pal Pardo.
<br /> I would definately recommend this book to someone.Granny made this book a great book because of all of the stories that the Granny tells.A little girl moves in down the street from Rosie and makes Rosie relly mad. The little girl is named Janie. She really likes Baily. Rosie gets jealous of her because Baily is hanging around Janie more than her. 
<br /> Over all I liked this book a lot. I hope you like it as much as I do.

                    <span>The book I'm reviewing is called Granny Torrelli Makes Soup by Sharon Creech. I gave this book four stars because it is sad. This is a good book, but not my favorite. The book is about a girl and her grandma having good times and bad times with friends. The grandma came to America and left her friend, Pardo, behind.  Her friend's dog gets tied to the railroad track.  Pardo tries to get the dog untied but gets run over by the train.  I would recommend this book to some of my friends. Sharon Creech also wrote Pleasing the Ghost, Ruby Holler, Absolutely normal Chaos, Love That Dog, Walk Two Moons, Chasing Redbird, Bloomabilty, The Wanderer, fishing in the air, and a Fine, Fine School.

                    </div>
                    <span>The book Granny Torrelli Makes Soup was about a 12 year old named Rosie and her best friend Bailey.  Rosie and Bailey have a fight so Rosie goes to see her Granny Torrelli.  Granny Torrelli teaches Rosie how to make soup for zuppa (supper in Italian).  While they are cooking she teaches Rosie about friendship and how Bailey will always be her best friend. Rosie and Bailey become friends again with Rosie's grandmothers help.  Then another girl moves into the neighboorhood and starts causing problems for Bailey and Rosie's friendship because she thinks Bailey is cute! But Granny Torrelli fixes things in the end while teaching Rosie how to cook.
<br />    I think you should read this book because it can teach you about friendship.  You can learn things that people can't really tell you. You have to experience them.  They even have recipes for pasta and soup in the book.  Everyone should have a Granny Torrelli!</span>

                    <span>My name is cierra and I think Granny Torrelli makes soup was a great book. Just looking at the cover made it seem interesting thats why I voted to read the book. At first I thought the book was going to be all about soup, but it was about the problems between two twelve year olds who have been friends sence they were born. Reading the book was very easy for me because alot things in the book I could relate to. Like the time I wanted to be just like my friends. So you see this book isn't about soup its about problems people face everyday. I think any one who is willing should read this book.</span>
