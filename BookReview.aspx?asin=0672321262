                    <span>This book has NO ANSWERS...well, at least not for any questions of substance. The Sams 24 Hours series is a major disappointment...just TOO superficial of a treatment of the real functionality required to create something.
<br />
<br />I strongly suggest the Sams 21 Days series instead. A much better introduction and explanation of the necessary material</span>

                    <span>What's the difference between ASP and ASP.NET?  According to this book, it's just syntax.  There are lots of code samples here but the book has you entering most of it by hand.  What you, the developer, need to learn is how to cooperate with the .NET IDE to create ASP.NET applications - you won't learn enough of that here.<p>Furthermore, subjects like SSL, Trace Debugging, E-mail functionality and File Streaming come too early in the course while database access comes in too late.<p>There is some useful information on setting up the web environment, registering an SSL Certificate, working with XML and there's a whole chapter on File Streaming.  But overall, it's not a bargain - even from the bargain rack.<p>Note:  This is not the same book as that by the same title but authored by Scott Mitchell.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. It contained the basics of just about everything a beginner would want to know about .NET. Server controls, security, ADO.NET, web services, stored procedures, and more are all included, but be warned! Many of the typos will have you scratching your head, and the lack of information on configuration may leave you digging.<p>For example, when they teach you about web services, they have you build a consumer for your web method and they say it's as simple as clicking a link to the local server in a web reference dialog. The problem? The link they mention apparently didn't make it to the release version, and in order to dynamically detect web services on your server (which is required for the lesson), you need to add a verb to a handler in the web.config file!<p>In addition, almost every example has typos, most relating to a flagrant disregard for letter case.<p>My other gripes are that the examples were VB.NET only not C# (though anyone with a basic understanding of VB and C# can easily convert most examples). The book also lacks important detail, but what can you expect with an introductory text?<p>Despite the downsides, this book is everything I could hope for in an introductory ASP.NET text. It got ME up to speed quickly, and if you're willing to look up details and server configurations on the web or VS.NET documentation, then this book will suit you just fine.</span>

                    <span>This book has a few typos but if you can overlook those it is full of excellent examples for a beginner learning how to use ASP.Net.<p>I liked it because the examples are complete, while there are at times better ways to do many of the processes that are featured the examples are written in a manner that assures you grasp the concept behind the process.  For example on Web Form Server controls it shows the progression of converting an HTML form to a server controlled form handling the button click in the code behind then it goes on to show you how you would dynamically create that form with tr, td objects in the code behind.  <p>The book covers a lot of beginner information...server controls, validation, security, reading and writing text & binary files, email, debugging... pretty much all of the stuff you would use in a real world implementation of a conversion to ASP.Net.  It even covers installation of a security certificate (which is not ASP.Net specific but very handy for beginners nonetheless).<p>I think it is a very comprehensive beginners book and should be considered for anyone just starting out in ASP.Net.  The book also gives some good information on getting your Visual Studio.Net set up and all of the examples are stepped through with the assumption that you are using VSNet for development.<p>My favorite book is the ASP.NET Unleashed so I suggest you consider them both as you will work your way through this book quickly...</span>

                    <span>I am totally disappointed in this book.  I was very anxious to learn ASP.NET and I wanted to find an inexpensive book to help me get started, but the only thing this book did was frustrate me with horrible examples.  Almost every single example in the book contained an error.  Very disappointing.</span>
