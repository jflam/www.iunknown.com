                <span id="Label1">The difference between <i>The First Five Pages</i> and most books on writing is that the others are written by teachers and writers. This one comes from a literary agent--one whose clients include Pulitzer Prize nominees, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors, Pushcart Prize recipients, and American Book Award winners. Noah Lukeman is not trying to impart the finer points of writing well. He wants to teach you "how to identify and avoid bad writing," so that your manuscript doesn't come boomeranging back to you in that self-addressed, stamped envelope. Surprise: Agents and editors don't read manuscripts for fun; they are looking for reasons to reject them. Lukeman has arranged his book "in the order of what I look for when trying to dismiss a manuscript," starting with presentation and concluding with pacing and progression. Each chapter addresses a pitfall of poor writing--overabundance of adjectives and adverbs, tedious or unrealistic dialogue, and lack of subtlety to name just a few--by identifying the problem, presenting solutions, giving examples (one wishes these weren't quite so obvious), and offering writing exercises. It's a little bizarre to think about approaching your work as would an agent, but if you are serious about getting published, you may as well get used to it. Plus, Lukeman has plenty of solid advice worth listening to. Particularly fine are his exercises for removing and spicing up modifiers and his remedies for all kinds of faulty dialogue. <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>I thought that this book would be a sophisticated look at how to grab an editor. Instead the first chapter deals with eliminating unnecessary adjectives and adverbs---this is writing 101. It takes a great deal more than than basics like this to get published. A total waste of money.</span>

Start out on the right foot and get this book.  It will save you lots of time and trouble.  Whenever I recommend books on writing, this is the one I recommend.  And if I were a teacher of writing, this would be required reading.  </span>

                    <span>In advertising parlance the 10-Second Rule is immutable:  You must grab the reader's attention up front, very quickly. In the First Five Pages Lukeman properly extends this mode, time-wise, to a novel-length product.  #####  But, sadly, how often have you seen this modus operadi overdone, carried to ridiculous extremes?  Far too often I have cracked open a novel where, right away, I am asked to believe a half-dozen impossible things before breakfast.  I am expected to follow the flight path of a transexual Albino who is running in a zig-zag pattern to dodge both a load of crushed rock being dropped on him from a crane at a construction site while somebody is similtaneously shooting at him with an AK-47 from a low-flying helicopter.  I say let a few pages lapse before his flight takes him, safely, to a low-rent neighborhood where a deranged, heavily-tatooed dwarf comes running at him wielding a crow bar aimed at his legs.  #####  When in doubt, I feel, it's always best to follow Commandment VI of the Plot Development Ten Commandments:  Thou Shalt Not Distort. #####  Lukeman's chain of thinking seems to hit the proper balance:  Excite early, but pace, with taste.  Along with all the other pearls of wisdom on how to get an editor to do a double-take of your work, I  found this book priceless.              </span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book for any writer who aspires to be published. Mr. Lukeman offers practical advice that will make a manuscript more saleable, but more than that, readable. He provides inside information on what agents/publishers look for when they initially look at a manuscript, and whether it will be tossed/rejected after the first five pages or if it will survive the cut. Mr. Lukeman has solutions and examples as well as exercises for improving manuscripts. A writer can't go wrong with Mr. Lukeman's advice.</span>

                    <span>I was very pleased with this book. It takes a no-nonsense approach to the writing concepts and skills most likely to prevent an editor from reading a manuscript. Topics are presented in order of importance (as determined by the author) and I think he's pretty much on target. The only complaint I have is that his examples of  bad writing are so obviously bad that they're really not realistic examples at all. But if a writer objectively reviews his/her manuscript after reading and absorbing this book, he/she should be able to find all the problems Mr. Lukeman covers. Fixing them, however, is another story.</span>
