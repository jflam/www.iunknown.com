                    <span>I really recommend any book written by this great man. This book truly gets to the essence of what praying is all about. I was touched by these prayers, reading them was like a peaceful meditation. 
<br />
<br />Thank You Miguel...Paul</span>

                    <span>"Prayers" is even a better book than the Four Agreements, though the Four Agreements build you a foundation.  It is meant to be a book we will read when at the quest of love and peace.  The book is meant to be read when you are angry, sad, experiencing fear and judgment.  Of course you still need to find other ways to work on your anger, this book simply have the power to help you let go of those nasty thoughts.  This book is not meant to be used to suppress/deny the existence of anger and fear, for, we need to accept human has all ranges of emotions.  There is no right and wrong for whatever and however we feel things.  At the end of the day, we are just saying prayers to let go of the emotional poisons.  That is the essence of this book.  The words of the book can only be experienced and felt.  You cannot use your judgmental mind to think and to understand nor can you try to rush finishing the book.  Some books, for example this one, just are not meant for speed reading because you cannot experience the peace the author wants to give you.  When you open your heart and feel the power of the words, you experience lots of love and compassion to yourself and others.  That is how you want to use this book to open your spiritual eyes and stay there.  This book is easy to understand.  It is meant to be read again and again, especially during turbulent times where we are most easily to slip back to the judgmental self.  I definitely recommend this book to someone who is experiencing some sort of a significant loss in life (whether it is a loved one's death, a lost of job or a loss of marriage).  May we all come out from the turbulent times and experience love and care, which help us return to our authentic self - with love and care and without judgment about self and others?</span>

                    <span>I went to a spiritual retreat and found this book.  I was so deeply touched, I bought and sent copies to my friend in New York.  She said, "This book is next to the Bible." She cried and
<br />told me that since her divorce (two yrs. ago) that when she went to bed that night after reading two chapters, she didn't feel lonely; that she felt love and peace in her heart. 
<br />I read the Circle of Fire prayer and try to live it everyday.
<br />You can't go wrong with this book!  </span>

                    <span>This is another incredible book by Don Miguel Ruiz.  It is a very small book, but it's contents are enormous.  It is a book of prayers. Prayers for  forgivness, self-acceptance, etc.  It is a truely fantastic book.  Simple and powerful.  I am so greatful for having found Don Miguel Ruiz's books and I thank him for sharing his gifts with a world that so desparately needs them.</span>

                    <span>I enjoy this book very much, as I do all of don Miguel Ruiz's books. Each one is a treasure to be read and re-read. <br>I take Prayers with me when I travel. <br>Miguel's prayers, like his teachings, are profound yet elegantly simple and to the point. And that's exactly what suits me best.</span>
