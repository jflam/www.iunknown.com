                <span id="Label1">Among the myriad of constants that appear in mathematics, p, e, and <i>i</i> are the most familiar.  Following closely behind is g, or gamma, a constant that arises in many mathematical areas yet maintains a profound sense of mystery.<P>In a tantalizing blend of history and mathematics, Julian Havil takes the reader on a journey through logarithms and the harmonic series, the two defining elements of gamma, toward the first account of gamma's place in mathematics.<P>Introduced by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), who figures prominently in this book, gamma is defined as the limit of the sum of 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + . . . up to 1/n, minus the natural logarithm of n--the numerical value being 0.5772156. . .. But unlike its more celebrated colleagues p and e, the exact nature of gamma remains a mystery--we don't even know if gamma can be expressed as a fraction.<P>Among the numerous topics that arise during this historical odyssey into fundamental mathematical ideas are the Prime Number Theorem and the most important open problem in mathematics today--the Riemann Hypothesis (though no proof of either is offered!).<P>Sure to be popular with not only students and instructors but all math aficionados, Gamma takes us through countries, centuries, lives, and works, unfolding along the way the stories of some remarkable mathematics from some remarkable mathematicians.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the previous reviewers, Havil has used Gamma as a means to introduce a wealth of fascinating mathematics. His chosen historical approach succeeds in adding interest whilst at the same time tempering some quite difficult subject matter. The cleverest thing for me is his ability to introduce a wide variety of material in such a natural way; it all flows very smoothly and he explains the ideas with crystaline clarity. There needed to be a book on Gamma and this, for me, is exactly the right book to write on the topic; it fits well into the PUP stable having e and i already in it. Its good to learn about new mathematics and to learn about it in context; now I am starting to read more about Continued Fractions, about which I knew very little. The Riemann Hypothesis is much in vogue at the present, with two new books about it but written for the lay reader; Havil approaches it as a mathematician and takes the bull by the horns with great success. He needed Analytic Continuation and sensibly did not side-step that need. This is a book which will last-and be on the shelves of many a mathematics student. Good for him and I too look forward to his next book.</span>

                    <span>There is more mathematics in this book, more interestingly explained than any other of its type that I have read. What is its type? Well, I guess it comes under the category of 'Popular math' or in the jargon 'trade books' but don't be fooled by that; to get something out of it you need some math knowledge-and more than that, some math ability. There are symbols everywhere. The constant Gamma just had to be the next single number to appear as the subject of a book and with the books on e and i under their belt I guess that Princeton would be the obvious publisher. Havil, a first-time author, could easily have made the grave mistake of writing a gritty book on analysis with gamma as its focus but he didn't do that. He decided on a historical approach and to divide his attention between the harmonic series, logarithms and gamma itself. As a result the book really is a mathematical odyssey (publisher's blurb)which embraces a huge number of ideas, each of which has a natural place in the development. For the first time I really understand Napier's approach to logarithms and how it relates to what we now define them to be. For the first time I understand that wakky Benford's Law. For the first time I understand the Riemann Hypothesis. There is stacks more stuff too. The Continued Fraction chapter has really got me into that cool idea, which I had only vaguely heard about. Euler was for me the man who solved the 7 bridges of Konigsberg problem-I had no idea just how fantastic he was.<P>They tell us that Havil is a math teacher at Freeman Dyson's old high school. What a school that must be-I wish I had gone there and I would like to have been taught by a teacher who is so clearly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his subject! Dyson wouldn't put his name to the book just becaause he is an alumni. He rates it and its real easy to see why. <P>Every so often you come across a winner...for me this is the first this year.</span>

                    <span>I debated for a while whether this book deserved four stars or five. There's a lot of very interesting material here: if there's one thing this book does--perhaps better than any book I've read in quite some time--is show just how interrelated far-flung mathematical concepts can be (how are the prime numbers related to pi, for example?).<P>My one complaint about the book--and the reason for giving it four stars instead of five--is that there are times when the formulae and notation get so dense that it's extremely difficult to follow the author's train of thought: I can think of a number of places where diagrams would have helped immensely. Likewise, since there's no list of symbols or formulae, it's not a book that you can simply browse through, in the sense that you can browse through, say, "A Brief History of Time."<P>Finally, let me reiterate that this book assumes that you already know a fair amount of math: if you don't know what a capital pi means, for example, you're probably going to have a hard time understanding this book. But if you *do* know what that symbol means, though, then by all means, give this book a try.</span>

                    <span>After reading Paul Nahin's lovely book on i, "An Imaginary Tale" (also published by Princeton University Press), I could not believe it when the same publisher produced a book on gamma. Gamma seems to always have been one of the neglected constants in mathematics (by the general public). e, pi, and i seem to capture the imagination more, my guess is because the mathematics required to understand them are more elementary (I use the word "elementary" completely tongue in cheek), and you can quickly see the dazzling results they are associated with.<P>Gamma is different. While you can understand the theory presented in Julian Havil's book if you stayed awake during second semester calculus, you definitely have to work at it. The requisite analytic number theory presented may turn away the average reader if they are not prepared to make the commitment to stay on the roller coaster for the full ride. <P>You will be rewarded if you can break through the initial 2 or 3 chapters introducing us to the logarithm and the harmonic series. To be fair, as a previous reviewer has noted, the material on Napier and the logarithm has been done in a more satisfactory manner by Eli Maor in his book on e. But this is only a minor drawback. As long as you are comfortable with the natural logarithm, you can omit Chapter 1 with no loss.<P>Chapter 4 starts off with the zeta function, arguably the most enticing and mysterious function in all of mathematics, despite approximately 150 years of analysis by the world's best mathematicians. This one function alone could arguably be said to be the genesis of analytic number theory (even though Dirichlet's work on primes in arithmetic progressions has typically been given credit for that role). All the familiar material is presented, including Euler's product formula, the "trivial" divisors of the zeta function, the infinitude of primes, Euler's evaluation of the zeta function for positive even integer powers, etc. <P>Of course, the gamma function makes its obligatory appearance. After having read Nahin's book on i, I was initiated into the math connecting the gamma and zeta functions. But Nahin of course could not use Euler-Maclaurin summation or the familiar inequality arguments as this would have taken him too far afield. After having read the traditional fare, such as Hardy-Wright, Apostol, Hua, et al., it was nice to see a more conversational approach to the material. I literally felt like I was sitting in Havil's office while he dissected the material for me, on a level I could comprehend.<P>My last comments on this book are the extras. As expected, Riemann's hypothesis and complex analysis make extended appearances. I appreciated the fact the Havil resisted the temptation to take the Riemann Hypothesis beyond the traditional mathematical lore and float off into the ethereal. This happened with John Derbyshire's otherwise excellent book "Prime Obsession", which devoted a little too much time to the psychoanalysis of Riemann, who after all, only scratched the surface of this problem. Derbyshire's book is highly recommended though for more material on the Prime Number Theorem, and some of its uses to formulate modern permutations of the Riemann Hypothesis.<P>He presents the usual anecdotes on Riemann and Hardy (who had a major love affair with the Riemann Hypothesis), but these are sidelines only, as they should be. Also, the material on residue integration and analytic continuation in the appendices is enormously helpful to understand the post Riemann attacks on the problem. In addition, well, it's just pretty mathematics.<P>The introduction by Freeman Dyson is quite impressive. How many books of popular mathematics get endorsements like that from world-class physicists? The praise is well deserved. This book belongs on every math enthusiast's bookshelf!</span>

                    <span>I agree wholeheartedly with all the positive comments and enthusiasm that other reviewers have shown. This is a remarkable book, and there should be more like it. I am astounded at how much and what range of mathematics there is in a book of this length and level of accessbility. Which raises a very good point: This would be a superb book for "Calc III". It's unfortunate that many students end their study of mathematics slugging through integration by parts, partial fractions, sequences and series, the logarithm as integral, etc., the traditional hodge-podge of topics called Calculus II. And the ones who progress end up going straight into multivariable calculus with its div, grad, curl, and all that. There is never really any reward for all the work in hacking through Calc II. This book, however, would tie so much of it together, it would all suddenly seem so mysteriously connected and beautiful, and the reader (I hope) would want to go on to Complex Analysis. Thank you, Prof. Havil! I hope you find the proof to the Riemann Hypothesis.</span>
