                <span id="Label1">Fifty years ago, in <i>1984,</i> George Orwell imagined a future in  which privacy was demolished by a totalitarian state that used spies,  video surveillance, historical revisionism, and control over the media  to maintain its power. Those who worry about personal privacy and  identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon  these rights--still use Orwell's "Big Brother" language to discuss  privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big  Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to  destroy the rights we've assumed were ours.   <i>Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century</i> shows  how, in these early years of the 21st century, advances in technology  endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and  retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our  movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want  to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private  communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our  histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer  profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy--the most  basic of our civil rights--is in grave peril.   Simson Garfinkel--journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority  on computer security--has devoted his career to testing new technologies  and warning about their implications. This newly revised update of the  popular hardcover edition of <i>Database Nation </i> is his compelling  account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming  years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking  look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a  disturbing question: how can we protect our basic rights to privacy,  identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control  easier than ever before?   Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism  is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince  us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity  before it's too late.</span>

                    <span>Simson Garfinkel has written Database Nation to present a comprehensive assessment of the direction technological advances are taking that have already threatened the privacy of American citizens. Threats to our privacy hit home - they threaten our liberties to voice opposing views, to mount peaceful protests, to buy and sell, to move about freely without big brother watching us, and to live our lives as we please without undue snooping by others.<P> The book serves as an indictment of the Federal Government, law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, private companies, and others who have gained too much control over the lives of people. Garfinkel provides a historical perspective of technological developments and demonstrates how easily we have gone down the road of information gathering. Readers will learn that their privacy is lost when information about them is being collected and sometimes sold, stolen, and put to use by others for a variety of purposes.<P> The contents of this book is chilling. Are threats of crime and terrorism justification for power grabs and the surrendering of our civil liberties? Garfinkel provides case studies to demonstrate the impact technology has had upon our personal freedoms. He provides revelations about various uses and abuses of barcoding, fingerprinting, audio and video surveillance systems, Webcamming, wiretapping, credit reporting, medical record management, confidentiality, and more.<P> Readers will learn how the lives of average American citizens can be turned upside down when errors creep into IRS tax records and credit bureau reports. People are human and humans make errors unintentionally, they steal information, and they deliberately tamper with information for a variety of criminal reasons. Readers would be shocked to learn that they themselves may have been the victims of undue scrutiny!<P> This book should serve as a wake-up call for American citizens to become more knowledgeable about widespread information gathering efforts and the potential for harm that could result from its illegal and unethical use. This is must reading for any person who is concerned about the direction America is taking - and for those persons who don't care but should be more concerned about where we are heading!</span>

                    <span>Privacy has become an apple pie issue. These days everyone is for it, and most people assume that there is a "right to privacy" articulated somewhere in the US Constitution, but there is actually little consensus in our society about what "privacy" really means, let alone "right to privacy." Alas, Garfinkel never quite puts forward a satisfying definition of privacy in Database Nation. He predicts (correctly) that the "right to privacy" will be one of the most important civil rights in the 21st Century, and (incorrectly) that "the federal government may be our best hope for privacy protection as we move into the new millennium." When examined more closely, most of the invasions of privacy he cites are actually violations of due process, negligence, inaccurate data, abuses of the nanny state, or outright fraud. <P>The book suffers from so many errors that space does not allow me to identify them all.<P>Garfinkel misstates the federal law regarding social security numbers and driver licenses. He also seems unclear on the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). According to Garfinkel, the FCRA "forbids the release of the information for noncredit or insurance purposes, such as direct marketing or 'people-finding' services." The truth is more complicated, but you wont find it in Database Nation.<P>Garfinkel's discussion of identity fraud is misinformed, and he passes along uncritically too much received wisdom about the issue. He seems to think that consumer credit reports contain the mother's maiden name of the consumer and that "lookup services make this information available, at minimal cost, over the Internet." Wrong on both counts. Forgive me, but at this point in the book I started wondering whether Garfinkel had ever even seen a credit report. As a licensed private investigator and professional debt collector, I deal with credit reports, look-up services, data protection laws and privacy issues every day, and am able to compare Garfinkel's claims with my own first-hand knowledge. Garfinkel has too much of a graduate-seminar approach to these issues. He needs to get out more.<P>I admit I have philosophical differences with Garfinkel's framework of reference. The greatest threats to privacy come from government, not business, as government has unique powers to coerce information from its citizens which no private entity has. Garfinkel sees government regulation of the private sector as the solution to privacy concerns. I see it as the problem.</span>

                    <span>This book dashed the high hopes I had for it. There are many very good reasons to be concerned about the ways technology can be used to curtail our civil liberties and constrict our freedoms. I had hoped for a serious discussion laying out the problems, their current state of application and misuse, and some thoughts about how to push back.<P>We do get some of that and to the extent this book is in this scope I like it a great deal (for example, the discussions around eternal copyrights and huge commercial databases gathering everything known about each of us or the sale of drivers license photos to commercial interests). When it is in the middle area of discussing thought crime and brain wiretapping he begins to lose me. It isn't that the issues aren't worthy of discussion, it is simply they way he discusses them has too much of a paranoid science fiction future feel. <P>When he paints the future of conscious machines and whether they will demand civil rights or not, well, I think he spoils this book. That speculative stuff should be in a different book. For me, the inclusion of this material makes it impossible to take seriously the good stuff he does have. The weird apple spoils the barrel kind of thing.<P>It isn't that the book isn't worth reading. It's that the serious stuff is so important that we need to focus on that and not be distracted by paranoid delusions about things that don't even exist. There is plenty to be concerned about in the databases already collected and being sold in commercial markets.</span>

                    <span>Simson Garfinkel's Database Nation is a frightening account of how our privacy is being infringed upon by government, industry and certain individuals. It illustrates how ordinary citizens' private information is obtained by individuals or organizations that want to exploit the data to their advantage. The information can be obtained from driver's licenses, credit card purchases, and medical records, just to name a few. The book is insightful and fast-reading. It will prompt you to take control of your life and wonder, "Who is watching me now?"<P>Garfinkel's intent is not to scare his readers, but to inform unsuspecting citizens that an increasing percentage of our daily activities are being captured by databases across the world. Our personal privacy is threatened with the use of fingerprinting and human marking to document and identify individuals. Whereas this means of identification was created to prevent identity theft, solve crimes, and eliminate computer error, some states are now able to sell this information to private businesses because they are part of the public record. Garfinkel's research on this topic is extensive.<P>Not unlike George Orwell's book 1984, we are also under constant surveillance. The stores we shop at, offices we work in, roads we drive on, and establishments we frequent are capturing our video images and placing them in databanks across the nation. Even surveillance satellites are able to capture minute details of a person. Our personal information is a commodity--it's what marketers use to solicit people.<P>Chapter 11: Privacy Now! provides us with examples and ways in which we can fight back as a nation to protect our right to privacy. However, it does not provide individuals with strategies for protection. Humans have come to rely on computers and data processing at the expense of the individual. The problem is that the smallest clerical error can destroy a person's life. <P>Garfinkel compares his book to Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, which planted the seeds for the environmental movement. Likewise, Database Nation sets the stage for the legislation and regulation of privacy in the twenty-first century.<P>Everyone should read this book!</span>

                    <span>This book has more to do with American politics than negative implication of advanced technology like it is trying to shoot for. <P>Database is merely a tool, and tools can bring hazardous results when held in wrong hands. SSN is another tool to get a grip on personal information for the government and large businesses, and the author is right in pointing out the abuse of SSN. However, one needs to note that use of such numbering system is considered unconstitutional in many countries, because they rob the rights to remain anonymous away from people.<P>Traditionally, the interest of the nation and large businesses took precedence over the rights and freedom of commoners in the United States, and installment and abuse of SSN is just one of the tools they use in order to tap into what they should not. <P>This book blames the tools and development thereof for such negative consequences, without ever blaming those who hold the tool. It's like blaming chain saw itself for the lost forest, without ever considering who used the chain saw. <P>The book never talks about the global trend of the issue. If it did, it would have been clear that most of the worries expressed in the book does not apply in many countries where the government and businesses aren't as nosy as ours. Freedom, individual rights and technology can co-exist, and there are lots of good examples to learn from on our planet, but the author refuses to do so. Most of the worries expressed in this book have to do with the ways of U.S. policymakers than the technology itself. <P>As for the chapter on terrorism - The author might be a knowledgeable person within the boundary of the United States, but he severely lacks international common sense. It fails to address the cause of terrorism, noting, "The terrorist of tomorrow is the irrational terrorist. (pp.211)" - A typical uninformed American take on terrorism. The author needs to learn a few languages, travel every continent and see how the world works for himself before publishing a book on it. The ignorance alone doesn't bother me, but I'm not happy with the fact that it is published in a book that is supposedly informative, ending up with spreading unnecessary fear without presenting any valid solution. Besides, this chapter on terrorism strays from the purpose of this book (technology and privacy). This is another indication that this book is compiled without sense of direction. <P>All positive reviews quoted on the back cover are of domestic sources: I suppose they couldn't get anyone overseas to recognize the value of the book on this supposedly global issue. I think this book should be discontinued, but in case that's impossible, they could at least change the title to "Nightmare in the 21st century America" from "The Death of privacy in the 21st century" and re-compile the book under some sense of direction, instead of simply listing whatever people would be afraid of. <BR> <BR>To sum up, this book scores well among those who are uninformed: it is highly engaging because it tickles the fear factor of readers and grabs attention, in a way fictions do. However, the raison d'etre of this book is quite questionable. Like cheap horror movies, it flows without sense of direction, moving from one scare to another. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this book to anyone as an informative source.</span>
