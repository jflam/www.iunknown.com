                    <span>North of Slavery marked the first comprehensive scholarly effort to explore the meaning of race in the northern states before the Civil War.  It many ways, it remains -- almost forty years after its publication -- the  single best starting point for examining the lives of Northern free blacks.   It focuses on a region traditionally neglected by other studies of race  relations, a problem being rectified in the scholarship only now.   Challenging the myth of the North as a bastion of racial liberalism,  Litwack portrays a North beset by segregation, racial pogrom, legal  stricture, and -- above all -- a system of informal proscription which  rendered black people there anything but "free."  Written during  the early stages of the Civil Rights Movement, the book had a chilling and  prophetic understanding of the struggles which would confront the CRM as it  moved out of the South and into the nation.  North of Slavery was, and  still is, a stunning antidote to the attitudes of those who tell themselves  "it doesn't happen here."  As is his style, Litwack peppers his  history liberally with compelling first-hand accounts; the writing is  exceptional:  clean, hard-hitting, dark, compelling, and courageous.</span>

                    <span>Nothing very special about this book.  It was more of an encyclopedia rather than a history book.  Leon F. Litwack failed to state his opinions which most history books contain. There isn't nothing else to write about since it was just like an encyclopedia but with more words.  There is interesting facts here though.  If readers are interested in the life of slavery before the civil war, this is the right book for you.</span>
