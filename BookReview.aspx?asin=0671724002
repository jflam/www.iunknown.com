                    <span>Although Dales books are quite old the concepts he introduces remain tried and true. I have read another of dales books  "How to win friends and influence people" And they are both fantastic. This book in particuliar i see as being of great value to anyone who has ever struggled with public speaking.

                    <span>This book by Dale Carnegie is one of the classic books written on public speaking.  Anyone interested in public speaking should include this book in their library.  My book, "10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking" (Warner Books) would not have been written without the inspiration I received from Dale Carnegie's book years ago.</span>

                    <span>Dale Carnegie, the author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" again provides the keys to success in an area that challenges many of us.  This well-written book discusses not only speaking effectively in front of large audiences, but also in front of smaller groups, such as at work.  Effective speaking is important in any field of endeavor, and this book will help to achieve this capability.</span>

                    <span>I never took up any efective speaking book before. This would be my first. It has been very helpful and comes with examples that really boost your confidence. They let you see the bad, let you feel the good. Then you'll know what to follow and what not to. Recommended for shy speakers. -)</span>
