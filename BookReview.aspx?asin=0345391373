                <span id="Label1">You'll find everything you forgot from school--as well as  plenty you never even learned--in this all-purpose reference book, an  instant classic when it first appeared in 1987. The updated version  takes a whirlwind tour through 12 different disciplines, from American  studies to philosophy to world history. Along the way, Judy Jones and  William Wilson provide a plethora of useful information, from the plot  of <I>Othello</I> to the  difference between fission and fusion. It's not a shortcut to cultural  literacy, the authors write in their introduction, but it's an  excellent "way in" to the building blocks of Western  civilization: the "books, music, art, philosophy, and discoveries  that have, for one reason or another, managed to endure." Think of  it as finishing school for your brain; study up and you'll gain a  lifetime's worth of cocktail conversation--as well as a new list of  books you simply <I>must</I> read.</span>

                    <span>While this book gives the reader a few kilometers' head start on the road of knowledge for several liberal arts fields (Art History, Film, Psychology, etc.) its wink-wink, "isn't it funny" outlook on the book's subject matter that is not, well, American, eventually becomes tiresome. For instance, did the Canada entry in the Political Science section really need an "eh" joke? I thus sulkingly axe one star from my rating.<P>Dispite this gripe, I feel this is a book I'll turn to again and again for factoids and nuggets of knowledge that us science types with hyperspecialized college/university degrees didn't get the chance to learn at school. <P>After all, this book made me discover the painter El Greco. I afterwards even bought a reproduction of his A View of Toledo. How's that for unintentional advertisement?</span>

                    <span>I first ran across this book on a friend's coffee table. After thumbing through it, I knew I had to have a copy of my own. It is witty, humorous and surprisingly accurate. The authors intentionally don't take the subject matter seriously in deference to those legions of name droppers and intellectuals who do. <P>Each chapter covers a specific subject area ("Art history", "Film", "Music", etc.) which is further broken down into essential "need-to-know" sections like "A Trio of Geographical Clarifications for a Nation that, Frankly Would Rather Skateboard" or "A Night at the Opera: manners and morals for the MTV Generation." The writing itself is similarly tongue-in-cheek. In a section titled "How to Tell Keats from Shelly" the authors write, "Keats is the one you'd play racquetball with. He wasn't happy, exactly, but he was better adjusted and less the outcast then Shelly and it shows."<P>I certainly got a kick out of reading it. If you are searching for a good laugh that is also enlightening, (and will fill the holes in your college education), this is the book for you. But PLEASE don't take this book too seriously.</span>

                    <span>I first flipped through this book my sophmore year of college, and I immediately fell in love with the immense breadth of it's scope. The best sections by far are "Philosophy" and "World History" sections, since most people forget their history 10 minutes after the last bell rings in high school and get little exposure to philosophy at all beyond the name Freud. Reminded me why I went to college in the first place with discussions of Art, Religion, Film, and even Economics! Many people may be put off by what they percieve as a flippant tone, but to many of us in college, this was how we really talked about and discussed the subjects we studied, "Holding Forth" dialogue, is what I call it. The absolute best way to introduce this sort of material to the layman, since it's often discussed by such drydrydrydry and boring lecturers who have no sense of presentation or keeping their audiences awake. This book isn't meant to be a textbook, so LAY THE FRELL OFF THE AUTHORS FOR NOT WRITING IT LIKE ONE!! If my organic chemistry texts had been written with half as much intelligence and wit, I'd probably be working for the Centers for Disease Control by now.</span>

                    <span>The authors are way too condescending. The Title is totally misleading. They basically just try to be witty and tell you what they think is good and bad without offering any substance. I've never given a book 1 star before, but if I could give it less, I would. You won't learn anything, except the authors opinions on things. They critcize almost every work of art, invention or idea ever created.</span>
