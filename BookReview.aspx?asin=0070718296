                    <span>While I am only about 85% of the way through this book let me say that I have found some very informative material. I have also found some VERY VERY wrong information. As a financial advisor turned contractor I am currently in the "Planning for your future" chapter and have found some terrible advice. It leads me to believe that although he was a succesful builder and did well that he doesn't know when to shut-up about things he really has no idea about.<BR> I have enjoyed the book so far but it really is outdated and needs to be revised or pulled off the shelf so that inexperienced builders do not use his "past there prime" ideas in todays market.<BR> If you are in the market for industry books then you can do better. There are books out there that are much more current than this one. Buy a specialty book and stay away from the guys that think they know it all.</span>

                    <span>If you are new to the building business - this is definitely NOT the book to buy or read. I found the book to be very general speaking on all 26 topics being discussed. E.g. topics on computers - why to use them or not - are completely outdated.<P>This book lacks a lot of detail. It scans over most items and I really find it difficult to highlight facts that I would re-read later. This book will NOT make me a successful Builder - just a frustrated reader.</span>

                    <span>Good book. A solid value. This is a very versatile book, as it applies to all types of construction business. Its really about solid business practices(not strictly pertaining to building, although theres plenty about that in here). This book is very business oriented and covers quite a bit in the legal aspect as well. Good book with good templates. Finally i got some decent info on lein waivers. To those who arent computer savvy, chapter 17 is for you.</span>

                    <span>As someone who hopes to become a home builder I found this book very helpful. The author answers many questions about the buisness side of the home building industry. It is a step by step guide, my only objection is that it did not go over the actual home building process (But I believe that was not his intended message, so I can not fault him for that.) I would read more books by this author.</span>
