                <span id="Label1">Despite its sensational title, David Bach's <I>The Automatic Millionaire: A Powerful One-Step Plan to Live and Finish Rich</I> is not a get-rich-quick guide. Rather, the book is a straightforward march through common-sense personal financial planning that suggests readers "automate" their contributions to retirement and investment vehicles. Bach, in fact, calls his model the "tortoise approach" to becoming wealthy by retirement age. <p>  In the early part of the book Bach builds on ideas he established in <I>Smart Women Finish Rich</I> and other bestselling titles. His core principle is that, to succeed, you must "Pay Yourself First." In other words, he suggests using pre-tax retirement accounts (i.e. 401(k)s, IRAs, or Roth IRAs) to set aside a fixed, monthly sum of money before considering what is left for living expenses. The "automatic" part of the title comes from Bach's emphasis on using automated payroll deductions to avoid the temptation of using the money to pay today's bills. <p>  Bach insists that "regardless of the size of your paycheck, you probably already make enough money to become rich." But his claims that his plan requires "no budget, no discipline," is a bit disingenuous. His discussion of the "The Latte Factor" shows that, to find money to start a retirement plan, a person with a modest income needs to make an up-front commitment to stop accruing debt and to reduce spending on such "wasteful" items as lattes and cigarettes. <p>  In the end <I>The Automatic Millionaire</I> does not offer much that is new for readers already familiar with personal finance basics like accelerated mortgage payments, "the miracle of compound interest," and the setting up of emergency funds. But, for those just starting with financial planning, Bach provides a host of resources to put recommendations into action. He walks his readers through such fundamentals as shopping for interest rates, creating a balanced retirement portfolio, and consolidating debt. And Bach's conversational style will make this quick read highly palatable for those daunted by more detailed investment and personal finance titles. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I></span>

                    <span>  This book offers a common sense approach for saving and investing. The easiest way to be wealthy is by simplifying your finances and to invest regularly.
<br />
<br />There's no need to attend money making seminars or buy a 
<br />get-rich-quick program, just continue what you enjoy doing and read the first four chapters of this book.
<br />
<br />Hopefully, you'll end the wasteful spending.
<br />
<br />Having financial peace of mind is the first step in solving family, community, town, state, national, and global problems. So read through the book and be part of solutions rather than part of problems.

                    <span>This is a book that gives good, commonsense advice on managing your finances so that there will be plenty of money left at the end of the road. While the advice may seem simplistic, you will be much more financially secure for sure if you have the discipline to carry it out. A fun read, I give it five stars easy. Other self-help books I like include "The No-Beach, No-Zone, No-Nonsense Weight Loss Plan, A Pocket Guide To What Works."

                    <span>No need to go into detail about what this book is all about. I do recommend it, it is a great starting point and a very good motivator with a pleasant reading style. It will give you examples and list numerous websites and phone numbers to get started with investing for your future. I did find that what could have been said in 2 pages it takes the author 10 pages to say it, he keeps repeating things while preparing you to give you the answer. Waste of pages, but I guess that is how you make a book out of a simple (successful) concept. You have to fill the pages somehow!
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this book, since I find its ideas are crucial to building personal wealth.</span>

                    <span>Given the state of the Social Security system combined with 73 million baby boomers stepping into retirement, this manual couldn't have come at a better time.
<br />
<br />David Bach has taken basic, proven investment and savings techniques, bound them together in one easy-to-read manual, and produced a book of financial truths and techniques for everyone.
<br />
<br />The power of systematic investing is well-documented and proven; Bach calls it the "latte factor": the systematic investment of small amounts of money over time. His spin is to automate your highest financial priorities. If retirement is your top priority, for example, automate that choice by having funds invested into 401k's, IRA's, and other plans faithfully, without having to make a recurring, monthly decision. Human nature is such that if I have to repeatedly make a decision to set aside funds for a long-term goal, in the face of short term pressures and priorities, the long-term goal will eventually lose out. He is right.
<br />
<br />As a "younger" boomer in his late forties, I take comfort in Bach's strategies; there is still time for them to work in my life. I have already executed many of them. 
<br />
<br />Warning: If you are already 60+, you might not have enough time before retirement to fully harvest the seeds Bach recommends planting. Seek other remedies to meet your retirement goals. </span>

However, if you get paid sparadically by your clients not knowing how much each month the concept is void.
