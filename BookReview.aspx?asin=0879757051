                    <span>Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!</span>

                    <span>I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works. This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.
<br />
<br />It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument.</span>

                    <span>Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this.  This, the Modern Library edition, contains an introduction and footnotes that essentially amount to Adam Smith as interpreted by 20th century socialists -- placing Smith and Karl Marx at the same level in the pantheon of social thinkers.  (One can imagine that the Modern Library may continue the trend and subsequently publish an edition of the Federalist Papers in which Madison is compared with Pol Pot.)  
<br />
<br />If you wish to understand Smith, avoid this edition.  If, however you want to gain a muddled perspective on The Wealth of Nations, go no further.</span>

                    <span>What more can anyone say about Adam Smith? Smith was right, and Marx and other socialists were dead wrong.
<br />
<br />This book is tough reading, but when you read Smith along with scholars who have read him carefully (and are not enemies of the free market economy) YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A BOLD AND BRILLIANT PIONEER ADAM SMITH WAS!
<br />
<br />SMITH IS NOT DRY WHEN YOU TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE IF SMITH IS WRONG. Supposedly, socialist Robert Reich wrote an introduction in another Modern Library edition. Reich thinks he knows Smith better than Smith knew himself, and Reich thinks conservatives who promote Smith need Reich to understand Smith.
<br />
<br />AND HOW FORTUNATE THE U.S.A. WAS THAT HIS MASTERPIECE WAS PUBLISHED IN 1776! To get beneath the free market principles that sometimes are taken for granted, the Wealth of Nations is a gold mine.
<br />
<br />In the old Modern Library edition, Max Lerner's introduction was either useless or maybe essential to read to see how modern intellectuals distorted Smith's theory as Smith originally understood it. Or how modern intellectuals use the non-political material in a text as a prop for their own radical political agendas.
<br />
<br />I must acknowledge that I have not read Edwin Canaan's introduction yet. But judging from the several Modern Library intro's to philosphers that I have read in the past, I do not expect a positive endorsement of capitalism.
<br />
<br />What is it about the Modern Library editors that they would Robert Reich to write the intro in another edition? Partisans of Reich's ilk are always blowing smoke about how Adam Smith's book has little or no applicability in a more "complex" world.
<br />
<br />I suspect that the University of Chicago Press's (given their history) edition has a better editor and an introduction that actually seeks to understand things as Smith understood them. </span>

                    <span>The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read. 
<br />
<br />Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand). 
<br />
<br />It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries. </span>
