                <span id="Label1">In both homes and furnishings, the modern look, known for its clean, spare lines and inventiveness, elicited strong opinions--which is exactly what classic designers like Ray and Charles Eames, George Nelson, Eero Saarinen, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe intended. <I>Classic Modern: Midcentury Modern at Home</I> celebrates the work of these innovators and the longevity of their designs as we move into a new millennium.<p> Starting off with side-by-side photos, we see several modern houses when they were originally built and how they now appear. They look both futuristic and contemporary in the companion photos and are impressive in the way they integrate easily into the outdoors. The first section of the book concentrates on the "flexible system of elements tailored to the climate and topography of a certain site" and "interior spaces [which] flowed into one another, rather than being divided by separate boxes connected by hallways." The second section invites you to tour especially significant or evocative modern estates, some of which are inhabited and others which are showpieces. Particularly interesting is the curved glass Palm Springs home of Raymond Loewy, designer of the Coca-Cola bottle, which is arranged around a free-form pool lapping the desert. A subsequent chapter examines modern architecture in the suburbs where the midcentury influence can be seen on a smaller, less expensive--but not less impressive--scale.<p> The photos show the sophisticated appeal of midcentury modern and illustrate the careful placement furniture for the greatest effect. And for those who want to know more about the furniture and the architects, the author has included lists of "where to buy" and biographies in the back of the book. <I>--Dana Van Nest</I> </span>

                    <span>Some critics say that Mid-Century Modern designs tend to look cold and passive. Many, however, including myself, believe this design style to be beautiful and exciting. Classic Modern: Midcentury Modern at Home was written for those of us who love the designs from the 1950s and early 1960s. The photos and captions alone are enough to excite and inform, but when combined with the text, they really add insight into how the designs were created and how they can be re-created in our own homes. I used to consider myself a midcentury modern enthusiast, but after having read this book, I consider myself a bit of an expert. Especially useful are the catalog of furniture and the "Further Reading" sections at the back of the book. One last surprise was the portrait at the back of the book which pictures six of the most prominent designers from the era, including my personal favorite, Charles Eames.</span>

                    <span>Having recently read over a dozen books on classic modern homes and interiors, including brand new ones like Modernism Rediscovered as well as classics like Schulman's own Architecture and Its Photography, I was still in awe at the quality and quantity of photos in this book. They're almost all full or double-paged and in brilliant color. There is an occassional paired "original period" photo in black and white for an interesting contrast. Unlike some reviewers, I found the text informative because views of the clients and current owners are included - as opposed to just the critics and designers, as in most of the other books. The several appendices are very useful, as well. I would highly recommend this book at more than its "suggested" price, let alone at its incredibly low bargain price. Get it while you can.</span>

                    <span>Terrific coffee table book. Gorgeous photos with rarely published interiors of well known mid-century homes. If you don't appreciate furnishings and design of the 1950's now, you will after seeing this book! Friendly text-the reader "gets to know" the residents and creators of these spaces.</span>

                    <span>This beautifully photographed book sheds light on how modernism is being interpreted by contemporary home owners. The houses featured in this book are classic examples of mid-century modern architecture. Many of them have been recently restored, and are now filled with the splendors of modernist furniture and decorative arts. This book is really about the photographs, and they're just great.</span>
