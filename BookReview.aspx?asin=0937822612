                    <span>This book is excellent for what it is: tips & tricks on building lapstrake plywood boats. It's laid out in a topic-by-topic fashion, with nice bits of information on all stages of the building & finishing process. I'm just finishing up one of Oughtred's designs, a 14'6" Whilly Boat, and I've found it nearly indispensable.<P>That said, I don't think this is a good first book or only book on the subject- that book is Tom Hill's Ultralight Boatbuilding. I recommend that anyone building their first boat buy Hill's book, then Hill's video (...) and then this book. I have half a dozen other books on building boats, but those are all you need to do an excellent job with plywood & epoxy. After absorbing Hill's material, this will fill in little gaps and help you work quicker & more efficiently.<P>Enjoy!<P>(...)</span>

                    <span>I agree with the reviewer who found the organization difficult. I have about 20 books on boatbuilding and I seldom consult this one except to compare to what others have to say on a particular subject.<P>I find Thomas Hills' method more interesting and I find his instructions to be clearer (but not without leaving some questions).<P>Note to those who have trouble with the bindings: On any book I expect to use while doing something else, e.g. building a boat, I immediately take it to Kinkos where they cut off the spine and put one of those plastic combs on the book. Make sure the person understands what they are doing. Once they cut the binding holes on the side opposite the original binding. No wonder it was confusing!<P>I find it ironic that some of the highest quality writing is packaged in the poorest quality books.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book while still trying to decide what boat building method I wanted to use for a boat that would spend most of its time out of the water. I have to trailer sail so ply lapstrake, composite strip, cold-molding, and stich and glue were all being considered. <P>After reading books about these other methods from various authors I found Mr. Oughtred's book the best for glued plywood lapstrake construction, and the best reference for his plans. I ordered my plans directly from Mr. Oughtred from the information in the back of the book. There is a good glossary of boat building terms. I only wish he could have explained spiling better. As mentioned earlier the binding is terribly weak, and the book can be hard to follow. All you have to do is take the time to read thoroughly, and answers to questions will come to you as you build. Excellent illustrations and photos.</span>

                    <span>If you're going to build an Oughtred designed boat, you'll find this book indispensible. Otherwise you'll find some good information, but not the best book on the subject. The layout and organization are very odd and hard to follow. Tom Hill's "Ultralight Boatbuilding" is a better book on the subject.</span>
