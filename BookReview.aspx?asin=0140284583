                <span id="Label1">This gripping history is the definitive account of the battle that shifted the tide of World War II.  <br> <br>Historians and reviewers worldwide have hailed Antony Beevor's magisterial <i>Stalingrad</i> as the definitive account of World War II's most harrowing battle. In August 1942, Hitler's huge Sixth Army reached the city that bore Stalin's name. In the five month siege that followed, the Russians fought to hold Stalingrad at any cost, then caught their Nazi enemy in an astonishing reversal.  <br> <br>As never before, Stalingrad conveys the experience of soldiers on both sides as they fought in inhuman conditions, and of civilians trapped on an urban battlefield. Antony Beevor has interviewed survivors and discovered completely new material in a wide range of German and Soviet archives, including reports of prisoner interrogations, desertions, and executions. The battle of Stalingrad was the psychological turning point of World War II; as Beevor makes clear, it also changed the face of modern warfare. As a story of cruelty, courage, and human suffering, Stalingrad is unprecedented and unforgettable.<br>"A fantastic and sobering story . . . fully and authoritatively told." -Richard Bernstein, <i>The New York Times</i></span>

                    <span>As I read this book I kept wondering how it was possible that I had never heard of Mr. Beevor before, this is an outstanding piece of work. This book is a gritty no holds barred description of close quarters combat. A preliminary military sitrep of the eastern front is included but the strong suit of this book involves descriptions so vivid that you may find yourself scratching (I did) itches as you read about the lice and other vermin in the shattered city. Trained dogs carrying anti-tank charges, sniper battles, front line taunting, hunger, suicide, bravery, desertion (by both sides), punishment battalions re-supply attempts via the Luftwaffe are a sampling of topics covered. Mr. Beevors describes the strength and weakness of the weapons employed by both side, for example noting that the anti-tank cannon (PAK 37) used by the Wehrmacht and it's allies was so ineffective against the Soviet T-34 tank that it was refered to as the "door knocker". The Panzerwaffe firefights with Soviet women anti-aircraft gunners on the outskirts of Stalingrad in the fall of 1942 shocked the Germans as to the degree of fanatic defensive efforts the Soviets were going to employ in this battle. The city became symbolic in the battle of wills between Hitler and Stalin, each drew a line in the sand at this place, unfortunately for the 6th Army, Stalingrad became their burial ground. This book contains easy to understand maps and (paperback version) two sections of photos. The book offers a very close look Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus' dilemma between obeying orders and looking out for the well-being of the 6th Army. This battle was not lost by the soldiers of the Wehrmacht in Russia but rather by the Nazis in Berlin afraid to enlighten Hitler (the truth would have made no difference anyway) as to the real condition of the trapped army and offering false assurances that air dropped supplies could keep the force alive until rescue. This book offers a very graphic description of what happened to the 6th Army after the fighting ended, following the suvivors fates which more than often were short and violent. This book has some of the most intense accounts of urban combat that I have ever read, also some interesting quotes and observations, for example Paulus saying "I have no intention of shooting myself for that Bohemian corporal" or a Soviet officer yelling to a group of German POWs amid the ruins and carnage around them "that is how Berlin is going to look".</span>

                    <span>Beevor's book is an excellent account of the human aspect of the battle of Stalingrad as well as the political hubris swirling around this historic battle. I have read many books about World War II and few provide the scope and immediacy this one does. Beevor fleshes out the the epic story of Stalingrad with the letters home from the 6th Army German soldiers cut off by the Red Army in the final weeks of the battle. Many of these letters made it out of the Russian encirclement(although their authors did not)before the the German 6th Army lost contact with the rest of the Wermacht. Through the last words penned to loved ones we have a window on the final hours and thoughts of the German soldiers of the 6th Army who realized too late that they had been abandoned by their Fuhrer to die in this frozen graveyard of a city on the Volga.</span>

                    <span>What remains in my mind are the incidental points: German soldiers drowning in latrines, too weak from dysentary to rescue themselves or be rescued by starving comrades. Russians incinerated as they try to flee across the Volga. Mass cruelty mixed with a German clergyman painting a "Fortress Madonna" on the only available paper, the back of a military map. Soviet propagandists blaring "death tango" music across the front. The Russian truce seekers meeting with Germans after Christmas. Those on both sides who desert. Soviet POWs worked to death as human oxen. German letters home from the "kessel." Hitler's gambling with half a million lives and Goebbels' media manipulation. Stalin's NKVD and Hitler's Feldgendarmerie both shooting those terrified to fight. Everywhere, mud, ice, blood.<P>These poignant and infuriating vignettes rise above the sheer mass of often primary-source material trawled by Beevor. Too often, this army formation goes here and this general goes there, especially in the middle of the narrative, and this weakens the "human" touch which I favor, although to be fair other readers may relish these strategic accounts. I certainly needed the maps to follow the action. <P>When I was a child, a "Reader's Digest" condensation described Stalingraders eating library paste and boiling leather goods to survive. Surprisingly, the civilian plight gains very little attention; the focus here mixes wide-scale accounts of troop movements with accounts drawn from letters and documents. This is a difficult balancing act to carry off for simplifying a complicated story over a couple of years in four hundred pages, and I commend Beevor's skill while wishing nonetheless that the book was even longer, to allow more space between these two extremes, and more time to relate the dazzling or dreadful individual's story that illuminates the fog of war. <P>A good companion to his "The Fall of Berlin," and those curious about the punishment batallions of the Soviets, the effect of the loss of the Sixth Army on the Nazi psyche, and the fate of those receiving Russian revenge for Nazi terror will find a logical continuation in his more recent work.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book by noted writer Antony Beevor joins three others that are essential English language "classics" on Stalingrad. These important books are John Erickson's "The Road to Stalingrad: Stalin's War with Germany" and Joel Hayward's "Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East 1942-1943" and Earl Ziemke and Magna Bauer's "Moscow to Stalingrad: Decision in the East".<P>Beevor has used all three and produced a work that is the least academic but arguably most exciting of all. He has also used Manfred Kehrig's "Stalingrad: Analyse und Dokumentation einer Schlacht"which is not available in English --- sadly.<P>Beevor also uses the latest research on the Soviets, including the books by David Glantz. He paid researchers to translate unpublished Soviet documents, which also enrich his text.<P>The book is clearly an excellent overview of the efforts put into winning at Stalingrad by both sides. As scholars have noted in learned articles, Beevor ignores airpower and only deals sketchily with strategy, but his narrative of the human experience of warfare is more than compensatory.</span>

                    <span>I first read this book during the summer of 1999 and had never heard of the author beforehand. I took to him immediately and experienced considerable difficulty putting Stalingrad down. I usually read three or four books at a time but could not with Stalingrad as it became my sole concern until it was finished. Beevor makes use of outstanding primary source materials and his narrative technique makes one feel as if you have secret access to the innermost recesses of the minds of Chuikov, Paulus, Zhukov, von Manstein, and, of course, Hitler and Stalin. It reminded me of the old PBS documentary, <BR>"Battleground" for the way in which it flowed. Buy it,I guarantee you won't regret it.</span>
