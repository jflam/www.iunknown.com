                    <span>I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years.  Burlingame is inaccurate in many of his statements about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln in particular and does not present all of the information about both of them.  Possibly his most faulty act is using William Herndon's information about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln.  Herndon and Mary Lincoln hated each other.  After Lincoln passed away, Herndon may have very well said things about Lincoln and her to hurt, degrade and disgrace Mary Lincoln.  Herndon is NOT to be trusted to be accurate much of the time.  Other very poor Lincoln authors are Weik, Sandburg, Gore Vidal, Lerone Bennett, Jr., Thomas DiLorenzo, Vincent Harding and Barbara Fields.  Their accuracy, interpretations and images are usually wrong and at times even bizarre.  If you want to read professionally researched, much more accurate material about Lincoln, read books by David Herbert Donald, Stephen Oates, Frank Williams, Mark Neely, Jr., Edward Steers, Jr. and Allen Guelzo.</span>

                    <span>The organization of this book is not presented in a chronological time scale as most books are.  Instead, the author breaks up facets of Lincoln's emotions and personality traits, and then takes us through his whole life, examining the influence of each facet.  Only thinking in this manner do I clearly imagine myself in his shoes, feeling what he felt, and in awe of the strength required to break the rebellion, and provide a land where each man's hand could feed that own man's face.</span>

                    <span>Burlingame's book is misnamed in my view - it is not `The Inner World' as much as how Lincoln reacted to the outer world.  The reader is left to judge ultimately for himself what Lincoln thought.  This is a testament to Burlingame's restraint as a historian.  He could have pounded away at all sorts of psychological concepts and explanations, but he does'nt  Instead, except for some references to Carl Jung in the beginning of the book and a sprikling of psychological explanations throughout the chapters, he presents in a matter-of-fact way Lincoln's relationships with his wife, his sons, his generals, and discusses his temper, ambition, and parenting, with some, but not excessive, `patient on the couch' pontificating.  
<br />
<br />The longest, and by far the most powerful, chapter is on Lincoln's marriage.  If only half, or even a quarter of what Burlingame recounts was true, then the potato-throwing, screaming, spendthrift Mary Lincoln must have been the worst wife on earth. In Springfield, Lincoln would often rush out the backdoor during Mary's `episodes' - whisking his sons up with him and spending the night in his office, on a couch specially installed that was long enough to handle his tall frame.  He was often beaten - a broom being Mary's weapon of choice.  My God, the poor man needed his own Emancipation Proclamation!
<br />
<br />The chapter on Lincoln's depression details how low this man could get.  It was probably his Gloomy Gus outlook that saved Lincoln from completely cracking up; only a person familiar with depression and how to go on under difficult circumstances could withstand the strain of a war that killed 628,000 fellow citizens in four years.  I am not a Lincoln scholar so I can't testify to the veracity of all that is in this book.  But, reading it will provide you with a sense of how many trials this strange, ambitious, and great man endured - at home and in politics.</span>

                    <span>Burlingame does a great service with this book.  He delves into Lincoln's psyche in a way that has perhaps never been done.  This is not vain guessing on his part.  He offers a virtual avalanche of sources throughout the book.<p>His Mary Todd Lincoln chapter is a welcome antidote to the "politically correct" version that somehow turns an emotionally and at times even physically abusive MTL into an endearing person.</span>

                    <span>Finally a work comes out that eschews the sugar-coated lies we have been spoon fed since grammar school regarding the fairy tale life of our 16th President.  Mary Todd Lincoln is spared all revisionist attempts at  painting her neuroses in a charming, adorable light and she is revealed for  what she really was - a monstrous, childish, shrew of a woman!  Great work,  and I shall introduce it to my students as the defining truth of the  Lincoln marriage and White House.</span>
