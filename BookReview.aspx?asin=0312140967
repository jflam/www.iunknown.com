                    <span>For me what this book did was move things I had been feeling about hugging up from the unspoken part of my mind to the page. There's nothing ground breaking here, but if you are looking to imrpove your hugging skills it is a reasonably priced fast-reading solution.<P>If you're looking for a book of "How to get laid by hugging" you may as well keep looking.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book very much. I definitely agree that hugging is essential in all relationships, but especially romantic ones. It was wonderful how the author described various types of hugs and how each one is good for us. I like how emphasis is put more on love, intimacy and tenderness then on pure sex. Of course sensual hugs are nice as well, but we need to balance physical, emotional and spiritual needs in relating to each other. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking greater love and intimacy in their lives.</span>

                    <span>I personally didn't enjoy this book, but it could be fun for others. It's in the same style as "The Art of Kissing" except a bit shorter (140 pages instead of 180). It's printed on cheap paper, and contains no photographs or illustrations. After a short introduction and discussion about sex differences in hugging, the bulk of the book describes 19 hugging styles, like "The Unrequited Hug" and "The Heart-to-Heart Hug". And finally, there is a chapter on hugging techniques, looking at issues like: How do you hug a baby? and Why do some people refuse to Hug?</span>

                    <span>North Americans would certainly be viewed as more friendly if they knew how to hug more often. It is a shame that hugging is not practiced very often in North America. Perhaps that's why North American women likes Latin American lovers....</span>
