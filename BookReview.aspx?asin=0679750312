                <span id="Label1">Postman suggests that the current crisis in our educational system derives from its failure to supply students with a translucent, unifying "narrative" like those that inspired earlier generations. Instead, today's schools promote the false "gods" of economic utility, consumerism, or ethnic separatism and resentment. What alternative strategies can we use to instill our children with a sense of global citizenship, healthy intellectual skepticism, respect of America's traditions, and appreciation of its diversity? In answering this question, <b>The End of Education</b> restores meaning and common sense to the arena in which they are most urgently needed. <br><p><br>"Informal and clear...Postman's ideas about education are appealingly fresh."--New York Times Book Review</span>

                    <span>Especially good was the book's beginning discussion of gods, myths or "narratives" as motivating forces. This topic was well presented. As to schooling there is nothing wrong with the concept of the public schools turning out "Americans", though this is hardly a novel concept. All in all my overall impression is that the book presents a utopian fantasy -- imagine a world in which students and teachers alike are never bored, but are always infused with enthusiasm over the overarching goals of education. Postman's utopia, pertaining to schooling, seems to be a scaled down version of a full-blown societal utopia (Marxism). Like Marx, Postman gives no means or method as to how to actually run such a system. In fact, right from the start Postman seems proud to declare that the discussion of the method(s) of schooling is beneath his dignity. Because, in his vision, the enthusiasm generated by his proposed educational "narrative" will be so invigorating that the students will necessarily become chock filled with learning regardless of what method is inflicted upon them. This seems overly optimistic. <P>Postman's proposition that his 5 pet topics will generate such enthusiasm is arrogant and delusional. Everyone knows that different topics interest different people. You may be enthused about gardening though it may bore other people to tears. The same is true about every topic, including "spaceship earth", the fallen angel, etc. <P>There are any number of minor errors that can be nitpicked over. Postman declares that he can conceive of no god that would destroy people or cities -- has he forgotten the biblical stories of Noah and the Flood, or Sodom & Gomorrah? He states that the non-public schools are divisive -- but the motto of the Catholic schools is "for God & Country". This is hardly divisive. <P>But I think Postman's most central error concerns critical thinking. Critical thinking is a subject unto itself. If it is to be taught, then it itself is likely to be as boring or not-boring as any other subject matter. Yes it may be fun for students to engage in a bull session once in a while to expose them to the possibility of critical thinking. But critical thinking is hard work; it entails doing the ordinary work, which is hard enough, and then going further. And it requires a large fund of knowledge, something Postman surprisingly eschews (on the flimsy ground that it's too hard or arbitrary to determine which facts should be included in the fund). But without a solid grasp of the facts, it's impossible to form and to evaluate opinions in a critical way. So, Postman's proposal that students could be critical thinkers without having to be bothered with a fund of knowledge, goes hand in hand with his confused idea that serious learning at school could take place on the basis of pure enthusiasm without due attention to the means needed to achieve the desired end -- it's a fantasy.</span>

                    <span>If one is a Postman reader to write that this is a great book is almost irreverent. I don't mean to say that anyone -including Professor Postman- is beyond criticism. I am trying to say that stating that "Postman is a fascinating writer, incisive in his commentary, original in his thinking" is very much obvious.<P>Aside of all the "banalities" what I may add for this book is that although its intended audience is American is very appropriate for other countries, at least of the western world (certainly very fitting for Greece), and I suspect for the majority of the countries, where policymakers, teachers, parents and students are struggling with the meaning of education. I suspect that the problems of education are universal and the questions that Postman poses are universal too.<P>I know, actually I have learned from Postman, that there are great and established scholars in the field of education - and I must admit that I am not familiar with their writings, but I will dare saying that you cannot afford NOT to read this book. By the way, having read other Postman's books I might suggest that this one probably is one of his better ones, bringing many intended and unintended gifts, such as lessons on language as a tool of understanding the world, the issue of multiculturalism, of patriotism, or religion, and how all these concepts pertain to today's world.

                    <span>The blurb of the book is interesting enough to make one want to pick it up. And when one does begin the voyage, one realizes immediately that the author isnt talking about the end of education in terms of its being finished, rather he is speaking of the Purpose of education. Once this distinction is made, Postman brilliantly argues about how all of today's educational initiatives in the US are more about the means, and hence do not address any root change in the learning process. He then goes on to categorically define the problems in the first part of the book, and his ideas quite almost leap out of the pages in the second part of the book as he boldly architects a probable scenario of the future of education, in terms of its driving purpose.<BR>In doing so, the author gives numerous examples to illustrate his points of view, while all the while admitting that the book is not an exhaustive list of ideas, rather an exhaustion of his mind! Quite a brilliantly written book that cannot but stop and make the reader think. It would be a very different world if every teacher in high school read this book and implemented just even a small part of it in their teaching and actions. In no ways a negative, it must be noted that Postman's religious beliefs and admiration for the US is thrown into sharp relief in his writings.<BR>Lastly, this book gave me 13 books and 7 authors as a potential list to read up on, the book is verily a rich source of ideas and allows the reader to make his own reading list to explore some of the ideas in depth and reach his/her own path.</span>

                    <span>The title End of Education is not as cynical as I had<BR>expected. I had interpreted "End" to mean "finish" although<BR>the book is really more about the "purpose" and <BR>priorities of our schools. Postman makes a well-argued <BR>case for profound changes in our approach to public <BR>education. <P>"The question is not Does or doesn't public schooling <BR>create a public? The question is, What kind of public does<BR>it create?" For me that is the most important premise<BR>in this book, because people who don't understand our <BR>history and our constitution, and who have no critical <BR>thinking skills, are not going to be effective <BR>participants in our democracy. <P>Another important point deals with multiculturalism vs. <BR>cultural pluralism. Postman argues for a "constructive <BR>and unifying use of diversity." American schools need <BR>to create Americans, who appreciate the various cultural<BR>backgrounds that make up our society, but divisiveness <BR>created in the name of multiculturalism is counter-<BR>productive. <P>The first half of this book discusses "gods" or narratives.<BR>"...Teachers must have a god to serve, or, even better <BR>several gods... Without a narrative, life has no meaning.<BR>Without meaning, learning has no purpose." For example,<BR>the god of Consumerism has been partially responsible<BR>to steering our schools off course. Personally, I think<BR>the god metaphor was belabored.<P>"Public education does not serve a public. It creates<BR>a public." That's why schools play a critical role<BR>in the future of our economy and our democracy.<BR>And that's why this is such an important book.</span>

                    <span>Most of the current debate in education involves 'means': teaching methodologies, national testing, privatization, etc. This book focuses on a different, less frequently discussed aspect of the crisis in education: what should we be teaching in the first place? <P>Inherent in all cultures and activities are purposes that drive actions. For schools, its most common objectives (such as technological competence, consumership, acquisition of practical skills, and multiculturalism) have failed to inspire spiritual and intellectual learning. Postman proposes five concepts (humanity's place in the universe, independent thinking, America's form of government, diversity, understanding technology's impact) to focus education around that in a number of ways grapple with the most significant issues the world faces today. <P>Given the significance of education, and the fact that everyone is both directly and indirectly affected by its results, readers will find this an important and insightful book. It is especially excellent for educators seeking meaningful content and context for their lessons. Like all of Postman's writing, it is a concise, witty, and interesting read.</span>
