                <span id="Label1">This book is a comprehensive programming guide for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It gives the reader a strong overview and reference of the JVM so that they may create their own implementations of the JVM or write their own compilers that create Java object code. <P> Perhaps the most important reason for learning about the Java Virtual Machine is that it gives you additional tools for solving programming problems in Java. The Java architecture is very open -- its easy to add programatic extensions to Java, once you have learned the basic rules of the Java Virtual Machine. And the Java Virtual Machine is portable, so you only have to write the extension once. <P> So if you don't like how a particular feature of the Java language works, why not create an extension library which operates in the way you need it to? Its not as hard as you might think, and this book gives you all the details you need.</span>

                    <span>If you're just entering the JVM aspects - that's a good place to start, I think. The JVM explained in a simple, not confusing manner, the book can easily be read by anyone. Then you might go to read the full "JVM Spec" from Sun. 4 stars for authors spend too much place describing Jasmin ( JVM assembler they wrote ) - tell me, who needs it ? I hardly imagine anybody writing bytecodes in assembly. *Reading* bytecodes is something else, I do it on a daily base - but let's leave the job of creating them to javac.<br>One special "thank you" is for "Appendix A" where all JVM instructions are nicely listed by the function group. I browse it the most.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for those that are interested in learning the bytecode structure of the Java Virtual Machine and its class file structure. It comes with a bytecode assembler, called Jasmin. Some reviewers felt that the assembler is completely useless. I liked having it as it helped me to learn and test my knowledge of java bytecode without having to write an interpreter first.<p>This book is misleading, however, as most books on this subject do a pretty good job of explaining the internals of the Java Virtual Machine. This book does not. If you are looking to understand java bytecode and class file format better, this may be your book. But, if you are looking to get the full explaination of the workings of the Java Virtual Machine (especially if you are trying to write your own), then "Inside the Java Virtual Machine" is a much better book.</span>

                    <span>Although there are only a few books currently discussing about the internal of JVM, this book is the worst of them. It copies too many pages such as the bytecode semantics from the JVM specification by Sun Microsystems and these parts consume around half of the books. Also most contents not borrowed from JVM specification is far too simple to be an indepth discussion of JVM. It only took me 2 hours to read the whole book and to find out that it is a bad book.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a good tutorial introduction to the Java Virtual Machine. It even includes an "assembler" so that you can practice writing Java bytecode yourself. Unfortunately, there are no exercises  provided so that it takes a great deal of motivation and creativity to  write JVM programs that will test your knowledge of the book's  material.<p>But by far the worst problem of this book is that it covers  only the very first version of the JVM and the Java language. Now that  there are new editions of the JVM spec and language spec, as well as the  other JVM tutorial books, the time for updating this book is overdue.</span>

                    <span>Compering to others books about jvm this one gives you much more details about functionality of jvm. Looking deeply inside structer of jvm less in just instruction.But one unneeded detail is "jasmin" assembler  who needs it no practical apply.</span>
