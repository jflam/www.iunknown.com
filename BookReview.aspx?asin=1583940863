                <span id="Label1">De La Salle High School in Concord, California, is home to perhaps the greatest dynasty in sports history. At age 23, Coach Bob Ladouceur launched a legend, "The Streak," with no teaching or head-coaching experience, and with his teams amassed the highest winning percentage in all of football history with 138 consecutive victories. This book takes readers behind the scenes, closely following individual players, as Ladouceur guides his team through the most daunting schedule in school history, the 2002 season. Numerous interviews with major-league coaches such as Bill Walsh, Steve Mariucci, and John Gruden show the depth of respect accorded to Ladouceur and his methods and philosophies. Written with full cooperation from the coach and including dozens of photographs, this book is perfect for anyone interested in the factors behind phenomenal team success.</span>

                    <span>Dude you are an idiot. You know nothing of the dedication and teamwork that De La Salle players and coaches posses, and based off of your imbecilic comments and lack of respect for other's accomplishments, you never will. The book is great because it is a reflection on the dedication that this team has for one another and for the game of football. Buy it and you will see why De La Salle will go down in history as one of the most significant high school football teams ever.</span>

                    <span>As the mother of three former high school football players who remains largely indifferent to the sport even now, I found myself surprisingly captivated by this story. Powerfully and tightly written, it early on evoked strong emotions and a growing fascination with Head Coach Ladouceur's methodology. As one of the team members said, "If you think Coach (Ladouceur) is inspiring on the football field, you ought to be in his Religion class."<P>The Coach is clearly unique among high school football coaches, This book is about a season of individual football games, the team players, the assistant coaches, and Coach Lad. I quickly grew to care deeply about every one of them. <P>As one of the boys chided a boasting parent, "Dad, it's not about winning." Indeed, it's not, not really at all, and that's what is so intriguing about this coach and this team. It's not even about football. Corny as it may sound, it's about love.</span>

                    <span>The De La Salle Spartans of Concord, CA, are owners and stewards of perhaps the longest winning streak in sports, let alone high school football. At the beginning of the 2002 season, the Spartans have won an amazing 125 straight games. To fully understand what that means, you have to realize that a typical high school football season is a mere 10 games, with a few more playoff games for the teams good enough to make it. Running through a season undefeated is an amazing accomplishment that most schools never experience, and is usually a fortunate and timely collaboration of good coaching, solid talent, meshed with experience and an enormous amount of commitment and desire, with just a bit of plain old good luck. By the summer of 2002, De La Salle's team had just completed a run of TEN CONSECUTIVE undefeated seasons. <P>The 2002 Spartans, however, do not appear to have what it takes to continue "The Streak", as they are less talented, less experienced, and seemingly, less interested and committed than De La Salle teams of the past. This book chronicles the trials and travails of the 2002 season, including potential Streak-ending games versus Southern California powerhouse Long Beach Poly and 15-time Hawaiian State Champions Honolulu St. Louis. <P>This book delves into the mystery surrounding the origins and continuation of the Streak, the players and coaches who have contributed to it, and most of all, how unassuming and unlikely a school like De La Salle and a place like Concord could be home to the longest winning streak in football history. The story isn't as electrically charged as H.G. Bissinger's "Friday Night Lights," but it is still a teriffic read and a rousing salute to the "ordinary" young men who have, through their dedication and effort, managed to forge "The Streak."</span>

                    <span>If you've heard about DLS, but want to learn more, read this well-written book. If you've heard the rumors about what DLS does or doesn't do, read this book. If you find it hard to believe that that a team can win 151 games in a row and would like to learn how they did it, read this book.<P>If you are inadequate and like to tear down others' accomplishments, don't buy this book - it will only frustrate you. If you think that the only way a school can accomplish great things in sports is by selling their soul to that sport, this book will not satisfy you.<P>If you would like to read about a VERY good school that unknowingly hired the best High School football coach ever to produce the most extraordinary football team in history, read this book. You will be very satisfied.</span>

                    <span>Neil Hayes took me places I didn't expect to go. What a fascinating portrait of a fascinating program. My brother is a coach in Southern California and I sent him this book because of the unique perspective it offers. It's amazing the wholesome culture that has been set up at De La Salle. Hayes does a great job of describing every facet of the football program. The secret to De La Salle's succes: Sure, they've started getting good talent, but they also work harder and take it more seriously than you could ever imagine.</span>
