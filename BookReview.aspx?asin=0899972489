                    <span>After a beautiful weekend in Big Basin Redwoods State Park my wife and I were not terribly eager to end our Memorial Day vacation by taking the direct route back home to Southern California. So we went by way of the coast and stopped at Point Lobos State Preserve near Carmel for some short walks. We were stunned at the scenery and immediately vowed to return. This is not the first time we have had such experiences around Monterey. The area is simply ideal for walking. The scenery is so delightful and the weather so mild that it demands a good guidebook and Weintraub's book certainly fulfills that role.<P>This book details 48 hikes in some 28 different state and county parks or other public lands. Most of the routes described are short pleasant walks. Fully 75% of the trails are under 5 miles and only two exceed 10 miles. (One of these, the Waterfall loop in Big Basin, is an absolutely mandatory hike. It is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the state.) Each route description includes a topographical map. <P>This book covers some of my favorite areas: Point Lobos, Big Basin, Henry Cowell Redwoods and surprisingly Pinnacles National Monument. I've done some exploration in all these places. But this book has made me aware of so many other nice parks in the region. After reading Weintraub's descriptions I'm looking forward to visiting Garrapata State Park, Jacks Peak County Park, and some of the wonderful beaches around the bay. In short, this is an excellent book for planning a vacation around. It is well worth the price.</span>
