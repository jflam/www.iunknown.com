                    <span>I read this book first because they say it was good. It was entertaining and kept my attention. I heard about church people acting this way, but I wasn't sure. It's almost scarry to go to church knowing that the people aren't being truthful and honest. I know i wouldn't want to follow a pastor whose family is off the chain. it was sad what happened to their mother. she seemed like the only one with good sense. but pastor's wife or not, i aint gonna let no woman bum rush my man and in my own house!!!!! Oh hell no! I liked this book better than the Preacher's Son.</span>

                    <span>This is how i would put it.  If you read all of your good books, then you might want to read this from your "later" pile if you have nothing else good to read. My bookclub was wrong for selecting this. </span>

                    <span>It wasnt the best book, however, I wanted to know how novel was going to end. 
<br />Besides the foul language, I would pass it along to my 18 year old neice.

                    <span>I read this one last month and when I finished, I said "what does the title have to do with the storylines?"  Why would the church say "amen" to a pastor's daughter's uncontrollable behavior; his son's homosexuality; his eldest son's drug problems; and, last but not least, the pastor himself--his neglect of his family issues.  I know that the author will probably rebuttal this, but I'm not knocking the storylines, I just want to know what does the title have to do with the storylines?  Instead the title should be The Pastor's Family or The Pastor's Children, or something to that effect.  Just my entitled opinion, that's all.</span>

                    <span>I was a little hesitant by the title and almost didn't purchase the book, was I ever so wrong!! Ms. Billingsley is truly a gifted writer as evidence by her sophmore release being filled with much drama.  She cativated and held my attention throughout the entire book!!  The characters are well developed and full of "drama".  Please let there be a sequel!!!</span>
