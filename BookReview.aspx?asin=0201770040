                <span id="Label1">Ideal for any Java developer or architect facing today's rich XML-based standards and tools, the second edition of <I>XML and Java: Developing Web Applications</I> delivers a wide and deep tour of the latest in today's XML standards and Java tools used to work with them. Whether you want to gain an understanding of basic or advanced uses of XML, chances are this  practical-minded book will fit the bill, with its far-ranging coverage of tools and programming techniques.<p>The coverage of today's Java XML tools is perhaps unmatched by any text. The authors do a great job at presenting the essentials first, in short, fast-moving, understandable chapters, before ranging farther afield. In particular, the coverage of two of the most important XML APIs in today's Java (SAX and DOM) is a standout here. We also liked the benchmarks that show how SAX can offer faster performance, plus the easy-to-grasp summaries of essential programming APIs for both tools. Beyond the basics, the authors present several advanced techniques, like sending XML over sockets and advanced "tricks" available in Xerces.<p>After the basics of parsing XML, the book turns to transforming XML using XSLT, again with a no-nonsense, practical tour. Turning toward the server-side, the text presents a quick introduction to JSP and servlets and where XML fits into each. (Readers will appreciate the demonstration of creating XML from an "ordinary" JSP here.) After looking at XML used with databases and messaging, the book focuses in on Web services in a particularly well-wrought chapter that covers all of the relevant standards for today's Web services, including how SOAP is really just an extension of XML messaging for the enterprise.<p>After looking at security issues with XML (including the importance of using secure sockets), a section on the various ways of defining XML documents (from standard DTDs to XML Schema, Schematron, and even RDF) shows the advantages and design goals of each. Handy reference sections list resources for all of today's leading XML-based tools and W3C XML standards.<p>While today's landscape of XML standards and tools can indeed be daunting, this text sorts it out with an enthusiastic treatment of the subject filled with practical advice and an expert's take on what working Java developers and system architects need to know when it comes to XML.  <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>This is a very good book, for the problem space it explains. It does not require much knowledge from the reader, just the most basic knowledge of Java and having looked at an XML document before. It has a handy reference at the back, which is better than going through the online Javadocs. Some nice chapters:<P>Ch 6: Interfacing Databases and XML<P>Ch 7: Exchanging Messages Securely on the Internet<P>Ch 8: Developing Applications Using JavaBeans<P>These are chapters after the introductory chapters that tell you how to use XML, manipulate it, etc. These chapters 6-8 introduce you to their subjects without assuming almost nothing in the way of knowledge. So, this is probably a book to browse through before you buy it, or order it and return if it's not for you. For some people, this will land immediately in a very useful area. For others, it might assume too much or too little.</span>

                    <span>It's interesting to note that all of the reviews on this site are prior to the second edition publishing date. I have read a completely different book. I find no mention of IBM proprietary classes or xml4j. Open source API's are used throughout for examples and while there is no mention of my personal favorite XML API, JDOM, it does cover newer topics like JDK 1.4, XSLT, XML Messaging, Web Services and XML databases well. <P>The book is literally filled with code, every page. A CD is included for all that source and it includes lots of evaluation and open source tools and API's to save you download time. All of that code leads you to want to use this book as a "cookbook" but don't overlook the text. There is serious experience and expertise revealed here.<P>This book contains the smallest and simplest example of SOAP messaging I've come across. Still several pages, but what are you going to do? For a book with this many authors, nine on the cover, it "cuts to the chase" very well and zeroes in on what a developer needs to use these new technologies to create Web Services and simpler XML applications.</span>

                    <span>Even if 9 different authors wrote this book, the logical flow remains intact and the writing style is consistent, clear and concise, without any redundancy. The authors provide plenty of well written, relevant code examples, almost to a level of a cookbook. I was very pleased to see some pretty advanced topics covered in details and, while the focus is on Xerces, JAXP get a good coverage too. In my opinion one of the best Java/XML books on the market</span>

                    <span>This is the best XML/Java book I've seen to date. Why? It's well written. For example, unlike most books written by more than one or two authors, this book does *not* repeat a lot of material that an author previously addressed. The code contained in the book and on CD is well formatted and doesn't contain a lot of needless fat surrounding the meat; it get's right to the concept they're trying to relate. <BR>I especially liked the chapters written by the lead author (Maruyama) and especially his XML Security chapters. Worth the money - just for the code.<BR>Additionally, the code is well written - example, the import statements list each class; they don't use ".*;"</span>
