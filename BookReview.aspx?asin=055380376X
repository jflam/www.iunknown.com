Unlike embedded journalists confined to a single unit, West and Smith acquired a captured yellow SUV and joined with whatever unit was leading the assault every day of the fight. The result is a report of what really happened from the heart of the action unlike anything you&#8217;ll read anywhere else.<br><br>&#8220;While we will move swiftly and aggressively against those who resist, we will treat all others with decency, demonstrating chivalry and soldierly compassion for people who have endured a lifetime under Saddam&#8217;s oppression.&#8221;&#8212;Major General J.N. Mattis, 1st Marine Division, Commanding<br><br>Here is the story that can be told only by those who actually witnessed the action of the famed 1st Marine Division&#8217;s march on Baghdad, from the shaky beginning of U.S. operations in southern Iraq to the capture of U.S. prisoners, the misreported &#8220;fierce Iraqi resistance,&#8221; and the aggressive assaults that led to a quick and decisive victory.<br><br>With over a half century of military and combat experience between them, bestselling author F. J. &#8220;Bing&#8221; West and Major General Ray L. Smith, USMC (Ret.), combine expert military analysis with dramatic battlefield reporting. They bring the reader on a march that ended in victory&#8212;but was shadowed by second-guessing, unexpected reversals, and the threat of catastrophe.<br><br><br>With access to three-star generals in the command centers and to privates in the field, the authors reveal how the strategic plan played out in battle, showing what went well and what failed, and detailing power struggles for military and political control never reported. The result is destined to become the definitive account of ground warfare in Iraq.</span>

                    <span>Smith and West are two US Marine veterans with impeccable credentials for knowledge of war. There access was excellent, probably better than a number of the embedded reporters in Iraq. The writing in the book however, has something to be desired. The book is written like a "What I Did on My Vacation in Iraq." There is little analysis of the situations and the authors don't make the story interesting in any way. I actually had trouble forcing my way through some of the battle descriptions, because they are boring!! The authors provide a number of useless details, but don't provide any of the tension of the battles. In addition most of the men they talk to we get to know in only a superficial sense, which gets even more superficial as the book goes on until the individual Marines are reduced to only last names.<P>I think if they would have spent more time researching and writing this book, they could have come up with something really special, but this isn't it.<P>If you want a book about the war that is interesting try Rick Atkinson's "In the Company of Soldiers."</span>

                    <span>There are going to be a lot of books about OIF. There were simply too many reporters for their not to be in the next year. However, to get a book, and such an excellent book written by two men (both former Marines themselves), that understand combat, logistics, operations, the fog of war, and most importantly the Marines involved in The March Up is going to make this book stand out from those that follow it's lead.<P>This story is filled with masterful anecdotes conveying brutality, indiference to danger, empathy to tragic circumstances, grievous mistakes, ignorance, fleeting command confusion, survival, death, anguish, and trial by fire. The technical capability of the troops, the competency of the officers, the capabilities of the NCOs, and the combat readiness of the Marines shine forth in this book. However no one is perfect, yet even the faults displayed are simply a contrast to a well organized and disciplined professional fighting force, more than any detraction of ability. The grit is as real as the dust layered on the vehicles of 1st MarDiv as they smashed into Baghdad, and what you experience will leave you with pride in the young men this country still produces to serve as Marines. Semper Fi.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book for what it is -- the first campaign narrative and proproganda for a general. Hopefully there will be more books in the future with real research and more even-handedness. This book is not intended as research and is clearly a propaganda piece for General Mattis who gave them carte-blanche to roam his division. As such, the book could be titled "How to Launch Your Campaign for Commandant".<BR>With that said, the combat and writing experience of the authors combined with their proximity to the battles involved produces some strong insights that are not likely to be found in other books. In terms of an analysis of tactics, I thought the book was very strong. It is a lot more insightful than all the embedded journalism stories that reported the excitement but could make very little sense of the battles. For that reason I highly recommend "The March Up" as a campaign narrative.</span>

                    <span>The 3rd Infantry Division did. The Marines couldn't find a bridge and the 3rd ID had already broken the back of the resistance with the "thunder runs". Just because the Marines toppled the statue, doesn't mean they should get the credit. Truman was right when he said the Marines have a better propoganda wing than Stalin. Other than that, I haven't read the book, but the title pisses me off.<P>Rakkasan!</span>

                    <span>Dear F. J. "Bing" West,<P>Thanks for writing THE MARCH UP with Major General Ray L. Smith. With the anniversary upon us, there is quite a lot of coverage on the war in the media but nothing like your in-depth account of what it was like. Your comments regarding the split second decision making required when "civilian" vehicles approached ignoring orders to stop found no argument from me. The tactics used by the fedayeen required a quick response and pre-emptive measures whenever possible to minimize their effect.<P>The 1st Marine Division certainly did all that was asked of it and in exemplary fashion. I believe history will appreciate the remarkable accomplishments with minimal loss of lives.<P>Respectfully,<BR>Theo B. Fiala<BR>U. S. Army Vet '70-71<BR>Hq USDB Ft Leavenworth, KS</span>
