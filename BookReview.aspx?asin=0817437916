                    <span>This is a great reference for easing your way into digital nature photography. I have been shooting nature on 35mm film for about 20 years and I finally bought a digital SLR camera. Cox explains the new digital terminology so everyone can easily understand it. He gives information about the various camera settings, file formats, white balance and some helpful Photoshop techniques. It was also a good refresher on how depth of field, ISO settings and shutter speeds work to construct a photograph. You can also learn a lot from just looking at his images. He shows different lighting, close-up, landscape and portrait techniques and explains what he did to capture the photograph. If you are new to photography or making the switch to digital this is an excellent book!</span>

                    <span>A friend recommended this book to me and I would like to pass on the same recommendation. In a new digital world Cox has not forgotten the importance of creating a strong image. I love that this book offers artistic advice AND gives helpful hints about how to use the digital camera and computer as tools for creating the final image. It seems as though he isn't caught up in digital for the sake of digital. Lately I've seen work from photographers that digitally "enhance" their pictures with tricky photoshop filters, but dismiss the initial content of the piece. It's like the difference between a quality psychological thriller and a movie that relies solely on special effects. Cox stays true to his subject, by making his images as close to what the eye sees and what the mind remembers. His photography is strong for photography's sake and the digital camera just happens to be his tool. He points out all of the benefits a digital camera has to offer, while at the same time offering his advice about constructing an interesting image. I would also like to point out the use of variety in his imagery. It ranges from incredible scenes in Africa, to untouchable icy images in Antartica, but then comes right into your backyard. His backyard shots were just as dynamic as his far away places, which gave me hope for my own photography. It's really kind of funny, actually, that his book is about nature, but taken with digital tools and you would never know it. If you are just starting out with a digital camera or know someone else who is buy them this book!</span>

                    <span>I just wanted to pass along my appreciation for the book, "Digital Nature Photography". I've recently upgraded to a Canon G5 after discovering I had a decent eye while using an old Canon A20. As I made this jump I wanted to understand how to take better nature and landscape photographs, my favorite subjects, and this book came highly recommended by a friend. It cuts straight to the important information and reads very easily. I've gained a lot as a result of reading it.<P>Also, beneath each photo example the author explains what he was trying to accomplish and how he went about it; not all books do this. This is very helpful. He organizes the book very well. Not only does this make for an easy read, but also works as a great reference guide.<P>Bottom line: if you enjoy taking digital nature photography and want to get better, pickup this book.</span>

                    <span>I writing again to reiterate how helpful this book as been to me. I've read it once the whole way through and now refer to it all the time as a tool for while I'm shooting. I'm not actually a photographer, but instead use photography as a tool for my painting career. I made the switch to digital a few years ago, to help save time. This book as helped not only to teach me about the use of digital photography, but has given me the added bonus of helpful hints about photography in general from an artistic perspective. In the past my images were over and under exposed, but now I am able to capture the detail I need for painting reference. In addition, Cox has provided helpful hints about photoshop tools, which help to enhance any lack of detail I may have in my initial photograph. Also, his captions with each photograph are extremely useful in understanding how he captured each shot. Thanks, Jon Cox, for writing this book!</span>

                    <span>One thing I noticed (I see Conrad O. made mention of it also) is the complete absence of discussion regarding the histogram -- the term does not appear in the index or the text. The proper use of the histogram is one of the most important topics that should have been covered!<P>There is little that addresses issues of digital workflow -- except to show that, golly, I can take my laptop with me hiking! There is a chapter on using photoshop, but nothing on precision color balancing, calibrating your monitor, getting quality prints, step by step workflow of how to do useful things in photoshop efficiently such as using photoshop to take the place of graduated neutral density filters, nor any discussion of helpful photoshop plug-ins. It's more on the lines of, Golly I used a couple photoshop tricks and look what a change it made!<P>Overall, the quality of the photos presented is just not of the caliber to be expected in a book of this kind. There are a good many winners, but for quite a few of the images my recurring reaction was, ahh -- another nice snapshot. <P>A book that says little more than "Golly I can photograph nature with a digital camera!" may have been fine in 1998 or 1999. But a book about digital nature photography published in 2003 should offer much, much more.<P>Although this book does cover a wide breadth of photographic topics, even beginning photographers will soon outgrow it. For a general introduction, much better is John Shaw's Field Guide to Nature Photography. For nature photography with digital content I would recommend Niall Benvie's The Art of Nature Photography, or perhaps (I hope) Digital Photography Expert: Nature and Landscape Photography : The Definitive Guide For Serious Digital Photographers by Michael Freeman (April, 2004). Digital in nature photography is still relatively new -- I would recommend passing on this book (or maybe looking for it in the library) and waiting for books to emerge that offer a greater depth and quality of content.</span>
