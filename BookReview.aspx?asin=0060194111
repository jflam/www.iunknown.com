Oscar Wilde: "A man who marries his mistress leaves a vacancy in that position." Charles de Gaulle: "The cemetery is filled with indispensable men." Abraham Lincoln: "Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power." Sophocles: "Men of ill judgment oft ignore the good that lies within their hands, till they have lost it."<P>Perfect for anyone who has ever been left speechless, this book will make you as glib as Oscar Wilde, as profound as Winston Churchill, and as wise as Aesop. Inspirational, entertaining, and thought-provoking, this is one collection that no library or bookshelf should be without.<P><UL><LI>Free CD Included</LI></UL></span>

                    <span>This is a great little book to read when you are looking for illumination by humanity's intellects and wags. Shanahan has done a good job of editing these into topical sections. My only complaint with the book is that the editor decides to include a number of his own thoughts among the "Most Brilliant". Now he is a smart man, to be sure, but it is just a little too prideful to include yourself in such a book. His first self quote appears on the very first page of quotes. What his self inclusion does do, however is illustrate the difference between the truly brialliant thoughts and those that aren't. Shanahan's editorial job is delightful, his self promotion to most brilliant embarassing for him at best.</span>

                    <span>This book is a nice companion work to Mardy Grothe's "Oxymoronica." John Shanahan has done all of the work and put together a collection of insightful perceptions, musings, and truisms (especially if one has lived long enough to appreciate them).<P>This book is meant to be read and read again -- and discussed with others to share the varied meanings and interpretations each reader will bring to the statements (e.g., Emerson's "It is impossible for a man to be cheated by anyone but himself").<P>If you are contemplative, if you like to reflect upon the keen observations of others, this one's for you!</span>
