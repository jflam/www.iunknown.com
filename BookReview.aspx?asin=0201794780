                    <span>I'm a long-time PageMaker user (from version 3) and unlike the person who wrote a most derogatory review of this book : 'they were text oriented' and did not like the pictures, I thought they really helped me learn to use the software. As they say, "a picture is worth a thousand words"... Why would one wade through oceans of text when they could look at the pictures of the various palettes and get an overall sense of what Sandee is explaining. This is an excellent book, better than The Classroom in a Book, which I abandoned after purchasing Sandee's book</span>

                    <span>After almost a year of struggling with the stupid electronic help and manual that comes with InDesign, I finally gave up and bought the InDesign 2 Visual Guide. Fantastic! Great! Best thing I ever did.<P>Instead of the vague descriptions and no-pictures in the manual, Ms. Cohen has laid out a beatufiul, step by step, explanation of every feature in InDesign.<P>Not only is everything well illustrated, but there are before and after comparisons to see just what the settings do to text, images, and pages. My favorite chapter is the one on imported graphics where you see exactly how to bring images into InDesign and apply transformations to make the images bigger, smaller, and rotated. <P>There are also real clear instructions on how to colorize a black and white photo -- something the teacher at my school said you couldn't do with InDesign. Boy, was he surprised when I showed him the steps. <P>This book is much more than just an InDesign book. It's got tons of pages with background information on all sorts of things dealing with old-time printing, typographics, color separations, and more. <P>The chapters are nicely divided into sections that deal with exactly the subjects I'm looking for. Tabs and Tables is one section, Color is another, and Automation still another. <P>And check out the gray boxes with added information. Those give tons of background stories and tips for working with InDesign as well as many other programs.<P>My only regret about this book is that I should have bought it six months ago. I know I would have been able to do much more with InDesign by now.</span>

                    <span>Maybe I'm just more of a text-o-philic person than the average designer, but I find these Visual QuickStart Guides painful to use. The pages are cluttered and difficult to browse, and I've yet to find anything I'm looking for in the index--even when it's a section I've already read and I know it's in there--so, in fact, I find this book about as useful as the on-line documentation that comes with the program--and if you've seen that, you know it's lousy.<P>Having tons of screenshots is a nice idea, but sometimes a thousand words are worth more than ten pictures, if they keep you from having to switch back and forth from text to example to text to example . . . I find myself wishing she'd just come out and _say_ how to use a feature instead of trying to _show_ me.<P>It's too bad, because I've seen Sandee Cohen speak/demo/present and I know that she knows her stuff. I wish she'd written a normal, discursive text instead of this eyesore that I can neither read straight through nor skim.<P>These seem to be very popular books, so I may be in the minority. My advice, though, is to go to a bricks-and-mortar store and leaf through it to see if the format works for you (the sample pages on this site do not show a typical instructional page, for some reason). When you're ready to buy, come back here, of course.<P>Update: Purchased Blatner & Kvern's _Real World InDesign_ and am getting much more out of it. So if you're a text-oriented person like me, you may have better luck with that book. Sorry, Sandee!</span>
