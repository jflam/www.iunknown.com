                <span id="Label1">In their 2002 bestseller, <I>Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done</I> Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan identify why people don&#146;t get results: they don&#146;t execute. Bossidy and Charan are back with another stellar study on organizational behavior that shows how companies can succeed if they return to reality and examine every part of their business. <I>Confronting Reality</I> is based on a simple concept, but many companies approach strategy and execution in a surprisingly unreal manner and even the simplest of measurement methods, like the business model, are not applied correctly. <p>  Cisco, 3M, KLM, Home Depot, and the Thomson Corporation are just a few of the companies that Bossidy and Charan examine. To demonstrate how to examine a business using the business model, Bossidy and Charan map out external variables, financial targets, internal activities, and an <I>iteration stage</I> (defined as a time to "make tradeoffs, apply and develop business savvy") to prove how a dynamically evolving business model will help improve performance. <p>  <blockquote>"The version of the business model we have developed is a robust, reality-based process for thinking about the specifics of your business in a holistic way. It shows you how to tie together the <I>financial targets</I> you must meet, the <I>external realities</I> of your business and <I>internal activities</I> such as strategy development, operating tactics, and selection and development of people."</blockquote> <p>  Larry Bossidy, retired chairman and CEO of Honeywell International and Ram Charan, author of <I>What the CEO Wants You to Know</I> and <I>Profitable Growth Is Everyone's Business</I>, have once again shed industrial-strength light on how to run a successful business. <I>--E.

                    <span>Larry & Ram lost me, and I hope most of you, with their very first example.  The new CFO, with no knowledge of the company or plant other than reading a few spreadsheets, with about 3 comments convinces the General manager to close the plant, fire everyone, desimate the town and move to China.  The coatings company described was high end, high service, specialty-focused and anything but commodity.  The workers were unusually dedicated.  They had some time.  For the GM to do anything other than allow THE WORKERS to confront reality and give them a shot at reengineering the place is a complete travesty. I've seen it work many times and I am no bleading-heart union man.  Bossidy & Charam set this up as a great example, but it is a pure, short-term, initial price analysis with NO consideration for total cost and total value.  The GM might have been able to save a business, save a town and actually win customers -- or yeah, move to China afterall.  But no one will ever know.  Larry and Ram sure don't.  Get real, guys.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent for entrepreneurs and junior managers who have bought into the myth that optimism is a foundation for success. Bossidy has a wealth of corporate management experience and offers some compelling case studies (although sometimes I wish he would have gone into more detail).  Bossidy does not explain the flaws of positive thinking, (these flaws are explained and overcome in Rosalene Glickman's best-selling book, Optimal Thinking), but he does write a practical  perspective on the power of confronting reality.  I recommend this book and Optimal Thinking to rise above mediocrity and create optimum results.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I really wanted to pan this book about half way through it as Bossidy and Charan have followed up their strong book Execution, with something less than expected. The last few chapters however pulled me back to neutral.  The difference is that this book seems more self referential and self serving that the other work.  However there are some good things in this book.
<br />
<br />First the good stuff, then if you want to read the other stuff.
<br />
<br />1) The concept of the business model is a good one and one that the book does spend some time with.  Unforutunately the case study treatements are a bit shallow and superficial.  This is a shame as the book could be longer.
<br />
<br />2) The points about how to "look around the corners" and look beyond traditional competitors is insightful and helpful 
<br />
<br />3) The commentary about enterprise change and leadership augment much of what has already been written about this subject.  Value added however.
<br />
<br />These are the good points and by themselves make this book worth reading, but not worth putting high in your reading priorities. 
<br />
<br />Now to the less satisfying parts, which by themseleves are not knockout critera, but are the reason why this is a three (really 2.5 star)rather than five star review. 
<br />
<br />The book basically uses "go to China/India" as the answer to every cost/competitive question which is a real dissapointment in terms what is says about competitivieness and the future.  Sure I am a realist, but "Go east" is sublimially placed throughout the book as the answer to all cost issues.  Seems a little too basic.
<br />
<br />The book contains a recurring homage to General Electric and people from GE.  Many of the cases are former GE people as if to imply that only people from GE are good managers/executives.  While Bossidy and Charan do include cases from outside GE the majority of examples re-enforce the GE mistique.   Not really practical advice for the rest of us who did not go to Crotonville.
<br />
<br />The book is too short by far and too light.  Confronting Reality is currently 260 some small pages in a larger than normal font.  Given that there is some fluff in here, the contents of the book are really more like a 40 page white paper than a book length treatment of a concept.  This strikes me a little like an extended offer for consulting services, than a tool for executives.
<br />
<br />Execution did not have these issues and represents a better book.  I know that many corporations bought Execution as an official corporate read for all of their executives.  I would not recommend doing the same for Confronting Reality. </span>

                    <span>For me, This book is useful. The concept shared is not that complicated, in fact, it seem fundamantal (however, often, and easily neglected). Personally, I believe business executive who are serious about building and sustaining his business should read this book. Especially during time of turbulant like this where executive can't afford to have false assumption regard thier business environment to guide thier critical decision.  
<br />
<br />From reading this book I learnt an important concept, and learnt from the illustration the authors used, i think if one "really" understand what is try to be shared by the authors, it would be very beneficial from reading it. 
<br />
<br />This book accompany with another book by same authors (Execution) - would be a very valuable reference for making daily business decision.  </span>

                    <span>Regrettably, the contents of the book do not actually live up to the title. Although the authors offer there own esoteric version of a business model, liberally illustrated with contemporary business case studies from Kmart, Dell, Wal-Mart and some others, the thesis of the book is heavy on the human aspects of confronting reality. 
<br />In some instances, like some history authors, the authors of this book seem to twist the contemporary/historical case studies in order to substantiate their thesis. Unfortunately, it appears that they have found what they were looking for and then devised the questions and thesis around that.   
<br />It is difficult to decide if this book is about execution, business or change management. I have decided that, in my humble opinion, that it is none of these. To the authors credit, they provide the friendly reminder on how to look at things in a different light; in essence lots on talking the talk, but very short on how to walk the walk.  If your thirsty for knowledge and are searching for something tangible, don't but this book; if however you are philosophically minded and want to debate the merits of the intangible elements of leadership and organizational behavior then this book may be of some interest for you.  
<br />All in all, the book is ok, it assumes a level of business understanding (or in the authors words, savvy) on the part of the reader, knows the talk, does not necessarily walk the walk and is heavy on what many might call the human elements of business.
