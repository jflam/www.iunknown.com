                    <span>I love Leonard Maltin's movie guide. I had a 1998 edition, which was probably one of the most thumbed books in my house, and finally rewarded myself to upgrading to the latest, 2003 version. What inevitably happens is this: I go to look up one film, and on the way, flicking through the pages, see another. That makes me think of a third which I then start to look for, but then I see a fourth... and before you know it, and hour has passed and I've completely forgotten which movie it was I was looking up in the first place. A very organic way of reading, and thoroughly, personally recommended as a way of passing the time waiting for your two-year old son to fall asleep! <P>This is a terrific resource: Maltin and his team of editors have a huge knowledge of the history of cinema, and the small amount of text which is afforded to each entry (by necessity - there are something like 14,000 movies reviewed - is unfailingly to the point - curt, in many cases - and gives a very good flavour of the reviewer's view of the movie.<P>The reviews, and star ratings, are very tough indeed, and in no sense does Maltin concede to public (or fashionable) opinion: if he doesn't like a film, no matter how well regarded it may be, he'll mark it down. Blade Runner, for example, gets just two stars our of four, while Memento, in my view a fantastic film and one which I've never heard a bad word said against, avoids the dreaded "BOMB" rating by just half a star. While often times you may not agree with this rating, you do have to respect Maltin's integrity.<P>There are one or two items I would mention (although, as Maltin would say, why carp?) which probably add up to imperfections, but which don't rob the book of my five stars:<P>In terms of its judgments, Maltin is guilty of the "They Don't Make Them Like They Used To" complex: there is a rather pompous introduction which says as much, and I have not been able to locate one film released since 1998 which has been awarded the full four stars. On the other hand, the top rating is liberally thrown about for films made in the forties or before: Adam's Rib: ever heard of that? Me neither. It may be true that there is a lot of commercial rubbish around now, but no more so than there ever was, and I think Maltin should be courageous enough to say at the time of release (rather than waiting for a film to pass the test of time) to pronounce a film a four star effort.<P>In much the same vein, Maltin seems to be no great fan of comedy. Having looked through all the greatest comedy films I could think of, only two have been awarded four stars, and both of those by the Marx Brothers: Duck Soup and A Night At The Opera (oh, and Adam's Rib is a comedy too, apparently). I think there is some cinema snobbery going on here. Films should be judged according to their genre, and the fact that none of Zucker & Abrahams, Monty Python, the Coen Brothers, or Rob Reiner has had any of their comedies credited as four star movies is a little telling.<P>A couple of nit-picks: I think a star system of up to five would give a little more room for flexibility in ratings, and I don't understand why TV Movies aren't subjected to the same regime (again, I think this is a little cinema snobbery: TV Movies, apparently, can only be "average", "above average" or "below average".)<P>Lastly, the indexing is pretty meagre: If you can't remember the titled of the movie, then unless it starred a major league actor, you are staring at one big haystack in which to find your needle. I guess space prevents anything more, but I would have thought an index of Directors wouldn't have hurt - or indeed a list of all four star (and BOMB) movies. In fact would be great to be able to get this book on CD-ROM so you could search on any name (or, indeed, sort by rating!)</span>

                    <span>"Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide" is still the best book of this kind on the market. It's comprehensive - 18,000+ reviews. It's focused on the kind of movies most people are interested in - it's mostly American movies, with some of the more popular and interesting Foreign films thrown in. It's concise - the reviews are brief (As they have to be in this kind of mammoth tome). And it gives you the information you require - advice on a film's content: sex, violence, nudity, etc.<P>The 2004 edition is pretty much the same as the other editions, only updated to include more recent films of interest. But it retains its biggest strength, which is to not join in with the over-inflated "Let's say everything's great!" approach to criticism.<P>Maltin and his reviewers have the same high expectations as a good portion of their readership. If a film isn't up to scratch, they aren't afraid to say so because it may upset the money men in Hollywood. If a film is merely mediocre, this book will tell you it's only mediocre.<P>It's hard to agree with everything in here. Some films you love will be trashed, other films you thought sucked will be admired. But that's part of the interest here; seeing how different the perceptions can be.<P>This is informed without being intimidating, solid and huge. A must have for the serious or casual movie fan.</span>

                    <span>I sometimes cycle through this guide for a laugh. Maltin is a horrible film critic and a total historian - basically meaning that any film predating 1960 MUST be given 4/4 (unless it's really mediocre which, according to him, is rare). However he didn't hesitate to give BATMAN AND ROBIN 2.5/4 and TAXI DRIVER 2/4.<P>He also gave THE BLADE MASTER, one of the worst films ever created, 0.5/4, yet he's given some truly decent films "turkeys."<P>I'd rather read a video guide by Ebert because unlike Maltin, Ebert doesn't judge different films of different genres of various years against each other. He's pretty fair. Maltin is not.</span>

                    <span>Leonard Maltin, unfortunately, is apparently held in high esteem by the DVD makers. His inane commentaries have shown up on everything from Disney's Donald Duck DVD's to the Little Rascals DVD's to the Marx Brothers' DVD's. Unfortunately, he is the type of guy that is an apologist for any cultural references resulting from a certain era in cinema. The kind of guy that has to be PC about everything.<P>On the same side of the coin, as shown in his video guides...he praises some of the inane tripe currently coming out of Hollywood, while bashing some of the classics of earlier years....probably because they aren't PC enough.<P>His book is filled with comments that show his real lack of perspective on history. And not only is he not a good historian, he needs some help with alphabetizing the movies, as well. What a pain trying to locate a movie using his system ["often" comes after "of a", but before "of the"].<P>He picks and chooses the actors he lists in his index...and some strange choices there are. <P>And, additionally....while he lists what is available on DVD...he DOESN'T indicate screen ratios, OAR's, pan & scans, etc, making the indicator rather useless for the TRUE movie fan.<P>My recommendation....stick with Martin/Porter or Moviehound. While you may not always agree with them, their comments aren't near as insipid and PC, and you'll be able to actually find a movie without having to interpret a hole new way of alphabetizing.</span>

                    <span>I have relied on Leonard Maltin's Movie Guides for many years. The 2004 Edition is the most complete source of honest movie reviews you can find. The new 2005 volume should be out around September. Each year Maltin adds hundreds of new reviews. I'm a AMC buff, but I appreciate the latest reviews as well, and they're always in time for the new video releases. As a reference book for movie fans, this is THE BIBLE!*****</span>
