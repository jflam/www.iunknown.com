                <span id="Label1">Most of us have sat across the tray from a waitress, but how many of us know what really is going on from her side? Hey, Waitress! aims to tell us. Containing lively, personal portraits of waitresses from many different walks of life, this book is the first of its kind to show the intimate, illuminating, and often shocking behind-the-scenes stories of waitresses' daily shifts and daily lives. Alison Owings traveled the country-from border to border and coast to coast-to hear firsthand what waitresses think about their lives, their work, and their world. Part journalism and part oral history, Hey, Waitress! introduces an eclectic cast of characters: a ninety-five-year-old Baltimore woman who may have been the oldest living waitress, a Staten Island firebrand laboring at a Pizza Hut, a well-to-do runaway housewife, a Native American proud of her financial independence, a college student loving her diner more than her studies, a Cajun grandmother of twenty-two, and many others. The book also offers vivid slices of American history. The stories describe the famous sit-in at the Woolworth's counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, which helped spark the civil rights movement; early struggles for waitress unions; and battles against sexually discriminatory hiring in restaurants. A superb and accessible means of breaking down stereotypes, this book reveals American waitresses in all their complexity and individuality, and will surely change the way we order, tip, and, most of all, behave in restaurants.

                    <span>I confess, I skipped the short history of waitressing at the start of the book to go straight to the interviews. These stories are fascinating.<P>This could have been a depressing expose about the low pay and poor conditions inherent in waiting. But Owings evidently has quite an admiration for waitresses, and she manages to bring out the pride these women have for their work. Even waitresses who hate the job are proud of some aspect of what they do.<P>The diversity of waitresses interviewed was impressive: from truckstops to Chez Panisse, from Alaska to Louisiana, from the Forties to the Millennium, from poor waitresses to not-so-poor (there are no rich waitresses), from high school dropouts to PhDs.<P>This is a wonderful book to include with Nickel and Dimed and Waiting by Ginsburg.</span>

                    <span>This thought provoking book was an eye opener for me. Similar to Nickel and Dimed - which I loved - it brings you into the lives of a hardworking segment of our workforce that is often overlooked and underappreciated. I had no idea of the physical, mental, and emotional challenges waitresses face (often with grace and humility) on a daily basis at diners and four-star restaurants alike. Reading the stories of these women - some sad, some funny, all interesting and compelling - forever changed the way I look at and treat waitresses. I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in deepening their understanding of the lives of people we see everyday but might not otherwise have a chance to know.</span>

                    <span>I had to force myself to get past the author's introduction, I have a strong negative bias toward feminist manifestos, but once Ms. Owings was finished with her political ranting she introduced me to a pretty interesting group of waitresses. Some are positive, some negative, some hate their job, some love it, and each story is interesting and unique. <P>The concise biographical sketches average about five pages each and the women frankly describe their experiences and their lives. Single moms, married women, waitresses in diners, franchises, and fancy high class restaurants talk about cooks grabbing, customers grunting and owners screaming. A few might fit the "waitress" stereotype but they are all very different people from different backgrounds and the author does an excellent job describing them and their circumstances as well as their pressures on the job. Some waitressed short term, others are "lifers" with up to 50 years of experience. Most of the women are likeable and some are downright heroic. They all describe a job with similar pressures, and how they try to deal with them. Even the cloistered nun who served the other nuns at mealtime had to deal with stresses unique to serving food to others. <P>Since the vignettes are a few pages each the book is easy to pick up and put down, it is not necessary to set aside a block of reading time. I enjoyed it more than I expected, it may not be great literature but the frankness and intimacy of their stories has a compelling power. It's worth a few hours to meet these ladies.</span>
