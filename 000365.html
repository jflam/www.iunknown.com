<h3 class="title">I am intrigued by ObjectSpaces</h3>

<p>Andy Hopper, who I've talked to many times about code generation, seems to be <a href="http://hoppersoft.com/Andy/PermaLink.aspx?guid=08a97ed0-415c-4413-b149-b63abcedd21f">enamored with ObjectSpaces</a>. Andy claims (and I have no reason to disbelieve him) that it eliminates the need to code-gen object-relational mapping layers. This is very interesting to me, since it removes some of the low-hanging fruit from <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000153.html">code generation motivation</a>.</p>

<p>It's time for me to dig into ObjectSpaces. I've been spending most of my Whidbey time on MSBuild, but now it's time to check out something new. More on this soon.</p>

<p>ObjectSpaces is the MS datagrid of O/R mapping.</p>

<p>Crude and feature limited.</p>

<p>Still a lot of people will end up using it, not realizing how much they miss.</p>

<p>OK, Thomas I'll bite :) What features are missing in ObjectSpaces that you would like to see? What's there that makes it suck?</p>

<p>From my limited exposure, I can see how it can simplify my code generation scripts somwehat. But I still like using code gen to create the other artifacts that I will need (SQL database schema, sprocs, entity class declarations etc.)<br />

<p>I'm afraid I don't consider Thomas to be an impartial observer, here. He has a commercial product known as EntityBroker, so I expect him to tell you in his own inimitable way that any O/R mapping tool other than his sucks.<br />
Does ObjectSpaces have limitations? Yep. It doesn't create your data objects - you instead need to write them yourself or write a framework that does create them, and it doesn't natively support creating the database schema. It's not as fast as a codegenned O/R layer (they anticipate it to be roughly 40% slower). There are other issues I can see, but this comment's getting too long as it is.<br />
I saw some extremely interesting things at the PDC that make OS more attractive. On Longhorn (yes, unfortunately only Longhorn), you will be able to use the classes in the System.Search namespace to create OPath queries from plain text requests. Imagine a doctor typing "Show me all of the encounters I had with John Lam over the last year."<br />
I see an opportunity for a company to build a tool to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>Thomas: You might consider to stop posting anything otherwise then positive. I seem to be just as interested as you in code-gen/or-mapping sollutions but you tend to pass the negative vibe around the web. C'mon you should know better then dishing other peoples work.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear your comments on ObjectsSpaces John.</p>
