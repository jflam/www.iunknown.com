                <span id="Label1">Over the course of 15 hours on four double-sided DVDs, <I>Chicago Bulls: The 1990s</I> documents the Bulls' incredible run of six NBA championships in eight years led by the game's greatest-ever player, Michael Jordan.  Like the earlier DVD release <I>Ultimate Jordan</I>, it collects a number of programs originally released on VHS, in this case the yearly highlight videos that summarized each of the six championship seasons, plus a five-minute introduction that covers the franchise starting in the 1960s and ending with its drafting of Jordan.  <p>  Where the NBA Dynasty series (the other initial entry is the slightly meatier <I>Los Angeles Lakers: The Complete History</I>) outdoes <I>Ultimate Jordan</I> is in the six playoff games--one for each year--as they were originally broadcast, minus halftime and commercials.  Having the nearly complete game (usually running 90-100 minutes, from the TV introductions to post-game interviews) means you can skip straight to John Paxson's clutch basket or what was expected to be the final shot of Jordan's career.  Or you can savor each game in its entirety, all the better to appreciate the artistry of Jordan in his three-pointer barrage against Portland or his "flu game" against Utah.  You can see other great players too, of course, including Jordan's teammates--Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant, Dennis Rodman--and those opponents unfortunate enough to face the Bulls--Clyde Drexler, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Karl Malone, and others.  Because these are all NBA Finals games, you won't see Jordan's shot over Craig Ehlo or his 63-point coming-out party against Boston, but the 1990s Chicago Bulls were a team for the ages, and merely having their games--some of them all-time classics--available for home viewing is a major milestone in archived sports. <I>--David Horiuchi</I></span>

                    <span>From Learning to Fly 1990-91 Season to the Swan-song Unforgettables, this DVD collection hits the spot. What people fail to realize is how much blood, sweat and tears went into this 6 Title - 8 year period of dominance. Given the ME FIRST, GOTTA GET MINES ATTITUDE of most Generation X-ers, we may never see anything like it again.
<br />
<br />I love the way the last season recap went. The Narrator let those last 41.9 seconds speak for themselves. That he did so only added to Michael Jordan's aura. I still get chills watching that segment; then I try to forget those years he spent in DC, which reminded me of Wille Mays stumbling while losing fly balls in the 1973 Oakland sun. 
<br />
<br />That first championship was special as well. The psychological hold Detroit had over them was something;it forged their championship resolve. 
<br />
<br />The games speak for themselves. Jordan leading the way, Pippen, Rodman, Kerr, Paxson, Kukoc, Harper, Cartwright, Horace, BJ, Judd Bucheler (?) playing excellent supporting roles; Jackson, Tex and Bach at the commands... Pretty nice time indeed for the Second City.

                    <span>But the Bulls were led by the most bloodthristy, unrelenting, and dominating competitor in all of sports.  If MJ was born in a different era, he would have been Alexander the Great, Napoleon (pre-Elba and Waterloo), or Genghis Khan.  He was hated because nobody could beat him, not when he was minutes from dying of dehydration and exhaustion (1997 Game 5), not when he had 12 pieces of dead weight on his 35 year old shoulders (1998 Game 6), not when "God" wanted the Phoenix Suns to win (1993).  He could care less about what "God" wanted; he was a divine force with a demonic drive to win.  Even Larry Legend admitted that something divine flowed through the veins of Jordan.  <p>Face it Celtics and Lakers fans, if it ever came down to the Celtics and MJ (his 63 on the Celts in '86 would have been enough if his supporting cast added rather than subtracted from his overpowering performance), MJ would tear Bird apart and leave him whimpering for the friendly confines of his backyard in French Lick.  Magic and MJ, 1991 pretty much proved that MJ is just a notch above Magic (with all respects due to Earvin).  Earvin was blessed with a pack of HOFers or near HOFers, while MJ had an glorified solid defender by the name of Pippen, and a bunch of below mediocre blokes who he elevated to the levels they had no right of even approaching.  If Jordan is not the greatest player, then he was the most unforgiving SOBs on the court.  He was a killer, a closer, and a champion.  And put him on a compotent team with a "hands off coach" like Phil Jackson; 6 titles, 6 playoff MVPs, and much love and respect (and deservedly so).<p>P.S. - This is a great DVD set, that features 3 of the greatest single game performances by MJ playoffs or regular season (namely Game 1 in 1992, Game 5 in '97 and the ultimate capper (or what should have been the finale) Game 6 in '98.  This is a great idea by the NBA.  They should come with DVD sets that include something like the 10 best games from each playoff year...some maybe slimmer pickings than others...but its an idea.</span>

                    <span>Haven't seen the whole set yet - but there's no question that it's a MUST HAVE for EVERY CHICAGO FAN - so we can remember the last time one of OUR teams won the whole enchilada. We all were a little happier back then - I planned my life around the Bulls' games - not wanting to miss ANY of it -  Chicago fans KNOW the good stuff never lasts.  I hope Bob Costas' best comment EVER is on this set:  At the start of Game Three against the Jazz: "There's Karl Malone. In Game Two, he scored only two points more than a dead man."</span>

                    <span>It just never gets old watching what had to be the greatest dynasty ever.  Sorry Boston, but you just didn't face the same competition in your heyday.  Watching game 6 of the '96 series I found myself cheering just as if it were happening live.  My only complaint with this set is with all the editing technology that's available, why could they not delete ALL of Bill Walton's commentary?  If I have to listen to him make comparisons to Elvin Hayes, Kevin McHale, or anyone else that hasn't played ball since high tops were invented I'm gonna have to mute this.  His bias is pathetic.</span>

                    <span>Magic on the break, Worthy fills the lane, Magic to Worthy... here comes MJ... and Worthy takes it over MJ for the jam!  Facial!....  Half-court set, Magic at point.  Back door Coop-a-loop -- over both MJ and Pippen!  In their face!!  That's what time it is, baby!  The Bulls will never be in the same class as the Lakers in their prime.  But second best is not too shabby, and the Bulls deserve their props.  Just get the Lakers DVDs first.  And if a Celtics Dynasty DVD set was available, I'd get that just to see more Lakers games.  But no Celts, so the Bulls must suffice.  So, this is good stuff.  Excellent team, footage, packaging and layout cannot be beat.  One thing I'd change; the Bulls disc has 1991 NBA Finals Game 5.  I'd prefer to see game 2; where the Bulls, after losing game 1, started to pull away... and MJ did the "I'm gonna dunk, no, think I'll lay it up" move, and looked at the Laker bench like "whassup?!" as he ran back for defense.  At that exact moment, all was crystal clear:  The Bulls had turned it on and pulled ahead in the game, they would win the series (you could see it), and the Lakers were eclipsed -- quite easily, once the Bulls changed gears.  So, game 2 was the changing of the guard.  Otherwise, great DVD set.  But get the Lakers first, and see the greatest team ever!!!  (And good ownership and management too :-)!!!)... And better looking cheerleaders and crowd....  Besides all that, full props to Da Bulls!</span>
