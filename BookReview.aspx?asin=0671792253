                <span id="Label1"><P> In <I>Class</I> Paul Fussell explodes the sacred American myth of social equality with eagle-eyed irreverence and iconoclastic wit. This bestselling, superbly researched, exquisitely observed guide to the signs, symbols, and customs of the American class system is always outrageously on the mark as Fussell shows us how our status is revealed by everything we do, say, and own. He describes the houses, objects, artifacts, speech, clothing styles, and intellectual proclivities of American classes from the top to the bottom and everybody -- you'll surely recognize yourself -- in between. <I>Class</I> is guaranteed to amuse and infuriate, whether your class is so high it's out of sight (literally) or you are, alas, a sinking victim of prole drift.</span>

                    <span>I first read "Class" in the mid 1980's, and the book remains memorable because of Paul Fussell's incisive, but often mean spirited wit. Fussell writes from the stereotypical Anglophilic perspective of a northeastern snob conditioned to denigrate ethnics, upward strivers, and technology. I believe that Fussell's 1983 book now seems dated, particularly since it has become evident that the old Anglo Saxon elite has been largely replaced by a meritocracy. In his chapter on higher education, Fussell emphasizes that upper middle class students tend to go to the good colleges, while proles and middles get relegated to dopey schools plagued by verbal inflation. While Fussell laments the emergence of many bad schools after World War II, he doesn't mention that during the 1950's and the 1960's, the ivies and near ivies focused more on recruiting kids who were smart, rather than merely rich. As a result, many students from prole and middle class backgrounds who happened to be highly intelligent (and often non-Anglo Saxon) acquired the cultural capital associated with the upper middle class. These new upward strivers who understood the cultural forms of both the upper and lower orders could not be dismissed as shallow arrivistes who lamely mimicked the elite. Rather, their rigorous educations combined with their experience of ethnic, working class cultures gave them a unique, energetic perspective, which they brought to the professions. Fussell's final chapter on the "X people"-- those who choose more "bohemian" paths-- seems more like an afterthought to his more dominant exurban, northeastern, and hopelessly preppy point of view. On the one hand, Fussell ultimately claims that the boundaries of class are escapable through creativity, nonconformity, and artistic achievement, yet for most of the book he makes a case for the superiority of WASP culture. Fussell's lack of awareness of this paradox is the book's major weakness, since, given his main argument, it seems unlikely that one could both support a rigid class system and reject it.<P> In the more recent "Bobos in Paradise" (2000), David Brooks argues that the new meritocratic elite has, in fact, synthesized a bourgeois sensibility with a bohemian one. Some readers may find the term "bourgeois bohemian" a troublesome oxymoron, especially if they believe that bourgeois capitalism and bohemian intellectualism simply don't mix. While time and space prevent a discussion of this valid point, Brooks makes a strong case that the meritocrats have appropriated the cultural perspective of bohemians or "X" people, as they also earn high salaries in bourgeois professions. "Bobos in Paradise" presents a more contemporary analysis of upper middle class tastes and values than Paul Fussell's "Class." Nonetheless, "Class" remains interesting and entertaining because of its exposure of a dying breed's social biases.</span>

                    <span>Having read several of Fussell's other books, I wondered why this is the only one that is entertaining (the man is both a misanthrope and a bit of a whiner). Then I stumbled upon "Class" by Jilly Cooper, which provides a highly amusing view of the British class system, and realized that Fussell had modeled his book on hers.<P>That's not to say that it's a rip-off. In fact, Fussell's genius lies in his having recognized a great concept and modified it for the American market. Additionally, he specifically credits Cooper at several points in his book.<P>Having grown up in a middle-class family in Pomona, California, Fussell does not have an intuitive understanding of Northeastern snobbery, which may account for some of the weaknesses in this book. Far better in that regard are "Old Money" by Nelson Aldrich or several books on the subject by Lewis Lapham, both of whom grew up in wealthy families.<P>Perhaps the greatest weakness in the book is Fussell's description of Class X as the ideal class. The people he describes so favorably, including himself, appear to be little more than Aging Hippies, frozen in time.</span>

                    <span>Class is a studied, hilarious, yet tongue-in-cheek dissection of the American social class system. It exposes such fundamentally American (and hence, germane) misconceptions on class as the truistic acceptance of class as a purely economical distinction (for the 2 lower classes, anyway). <P>Using an 8 or 9-class structure (by my count), Fussell spares no target from incisive scrutiny. The middle class with its safe, boring, and envious ways is Fussell's central target, but in the course of his attack, he takes working class slobs and upper class snobs prisoner as well. <P>While very funny, readable, and entertaining (check out the illustrations!), Class does, contrary to some overzealous reviewers' desire to bestow overarching approval on the book, feel a bit dated for a younger generation of readers. Although many of its keen observations will stand the test of time, an updated edition, as in any great textbook, is warranted.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book in my mid-20s -- after surviving college and my first few experiments with employment -- I felt as though I had stumbled upon a Rosetta stone of sorts: a complete schema of the underlying language of American society. <P>Fussell's meticulous, razor-sharp, and frequently hilarious dissection of American class distinctions (and the tortured ways in which we all struggle with those distinctions) brought into focus what had previously been -- to my eyes -- a hidden language, or, perhaps, an invisible hierarchy.<P>Although slightly dated in its references, I can't recommend this book more highly. <P>Remember when you were a kid, how crazy the adult world seemed? How myopic and insane grown-ups were? How strange and inpenetrable their customs and culture? Did you ever wish someone would just sit down and explain to you what the heck was going on?<P>Here's a book that explains it all -- with insight, humor, and an acid-tipped sense of irony.<P>Fussell is no snob -- if anything, he skewers the upper classes as gleefully as he mocks the lumpen bourgeoisie. He also provides an escape hatch from the claustrophobic world of status accumulation -- his newly minted X-Class (the inspiration, btw, for Douglas Coupland's Generation X).<P>Very few books change the way you see the world, or, perhaps, allow you to see the world more clearly. This -- for me -- was one.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The greatest irony of this admittedly meanspirited but smart little satirical study might seem initially that, in the intervening twenty years since it was published, it has become literally a social climbing guide for status-seeking readers. Many upper-class aspirants still religiously look to it to learn how, for example, to have their suits tailored (no "prole gap" between jacket and neck!) or decorate their living rooms.<P>But perhaps this irony isn't so great after all. Despite the often brilliant (although now dated) observations Fussell makes, the loathing he feels for the middle classes and mockery he shows towards the "proles" really isn't balanced by any similar feelings for the upper classes, or for what Fussell designates as his own class ("class X"). Just as he describes the wealthiest of the wealthy as "out of sight," so is any pointed satire aimed towards them. Worst of all, his argument (like Freudian psychoanalysis or Marxism) is neatly unfalsifiable: any criticism you might make of his argument is neatly explained away on his terms as symptomatic of your own class insecurity, which functions as a kind of false consciousness. It's an exceptionally intelligent book, but too mean-spirited and blind to its own prejudices ultimately to be as trenchant as it means to be.</span>
