                    <span>The good
<br />1. This book has a coding style that is very reminiscient of some code one might find in UNIX books(perl, etc).  If you are transitioning, this might be a help.  I am not sure.  I am not a big Unix programmer.
<br />2. Many things are discussed in this book that are not discussed in other texts.  This book has a good focus on console code which is nice for a beginner.  Windows programming is not hard but like motif or tk, a solid understanding of the basics is good before delving into heavy UI programming.  
<br />
<br />The bad
<br />
<br />1. The code examples are extremely buggy and littered with potential buffer overflows and other mistakes which often make this seem like a guide on how not to program(especially in our security conscious society).
<br />2. The code examples are often efficient but rarely self-documenting.  Efficieny is usually best gained by better algorithms and gaining efficiency by tricks which make code harder to read should be left to after profiling the code and finding the bottlenecks.  Furthermore, things like synchronous I/O are the focus of these over optimizations (especially for a beginners book).  I/O programs are rarely CPU dependent and rarely gain benefits from brute force logical optimizations.  This is not the Zen of Assembly language and TINSTAFC (There Is no such thing as the fastest code) are not necessary here.  Books like Writing Solid Code by Steve McConnel should be required reading for any programmer.
<br />
<br />Both 1 and 2 do get better as the book progresses but be aware that the code is designed in ways that make buffer overflows likely.
<br />
<br />3. This book should not be called Windows System Programming.  The title is misleading and you will not find in depth kernel programming here.  Microsoft Windows Internals is much much better here(though it is by no means an introductory book).  System programming is often taken to mean internals programming.
<br />4. Most windows programs do not look like the code here.  Unfortunately, console programming is vastly different from programming using the standard Windows interface.  It is different on unix toolkits like XWindows or TK too.  I am not sure just focusing on console development is where a beginner should go.
<br />
<br />I am still reading and will probably update my comments later but so far this is what I see.</span>

                    <span>As a veteran UNIX developer I recently picked up this book to help me with a new Windows assignment at work.  In a matter of hours I had a working prototype that involved services, thread synchronization, and named pipes.  The organization, clarity of description, and comprehensive index helped me do my job quickly.  I can confidently say that I can handle most system-level programming projects with this book on my desk.</span>

                    <span>So much of this book has the flavour of unix systems programming. Part of the reason is the presentation. Hart has deliberately pitched his book towards programmers experienced in unix. But the bulk of the material is inherently not too dissimilar anyway.
<br />
<br />The code examples are in C, as they usually are in unix. Plus, the book stays away from user interface issues, where there seems to be greater divergence between Microsoft and unix.
<br />
<br />The discussion of network programming may have the greatest overlap with its unix counterpart, out of all the book's sections. Mostly because both use TCP/IP, so optimal designs tend to converge. Those of you used to Berkeley Sockets are shown an easy port to Win Sockets. Very little rewriting or relearning here.
<br />
<br />All this in the book is good news for you, if you come from unix programming. It means your skills are very transferable.</span>

                    <span>I had never programmed using the Win API (apart from the odd Visual Basic API call) before. I do, however, know C & C++ pretty well inside out.
<br />
<br />The book is well written and very readable. There are plenty of examples in the book, and they are supported by a downloadable ZIP file that contains the actual code that you can simply compile & run. The only criticism I have about the examples is that they could be a little better explained. Some things are left to the reader to sort out. However, if you already know C or C++ this should not be too difficult
<br />
<br />This is not a book for C & C++ beginners. It is bang up to date & covers all versions of the API from the earliest versions of Windows to the latest versions, even referring to the emerging Win64 technology.
<br />
<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to go beyond standard C / C++ or even go beyond MFC. It would also be useful to anyone who needs to know what goes on 'behind the scenes' in Windows or MFC. </span>

                    <span>The author does a wonderful job in explaining the fundamentals of windows systems programming. His writing style is clear and concise. This doesn't mean that he glosses over the details however, he makes a good attempt at highlighting tricky or confusing areas in the API and makes sure the reader knows what to watch out for. I reccomend this book for those wanting a good overview of the Win32/64 API. It take to notice that this book does not cover GUI in anyway. </span>
