                    <span>Having read quite a few Feng Shui books this is by far the best and easiest to understand. I read the book in two days and started to enchance my house,desk and car right away. Very practical and you don't have to "buy" anything. Most items are in your possession already. I hope Karen is writing another book soon. I loved her light and funny manner of writing, instead of all the historical and technical terms most other authors use. Great Book!! I loved it!!! I'm reading it for a second time.</span>

                    <span>I have over 2 dozen books on feng shui, and they all left me confused and frustrated. Which feng shui system should I use? Where the heck is my prosperity corner? Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life knocks all the other feng shui books off my book shelves. The others try to be mystical, philosophical, and pay homage to their feng shui masters. Move Your Stuff just gets down to business with a lot of humor, and a lot of great information (that I did not find in the other so-called expert feng shui books.) I admit I had lots of accumulated clutter to clear before I could think about arranging my work and living quarters for optimum prosperity and well being. However, it was easy once I read each chapter as outlined for each of the segments of feng shui (fame and reputation, prosperity, love and marriage, etc.) One of the best things in the book is that Karen explains how to determine if there is a problem, and what you need to do to resolve it. She makes it clear - fixes are not just physical - they are mental and emotional, too. You must be clear in your intent to improve your life and take the necessary steps yourself. No one can take action for you. But Move Your Stuff can sure give you great guidelines for making positive energy flow in your life again. Try it. I promise your energy will increase and your circumstances will improve as you take feng shui actions to improve your life.</span>

                    <span>Whether you're an advocate of feng shui or not, this is a fun book that provides ample inspiration and ideas to reorganize and redecorate your home or office. I use this book and gave copies to my kids. If you need a quick jump-start when your surroundings are ho-hum or disorganized with clutter, this is the best book that you can read to get unstuck. Don't trust the library to have it when you need it on a rainy, gotta-clean-this-messy-apartment kind of day; get your own copy. You'll refer to it often and, if it works for you as it has for my friends and family, it'll pay for itself in one use.</span>

                    <span>People are used to my wacky stories about my family, but my new favorite wacky stories are about Feng Shui. <P>I read this book with much skepticism....but thought, "Hey, it can't hurt, right?" A few years ago, a Feng Shui practicing friend of mine asked me if I closed the toilet lid when I flushed...I said, "Sometimes, but not always...." and she replied, "You're FLUSHING away your wealth!" I had a good laugh, but decided to try it. I began religiously to put the toilet seat down...and got an unexpected check in the mail from the IRS that year. Let me just say that has never happened before or since. <P>I decided to bone up on Feng Shui and did a Bagua map of my home and saw that my wealth area was my back bedroom which was in maxed out disarray due to a flooding problem which had recently been fixed. I took a week off from work and totally remodeled the room....even put new furniture in....and my husband got a nice raise! I know, it sounds crazy... but I think, in part, having an orderly home free of clutter destresses you and helps you become more peaceful and therefore more productive and happy. <P>This was a great book. I can't comment on the love part as I've been married forever (but still love him), but I'm sure it can't hurt to try either! I highly recommend this book, if for no other reason, to get your home decluttered and more organized.</span>
