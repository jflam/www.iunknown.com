                <span id="Label1">Newton's Telecom Dictionary helps technology and business professionals stay on top of the ever-changing network, telecom, and IT industry. The tech industry hype has cooled dramatically, but nonetheless new telecom and networking technology and services continue to be adopted at a rapid pace, and new terms and acronyms sprout just as quickly. Industry guru Harry Newton explains technical concepts in non-technical language that anyone in business can understand, making it an essential reference tool for anyone involved with telecom and IT systems and services.</span>

                    <span>Harry Newton is now on the 18th Edition of his renowned dictionary. Having worked in the telecommunications industry for 4 years, I can vouch for how valuable this reference has been for me. <P>Newton covers all the acronyms, standard terms, slang, etc. that anyone would ever be exposed to in the telecommunications world. These are not just standard definitions. Newton goes in depth for those terms that require extensive explanation. The definition for "Frame Relay" is approximately a page and a half. Even more impressive, you come away with a solid, basic understanding of Frame Relay.<P>What separates Newton's from other efforts is the extensive nature of the work, and the humorous approach to writing many of the definitions. For example, Newton's definition for "Intelligent Phone" starts off with "When the Bell operating companies get bored they occasionally fantasize about applications for the networks they provide." Believe me, if you have ever had to work with a Bell operating company (Southwestern Bell, Bell South, etc.) you'll get a lot of laughs from this kind of stuff.</span>

This book was very helpful in explaining new words and phrases, especially since the telecommunications industry is full of strange acronyms.
