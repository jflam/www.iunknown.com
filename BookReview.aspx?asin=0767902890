                <span id="Label1"><I>"They carried all the emotional baggage of men who might die. Grief, terror, love, longing--these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. They carried shameful memories. They carried the common secret of cowardice.... Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to."</I><p>  A finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, <I>The Things They Carried</I> marks a subtle but definitive line of demarcation between Tim O'Brien's earlier works about Vietnam, the memoir <I>If I Die in a Combat  Zone</I> and the fictional  <I>Going After Cacciato</I>, and this sly, almost hallucinatory book that is neither memoir nor novel nor collection of short stories but rather an artful combination of all three. Vietnam is still O'Brien's theme, but in this book he seems less interested in the war itself than in the myriad different perspectives from which he depicts it. Whereas <I>Going After Cacciato</I> played with reality, <I>The Things They Carried</I> plays with truth. The narrator of most of these stories is "Tim"; yet O'Brien freely admits that many of the events he chronicles in this collection never really happened. He never killed a man as "Tim" does in "The Man I Killed," and unlike Tim in "Ambush," he has no daughter named Kathleen. But just because a thing never happened doesn't make it any less true. In "On the Rainy River," the character Tim O'Brien responds to his draft notice by driving north, to the Canadian border where he spends six days in a deserted lodge in the company of an old man named Elroy while he wrestles with the choice between dodging the draft or going to war. The real Tim O'Brien never drove north, never found himself in a fishing boat 20 yards off the Canadian shore with a decision to make. The real Tim O'Brien quietly boarded the bus to Sioux Falls and was inducted into the United States Army. But the truth of "On the Rainy River" lies not in facts but in the genuineness of the experience it depicts: both Tims went to a war they didn't believe in; both considered themselves cowards for doing so. Every story in <I>The Things They Carried</I> speaks another truth that Tim O'Brien learned in Vietnam; it is this blurred line between truth and reality, fact and fiction, that makes his book unforgettable. <I>--Alix  Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>They carried canteens, pictures, machine guns, love letters, mine detectors. But most importantly, they carried each other. The soldiers who fought in the Vietnam war that were lucky enough to make it home alive would struggle with the memories they carried as well. Tim O'Brien illustrates his cathartic re-entry into the jungles of Vietnam in this captivating -- indeed poignant -- collection of memories.<p>Many question whether "Things..." is a novel, considering the choppy, often non-chronological nature of the short stories which O'Brien tells. As the title page says, it is a work of fiction, but the book itself defies all categorization. Each chapter is a separate and individual memory that is so well written, it could successfully serve as a short story on its own. Together, however, they deliver an impact unlike any book I've ever read.<p>"Things..." made me question my hold on reality. It made me question my motives in life, my enemies, my friends, and the way I perceive the world in general. I have never been so moved by a book. I cried, I cringed in horror, I sat dumbfounded and slack-jawed, glued to each page. I read the book in one sitting.<p>If I were stranded on a desert island, as the hypothetical question begins, this is the one book I would take with me. It is not only about the Vietnam war, it is about life, about men who fight and die for love and out of innocence. It is about the enemy, or more importantly, the idea of the enemy. It is about friendship. It is about the loss of innocence. And it is about the innocence that may be recaptured through the retelling of stories. It is about the things we carry. A must-read book! But try it for yourself. Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition," an engaging, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.</span>

                    <span>The Things They Carried is a book which you will want to read more than once. Tim O'Brien captures the emotion he experienced in the Vietnam War, and he makes the reader feel them as well by telling stories which are "truer than the truth." You don't just read the stories of those who experienced Vietnam, you feel them, almost live them. This is what makes this book so addicting.
<br />
<br />Of course, by setting the book in the Vietnam War, O'Brien guarantees eliciting an emotional response. Added to this, in his original writing style he masterfully combines the past and present, reality and exaggeration, sadness and laughter. Armed with this unique style, The Things They Carried is truly a novelistic masterpiece. O'Brien leaves no stone unturned as he shares the experiences of a platoon in Vietnam. You share with them the sadness of lost friends, the uncomfortable feeling of killing a human being, and the regret many feel when they return home. From a girlfriend in culottes smuggled into Vietnam from the U.S, to "The Man I Killed," to a baby water buffalo which the men brutally take out their frustration on, these men's most personal experiences become yours as well. 
<br />
<br />When I had an assignment to re-read a book for English class, I immediately thought of this book. The characters, the stories, and the lessons you learn while reading makes this a memorable book which you will find addicting.

                    <span>	"The Things They Carried", by Tim O'Brien, is a book that you will pull off that old dusty shelf for years to come and anxiously read through every page again.  One of the most emotional books of the Vietnam era, the stories will tug at the strings of your heart.  You fall into believing you are part of the story, step by step, laugh by laugh, and death by death.  You experience all of the same pains and fears of war that soldiers on the frontline suffer.
<br />
<br />     The stylistic approach to how O'Brien wrote the book is something that we do not often see in today's literature.  His writing style puts is in Vietnam, it puts us there with the solders as they tell their tales.  O'Brien retells war stories, and adds in additional stories from post-war situations, that end up covering more than 30 years of his life, along with only some lasting memories of others in his platoon.  As a second read, I caught even more detail and was amazed by how O'Brien at one point in the book, have you laughing with the soldiers as they prank others, and a split second later, bombs were exploding and people were screaming. 
<br />
<br />     A truly brilliant novel that changes the way you will read books for the rest of your life.  This Vietnam war narrative will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you with a heartfelt message in the end.

                    <span>This undoubtedly has to be the most shocking and blunt novel that I have ever read. O' Brien explores the side of war that most would rather leave untouched...the side that is beneath the surface of glory and honor for one's country. O'Brien depicts the harsh realities, the stark veracities of a soldier's war life. 
<br />
<br />The reader is continually impressed and intrigued by the occurrences of the Vietnam War. The novel is not to be read by the feeble and weak-stomached. </span>
