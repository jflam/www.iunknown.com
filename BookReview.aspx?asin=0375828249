                <span id="Label1">When teenagers Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow lead their people up out of the Earth, fleeing their dying underground city of Ember, everything is new and a little frightening to the refugees--the sun and the moon, birds, trees, fire&#133;and the people of Ember are strange to the 322 citizens of Sparks, one of the few towns on Earth to survive the time of The Disaster. How can they feed and house the 400 Emberites, the leaders of Sparks wonder, when they have just begun to be able to feed themselves comfortably? But if they don&#146;t, these underground people with no survival skills will surely die in the wastelands. They take them in as best they can, but grumbling and bad feeling grows on both sides. Lina returns from a failed search for her persistent vision of a city of light to find the town, egged on by the power-hungry young thug Tick, once again at the point of war, forgetting how the Earth has been destroyed before. But Lina has seen the devastation left by The Disaster, and so she risks a brave move of reconciliation, and when Doon exposes Tick&#146;s trickery, the two sides join as the new people of Sparks.<p>  In this exciting and solidly constructed sequel to <I>The City of Ember</I>, Jeanne DuPrau moves the story on entrancingly, bringing along her cast of characters from underground and adding new dimensions and relationships as the action escalates to a satisfying conclusion that still allows for further volumes in this fine fantasy.  (Ages 10 to 14) <I>--Patty Campbell</I></span>

                    <span>Maddie and I read this as a read aloud. Much fun. A great sequel to the City of Ember. Lina and Doon are imperfect and terrific characters that everyone can relate to. Also, the other characters were well developed, too. Wouldn't it be great if there was another book coming...</span>

                    <span>EMBER was a gripping novel. As soon as I finished it, I emailed the author begging to know what happened next. She wasn't telling, of course. "You'll have to wait for the sequel," she said. Man, was it worth the wait. I rarely tell people that they have to buy a book, that they must not let another week go by without reading a particular title. Literature is very subjective, after all. What I love, another reader may find uninspiring. SPARKS is an exception to this. <P>Three chapters in, I was literally teary-eyed at the lyricism of Duprau's writing. Six chapters in, I couldn't put it down. I lost SLEEP to finish this book - my ultimate testament to a really good read. <P>THE PEOPLE OF SPARKS is a post-apocolyptic view of the world, after wars, plague and famine have wiped out most of the human race and the few people left are struggling for survival. In the first book, THE CITY OF EMBER, the City Builders have constructed a small city deep underground and stocked it with supplies in vast storerooms, then sent 100 couples with two children each to live there. The Builders know the wars, etc. are coming, and this is how they will save us all. After 200 years, the city infrastructure is crumbling and the city leaders are corrupt, supplies are running out, and the massive generator that keeps the lights on is failing, about to doom the Emberites to permanent darkness, but two young people find the way out, the way to the surface. <P>This leads us to book two in the series. The kids have dropped a message back down to the people of Ember telling them the way out, but will anyone come? They do. And they inundate a small settlement, falling on the mercy of the people who live there, a bedraggled lot, starving, exhausted, unable to move on, and without the skills to be useful members of the new community, the tiny village of Sparks. The Emberites have never seen trees, you see, or birds, or large fields of cabbages, or adobe houses, and fire is a terrifying thing. <P>What ensues is a fantastic story of generosity, deprivation, jealousy, and violence that may lead to the destruction of both communities. The lesson: there are no winners in war, and making peace means taking giant risks. This book has been haunting me for the two days since I finished reading it. If there were a world-wide cataclysmic event, who would survive? Would anyone? Will we ever learn that war only leads to war, violence only to more violence? Can we do something that will take us off the course of self-destruction? Is there hope for the human race? <P>Buy this book. Buy a copy for your local library. Buy a class set and donate it to your kids' school. It's that good.(...)</span>

                    <span>There is no doubt that Jeanne Duprau's first book, The City of Ember, was my favorite of last year. The wait for the sequel seemed like an eternity, but it was worth it! I loved the characters Lina and Doon, the tension brought about by little provisions, and of course, the twist at the end. I'm looking forward to more books by Jeanne Duprau. I hope the wait isn't too long.</span>

                    <span>I finished reading the first book, The City of Ember, feeling like I needed more information. So when this book was released, I quickly got it. WOW. Could a sequel be more...tiresome? The idea was nice, and like a lot of futuristic books, based in a "President-and-Friends-had-a-bomb-party-and-the-world-blew-up-setting."<BR>I've actually read many books like this. It wasn't a horrible book, but its not a favorite. But Jean Duprau illusrated the human nature well in the conflicts between the emberites and the people of sparks. The characters were well developed, which is a rare quality in books I dont like. I also was a little dissapointed because there wasn't a solid plot and I expected Lina and Doon to fall for each other. But then again, maybe Lina doesn't go for the pipe worker types.</span>

                    <span>Sparks is an amazing and wonderful sequel to The City of Ember, with a fascinating and fast paced story line and truly interesting and memorable characters. I was worried that Sparks would not be as great as Ember, but I loved it just as much (if not more) and was so sorry to come to the end. This brilliant and imaginative book will appeal to children and adults alike, and I'm sure will be read for many years to come. Please, Ms. DuPrau, write more!</span>
