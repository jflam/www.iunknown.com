                    <span>SQL Server 2005 will be a big release for SQL Server, on the scale of the 6.5 to 7.0 upgrade. With that kind of shift, it is critical to have a head start in planning. How are the decisions I am making today fit into SQL Server 2005? How will CLR integration help me build solutions? What can I do with the new XML datatype? These are all common questions answered in this book, along with many others. 
<br />
<br />The book is very readable with good context and background. It makes a great guide to using the SQL Server 2005 previews available to MSDN subscribers.</span>

                    <span>Databases are at the core of most software projects these days and there is a fair amount of competition between software vendors for a bigger share of a lucrative market. However, it would be fair to say that only DBAs really know what their database servers are capable of and maybe only half of them really everything that their software can do. One of the biggest arguments for this First Look At SQL Server 2005 book then is as a prospectus for all the developer-related features and functional nooks and crannies that the next incarnation of SQL Server (codename 'Yukon') will contain.
<br />
<br />Split over seventeen chapters and two appendices, this very thorough book covers the ins and outs of four main topics - SQL Server as a CLR host, XML, enhancements to the existing features of SQL Server 2000 and notification services - that should be of interest to developers looking forward to a world of Whidbey and Yukon. Topics such as security and XQuery aren't exhaustive - they'd each take up a book on their own - but all the main points within the context of this book are covered. Indeed, with the exception of Chapter 14, which covers a feature since removed from SQL Server 2005 but is well written anyway, each chapter is clean, concise and packed with useful information. 
<br />
<br />The author team of three have produced a book that at times goes as deep into detail as Don Box's Essential .NET does while treating 'lighter' topics such as Microsoft's new enhancements to T-SQL, in no less detail but in an easier to read style. The main focus of this book are the new opportunities for developers to utilize Yukon but administrators can also take a lot away from this book having been made aware of areas that developers may focus on. In all, this is an excellent preview book on developing with SQL Server 2005 in mind and should be kept around until the revised version comes out for the actual release of this new database.</span>

                    <span>"A First Look at SQL Server 2005 for Developers" is aptly named.  It's a timely, detailed, and very useful introduction to what's new in SQL Server 2005 for three types of developers: database-oriented developers (e.g., with a Transact-SQL background), .NET developers (using C# or VB.NET), and XML-focused developers (perhaps most focused on Web services, XML Schema, etc.).  SQL Server 2005 attempts to provide a more seamlessly unified set of services for these three developer approaches, and the book does a great job of explaining how all of the pieces fit together, along with ramifications for SQL Server architecture and security.
<br />
<br />The authors faced a major challenge in that SQL Server 2005 hasn't shipped yet, and Microsoft made some changes after the book was published.  The chapter on ObjectSpaces, for instance, no longer applies to SQL Server 2005 (at least to pre-Longhorn releases of SQL Server 2005).  The ObjectSpaces chapter is still a useful preview of more complete, future integration among programming models, but Microsoft will no doubt make some major changes before Longhorn is finalized.

                    <span>Ten years ago I bought a book called "Introducing Java". It was basically some warmed over magazine articles that was filled with...... well ... filler. Poorly written, many key sentences were vague and they stayed vague even after a close reading. So, I became suspicious of any sort of Introducing,  First Look etc.
<br />
<br />But on the basis that Bob Beauchemin is one of the authors I gave this book a try. And I am five star happy that I did.
<br />
<br />Firstly it must be said that SQL Sever 2005 is a massive piece of software. It not just a gazillion new bells and whistles, but there are some foundational shifts in how we will program.
<br />
<br />There is a lot of material in the book. But it is anything but filler. If there is something I didn't understand, rereading helped me out!
<br />
<br />I consider myself an XML wonk of sorts and it is painful to read database writers discussing XML all the while not "getting it". Rest assured these guys get it.
<br />
<br />In short
<br />Extremely worthwhile.
<br />This book is not for newbies.
<br />The will not be your last book on XQuery, but the discussion on XQuery is dense and accurate.
<br />You will need your hi-lighter and post-it's at hand when reading this.
<br />
<br />There is a lot to SQL Server 2005, and this book will be a great way to get a handle on it. In fact, I am guessing this "First Look" will be on my desktop for a couple of years from now.

                    <span>Microsoft continues to integrate its SQL Server deeper into its .NET framework. One result is this book, with a heads-up on new features with a nominal release date of 2005. YOu can see a lot of changes.
<br />
<br />Most significant, perhaps, is that the .NET CLR engine is now embedded into the SQL Server engine. So that stored procedures can now be written, and in several .NET languages, at that. Stored procedures are a key optimisation technique of sophisticated databases, so it is very good to see it here. 
<br />
<br />Hmm, I wonder. This book scrupulously avoids mentioning any rival databases. But at the low end, SQL Server has to ward off the free MySQL. The latter lacks stored procedures [for now]. So this lets Microsoft put some distance between them. Plus, above SQL Server in functionality sits Oracle and dB2. So stored procedures help close the gap here.
<br />
<br />Another interesting note about the book is the sheer space devoted to integrating in XML. There is now a native XML data type in SQL Server. All relational databases are having to move towards handling XML. This also makes it harder for pure object oriented databases, like Versant, to make inroads when major databases like SQL Server handle XML.</span>
