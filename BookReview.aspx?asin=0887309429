                    <span>I'd strongly consider this book very carefully if I were you. This is not a book for the "Feel Good" crowd who thing they can save 10% for X amount of  years, and retire at 55 like Donald Trump. Pollard, using very specific evidence, points out how that simply won't work for you anymore. 
<br />
<br />I've read several of the types of books outlined above - they're all the same; they all present superficial arguments cloaked in cutesy little stories; and they all are written for mass consumption designed to sell as many books to lemmings as possible. Don't be a lemming.
<br />
<br />I've already implemented some of the ideas in the book like: pay cash. And I can see even that little reliance on 0% offers I used to have, has become a burden, when it runs out and the balance must be paid off. Interstingly Pollard likens this to drug dealers giving out free crack. And he's right, even someone as disciplined as myself (who always pays the balance in full) has had his self-control tested by these offers. I only mention this because of how irritatingly negative/sophomoric the previous reviewers comments were about paying off Credit. He is "a young Gen Xer" who has all the answers - probably with one Credit card for 1 year. Just wait - lets see how disciplined you are in the future with paying it off in full - just wait and see.</span>

                    <span>As baby boomers that lost it all and is in the process of rebuilding our life, we found this book to be very helpful.  In addition, it points out the hardest lesson that we've learned - your employer is not loyal to you and you can't count on them to take care of you.<p>This book isn't going to make you wealthy, and that is not its intent.  This information in this book, paired with info from Suze Orman, are powerful tools for protecting yourself from future crises.<p>It isn't always right on the money, but it offers food for thought and practical advice.  You won't find any book that has all the answers - if that were true, we'd all be rich.</span>

                    <span>"Die Broke" was an interesting read although not what I was looking for.<p>I got the broke part down years ago with out much effort. Now I just need to decide on how to best achieve the rest of the formula.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>When this book was first published about six years ago, many reviewers on Amazon.com really ripped it up.  I'd be curious to see their opinions now that their impressive "retirement" portfolios are worth next to nothing and they're looking for work--that they can't find.
<br />
<br />It's a fine philosophy, but it depends on who the reader is.  Pollan isn't right about everything.  For example, he claims that non-cash gifts aren't subject to gift tax.  Not exactly.  And his ideas about getting to know the manager of your bank branch personally are quaint at best.  In my experience, bank branch managers last a few months at most.  I also don't understand his recommendation to lease instead of buy cars; leases are generally designed to rip people off.
<br />
<br />But, that said, the idea of not retiring, of working so you can have a life, is right on.  I suspect after the upheavals of the last few years, more people are likely to agree with him and see validity in his ideas.
<br />
<br />HOWEVER, like so many of these books, it's essentially an interesting ten-page essay expanded into a book.  If you think you're going to work at a job for 40 years, then spend a few years shuffling around the golf course waiting for death, buy it and read it.  If that scenario strikes you as a dead-end fantasy, you're probably already with the program.</span>

                    <span>The book is obviously aimed towards the baby-boom generation as a motivational tool. About half of the content is devoted to the philosophy of Dying Broke (garnered from the cover in minutes) and the rest of the content vaguely describes approaches to car purchases, insurance, mortgages etc... I would not recommend the purchase of this book to friends.</span>
