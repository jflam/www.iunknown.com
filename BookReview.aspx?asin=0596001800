                    <span>I've been developing with Sybase and SQL Server for about 5 years with very limited experience with Oracle in that time. I purchased this book hoping to get up to speed on the differences between Oracle's PL/SQL and the Sybase/Microsoft T-SQL syntax. From the title this book seemed appropriate for the job. In short, while the book might be an adequate, albeit SLOW, introduction to Oracle, it covers very little actual PL/SQL. <p>If you are a programer/engineer/dba looking to "learn Oracle PL/SQL", interested in practical applications of such fundamental topics as constraints, foreign keys, indexes, joins, cursors, views, triggers, corelated subqueries and the like, look elsewhere. Don't take my word for it--take a peek at the index or table of contents and you'll see that the focus of this book has very little to do with PL/SQL.</span>

                    <span>I've only read three chapters so far.  It's been very good actually - I knew some SQL beforehand, although nothing very complicated, and it has been pretty easy for me to understand as well as very helpful for me in learning how to use PL/SQL.  It has genuinely useful examples, and also provides tips as to how to perform unit testing on stored procedures and functions.<p>Another very useful thing the author does is list common and not-as-common mistakes that a programmer may make (which may not always result in errors or exceptions), hence possibly saving you the trouble of hours of debugging.<p>The only problem I've had with it is that he doesn't treat foreign keys as constraints.  One of his sample column declarations is:  "isbn VARCHAR2(100) FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES books (isbn)", but I kept getting an error until I changed it to:  "isbn VARCHAR2(100), FOREIGN KEY (isbn) REFERENCES books (isbn)".  I am not sure if this is a peculiarity of my installation (running Oracle 9i), but a check online reveals that many people also consider foreign keys a constraint.<p>Except for that problem, I would have given this book 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>I use a self-taught approach to learn new things like most people. And, like most people, I get frustrated with the lengthy superfluous nature of how-to books which throw everything in, including the kitchen sink. This book starts off well, and you can learn from it at a comfortably progressive pace, but it could use a larger scope.  The author leaves a lot of code out of the book, though he does explain parts of it.  In the end, the project he uses to illustrate PL/SQL becomes more complicated than it needs to be for a tutorial exercise.  Still, I haven't seen anything better.</span>

                    <span>I've been a self taught Oracle PL/SQL developer for two years, so I was sceptical on reading a "Learning" book. After reading the first few chapters I was able to make improvements to my PL/SQL programs. It was definitely worth the time and money. The examples are well written and simple enough to make sense, but not too simple that they are "duh" type examples. I also liked the fact that the book explains how to set up and use Oracle/Apache to make PSP pages (Stored Procedures that generate web content). The PSP section makes up a good portion of the book that I didn't know was in it before I got it. With plenty of real-world experience tips, a section on tools and security, it will be a while before I have this ingrained and used on a daily basis. I defiantly got more than I was looking for.</span>

                    <span>Listen Software Solutions: PL/SQL introduces a new dimension of power programming capability for the developer. The goal of reusable code measurely improves quality verse vast amounts of non-reusable SQL. PL/SQL packages describe function and procedure specification and body. The specification describes the package interface to the calling application. The package specification approach is part of good design. The package specification exposes procedures and their parameter properties to external applications. Each specification has a package body. Within the package body various data structures, such as arrays and tables can be referenced, functions called, and procedures executed. Developers new to PL/SQL often understand insert, update, and delete data manipulations; but are confused about selection. This is because they don't know about cursors. <p>I recommend this book. As a developer having knowledge resource information is critical.</span>
