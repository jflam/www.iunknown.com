                    <span>I'd never read a book prepared by Bloom, and so based my purchase only on what I'd heard about it through American Political Science Review. That said, I was pretty impressed and can only agree with the promotional salesmanship present on the book itself. I plan to buy his The Closing of the American Mind only on account of having read this edition of his.
<br />
<br />Even though it's said to be a very literal translation, the book is easy to read, and I can't imagine that one would have to be a student of Greek philosophy to handle it well. Socrates had me going nuts as I read through his enraging method, so the translation must have been decent enough!
<br />
<br />I purchased this book through Amazon four years ago, and it's held up despite me flipping through it on occasion like an idiot searching for cookies. The pages are thick enough to support highlighting, the preface and non-body material is excellent, and, it doesn't hurt that even in the paperback version, the book is aesthetically pleasing to look at, even while sitting on the shelf waiting for you to open it up again.</span>

                    <span>As usual, the atrophied intellect that is Allan Bloom successfully attempts to rape a classic piece of philosophy with his mediocre, lackluster, ogrish brutality, which is his norm, towards true academia, knowledge and wisdom. If Rush Limbaugh re-wrote the Constitution you'd get an idea of the ruse that masks itself analogous to Mr. Bloom's feebility towards writing and thought contained within this boorish tome.
<br />
<br />If you just want to read the Republic as it was intended, to the best of our Anglo-Franco-Germanic understanding of the last two centuries, steer far clear of Mr. Bloom's literary abortion within these pages. 
<br />
<br />If you further care of preserving your ability to reason, unfiltered and unprejudicially, I suggest looking into Mr. Bloom's history and agenda towards the upheaval of education, truth and attitude(s) toward integrity and intellectually honest liberty before considering wasting your hard earned currency on his insidiously dishonest dribble.</span>

                    <span>We all know - there is no point in reviewing such a classic (other than to comment on the translation). So what I want to say is that Plato is so much fun to read. It is the dialogue. When I found out that was how Plato wrote - I became interested. Accessible to everyone! And the Myth of Er is one of the best endings ever! 
<br />The Republic is great. Pass it on!</span>

                    <span>  This is one of the better translations of Plato's Republic, and his theories are still applicable to this day.  When he speaks of different forms of government, and the pitfalls of each, it's amazingly accurate even more then 2700 years later.  Even democracy, as we've come to appreciate it has pitfalls as Plato explains it.  One of the leading problems, is the possible evolution towards tyranny.  And a lot can be said about Bush and the steps some democratic governments take to become Tyrannical.
<br />  Another thing most people should take into consideration is that although Plato claims most of the dialogue and arguement is based on conversations between Socrates and his circle, the truth is, much of the dialogue attributed to Socrates, is most likely Plato's own thoughts.  At the time of his writings, Socrates was already dead, and some of Plato's theories were quite inflammitory.  He speaks of one god, instead of many gods, and his ideas of what a Republic should be could have had him condemned to the same fate as Socrates (imprisonment and capital punishment).  Thus, what Plato smartly does is attributes most of his own theories and ideas to what he purportedly heard from Socrates.  </span>
