                    <span>(Disclaimer: I worked with the author on one large project).<br>Dave Astels' book is a comprehensive work covering TDD from the ground up to advanced topics. While most of the book examples use Java and JUnit, it does cover unit testing frameworks in several other languages as well. I've read two books on the topic (the other one is Kent Beck's "TDD By Example") and I liked Dave's book better. The basics of TDD can be explained in 10 minutes however when it is applied on practice it gets complicated in at least 3 areas: 1) testing UI 2) testing with database - data setup, isolation, etc. and 3) mocks. Kent's book is more about a philosophy of TDD but it only goes through a very simple "toy" example. Dave's book really helped me to understand mocks and it does cover UI testing in great length. Mocks are an advanced topic, so it does require a good knowledge of Java and OOP. The rest of the book seems to be on intermediate technical level.<p>The only thing this book is missing, I think, is a discussion about data setup and database-related testing, dbUnit, etc., other than an advice to avoid it altogether (p. 83). While you can indeed use mocks to avoid it, on the large real projects some kind of integration testing (including testing with the database) will be necessary. I hope the second edition will come out at some point!<p>Overall, it's a great book for both newcomers and developers with unit testing experience. BTW, it won SD West 2004 Jolt Award.</span>

                    <span>This book is about Test-Driven Development (TDD). Its purpose is to help you write better code (by having more tests) and give you a head start with existing tools to achieve this.<p>The book falls short of these goals: The explanations about writing tests are short on advice and are sometimes misleading. The presentation of the tools is long, with little useful facts. <p>The book is organized into four parts: Background on TDD, refactoring and programming by intention; A look at JUnit and related tools used to write and run tests; A lengthy example of TDD; An overview of other tools in the xUnit family. The book is targeted at a Java audience but programmers using other languages should have little difficulties understanding the code.<p>I have a major problem with the background section. The author repeatedly claims that TDD provides exhaustive test coverage and ensures that you can refactor your code with confidence. Any error will be caught by the tests. This is foolish. First, tests rarely reach 100% code coverage. Even the sample that the author provides in the book ends up with less than 90% coverage. This leaves many gaps where tests will fail to detect errors. Even if tests cover 100% branches in the code tests are not exhaustive. Depending on the data used, the same branch may exhibit different behavior. (Not to speak about race conditions and other sources of hard to find bugs.) I fully agree with the author that writing unit tests will improve the quality of the code and help find bugs. But claiming that this is a silver bullet is not wise. I would recommend reading books about tests (e.g., Myers' The Art of Software Testing and McConnell's Code Complete chapter on unit testing) in addition to this book. The section on refactoring is a summary of Martin Fowler's Refactoring book which I recommend.<p>The second part presents JUnit. JUnit is a framework used to write and run tests. It is a good presentation. However I would have liked to get pieces of advices on what tests to write in addition to how to write them. The author briefly mentions boundary testing but does not have much to say about the tests themselves. Again a test book is invaluable for this. The author recommends using a test coverage tool as well as Jester to measure the tests coverage. This is a great idea.<p>The third section is an (overly) extended example: the author walks us through writing TDD code. This could have been a great part, giving meaning to the `practical' adjective in the book title. Unfortunately it is a long rambling, showing lots of code but short on insights. The actual `meat' of this part could be summarized in less than five pages.<p>The last section presents variations on the JUnit tool. Many languages (C++, C#, VB, Python, etc) are discussed. This part would have been better put on a website rather than printed in the book. Given the changes in some of these frameworks the information is obsolete.<p>The books ends with several appendices dealing with extreme programming and agile modeling. <p>Unit tests are a great tool to improve code quality. Whether or not you actively practice TDD, a good book on it can provide insights into improving your code. This book contains some interesting bits of wisdom. However much of it is buried by the rest of the material.</span>

                    <span>Dave's book does one thing that most other books in this field do not do: it avoids the web application. Hallelujah!<p>This book provides a good foundation for understanding TDD: the programming cycle, refactoring, tools, mock objects... it is possible to begin applying TDD for yourself after reading the first 1/3 or so of this book.<p>Writing effectively about programming sessions is not easy. Only a few authors can do it well, and Dave does an admirable job in this. My only beef with the case study (which makes up the bulk of the book) is that, after a while, it becomes somewhat repetitive. This isn't Dave's fault: it's the nature of programming. Sometimes we just need to add another button or another text field. We don't necessarily learn anything new doing it, but if we want a finished product, we have to do it. I understand Dave's desire to present a complete (if small) project, and so applaud his willingness to risk some duplication in the name of finishing what he started.<p>The experience of learning from this book is similar to learning from real project experience: not every page contains something new and exciting, but if you follow along and ask questions (of yourself), then you will have learned a great deal by the end.</span>

                    <span>The single best thing that distinguishes this book from the other TDD books on the market is its effort to produce a believable application during the course of using TDD. It even showed a way of unit testing GUI applications, which is easily the hardest thing in-practice about TDD.<p>On the bad side, some nicer abstractions around the UI and any patters he'd come up with to make UI TDD better would've been a great takeaway. Also, he said that he'd be using Smalltalk-style names because that was what it was familiar with, which is totally bogus. The book should be written for the reader, not for the writer -- if he was that attached to and unwilling to give up Smalltalk, then why write it using Java?</span>
