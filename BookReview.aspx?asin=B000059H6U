                    <span>I love it when they combine nature programing with prehistoric creatures. Thats what they did in this program. I loved the first Walking with Dinosaurs so I was happy there would be another. First it was too short. It was only 30 minutes. It was too much like the first. They should have made a Walking with Dinosaurs special on dinosaurs that were not in the first movie. I was very entertaining. It had action packed hunting and fighting scenes that were even more intentense than in the first. It had no scientific problems. It had awsome realistic special effects. It had perfect picture quality. The main problem with the film is that it didn't have full doby digital sound. The second segment Big Al uncovered could be called a making of documentary. It talked about all the scientific evidence of what they used to make the film. It also had some funny clips the same way the making of Walking with Dinosaurs had. The story boards and photo gallery were OK but should of had more supplements. The DVD rom supplements were the best. I recomened Allosaurs for anyone who liked the first Walking with Dinosaurs.</span>

                    <span>Well,I have to say that I have seen this one,and it was better than the usual "Walking with Dinosaurs". This time,they have a real storyline,although it`s just a documentary film. And the dinosaurs seems a lot more full of life,although their look isn`t different. It`s a pity these series were not included in the book. <BR>I this 30-minute special,we follow the allosaurus named Al from beeing an egg to his death. In fact,this could truly have been the life of an allosaur. But there are still a few things which I don`t understand (and it has happend TOO many times in "Walking with Dinosaurs"): why does he always start arguing with a female of his own kind?Why didn`t they let him fight another male to get the female instead?That would have been a little more realistic (and a more usual thing to happen in the dinosaur world as well). <BR>Well,I know the filmmakers weren`t made out of cash,but I think this documentary could have been a little longer - 30 minutes was too short. It should have been about an hour. Then we would probably have had more time too learn about Al`s dangerous and wondrous world,and the fantastic creatures living there. <BR>Still,I think this was a very nice addition to BBC`s most expensive project so far,and it is recommended watching both for dino-loving kids as well as for adults and anyone interested in dinosaurs & computer animations.</span>

                    <span>This dramatic narrative follows the life of actual Allosaurus, Big Al, from an egg to the corpse of a fierce hunter. Even though the filming skips about Al's life, the flow of the production is hardly damaged. The research for the film is impressive; even the Allosaurus fight has some evidence from Al's fossils. Superb computer graphics and animatronics create the believable dinosaurs. There is suspense,action and tradgedy,as well as humor and fun woven into the story.One negative comment is with the location of the filming. It is filmed in Utah and Arizona,which do not look quite accurate,but the extensive research and realistic dinosaurs balance it out. This good short film lets the viewer experience how a dinosaur may have lived.</span>

                    <span>When I was a little kid, I used to dream of a world teeming with dinosaurs. I used to imagine what it would have been like when those skeletons I saw on exhibit lived, and how someone needed to play tour guide to that realm and how I should twist the handle. Sadly, no matter how I tried that doorway, it always remained closed, my time machine not quite working the way I would have intended, and dinosaurs were left either in bone formation or in the movies as monsters.<BR>There was never an in-between. <P>With the creation of the Walking With Dinosaurs series, however, everything began to change and I, still that boy with an interest in that hobby, found myself addicted. The key that separated this series and made it "unique" - a word I try to use sparingly - is in the way the dinosaurs, our main actors and actresses, are portrayed. Instead of turning then into a depiction of a colossal, toothy menace or dryly discussing their lifespan in the way one discusses ancient relics, the series showcases dinosaurs by allowing one to walk with them through their terrain. From the flora and the fauna, the insect life and dinosaurs themselves, a depiction of CGI effects, prosthetics, and of "dinosaur knowing" comes to life. Here, you see the landscape the way it would have been, the animals roaming free and observed naturalistically, and the experience is incredible because it looks so vibrantly realistic. <P>In Allosaurus: A Walking With Dinosaurs Special, the Allosaurus "Big Al" is showcased as he struggles from the cradle while trying to grow into something fearsome. In sixty minutes, the fifteen years from the egg to the eventual demise it faces are depicted, showing a person that going to the head of the class wasn't easy in that age. Here, other dinosaurs walk as well, and the efforts of one of the top predators of its age seem a tad on the hard side - making me rethink the allure of being the biggest kid on the block. Survival while growing, it is dramatic and enlightening experience, and its pretty interesting how harrowing an introduction can be and how brutal it can be. <P>For anyone that has yet to watch this series, I'd recommend tuning in as soon as possible and catching up on all those moments you missed out on. I would recommend starting with Walking With Dinosaurs, however, and moving on from there. Still, that is far from being a bad thing. Besides this video that focuses on Big Al and a few of species, other DVDs house other forms of life that are entrancing. Wonderfully fast predators, Megladons swimming the high tides and eating enough to be interesting, and other strange species await you. And they, all the DVDs released thusfar in this series, simply look fantastic. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The "seventh" episode of the spectacularly successful "Walking with Dinosaurs" series, "Allosaurus" - better known as "The Ballad of Big Al" outside the US - is a extraordinary follow-up to that series. It also served to whet many fans' appetite for the later "Prehistoric Beasts" series.<P>In "Allosaurus", we followed the life of "Big Al" literally from birth to the grave. Life wasn't all "blood in tooth and claw" for the top predator in Jurassic America, as we're shown. As a baby, Al had to watch for predators, especially his own kind! He had to literally teach himself to hunt, and some prey was just too big to take on without help. And mating was no pinic either; Al needs more than flowers to win a female's heart. <P>As a sequel of sorts to "Walking with Dinosaurs", "Allosaurus" does quite well. We're treated to the same CGI and animatronic effects seen in the previous series, and while the puppetry still needs a little work, IMHO, the CGI is top notch. All of the dinosaurs featured in the episode "Time of the Titans" - Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, and Stegosaurus - return here. Three more dinosaurs are added to the cast; Dryosaurus, Othnelia, and the famous Apatosaurus. As with "Dinosaurs", there is a "Making of..." episode, included on the VHS, giving us insight into the research of what is one of the most recognizable predatory dinosaurs, second only to Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor. <P>While "Allosaurus" is a wonderful series, I do have one little complaint. Surely the Framestore and BBC teams could have added a few more dinosaurs to the episode. They didn't need to have added more sauropods; three is enough. But what about Ceratosaurus, or Camptosaurus, both contemparies of Allosaurus? Surely both these dinosaurs could have been included, especially since its likely Ceratosaurus could have competed with Allosaurus for the same food source.<P>Despite this "flaw", "Allosaurus" is a fine follow-up to "Dinosaurs". Part of the continuing "Walking with..." series, which now includes "Prehistoric Beasts", "Chased by Dinosaurs", and now "Walking with Cavemen", "Allosaurus" definately belongs in anyone's collection. And here's a message to the folks at the BBC: please, *please* do something about the time *before* the dinosaurs.</span>
