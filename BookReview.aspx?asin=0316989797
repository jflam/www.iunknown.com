                <span id="Label1">In the summer of 1999, the Dalai Lama addressed an audience of over 40,000 in Central Park on how to live a better life. <I>Open Heart</I> is derived from this and other popular lectures given in New York. Here, the Dalai Lama progresses beyond his bestsellers <I>The Art of Happiness</I> and <I>Ethics for the New Millennium</I> by introducing specific practices that can engender happiness. Spiritual practice, according to the Dalai Lama, is a matter of taming unwanted emotions, which means becoming aware of how the mind works. Through the methods of analytical and settled meditation, the Dalai Lama shows how we can cultivate helpful states of mind and eliminate harmful states, leading us to develop compassion for others and happiness for ourselves. But there is no preaching of a single, right method. This revered but humble monk merely invites the reader to understand the causes of one's suffering and consider how best to alleviate it. <I>Open Heart</I> should draw crowds to the bookstores and lead us all to more satisfactory living. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>"Our spiritual journey is a long one," the Dalai Lama writes in this compilation of dharma teachings delivered in New York in 1999. "We must choose our path with care, ensuring that it encompasses all those methods that lead us to our goal. At times the journey is steep. We must know how to pace ourselves down to the snail's path of profound contemplation while also ensuring that we do not forget our neighbor's problem or that of the fish swimming in the polluted oceans many thousands of miles away" (p. 54). In this book, His Holiness shows us how to open our hearts and cultivate compassion toward all beings. He begins his book with an introduction he first delivered to more than 200,000 people in Central Park, during which he expressed his views on the "importance of respecting our neighbors, our compatriots, our fellow nations, and all of humanity. He shared his way of transforming pride into humilty and anger into love. He expressed his concern for the divide between rich and poor. He ended by leading a prayer for all beings to find happiness" (p. xv).<P>"It is my hope," the Dalai Lama says, "that the reader of this small book will take away a basic understanding of Buddhism and some of the key methods by which Buddhist practitioners have cultivated compassion and wisdom in their lives" (p. 29). Throughout his book, His Holiness urges us to recognize that the nature of worldly life is suffering. "I therefore believe that cultivating a correct understanding of the way things are is critical to our quest for happiness" (p. 34), he writes. He teaches us how to cultivate loving kindness, compassion, and equanimity, and how to transform negative, "afflictive" emotions--attachment, hatred, pride, and greed, for example--into compassion through "analytical" and "settled" meditation practices. "Meditation is the process whereby we gain control over the mind and guide it in a more virtuous direction," he explains. "Meditation may be thought of as a technique by which we diminish the force of old habits and develop new ones. We thereby protect ourselves from engaging in actions of mind, word or deed that lead to our suffering" (p. 46).<P>These clear, engaging teachings demonstrate that "an open heart is an open mind. A change of heart is a change of mind" (p. 84). They also provide a good introduction to the Buddhist path by a trusted spiritual advisor, and they are accessible to readers of different religious backgrounds. They demonstrate how an understanding of "the miserable nature of life" can lead us to an appreciation of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha--the Three Jewels in which Buddhists seek shelter. For those readers interested in living life with an open heart, I would also recommend Pema Chodron's recent book, THE PLACES THAT SCARE YOU (2001).<P>G. Merritt</span>

                    <span>This latest book by the Dalai Lama is a compilation of speeches he gave in NYC in the past. It lists the main traits one should practice to fulfill a healthy lifestyle: compassion, empathy, wisdom, and so on. If you have already read 'Ethics For The New Millenium' or 'The Art of Happiness' you will find that this book repeats much of the material in those books. The main difference I see in this edition is that some basic meditation techniques are covered. Overall, it is a book that reminds us of the most important qualities one should practice to create a centered life. I also recommend "Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom" by Taro Gold which is filled with hundreds of thought-provoking and inspirational quotations.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a Buddhist scholar, nor am I a Christian theologian. This book puts forth a tremendously powerful approach to dealing with interpersonal, as well as international, problems. The Buddhist teachings on compassion are numerous and complex. However, this book provides a clear discussion of the benefits of compassion and the use of specific meditation techniques to foster it. It seems that these teachings integrate well with Christian, Islamic and other religious frameworks. If more religious fundamentalists took these teachings to heart, terrorism would wither and die of neglect.</span>

                    <span>This is a badly constructed book. There is a book written by the<BR>Dali Lama that is just incredible!!! And will blast you to the moon. I'll get to that in a bit. Because His Holiness refuses<BR>to go native, his books center around a sort of floppy disc<BR>form of global Buddhism (Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's Buddhism in the West).<BR>The book is not well-thought out. Based on three sacred texts,<BR>we try to deal with the topic of compassion. And we do so to an<BR>extent. Mostly based on His Holiness'es talks in August, 1999,<BR>we are left with a lot of form and little substance. This is a good book if you are an adept practioner. Geshe Kelsang Gyato's<BR>books, on the otherhand, are a dream. This is even admitted by<BR>followers of the Dali Lama (there was a deep rift between the two parties in 1996-1998 that split Tibetan Buddhism into two<BR>sects; Tibetan Buddhism and global Buddhism). Gysatso's books are clear and lucid. What makes me quite frustrated is that the<BR>Dali Lama has written an absolutely tremendous book for you and me called "How to Practice." This book is tremondous and it deals virtually with everything one could possibly want to know in order to do Tibetan Buddhism in one's kitchen sink with a minimum of fuss. For those of you who want to give me a negative vote for<BR>knocking the Dali Lama, I am not doing so. Nobody pays attention to "How to Practice" by the Dali Lama and my friends just get a bored look. I say, "It's not what you think! He even tells you how many pillows to put under your [bottom]." And they say, "Yeah. Yeah. The Dali Lama is kewl man." Buy Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's books. But then find yourself very suprised. In "How<BR>to Practice," the Dali Lama hits a home run that is a grand slam. "How to Practice" came out in 2002, so keep an eye out for<BR>it. Buy the book above for helping out the Tibetans. And it can add<BR>some useful information. But that is all.</span>
