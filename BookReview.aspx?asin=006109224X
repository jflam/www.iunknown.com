                    <span>This work provides specific guidance on how to take control<br>of one's life ( to the extent that is possible). For instance,<br>he describes how to operate from a position of strength by<br>placing people on an equal plane and addressing them by their<br>first names. In addition, the author criticizes our tendency<br>to be governed by past events that we can no longer control<br>or change. He explains the need to draw boundaries and assert<br>ourselves in defense of our basic rights. The author <br>recommends the behavioral approach in order to respond to people<br>and events that make us uncomfortable. Above all, the author<br>warns about placing institutions  over ourselves and personal<br>self-worth and satisfaction. Finally, the author asks us to<br>look around ourselves in an effort to make our daily lives<br>better for everyone. He even quotes the Declaration<br>of Independence (July 4, 1776):<br>"All experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to<br>suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed."<p>The book is an excellent behaviorally based reference which<br>can help us manage our affairs both privately and in the<br>workplace setting.</span>

                    <span>Dr Dyer is a rare individual. He really understands. He has found simplicity. The truth is simple, that which I have yet to understand! I read this book first, and felt compelled to learn how to pull my own strings. I freed myself from outside influences by reading this book, Pulling Your Own Strings. We learn to be more than a sailboat, drifting on the sea with a fixed sail, frolicking about, at the mercy of every wave and breeze.  I learned how to be effective at grabbing the control panel, that pull the strings of my life, which at times takes a bit of assertion.  Combining that with one of his other books, "Your Sacred Self, I gained peace. I finally found the key to dealing with stress. I did so by learning what meditation really is from him. Instead of a lotus position, and humming a mantra, I learned that it is simply sitting or lying still, undisturbed, for ten or fifteen minutes, letting all thoughts leave my mind. Each thought is tied to an emotion. You come to a place that is quiet and peaceful, and your arise refreshed, renewed, and unfettered with stress and resentments. Then your greatest problem solving mind is present, solutions appear. It is true. What a great tool. Instead of resorting to addictive, and destructive habits, or substances to deal with stress, he has shown me the ultimate solution. <br>So there you have it, with Pulling Your Own Strings, you learn to be the master of your own life, and recognize those, and those things, that try to direct us, and not neccessarily for unselfish reasons. Then freed from outside control, we begin to see that the solutions to our lives are available to us from within. In Your Sacred Self, he teaches us that ego is controlling, and dominating our lives. It is at war with your greater spiritual self. It keeps us from sitting still. Always striving, but never arriving. Let the noise and clamor cease. We are all one together. We don't need ego driven domination, but rather cooperation. Get rid of the anger. Learn how to eliminate the negative influences in your life. The most powerful way for someone else to control you, is to make you angry. Once they see it no longer works, they usually leave you alone, or it makes them angrier that they no longer can control you. "It is like heaping coals of fire on their heads" Then acquire joy and peace. I know it sounds like cliches, but it is true, and I don't know how else to say it. <br>Dr Dyer gives you the tools, to build a new house. Or should I say, he reminds you of the house that has been there all along. Only the expressions are original, the thoughts lie within us all.</span>

                    <span>This book's theme is taking charge of your own life, being responsible for yourself, and not allowing other people to control your thinking or convert you into a victim.  Throughout the book, examples of victimhood are adduced, along with recommendations for personal action that will avoid that victimhood.<p>Contemporary, progressive society has left this mode of thinking completely behind.  Nowadays, there is limitless honor in being a victim, in having been wronged by someone else (or even wronged by yourself, like if you spill hot McDonald's coffee in your lap).  Dyer appears to have no appreciation whatever for the fact that professional victimhood is a huge national industry, a thriving source of income for an entire benthic layer of our society.  <p>Dyer's implication that you should simply "get over it" and move forward with your life is an insult to everyone who has spilled hot McDonald's coffee in her lap.  "Get over it" suggests there should be no reparations for descendants of slaves or payments to lung cancer victims who smoked three packs a day for forty years.  "Get over it" would leave legions of personal injury lawyers scraping elsewhere for money.  When I envision our own World Grand Master of Victimhood, Hillary (who steadfastly stood by her cheating man) merely "getting over it" and not wallowing in the ocean of pity that got her elected to the Senate, I understand how drastically Dr. Wayne has strayed from contemporary mores and morals.  He is obviously not a member of the Bill Clinton's (political) organ, the Democrat Party.<p>"Pulling Your Own Strings" is an antique, an outmoded relic of a bygone era when real people took responsiblity for themselves.  Don't waste your time on it.  You might become self-reliant.</span>

                    <span>I've read this book after Life strageties of McGraw and found out that it has almost the same ideas, but this (Dyer) one was published earlier and has a more gentle approach, so don't hesitate and buy it!</span>

                    <span>I found this book extremely motivating and self-fulfilling. I practiced several of the techniques Dr. Dyer mentioned, through them I gain more self esteem, respect of being a more confident individual, and knowledge to share with many women I am in contact with that feel no sense of control in their lives. Thank You ever so much and look forward to your other books as well.</span>
