                <span id="Label1">The craze for "getting away from it all" in buildings of log, stone, and unpainted lumber has been a part of American life since the 1800s. From the Gilded Age retreats of the Catskills and Adirondacks to the rugged Wild West lodges of Yellowstone and Yosemite, <I>Cabin Fever</I> celebrates the architectural elements that make cabin style unique: gleaming hand-peeled and polished logs, cowhide sofas, and river-rock fireplaces. Some are large, old, and built as public lodgings, like Putnam Camp, the Adirondack summer retreat founded by philosopher William James, which still has the cheerful austerity it had when Freud and Jung mingled there with Harvard academicians. Others, like the grand hunting lodge nestled on the edge of a marsh, are more recent monuments to quirky private visions of the perfect rustic retreat. Rooms in both are accessorized with animal heads, native American blankets and art, snowshoes, antler chandeliers, and willow twig furniture. The book's appendix includes catalog sources for everything from small wooden summerhouses to buffalo-plaid blankets, and a list of hotels in the grand old style (like Yosemite's Ahwahnee and the Grand Canyon's El Tovar). Even if you can't have a piece of the wilderness to call your own (and the burl furniture to match), you can still enjoy the rustic yet substantial comforts of <I>Cabin Fever</I>.</span>

                    <span>My favorite book related to vacation home style is Cottage Style, and I wrote a review of that book on amazon awhile back. This Cabin Fever book is a bit narrower in scope, but I am enjoying all the photos. Because I love Better Homes and Gardens Cottage Style, I just bought the new BH&G book called Second Home, which shows one great house after another. I'm getting lots of decorating ideas from those homes. But Second Home also has great information on real estate shopping, home design, and decorating, too. It's my kind of book, because it's a dream book that also helps me do something to achieve the dream.</span>

                    <span>Thanks to a previous reviewer, M. Pass, I bought this and also bought a book called Second Home. Both are great. This Cabin Fever book is limited to homes that are a bit more rustic than what we had in mind, but we still love it. Second Home also is a gorgeous dream book but it has a wider variety of home and decorating styles. Second Home also has given us a lot of information on how to shop for a retreat, how to decide what location is best for us, as well as tips on decorating and building. Second Home approaches the topic from a broader perspective.</span>

                    <span>I have been searching for books for months now that would give me real life examples of cabin type homes to use in designing my country home. While there are a lot of books out there on small cabins, I was looking for a book that showed examples that I could incorporate into a larger home. This book is exactly what I was looking for! The photographs are beautiful and truly capture some of the key elements that make these homes special. The author has managed to find some of the best examples out there of truly beautiful, well designed log/natural material homes.<P>In addition to the photographs, the narative is also quite entertaining. It helps the reader understand some of the thinking that went into the creation of these great spaces.<P>If you are looking for a very enjoyable book with wonderful pictures of a vast collection of cabins (both small and large), then this is the book you have been looking for! I know it was for me; I already have dozens of ideas that I plan on incorporating into my, not so small, cabin. Enjoy!</span>
