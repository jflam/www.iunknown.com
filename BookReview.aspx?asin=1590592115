                <span id="Label1">Have you ever poured all your creativity into a Flash movie, but found your friends grumbling at the download size? Have you tried to use just one tiny picture in your movie, and seen the file size go through the roof? Is it possible to do anything remotely effective in a small file? More than you could possibly imagine! This collection shows you just exactly what can be done with tiny Flash files, using some of the hottest Flash designers around. These authors pull designs out of the top drawer and show you exactly how you can go about creating great SWFs with the smallest amount of download pain. We will look at: creating incredible generative designs -- so small you can use them for wallpaper producing 3D animations that roll in at under 5k in size creating sound toys in the smallest possible file space de-mystifying the use of JPEGs and photographs while keeping your Flash movies small strategic use of back-end technology to keep your delivery times down to nanoseconds! changing the boundaries to look at new ways of delivering entire sites! From the Publisher Who is this book for You've worked with Flash, but are wondering why people are getting tetchy at the download time. You're willing to start learning some ActionScript tricks to fight the file flab, and you're not afraid to become addicted to optimization!

                    <span>Well, isn't THIS a fun book! The material is extremely diverse-- some is merely cool, though not altogether useful, while other material (such as the great chapter on separating form from function) can go a long way to helping you produce more functional, configurable sites. All through the book the reader is offered insight on techniques that will keep the file size down, and since this is the most important aspect of the book, I would have perhaps liked a checklist near the top or an index at the end of these of these ideas. As it stands, you have to go through each tutorial (although they are all interesting) to get a full list of byte-saving techniques. Not a major drawback, but a small chapter that gathered all of the authors' tricks together would have been useful.</span>

                    <span>Finally somebody's seen fit to gather these kinds of techniques. It says on the cover youre looking at files under 4 KB, but most of these are like under 2. It's got a really good balance, going from some staple stuff to begin -- mouse trails and smoke effects and fireworks through simple scripting. After that, it passes into the really useful things, like an animated photo gallery, with gorgeous wipes and fades. I haven't yet got on to the later stuff that I've just never seen anywhere before -- an interactive 3D city, and sound! A big thumbs up, and it should have been called bit-size.</span>
