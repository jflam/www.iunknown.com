                <span id="Label1">Some might think of a Wow! book as only showing how to create neon lettering or chrome highlights. But Sharon Steuer has given us a book that will have readers saying, "Wow! I can't believe how much better I am at Illustrator." The special techniques famous to the Wow! series are still represented here: pen and ink wash, scratchboard, warps, scribbles, and 3D effects, among many others. But what makes this book the one you'll keep by your computer is the incredibly clear writing, examples that cover all the fundamentals, and a clean layout.<p>  The book is great for basics, although even experienced users will appreciate "The Zen of Illustrator" instructions that help you "think" and "see" in Illustrator. You begin by recreating basic shapes using a variety of methods, all the while becoming very agile with the pens, pathfinder palette, and other tools. Then, there's the Finger Dance: a set of keyboard fingerings that will take you right back to your piano lessons. These brilliant exercises help you move away from relying too much on your mouse (the slowest way to go) and in the habit of using the modifier keys (Control, Command, Shift, and Option). Other lessons include drawing and coloring methods, creating isometric images, patterns and vector photos, using distort filters, mapping techniques, extensive use of Illustrator CS's new typography tools, blends, gradients, transparencies, preparing artwork for use in Flash, designing web pages in Illustrator, and much more.<p>  In addition to the at-a-glance charts in the Zen and Finger Dance sections (where you learn by looking more than reading), there's a nifty spread showing all the options in the pathfinder palette and another showing special techniques that can be achieved with brushes. And there's a handy pullout of glossary terms and summary explanations of all the steps in the Finger Dance.<p>  There are techniques from accomplished artists and gallery sections displaying their work. Highlights include Marc LaMantia's expressionistic paintings of New York City, made from meticulously tracing over photos in Illustrator using the pen tool; Ann Paidrick's mindblowing, realistic dishes of glistening tomatoes and olives; and Yukio Miyamoto's awesome illustrations of a cat, a French horn, and a motorcycle, so detailed, you can't believe they are vector-based. This work is truly inspiring.  In no time, you'll be more creative, work more efficiently, have more fun, and never let anyone borrow your book! <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>This book has a lot of artworks inside it, every artwork are used to explore advanced tecnics, some of then are avaible on the cd so you can explore it. 
<br />To use this book you have to know the basics of this software. For novices I recomend the Anessa Hartman "Exploring Illustrator CS".</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I'm new to Illustrator, having only experience in Photoshop. This book was not designed with me, a beginner, in mind. The first 40 pages are filled with "new & improved in Illustrator CS" tips, which make little sense at all to a person who's never used the program, even when sitting in front of the PC with the book open. The Zen of the Pen section, designed as a finger exercise to get a person used to clicking with the right hand and using shortcut keys with the left hand, is confusing, and lacks enough step-by-step info for a true beginner to get through it and feel confident. 
<br />
<br />The accompanying CD has lots of finished art on it, but no tutorials, and seems to be organized in an unusual structure. It's as if the author is using her book to showcase her fellow artists' work and not to show exactly how these things were created. There are a few deconstructing exercises, but again, not very beginner-oriented. I longed for bezier curve exercises, how-to's, etc., but was left disappointed. The CD is useless for learning, to be blunt. 
<br />
<br />I would have given this a 2 if not for the wonderful color illustrations, and the fact that it's probably and excellent book for someone with previous Illustrator experience. I'm using this book for a college class, and about 70% of the class, over half of which HAVE Illustrator experience, are disappointed in the tome's info as well. 
<br />
<br />For a beginner, I'd recommend Classroom in a book, or some other, 1-2-3 type book. I wanted detailed information on how to accomplish concrete tasks, and instead I got a book that skims over techniques with a lot of pretty pictures.</span>

                    <span>I read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them. In addition to this book, I purchased Illustrator CS Killer Tips and Adobe Illustrator CS Idea Kit. Now, not to the insult the author, but this book was horrifying. I felt like I was reading a boring, difficult college textbook! I'm not new to Adobe or the interface, and I self-taught myself Elements and Photoshop. I must say that I was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid, visual detail, and failure to get me intrigued - how could I be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork? I have to find another Illustrator book so I actually learn something...what a dissapointment! The CD was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on CD. Plus, some of the lessons were advertisements for Steuer's online classes. Ha! The only good thing was the art that it did have was in color, and color is good - which is why I gave it one more star than I would've. If you buy it, don't open the CD so you have the option of returning it.</span>

                    <span>The ideas and concepts in this book are excellent.  However, there is a significant amount of redirection...if you like, this look in this chapter, or we'll see more on this later in this chapter.  Combined with the many sidebars and tips, the overall effect is a little distracting, and gets in the way of some very valuable information and concepts.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the better books I've come across as far as learning the tricks that you need to make realistic artwork and almost anything else. The tutorials do take a lot of practice and adjusting on your own to really figure out what they are offering. They dont go over things step by step by step like beginner books do so if you dont have the basics down dont bother. Once you get those basics down though, this should be the first book you get. It teaches you all the tricks of the trade that are necessary to be true masters of Illustrator.</span>
