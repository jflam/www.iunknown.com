                    <span>Author Tyler Williams has written an easy to use and beautifully crafted guide to hikes in Grand Canyon. The routes presented range from simple jaunts to more strenuous overnights and lead you to the must see and lesser known destinations from the river in the Grand Canyon.<P>Clear maps, concise route instructions and hike difficulty ratings help you to plan what to wear and what to carry on your hikes. I really liked the information on best time of year to undertake the hikes in different locales as temperature extremes in Grand Canyon coupled with remoteness, can turn a fun walk into a survival epic.<P>I have used this guide on my Grand Canyon river trip and it will be the first thing I pack in my ammo can for that next trip. The beautiful photos throughout the book are something I look at again and again and they stir the memories I have of sandals gripping on polished limestone, narrow passages leading to cool, green waterfalls, and hot trudges climbing across desert landscapes that give way to heartstopping views.</span>

                    <span>Although you don't have to be going down the Grand Canyon on a raft to get the most out of this guide, this will greatly enhance your experience if you are.<P>This book is jam-packed with the information you want. If you've ever been on a raft and wondered "Hey, what's up that side canyon?", Williams tells you all you need to know, from what mile marker the hike starts at, to where to park your boat and camp, to how long and difficult the hike is and what you'll see. <P>The book includes maps and gorgeous photographs to augment the text, plus background information on the Grand Canyon--geology, history, politics, and folklore--that's just plain good reading.<P>If you're one of the lucky ones who gets to paddle down the Colorado through the Grand Canyon each year, DO NOT GO without this book to take that experience to a new level. And if you're one of the many folks who explores the Canyon by hiking in from the top, here's a book with a bunch of information you don't want to be without.</span>
