                    <span>This is the kind of book that makes my blood boil. 
<br />
<br />1. If bikers are so intent on expressing their individuality, why do they ride around in a herd at thity miles-per-hour wearing identical "baaad" outfits?
<br />
<br />2. Loud pipes don't save lives, they create even more anti-motorcycling sentiment with the general public. Loud pipes will LOSE bikers' rights.
<br />
<br />3. Nam is over, dudes. Have a little self-respect and stop peddling your trauma. Grow up.
<br />
<br />4. What the hell is that typeface all about? Oh, I remember... individuality, again. Right.
<br />
<br />I'm a motorcyclist. Not a biker. I ride alone, and I like it; I like the skill, the grace and the challenge. I'm well aware that I could be killed or maimed at any given time while riding. But that doesn't qualify me to write this kind of pseudo-philosophical claptrap.
<br />
<br />Save your money. Buy a copy of... ANYTHING else.</span>

                    <span>After reading this book, and the reviews found here, I can't help but believe that all the positive reviews come from:
<br />
<br />1. Rich Urban Harley Riders
<br />2. Friends of the author
<br />3. Both
<br />
<br />This is pretty light weight stuff that has very little to do with riding a motorcycle. But then again...there aren't a lot of motorcyclists. There are a lot of people who own motorcycles. Before you order it from Amazon.com pick the book up at your local bookstore. Glance through it. Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you think $25,000 is a reasonable price for a Harley. </span>

                    <span>I was just a kid when I was sitting on the back of a bike and holding on for dear life. My arms around these two wide shoulders holding on with a vice like grip. I trusted my father and I knew he would never put me in danger. I remember the sound of the engine and the wind as we broke through some kind of a sound barrier or something. The sharp turns that we didn't slow down for and for sure I was going to fall off.The sounds and the screaming of the wind were a memory I grew up with.I didn't realize it then but it was the most exhilarating memory of my life.<br>It all came back as I breezed through my new copy of The Biker Code. Was it the fear of getting on the bike or was it just something that I just never got around to doing?<br>Every page brought me closer to that memory so very long ago. Did I just see my old man on one of the bikes or was I just looking for him? Why did I run away from it? Is it not to late? My God, how I just love all of those free spirited souls on every page. Is it not too late to go back to those memories?<br>A great book. An emotional journey. Maybe a dream that can be lived again.</span>

                    <span>This book changed the way I drive around bikers...because I didn't really understand their vulnerability, AND because I didn't appreciate their strengths.  This book shows a side of bikers that non-bikers (like myself) need to see.  It is both beautiful and moving.</span>
