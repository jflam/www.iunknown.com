                    <span>    Well this book is about a very funny man by the name of Tim Allen . The title of this book is Tim Allen Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man. He talk about child life as a boy , mostly about guy stuff. Also he would talk about his teen boy life like he smoke just to be cool and just a girl that he didn't even get . He also gives us some what guy tips about a girls. Like don't let a girl some what run your life. He tells us guy we are the man in the relationship . You would also read about his time when he went jail for selling drugs and he tells us that he wish he could go back in time. He also went to prison and he say never go there because there are a lot lunatics in prison. He talk about what he did on his free time like he fix up cars like he would put in a new stereo system and fix the engine so it would go fast and etc . Also he say that all guys have secrets and they should never be said or told . 
<br />
<br />    What think about this books is that it is a great book . I would tell people to read this read this book ,but I would recommend this book to only guy or girl that want to know about guy stuff. When I read this book I could some what say my life is some what like his . If I had to rate the book 1 to 10 I would rate it 8 . When you are reading the book it is like he his talk to you face to face . It is also like he is joking with you while you read his book.

                    <span>Here's another book that clearly is an attempt to take advantage of the success of a television show.  I enjoy Tim Allen's humor and thought his show was pretty good, and was expecting more of the same in this book.  There is a lot of very funny material in this book, and I frequently laughed out loud. I especially enjoyed the chapter entitled "The Secrets Men Never Tell Women" (no, I'm not going to tell--you'll have to read the book!). Surprisingly, though, Tim Allen also reveals a philosophical side here as well. Parts of this book are quite thoughtful and reflective, and show a surprising depth. I definitely can relate to much of the material in the chapter on fatherhood. This is a fun book that also provides a little food for thought.

                    <span>i thought this was going to be like his show, but it was a bit different.  I also liked reading the book by the "eight rules" guy (the john ritter show) and the "welcome to the nuthouse" book by peter mckay.  those books are about the humor in the american family.</span>

                    <span>I'm a woman and it was pretty funny...it's a bit offensive at some times but anyone with a good sense of humor will absolutely love it! I always liked Tim Allen and it's a good book from a "man's man" point of view!</span>

                    <span>I first saw Tim Allen on Home Improvement and thought he was great.  Then I saw every movie he was in and they were great.  I, unfortunately, have not had the chance to see his stand up acts (although i hope to shortly).  I bought this book with a little hesitation because of the title.  But once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  This book is very frank on his early sexual experiences. (I personally liked the part of the poster).  I would not recommend it to the child fan of his tv show because the jokes are either too vulgar for little kids or they may not get them the way they were intended.  Anyone else that enjoys uncut humor should buy this book.  I guarantee you that you will not regret the decision.</span>
