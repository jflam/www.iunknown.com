                <span id="Label1">Web services, the new way of stitching data and processing resources together to form elaborate, distributed applications, aren't like other software systems. They differ even from other architectures for distributed applications. In his fantastic <I>Understanding Web Services</I>, Eric Newcomer helps his readers figure out what Web services are all about. This book is better than any other book out there in helping readers come to grips with the terms, technologies, behaviors, and design requirements that define the Web services universe. It's remarkably light on code--Newcomer's logic appears to be that you should dig into the details of implementation only after you thoroughly understand the design concepts--and emphasizes definition and exposition of SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and ebXML.<p>Newcomer's work looks and reads almost like a notebook, with succinct statements in the margin (for instance, "SOAP processors first have to check the mustUnderstand attribute, if any"), adjacent to paragraphs that go into greater depth. He's careful to call attention to differences among the relevant standards documents, and points out differences among implementations. Graphical learners may wish for more conceptual diagrams, as there aren't a lot of them here. Newcomer's prose is brilliant, though, and it's pretty easy to determine what he means. Perhaps best of all, Newcomer isn't cheap with his opinions and forecasts. It's helpful to read his informed feelings and predictions. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> The specifications, implementations, and popular trends that define the Web services movement. Conceptual coverage of Extensible Markup Language (XML), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL), and the Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) protocol fills these pages. Emphasis is on how it all works rather than on how to program for it.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I've found to date on web services. It sits half way between what I call the protocol books (you know: the O'Reilly sea-creature series) and strategy books such as the one I'm currently writing. What impressed me most was the book's thoroughness. Although it's clearly aimed at developers and includes a fair number of XML examples, the book contains few code listings. (When you're ready for that, you need the sea-creature books.) Instead, Understanding Web Services gives equal time to technology, standards, strategies and Eric's own perspectives on the offerings of the major vendors. (Eric is the CTO of IONA.) If you want to know what web services are all about, with an emphasis on the technologies, this is the place to start. I only wish this book had been available when I was ramping up.</span>

                    <span>Eric Newcomer's book was written for the well read architect, technically minded manager, or developer who is interested in more than just bits and bytes. If you are interested in 'how to implement a Web Service in language X or Y', then look else where. If you have the mind for the bigger picture then this is the book for you. Although Eric Newcomer is CTO of IONA this book does not suffer from the typical vendor marketing hype that one has to typically wade through, more importantly being involved in the major organisations defining the Web Service standards he is able to give you an up to date well balanced opinion of where each technology (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI etc) is heading and problems facing each one. <P>For an architect or manager who has the responsibility of planning the future EAI strategic direction for the company this book provides an honest basis to make well informed decisions e.g. does one move towards ebXML now or wait, or choose SOAP, WSDL, UDDI as they appear to be heading. The book is easily read, starting with the basics, moving on to the core technologies making up Web Services, then to the less well known technologies being floated, finally to an overview of the product offerings from the major vendors. No book can be all things to all people and where Eric Newcomer has thought appropriate he has referred the reader to further reading.<P>In summary I can highly recommend this book to those who want to know:<P>- what are Web Services, <BR>- where do they fit in to my organisation, <BR>- where are Web Services heading and the problems they face, <BR>- who/what are the main driving forces behind Web Services, <BR>- how do the technologies (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI etc) fit together,<BR>- what other technologies are currently being floated.<P>Web Services are posing an exciting future as a mechanism for 'globalising' the world of bits and bytes, this is a great book to come to grips with the world of Web Services.</span>

                    <span>I have been thrown into the web services technology without a parachute and this book has helped to put things into perspective. You are not going to sit down and write code from this book, but it does help to define all of the pieces of web services technology and get you started.<P>With that said, this was a difficult book to read because the writing style is very abrupt, does not flow, and reads like an old style academic textbook trying to impress and confuse the student. I've read more technical books that were easier to understand because they explain their subjects in more natural prose. I found myself frequently reading pages over one or more times.</span>

                    <span>This book is about the data side of XML as opposed to the document side. It is the first excellent (and mature) one I read so far. It gives a thorough introduction to all relevant subjects. Its chapters are often more helpful than an entire book devoted solely to the chapter topic. Especially helpful I found a lot of explanations for seemingly simple or trivial things that nobody else explained and I admittedly did not dare to ask.</span>

                    <span>Very nice book. I have been following some great technolgies over the last 10 years. With Web services, I was overwhelmed with the bundle of various APIs, tools, standards, specifications that emerged. This is a well written book for aspiring Web services enthusiasts. Almost all the chapters are covered in depth with high-level introductions to the technologies.</span>
