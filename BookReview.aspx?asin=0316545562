                <span id="Label1">It speaks to the failure of medieval Europe, writes popular historian William Manchester, that  "in the year 1500, after a thousand years of neglect, the roads built by the Romans were still the best  on the continent." European powers were so absorbed in destroying each other and in suppressing  peasant revolts and religious reform that they never quite got around to realizing the possibilities of  contemporary innovations in public health, civil engineering, and other peaceful pursuits. Instead, they  waged war in faraway lands, created and lost fortunes, and squandered millions of lives. For all the  wastefulness of medieval societies, however, Manchester notes, the era created the foundation for the  extraordinary creative explosion of the Renaissance. Drawing on a cast of characters numbering in the  hundreds, Manchester does a solid job of reconstructing the medieval world, although some scholars may  disagree with his interpretations.</span>

                    <span>This is quite a work of art. Bringing a fascinating and fundemental period in Western Civilization to "light". Many people are fascinated by History and its causes, yet those same eager minds are clueless to the motivations and events that shaped our World during the 1000 years, after the fall of Rome to the why the Renaissance even happened. This book answers questions I never really knew...Protestantism, Inquisition, Bad Popes, Humanism, Visogoth, Henry VIII, Erasmus, Huns...its all here. The desire for knowlege on the subject is there, the problem is the dirth of vibrant materials and that exist seem to be an esoteric and mundane examination of specific events or Characters...the type of writing that is better left to the researcher or the student who is forced to read. <P>Manchester is an awesome storyteller who combines a tremendous knowledge of his subject with a wit and insight that makes for a fantastic read. It is very hard if not impossible to put this book down. To know that the facts are right on, the characters were very real, and the events are the foundation of who and what we are as nations, families, congregations and people is just the biggest buzz you can get from reading. It opens your mind up and creates a desire to know more and a sense of satisfaction that you now have a grasp of knowlege that before you read this was just a cloudy picture. I have urged everyone I know to read this book, it is like having a brillant friend telling you a tale by the campfire. Just a WOW read.<P>The negative reviews in here have been emotionally motivated. The facts in this book are well researched. The critics I have read here are mostly abolisionistic, book burners, and religious zealots who do not like anything that does not support there causes without question. Luther was not "God Like", John Calvin was an egomanical Theofacist, The Popes were not "All Saintly" and Christian motivation for slaughter and torture of there fellow man in the name of Jesus was not a fiction made up by the devil to discredit God. Allow yourself to enjoy and learn.</span>

                    <span>Whether you are looking for a spectacular read, are a student or just a history buff, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is of a caliber that is equally enjoyable to any of the above readers. <P>Beginning with a glimpse into the medieval European's mind, Manchester goes on to describe the key events and personalities that led to the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation - both of which are firmly rooted in the medieval tradition, both irreversably changing Europe into a modern society. The book is magnificent. Even though I am very familiar with the era, Manchester's writing kept me in rapt attention. In writing about individuals such as Lucretzia Borgia and Martin Luther, you truly get a feel for them as real people, not just dry names and dates as is so often the case in histories. Manchester also does a remarkable job of clarifying and explaining the events which were so influential to European (and world) history: the birth of the Renaissance, European exploration of the world, the Protestant Reformation, the Columbian exchange. <P>A World Lit Only By Fire is entertaining, fascinating and historically accurate. I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have - I strongly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I have been reading a variety of books in the last year in a personal pursuit to learn more about the middle ages. My neighbor lent me this book and I am now buying it for my own collection to read again later. <P>I found the book to be extremely well-written and challenging -- in more ways than one. The reviewers here have done a good job of summarizing some of the finer points of the text, and yes, I found discrepancies with some historical facts. But, those discrepancies were minor in light of the overall message of the book. Mr. Manchester was clear about his purpose at the beginning -- demonstrating how all things are intertwined and related. One little-known piece of information in this book that illustrates this philosophy that I found rather intriguing: the mother of Prince Henry the Navigator was influenced greatly by Chaucer who had a deep interest in maps and star-charting. She, in turn, infused this interest in her son. How different would European navigation and discovery have been without that influence? Just an interesting what-if to ponder...<P>The negative reviews I have read on the book did not provide any good reason to avoid it. In fact, most stated that they they did not agree with what Mr. Manchester has written, but there is nothing wrong with disagreeing with a book. It is certainly does not make it a bad book. I have read many "bad" books, meaning poorly written, no purpose, no direction, lacking any real depth, and so on. In my opinion, this book does not match any of this criteria. <P>As one reviewer wrote, you really have to read many books on a given subject to get a more-rounded understanding. I would highly recommend using this book as a piece in the puzzle of understanding medieval life, and learning a bit more about the characters that we all have been exposed to in some form of education. It was refreshing to read some history in an entertaining format -- in story form and where the characters were more humanized.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up at an airport bookstore, hoping for something interesting and informative to read on my trip to Italy. What I found instead was a historian's version of the National Enquirer - lurid, overly sensational, and thin. I'm just as fond of a good Pope orgy story as the next person, but I object to shoddy research in pursuit of one. My knowledge of the timeperiod covered is slightly better than that of the average person, but I'm no expert, which means that when I start finding factual errors in a history text, something went very wrong.</span>

                    <span>I think William Manchester is trying to make a point here. He's honest about it, unlike other modern scholars trying to hide their bias in a veneer of "Objective Scholarship" like Ed Said and others (for which I recommend "The Muslim Discovery of Europe" by Bernard Lewis, who reminds us that 'non-Westerners' view the 'West' through their own lenses, 'Occidentalism', as well).<P>Anyway,Manchester here is pointing out to layman several ideas that we generally don't think about.<BR>1. Reinforces the idea that the vast majority of peasants don't know that multiple times there are two or three competiting Popes.<BR>2. That illiterate peasants with nothing to do, find something to do, like fornicate. This idea of good little honest serfs just stitching their clothes, dancing in lederhosen or whatever, and singing hymns all winter is absurd. We think that when medieval Priests moan about all the fornication in cities and villages across Europe, they're just being zealots. Maybe they were being honest. <BR>3. That for all the complaints about how rough we have it in the West today, it was once a whole lot worse.<P>He gives alot of color to people who many have revered as heroes. Like Luther, or some of the Popes. Some people don't like the truth about Luther's profane rantings (he was the son of a miner after all!) or the inequities of the Medici brats whose Papacy was brought (do you think they instantly became pious men from spoiled plotting children once they become Popes?)<BR>I think the people who don't like this book don't want their "El Cid" and "King Richard" fables de-bunked. They want their staid history from an eagle-eye view, of the battles of Agincourt and Tourneys and dates and places, but when it comes to humanizing the late Medieval/Renaissance men of history, their fantasies come under attack and they react with repulsion.</span>
