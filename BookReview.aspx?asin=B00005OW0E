                <span id="Label1">Throughout the ages, we return to the water in search of peace, relaxation, and tranquility.  Maybe that's why an aquarium is so mesmerizing, so serene.  The Aquaria series is for everyone.  It's designed for people who want easy relaxation, as it is great to watch or simply leave on as a visual and audio background for life around the house.  Aquaria is a serious program about aquarium fish and sea life.  If you're thinking of building or adding to your aquarium, Aquaria allows you to preview designs and fish.  It also gives you important information about each fish, including care, handling, and tips for first-time buyers.  The screensavers, calendars, and downloads are fun and add to your computer enjoyment.  It's even for people who want an exciting aquarium in their home without all the work and mess.  <I>Aquaria: The Complete Aquarium Collection</I> collects five exciting aquariums in the Aquaria series.  Each has the same high quality and is a unique aquarium: <I>The Exotic Aquarium</I>, <I>The Natural Aquarium</I>, <I>The Freshwater Aquarium</I>, <I>The Classic Aquarium</I>, <I>The Coral Reef Aquarium</I>. </span>

                    <span>Earlier this year I saved my pennies and bought a 50" plasma screen. It's great for home cinema but when I'm entertaining guests and not watching the screen, it's a large black hole on the wall of my living room, until now that is.<P>This DVD is the perfect solution. Instead of being faced with a boring featureless black void, my guests can now gaze at my fabulous collection of marine fish. The bonus is, I never have to clean the tank or feed the fish! I bought the Coral Tank version but I assume they are all variations on a theme and would perform more or less the same function. <P>I Take on board what other viewers have said about the size of the fish on a smaller screen, but on the plasma screen, the proportions are perfect and I think, very realistic.<P>The DVD also has some extra features for your PC including a fishy screen-saver, which gives a slideshow of each of the inhabitants of the tank. It also has printable high-quality photos in PDF format and a copy of Acrobat Viewer if you do not already have it. <P>I love it and I intend to buy the other versions!</span>

                    <span>This is the worst attempt of an aquarium I have ever seen. Having a plain fish bowl with one fish would have been better. Basicaly the camera stays in one spot, with may be 2 fish to look at, and they barely move around. Then to make it worst the background is void of any color, its just gray and horrible. I got my DVD and through it into the trash. If I had a fire place I would have burned it! This DVD is only worth .99 cents at the .99 cent store.</span>

                    <span>I have a two month old daughter, and we heard from a friend that an aquarium really entertained their son. We can't afford the cost and upkeep of a real aquarium, so I found this on Amazon.com and purchased it. I put my daughter in front of the tv to any one of the aquarium types on the cd, and she is mesmerized. A really neat feature is a close-up option of each aquarium, and the fish are displayed larger on the screen. This view really captures my daughter's attention - the bright colored fish, coral, and lights keep her eyes darting, and tones down her fussing - allowing me to get things done around the house. ANYONE WITH BABIES - ORDER THIS NOW! It is such easy entertainment, and I am sure it really helps develop their senses! Great video - very real to life.</span>

                    <span>What a waste of time, money and effort! This must be the worst screensaver ever made! It looks like the screensaver was made by an 8 year old kid with a very cheap and old camcorder! Rarely in focus; this screensaver is just plain junk. I really don't know how this ended up on the retail market! Don't buy this one!</span>
