                    <span>I've been a Charlotte Moss fan for years, beginning in the late 80's when she opened her decorating shop in New York City in the 1980's and consider her books, "A Passion for Detail" and "Creating a Room" to be my very favorite interior design books (and I have quite an extensive collection).  So, when I understood that her latest design book, "Design Inspirations" was being published, I was very much looking forward to it and ordered it sight unseen.  Sadly, I found it quite disappointing and not nearly in the same league as her other decorating books.
<br />
<br />First, I should explain that the book examines four rooms that she has designed in recent years for interior design showhouses in NYC.  It is not her rooms that I find fault with -- all the rooms are absolutely gorgeous, as I have always found her designs -- but the book itself is the disappointment.  Unlike her previous efforts, this book is a thin volume -- not even 100 pages in total -- and unexpectedly small -- not much larger than a standard paperback.  It is not the substantial, coffee table beauty that I've come to expect from this author.  The illustrations are lovely, but there's very little text at all and I don't imagine the author spent much time writing the text and organizing the illustrations.  In addition, one of the four rooms, the bedroom, has been covered and illustrated extensively in at least two recent home decorating magazines. The other three rooms are also well illustrated on her website, so there will actually not be too much new to be found in this book.          
<br />
<br />Maybe it's me, but this book seems more like a little companion guide -- with some pretty illustrations -- to the showhouses in which she participated, than the beautiful and substantial "Passion for Detail" that I have revisited with enjoyment many times since it was published almost 15 years ago.  In summary, I probably would still have bought this book, had I seen it first, but it would not have been the automatic purchase I thought it was when I ordered it.
