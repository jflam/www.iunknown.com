                <span id="Label1">When connoisseurs speak of wine as a long-term investment that can appreciate in gustatory (and monetary) value for decades, they usually refer to red Bordeaux, France's biggest and longest-lasting wine. But as the cachet of Bordeaux continues to attract legions of wine fanatics across the globe, the 90s have seen Bordeaux prices skyrocket. The importance of informed buying has never been more acute, and Parker's guide is simply the best available. Updated from the original 1985 edition, the third edition of <i>Bordeaux</i> is organized along the same lines as the region's wine classifications. After introducing the style, history, and techniques specific to each principal appellation, Parker discusses the featured ch&#226;teaux in detail--from the techniques of the vintners to the peculiarities of the all-important <I>terroir</I>. Parker's ratings for the tasted vintages, based on the 100-point scale he popularized through <I>The Wine Advocate</I>, are the real crux of each winery's listing. Performing all his tastings in "single blind" style--where each wine is judged without knowledge of the price or producer, and only in context with similar wines--assures a measure of independence in the tastings. Big-name wines are often deflated, and many "also-rans" from the landmark quality classification of 1855 finally win their deserved recognition.<p> The third edition naturally highlights the series of (mostly good) vintages that Bordeaux has seen since the release of the second edition in 1991, but it also includes updated tasting notes on the vintners and vintages Parker has revisited since that time. His opinions command such worldwide attention that, given time, either your palate or your wallet is bound to benefit from keeping up with Parker's advice. <I>--Todd Gehman</I></span>

                    <span>Comprehensive and generally trustworthy information. A critical analysis, from the standpoint of a wine buyer like myself should not dissuade anyone from getting this useful and professional guide. The way Parker evaluates wine is not fool proof- but he is right 95% of the time. That in itself makes him better than almost any peers considering the sheer volume of juice he tastes. For the initated and value seeking with a professional slant, it would be nice if Mr. Parker would spend more time looking at Entre deux Mers for both red and white. Professionalism and compentency has increased there and it is not the land of co-op's and swill that it once was. Also, I would like to see more attention paid to petit chx. But then again, the sheer fact that they are not in his book keeps the price down for some of my best petit estates. There are also some worthy Lalande de Pomerol and Castillion sites he has not caught onto or he omits for lack of consistancy. I'd like him to thicken the book up with a bit of this and less on what we know is great (Clasified Growth top stuff) One thing, Cru Classe wines are bad too sometimes and Parker pulls no punches when they ship out a real looser. He can find you relative bargains, like Chx Tayac in Bourg (had 82 in mag last week- fantastic). So get the book if you want to know anything about Bordeaux. Robert Parker has kind of been black listed in Burgundy- this is too bad. He knows his stuff and some minor discrepancies should be overlooked. Cant wait for a Parker / Rovani Burgundy to be released.</span>

                    <span>This book is comprehensive and informative and should be added to the library of any serious wine lover. However, it is important to bear in mind that Robert Parker has very definite views on what a great Bordeaux wine should be! Wine, of course, is very much like art - the beauty is in the eye of the beholder! It goes without saying that if you enjoy your wines black and tannic and undrinkable for the first 15 years then Robert Parkers famous points system is for you! It is probably better to ignore his points system altogether as a wine with 85 points could well be vastly superior to a wine with 95 points , depending on whether you are looking for elegance rather than inky blackness. It is also worth noting that wines such as "Cantemerle" are sometimes penalized by Parker for being light coloured and elegant rather than a blockbuster heavy wine (such as Latour). Hachette produces a much better wine guide which presents a more balanced view on wine appreciation. It helps undo the damage which is rife in America - many wine consumers feel obliged to serve only wines with 90+ points , thereby missing out on an ocean of extemely delicious and elegant wines which Parker only rates with 85 points.<P>Good drinking!</span>

                    <span>I consider this to be by far the best book on Bordeaux. While I do not agree with Parker or just about anyone else regarding the rating of Italian wines, Parker is right on target in his ratings for Bordeaux. I find it interesting that Parker is a fan of the rich and opulent micro wines coming out of Pomerol and St. Emilion. There are strict Bordeaux traditionalists that don't care for these wines. I think they are great and agree with Parker. They simply add another dimension to the many styles of wine being made in the greatest wine producing area of the world. Parker is extremely consistent and the only other taster that comes close is Stephen Tanzer. The Wine Spectator and James Suckling are pretty good, although I think they overrate too many wines in subpar vintages. Ironically, Spectator is not a big fan of the decadent wines Parker likes from the right bank.</span>

                    <span>One reviewer noted that this really comes closer to a buying guide than anything else. I suppose that is true, but it is much more, also. It is easy enough to write histories of Bordeaux, and many are very entertaining, such as D. Markham's work on the 1855 Classification. But when most of us pick up a recent Bordeaux work, isn't it more helpful to hear more than "Chateau Lafite is a first growth and has produced good to excellent wine in x, y and z vintages, and many others." This is a book that takes a stand. And quite frankly, Parker's Bordeaux palate is as good as anyone's in the world. You don't have to agree with everything he says on every wine to recognize a master at work.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who has looked up this title is probably already aware of its obvious virtues, so I won't belabor them. I point out some flaws here to better show what this book is and what it is not.<P>1. Parker emphasizes disproportionately the classified (and pricier) growths. Many crus bourgeois make it in the book, but the information on them is more scant than the more glamorous estates. And even on the top tier of producers, Parker neglects affordable alternatives: e.g., of the five first growths, Parker includes significant coverage of only one second wine (Les Forts de Latour). If crus bourgeois and fifth growths merit their own subsections, surely so do Carruades and Pavillon Rouge, no? It would also be nice if the book reviewed more "undiscovered gems." Several that it does unearth (Corbin Michotte in St. Emilion, du Moulin Rouge in the Haut-Medoc) leave one thirsting (ahem) for more.<P>2. Much of the information is of the technical variety. Parker supplies the number of vineyard hectares, average tonnage per harvest, and so on, for most chateaux, but often omits the histories that make each estate unique, which would make for much more interesting reading in many cases. <P>3. The book's emphasis is very much on tasting notes and numerical scores. This makes it much more of a buyer's guide than an authoritative companion for a Bordeaux lover. Even so, many tasting notes are out of date (last tasted many years ago), so one wonders on these how much information the description (or the score) really communicates. Still a "91" ten years later? Who knows? However, this minor fault is more than compensated for by the sheer volume of notes. Parker reviews for each estate vintages going back decades.<P>The book can keep one occupied and coming back to it for quite awhile, so it's more than worth a purchase price equal to a wine likely to score admirably on the Parker scale.</span>
