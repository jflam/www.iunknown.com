                    <span>2 years ago I attended a Joel Bauer closed-door, industry specific, private seminar designed for people who work in similar fields & arenas as he. It started at 8 PM and ended at 6:30 AM!!!! Why did everyone stay glued for so long?.. And how did he do this? It's simply because he knew what he was talking about, knew it so well, and no one wanted to miss out on the practical, strategic, methodologies only he could share. Joel Bauer has spent his life defining and refining original methods that get people to take action on your thoughts! <P>I took notes all night (as fast as I could) and began to archive and expand on them the next morning, as much as my then weary mind allowed. These notes were golden to me... <P>Untill... I picked up a copy of his book the day it was released. It's more concise, more to the point, and more immediately applicable than my treasured notes. It's clearly written and understandable to anyone who works with people on any level...And if you're reading this...THAT'S YOU! <P>So, In a nutshell if you interact with people for a living, you can't live without this book. <P>If you're my competition, you can.<P>Kerwood</span>
