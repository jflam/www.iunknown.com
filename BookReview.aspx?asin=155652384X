                    <span>This was extremely eye-opening for me. I loved the fact there were black people, young black people, in that time who were collectively doing what they could for us to come up at that crucial period in the late '60s. I don't think the Panthers get the respect they deserve in terms of their part in the Civil Rights era. To some, they had a nonconventional way of getting their message across, but I admired their courage and their intelligence. Hilliard examines everyone who was a crucial part of the movement, including Kathleen and Eldridge Cleaver, Lil' Bobby Hutton, Bobby Seale, Geronimo Pratt, Huey Newton, and others. He also discusses his own personal demons and how it afflicted him as well as the party. All in all, it was a very good read for me and was much needed.</span>

                    <span>This is I think is first book I ever read by a Black Panther Party member. Most certaintly, the BPP was extremely controversial and weighted down with informants, provocateurs, and sell-outs. But Hillard wasn't one of them. He seems to give an honest account of his involvement in the Party. His story will give you great respect for a group of brothers and sisters who dared to take a stand against White supremacy, police brutality, and other forms of injustices. His is an inspiring story.</span>

                    <span>David Hillard and Lewis Cole's This Side Of Glory (1-55652-384-X, $18.95) provides the autobiography of Hillard and his involvement with the Black Panther Party. The Party's history, focus, and events are revealed in this eyewitness account. Essential to any comprehensive ethnic issues collection.</span>

                    <span>This book is very interesting. Hilliard follows the idea of self-criticism throughout this book, leaving the reader with a very broad view of the Panthers. He seems to exclude nothing, he shows the promblems and the  triumphs of this grand party. All power to the people finally came to mean  something to me, instead of being some "crazy sixties thing."  This should be read by all revolutionaries trying to start an organization  and people questioning their government.</span>

                    <span>I am glad that I picked up this book. I was interested in learning about  the BPP, so when I saw this book I bought it.  The book gives an  interesting account of what the BPP was about, and who the  "cadre" were.  I must recommend this for any revolutionary</span>
