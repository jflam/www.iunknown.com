                <span id="Label1">Written for the intermediate or advanced C++ programmer, renowned C++ expert Scott Meyers provides essential techniques for getting more out of the Standard Template Library in <I>Effective STL</I>, a tutorial for doing more with this powerful library.<p>  STL is a hugely powerful feature of today's C++, but one with a well-earned reputation for complexity. The book is organized into 50 tips that explore different areas of the STL. Besides providing a list of dos and don'ts, Meyers presents a lot of background on what works and what doesn't with STL. Each tip is demonstrated with in-depth coding samples, many of which make use of two-color printing to highlight the most important lines of code. (Advanced developers will enjoy Meyers's in-depth explanations, while those who are in a hurry can skip ahead to the recommended tip itself.) <p>  A good part of this book involves using containers, like vectors and maps, which are built into STL. (Besides the standard built-in containers, the author also highlights recent additions to STL like <I>B-trees</I>, which are available as extensions from other vendors.) You'll learn the best ways to allocate, add, change, and delete items inside containers, including associative containers like maps. You'll also learn to avoid common pitfalls, which can result in writing code that is slow or just plain wrong.<p>  Other areas covered in <I>Effective STL</I> cover getting the most out of the 100-plus STL algorithms that are bundled with this library. Meyers shows you how to choose the correct algorithm for sorting and other functions. (Even advanced developers will learn something here.) Sections on using function objects (called <I>functors</I>) round out the text. Meyers shows you when these classes make sense and the best ways to implement them. Besides specific tips, you'll get plenty of general programming advice. A useful appendix shows the limitations of STL as implemented in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and how to overcome them.<p>  Overall, <I>Effective STL</I> is a really invaluable source of programming expertise on an essential aspect of today's C++ for anyone who is using--or planning to use--STL in real production code. It is quite simply a must-have. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Introduction to advanced Standard Template Library (STL) programming techniques <li>50 tips and best practices for STL illustrated with sample tutorial code <li>Choosing containers <li>Efficient copying of elements inside containers <li>Removing, erasing, and cleaning up items from containers <li>Using custom allocators with STL containers <li>Thread safety with STL <li>Tips for programming with the STL <I>vector</I> and <I>string</I> classes (including reserving memory and calling legacy C/C++ code) <li>Tips for associative containers (including comparing items, sorted vectors, and non-standard enhancements to STL) <li>Tips for selecting and using STL iterator classes <li>STL algorithms (including sorting, removing, and comparing items) <li>Using functors with STL <li>General tips for STL programming (including advice for choosing algorithms and understanding compiler diagnostic messages) <li>String locales <li>Overcoming STL imitations in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0</ul> </span>

                    <span>Four years passed when I first read this book, I still consider it a classic on the STL topic.
<br />
<br />The best parts of this book are its analysis although a little bit verbose and rambling. You could come up all the results by yourself through several years industry experience. But, if all these idioms have already been collected and justified by others, why not just take it.
<br />
<br />According to my own experience, if you really want to master STL, the following way is a solid path (I went through it by accident):
<br />1. C++ template programming, or as C++ community named it "generic programming". The whole STL is built on it.
<br />2. foundamental data structures, especially balanced tree, because all associative containers are implemented as some kinds of balanced tree.
<br />3. practical algorithms (not only those on your college textbook) widely used in industrial background, the more the better.
<br />4. solid OO understanding, STL prefers it. For example, when you choose between traditional functions or functors, STL prefer functors. The same between smart pointers and raw pointers, actually iterators are sort of smart pointers.
<br />
<br />After you finish all these steps, STL will become so natural to you, you won't have any surprise.
<br />
<br />Actually I have a "Least Surprise Principle". You can use this book as a tool to gauge your proficiency on STL. When you finish your reading, if you get a lot of surprises, you really need to learn. If you feel some surprises but not a lot, you are already in good shape. If you feel everything in this book is so natural without any surprise, you are master already. Anyway, if you reached this level, don't forget send me a short e-mail, I will take my hat off to you.</span>

                    <span>I'm a professional software engineer.  I write code all day long and have lots of experience with C++, but I hadn't used STL much until recently.  If you're in a similar situation--decent C++ knowledge but not an STL expert--this book is for you.  I haven't even read the whole thing yet, and already I am using patterns from the book to write more effective code.
<br />
<br />Before I started this book, I thought STL was kind of neat. It had some useful containers.  It was nice to be able to use a list or map or string class that had already been tested.
<br />
<br />Boy, was I underestimating the power of STL. This book has made me a big STL fan, but I'm not reviewing the STL now so I'll leave that topic alone... Thanks to Steve Meyers, I have a much better grasp of the capabilities and limitations of STL. I can use it to do a lot more. I write more concise code that's easier to read and debug. I make better choices about which containers to use. I recognize situations where I can use an STL algorithm instead of many lines of my own code. 
<br />
<br />In short, I look at the STL code I wrote before and laugh... I mean, it all works, but the Meyers book has taken my use of (and appreciation for) the STL to a whole new level.  I recommend this book for any C++ developer who isn't already an STL expert.

                    <span>Frankly this is not a beginner's book. You need some deep knowledge of c++ templates and working knowledge of stl to make the best out of this book.<br>Aside from introducing some caveats in STL programming, the main achievement of this book is to introduce the more descent part of STL which is less commonly used. <p>If you only use STL in the same way you use traditional data structure interfaces, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>The only reason I picked up this book was because of his other book Effective C++.  I liked the way he approached things in that book so I decided to pick up this book as well, trusting that I was going to get the same result.  Writing a book on the STL is different however and the formula that worked for Effective C++ didn't work for this one at all.  If you're looking for a book specifically on STL then I would recommend picking up something else before this one.  If you've already read all the books on STL and you're looking for something that'll put some of those pieces together than this might be the one for you.</span>

                    <span>Following in the tradition of his prior books, Meyers delivers another gem with Effective STL.  This one is a must have for your software development bookshelf.<p>I user several STL books regularly and none of them have come close to giving me the in depth understanding that this book has.  Sure, others are better references, beginner guides, etc.. but if you really want to understand what is going on under the covers and how to write -good- STL, this book is your answer.  I have seen suggestions from this book result in massive performance improvements in naively written STL code.<p>Enough said, go pick up a copy .. :)</span>
