                    <span>This is one of the most highly regarded books on software quality.  If you have never read the first edition it was one of the few books that covered software quality in depth, going well beyond metrics and models into strategies for achieving quality, and understanding the underlying principles and mechanics.  That edition had a lot of life left in it, but this second edition is one of the most complete rewrites of any technical book I've read in recent memory, and if you own the first edition you may want to consider retiring it and investing in this edition.<p>While the first edition packed a lot of information in 344 pages, the 560 pages that comprise this edition reflect new chapters and expanded content in the chapters that remain. Here is a list of the new chapters:<p>- Chapter 10, In-Process Metrics for Software Testing<br>- Chapter 12, Metrics and Lessons Learned for Object-Oriented Projects (in lieu of the old Chapter 12 titled AS/400 Quality Management)<br>- Chapter 13, Availability Metrics<br>- Chapter 15, Conducting In-Process Quality Assessments<br>- Chapter 16, Conducting Software Project Assessments (the project assessment questionnaire example in the appendix is a valuable companion to this chapter)<br>- Chapter 17, Dos and Don'ts of Software Process Improvement (contributed by Patrick O'Toole)<br>- Chapter 18, Using Function Point Metrics to Measure Software Process Improvement (Contributed by Capers Jones)<p>Among the new chapters I most like are Availability Metrics (Chapter 13), because of the direct tie to production, and Dos and Don'ts of Software Process Improvement (Chapter 17) because of the practical and objective advice. This book will remain, in my opinion, one of the definitive texts on software quality and is one I highly recommend.</span>

                    <span>Solid information which not covers the basic development lifecycle and it's components but also the bigger picture e.g. predictive analyses, reflective metrics, customer satisfaction measurement, etc. A good read, informative and it won't scare a novice.

                    <span>I use this to teach a class on metrics for Drexel University.The material is inherantly dry, but Kan covers it clearly and well.  Agood balance is struck between product metrics (e.g. reliability) and broader metrics (customer satisfaction).</span>
