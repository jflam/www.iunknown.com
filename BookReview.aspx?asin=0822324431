                    <span>The chosen gay jargon of the "closet" is so woefully inadequate to the historical condition of gays dealing with passing for straight.  I hoped this book might have really seized on the similarities in the dilemma of passing as it affected Blacks and gay people, but unfortunately this isn't the case.<p>The author seems to begin with those intentions, but after presenting some interesting thoughts she simply follows them up with a set of four jargon-laden book reports on works of fiction and that's that. What she has produced could be a text for yet another multicultural lit course, but it sadly misses as a discussion of the phenonmenon of gay passing.  The survivors of the era in which gay passing was a norm for homosexuals are fewer and fewer.  And the passive imagery of "the closet" remains in place, misleading and inappropriate as is to much of the gay past.  <p>It is a shame that there are not traditionally-oriented gay historians dealing with the actual dynamics of gay passing as it affected the lives of millions of men and women. This doesn't come close to being that book.</span>

                    <span>Queering the Color Line is a successful attempt to integrate (no pun intended) queer theory with a historically-based cultural studies methodology, which makes it all the more interesting. Somerville has done  an admirable job taking popular texts and showing how they reflected  contemporary medical and sexological discourses about race and  homosexuality. I would have liked her to build more historical  arguments--which is something I think the previous reviewer was hinting  at--rather than doing these textured readings, but I think Somerville is  pointing the way toward something very exciting. My one criticism is that  she doesn't say anything about the amazing photograph on the book's cover!  Who is it, where was it taken (it's from a Yale archive, but we don't know  anything else about it!), and in what way(s) is Somerville using it!  It's  too good to not remark on.</span>

                    <span>This book is a largely successful attempt to blend together two of the most interesting theoretical innovations--queer theory and critical race theory.  When I first purchased this book, I was expecting to struggle with  a difficult theorectical text but found the book as a whole to be  accessable.  The first three chapters in particularly offer careful nuanced  readings of scientific, literary and movie texts.  As the author states,  however, her readings require that the reader accept different models of  historical proof as a queer reading generally examines the spaces in  between texts.  While as a somewhat old fashioned historian, I would have  liked to have seen better connections; i.e. a more precise cause and effect  relationship between the texts she examines but in fairness it is not her  intention to establish such relationships. I nonetheless found her analysis  provacitive--I really mean this word and am not simply using it to dismiss  the work as some academics do--and suitable for the classroom.  My hope is  that her work will provoke more study and that the relationship between  queer theory and critical  race theory will continue to produce books like  this one.</span>
