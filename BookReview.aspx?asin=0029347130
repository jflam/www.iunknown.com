                    <span>RESTORATION<p>In this book George Will has proven himself to be one of the great political thinkers of our times. His wisdom, although presented in 1992 in Restoration over a decade ago, is still vitally relevant to today and tomarrow and to the future of the American Republic as when he wrote it. <p>I have spent decades as have many other average Americans, being frustrated, over the sorry state of affairs in our nation and especially in our government institutions. <p>Many of us have had a nagging feeling that something was causing our nation to slowly slide into the hands of unconstitutional, unpatriotic, unethical, immoral, greedy, power hungry, elitist who pretend to care about "WE the People." But really care only about padding their own nest, enriching themselves and their families with material and monetary things, and to ensure their political longevity.<p>They seek only to acquire unwarranted influence and with it manipulate the mob and sheepish unenlightened among us for their deviant personal near-treasonous self-gratification.<p>Communism, socialism, mob rule democracy (dispised by our founders)or life-term representative encumbancy, it makes no difference to them, as long as they are on the top of the social aristocracy, and the rest of us are on the bottom. Nepotism and narcissism runs rampant in their ranks and this shows each and every day whether they are conducting business in the House or Senate, or during elections and reelection campaigns. <p>They will, as Bill and Hillary have so eloquently demonstrated, do, say and support anything that will help them get and stay in power, as members of that society of disgusting ladies and gentlemen, known as the 20th and 21st century politician...<p>George will brings all these [] tactics, the senseless selfish unprofessional conduct, the sickening behavior in direct violation of their sacred charges and honor to light. He highlights their failure to respect their sworn oaths and their duty.<p>He explains how and why our political process, our political representatives and our judiciaries have failed us.<p>The devils or evils of our destruction if you will are incumbency, redistricting, subsidies, excessive pay for public service and a retirement system that breeds contempt for the constitution. Do away with these and the world and the nation would begin to heal and we would have a chance of returning to a true patriotically moral public servant like representative democratic-republic.<p>This is a great book, one of the best I have ever read and Mr. Will would get my vote as the man who could help us heal our nations. A must read for one who can stomach the truth of just how bad things have gotten in Washington...</span>

                    <span>Will's case rests on a few suppositions. First, he provides examples of daily life in Congress which show that, first, the ideas of representation and deliberation have been replaced by servitude. Legislators are slaves who bring pork to their districts. Second, he argues that this servitude has institutionalized career politicians, thus making it nearly impossible to defeat an incumbent given his resources, and thus turning the job of legislator into a career, rather than the temporary position it was originally intended to be. Both of these have driven Congress out of balance, its power disproportionate to other branches of government. As it has invaded more into private life and taken over more responsibilities in society, it has become more corrupt and less respected. So the argument isn't one of punishment but of restoration -- a means of strengthening Congress by returning it to its original, limited function. For Will, this means reviving two vital concepts: deliberative democracy and classical republicanism.<p>Without going into too many details, I will say only that I am persuaded by Will's case for term limits, made first in early 1990s.  The last time it was seriously considered was when Newt Gingrich, as speaker, brought the matter to a vote on the floor of the House as a part of his Contract With America. It was one of the few Contract issues to be defeated.<p>Most of George Will's books are compilations of previously published columns. In Restoration, he takes the time to look at in issue -- representation -- in depth. People of all political stripes will benefit from the results, though what they read will not necessarily make them happy. It is one of the most intellectually serious arguments for reform that I've heard. It is also readable and re-readable, making it a valuable, brief look at some of the ideas upon which America was founded. That is no small task.</span>
