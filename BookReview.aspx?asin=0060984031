                <span id="Label1">Jared Diamond states the theme of his book up-front: "How the human species changed, within a short time, from just another species of big mammal to a world conqueror; and how we acquired the capacity to reverse all that progress overnight." <I>The Third Chimpanzee</I> is, in many ways, a prequel to Diamond's prize-winning <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I>. While <I>Guns</I> examines "the fates of human societies," this work surveys the longer sweep of human evolution, from our origin as just another chimpanzee a few million years ago. Diamond writes:<p>  <blockquote>It's obvious that humans are unlike all animals. It's also obvious that we're a species of big mammal down to the minutest details of our anatomy and our molecules. That contradiction is the most fascinating feature of the human species.</blockquote><p>  The chapters in <I>The Third Chimpanzee</I> on the oddities of human reproductive biology were later expanded in <I>Why Is Sex Fun?</I> Here, they're linked to Diamond's views of human psychology and history.<p>  Diamond is officially a physiologist at UCLA medical school, but he's also one of the best birdwatchers in the world. The current scientific consensus that "primitive" humans created ecological catastrophes in the Pacific islands, Australia, and the New World owes a great deal to his fieldwork and insight. In Diamond's view, the current global ecological crisis isn't due to modern technology per se, but to basic weaknesses in human nature. But, he says, "I'm cautiously optimistic. If we will learn from our past that I have traced, our own future may yet prove brighter than that of the other two chimpanzees."  <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I></span>

                    <span>I teach to college students a precis of Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel" book from a UCLA lecture he gave summarizing that work in 40 minutes. His energetic style rushes past dazzling insights that only later cause you to pause and then question them more thoroughly, in retrospect. By then, Diamond's long ahead of you, on to yet another byway along his intellectual marathon. You never can catch up with his pace. 
<br />
<br />Such aplomb can be found in his earlier collection, which suffers a bit by comparison. It lacks the unity that linked GGS. You can find his "later" ideas published in the next decade and more here percolating--"Accidental Conquerors" the raw material for GGS; part five "Reversing Our Progress Overnight" anticipating "Collapse." Without exception, the length of these essays, individually often full of intriguing anecdotes, remains constant. They satisify with analogies as disparate as a Mercedes dealer, a relative from the Holocaust, his toddler's vocabulary, and how bowerbirds' love shacks compare with dating rituals on the Sunset Strip. 
<br />
<br />Their origins in Discover and Natural History magazines reveal also their limitations. Compressing complex theories into a small space for a broad audience is Diamond's admirable skill. Yet, he raises more questions than he can answer. This open-ended approach perhaps stems from his style of lecturing, but on paper it leaves the reader less satisfied than his listeners, I sense. I learned much from each disparate essay, but I never reached the conclusion without feeling a bit shortchanged. His annotated bibliographies document the breadth and depth of his research, and I have nothing but praise for his abilities. Yet, I find in his more unified later publications a more cohesive, if equally debatable, presentation of his very fertile intelligence.</span>

                    <span>I prefer Diamond's sweeping new book, Collapse. It's much less "academic" yet it conveys many of the same ideas. In Collapse, Diamond sketches out the path of cataclysm. Environmental harm, climate alteration, fast population growth, and imprudent political choices were all factors in the ruin of some societies, but other societies found solutions and are surviving. Similar troubles face us today and have already brought calamity to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to muddle through in ground-breaking ways. Despite our own society's apparently limitless possessions and unequaled political power, portentous warning signs have begun to come into sight even in ecologically strong areas like Montana. This is an important book that raises many important questions. Every concerned person should read it.

                    <span> First the good points. Jared Diamond writes excellently and makes some very good arguments, his humanity and morality is evident throughout the book. The later part of the book, which highlights many of the modern worlds more repugnant acts (especially on genocide) is a masterpiece in the critique of human barbarity and it's attempted justifications. Now for the criticism. Jared Diamond seems to have at best a rudimentary understanding of evolution and natural selection, and some of his statements don't stand up to even the most cursory reflection. For example he states 'The winner takes the losers land, sometimes also the losers women, and thus the loser's opportunity to perpetuate genes'. This seems to be a very male centered way to look at the facts (a common mistake throughout the book). It is evident on even a moments reflection that the women so enslaved are the mothers, sisters and daughters of the `loser' and therefore carry the same genes. Again on convergent evolution (and the possibility of extra-terrestrial life) 'radio communication is one of those things that happens to have evolved here..'. When did radio communication evolve? It was discovered and developed through scientific experimentation but it hasn't evolved, not ever. Another inaccuracy is the statement 'Since evolutionary multiplications of species are very slow, natural extinctions must also be slow'. Jared Diamond seems to have an antiquated Neo-Darwinian view of evolution, which doesn't stand up to the actual observations in the fossil record, species explosions are very rapid. He states that mass extinctions are rare events, but this is simply not true, there have been many mass extinctions, which are amply recorded in the fossil record. Mass extinctions occur when the environment changes dramatically and quickly, this has occurred many times. Ecological niches in those conditions remain open, and are usually filled very quickly by pre-adapted organisms (ie those which, by accident can survive the change in environment), which also very quickly adapt, through natural selection to their 'new' niche. These are well-developed arguments first proposed by Niles Eldrige and Stephen Gould, which fit the observed fossil record perfectly. An adequate understanding of the theory of punctuated equilibrium is required for anyone who wants to venture into the world of evolution, and, unfortunately the very gifted and articulate Jared Diamond seems to score very poorly indeed.
<br />
<br />Jared Diamond makes the cardinal sin of stating that 'the vulnerable species get eliminated quickly, and what we see persisting in nature are the robust combinations of species' this statement to me is arrant nonsense. During a dramatic change in environment, for example when Humans first colonised New Zealand, was it the robust species that survived? Well it depends how you define robust. Those species best adapted to life without human predators (ie the most robust in the original environment) weren't necessarily the same ones that were the 'most robust' after Human colonisation, the goalposts had been moved. This is the case with all mass extinctions. So those which were most robust after the colonisation had a pre-adaptive advantage (avoiding humans). But there was absolutely no way of any species 'deciding' to evolve 'avoidance of humans' just in case humans decided to come (none of the species knew of the existence of humans). This is the classic definition of pre-adaptation. It's the survival of the luckiest not survival of the fittest. It's the same with dinosaurs, they were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for well over 100 million years, far longer than mammals (which were around at the time of the dinosaurs), have been the dominant terrestrial vertebrates. So did they suddenly realize 'hey guys mammals are superior lets all die'. No some cataclysmic event (for the dinosaurs, anyway) occurred. Mammals were lucky enough to survive, and then through selection occupied the niches vacated by the extinct dinosaurs. If that dramatic extinction event had not occurred then there is no doubt that dinosaurs would still rule the world and mammals would still be the 'loser' vertebrate. There's an old-fashioned 'Victorian era' view of evolution as being 'progressive' which is just plain wrong, Jared Diamond falls into the trap when he infers that natural selection is the sole force behind evolution (ie speciation), but it is now accepted that natural selection and at least one other force must be behind speciation events. In truth selection is adaptive, and only leads to speciation or evolution during special periods (like just after extinctions). The upshot is that during periods of equilibrium (ie no dramatic environmental catastrophes) then natural selection acts to keep species as they already are, that is already well adapted to their environment. I recomend reading 'Wonderful Life' by Stephen Jay Gould for a more lucid and accurate explanation of Evolution and Selection.
<br />
<br />There are some other poorly argued points in the book. Jared Diamond correctly states that we should not look for 'evolutionary'- (whatever that's supposed to mean) reasons for all our behavioural or physical characteristics, but then goes on to do just that. He looks for selective reasons for all sorts of things, without ever explaining the genetic basis of pleiotropy, which is the fact that one gene can have two or even more effects. That is that a gene can exist for a given reason, but may manifest itself in another, apparently totally unrelated way. So people may be looking for the selective reason for a characteristic that a gene confers upon us by accident, because the gene is required for it's other effect. Getting back to the male centered view of the book, he spends some time on the fact that human males have inordinately (relatively speaking) large penises compared to other apes. He concludes that it's for 'display purposes'!!!!! So it couldn't be due to the fact that human women may have selected for them because that way they have more fun then? Or that there seems to be 'no selective reason' for female infidelity (but plenty for men). So can't women have chosen one male as a 'rearer' and another as a 'donator of genes'. None of these not unreasonable explanations seem to have occurred to the 'male centered' Jared Diamond.
<br />
<br />All these criticisms aside it's still a well written book with lots of humanity and much truth, It's only the selection/evolution bits which lack coherence. </span>

                    <span>This fascinating book provided information about some items familiar to me and some not.  
<br />
<br />     About Testis Size:  "The combined wt. of the
<br />testis in the average man is 1.5 oz.  This may boost the macho man's ego when he reflects on the slightly lower testis weight in a 450 lb male gorilla...but wait: our testis are dwarfed by the 4-5 oz. testis of a 100-lb male chimp!  Why?  Answer: When fertilization is a competitive lottery, large testis enable a male to enter more sperm into the lottery."
<br />
<br />     About Penis Size:  "From the above triumph of scientific explanation we descend to a glaring failure: the inability of 20th century science to formulate an adequate "Theory of Penis Length." The length of the erect penis averages 1.25" in a gorilla. 1.5" in an orangutan, 3" in a chimp, and 5" in a man. Why does the human male need his relatively enormous, attention-getting penis?  Here is a rich field for research." 
<br />
<br />     One chapter concerned the finding of Stone Age tribes in New Guinea in 1938.  These tribes had perhaps as many as 1000 languages, many of them unrelated to any other known language in New Guinea or elsewhere.  Nowadays, some of the descendants of these tribes are flying airplanes and programming computers.
<br />
<br />  Another chapter critizes the efforts of astronomers to communicate by radio to life outside this earth.  "Fortunately for us, the silence from Outer Space is deafening.  Considering how we have treated less intelligent species on earth, any advanced extra-terrestrial who discovered us would surely treat us in the same way."
<br />
<br />     About "The Great Leap Forward:"  Also covered extensively in "A Brief History of the Mind", by Calvin; somewhere between 100,000 and 40,000 yrs ago, we got smarter without changing our external appearance.  "The tools suggest that modern anatomy had at last been joined by innovative modern behavior.  The identity of the ingredient that produced the 'Great Leap Forward' poses an archeological puzzle without an accepted answer."  Diamond thinks that it is "the anatomical basis for spoken complex language."
<br />
<br />     Other chapters included an impressive data spread concerning the always present and continuing genocidal tendencies of man, and a chapter suggesting that the most important factor in differential cultural development is geography. This chapter is the subject of his highly acclaimed book, "Guns, Germs, & Steel." 
<br />
<br />     Parts of the end of the book treats you as if you are in environmental Sunday School, however, I will forgive that, and give this book a 5.
