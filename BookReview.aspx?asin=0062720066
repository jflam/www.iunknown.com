                    <span>I've been writing for years and earned my MFA a few years ago and have loved "What If" since it was introduced to me in my intro to creative writing class.  It's great for beginners to exercise their creativity, fun for people with more writing experience because the assignments allow for creative expansion as well as improvement and various method training, and if I'm ever having a down time when I just don't know what to write but feel the need to get something on paper, the book is perfect inspiration, and sometimes has the tendency to get me started on a story I didn't know I had in me.  Even if it seems elementary, it's hardly that...each exercise can be done once yearly, and every time it's done it will be tackled differently and with growing talent and skill.</span>

                    <span>Anne Bernay's and Pamela Painter have done a good job in giving writers many different kinds of options to jumpstart your writing. I especially like the way the invite you to go beyond your own story and into the characters as well as encouraging the writer to take chances with their own emotions and write from sometimes scary places. I think doing this results in a huge payoff for the writer and puts the writer squarely in the creative journey. 
<br />
<br />There are lots and lots of exercises that approach the writing journey from different points of view. Good for all levels of writers and also a keeper. I think if you are a beginner you'll get something and then if you look back into the pages and redo these exercises in time, you'll get even more out of them</span>

                    <span>I like What If quite a lot.  Although you can't design a class around the book, the exercises contained therein are useful supplements in the creative writing workshop.  Something for everyone.</span>

                    <span>I teach short fiction writing at a college in Michigan.  I've used the first edition of this book for four semesters, and I just had a chance to peruse the second edition.  Great stuff!  The exercises in this book teach the elements of story writing, but they do it in an interesting and interactive way.  Students will learn about Starting in the Middle, Strong Dialogue, Conflict, Endings, Titles, Naming Characters, the Internal Life of Characters, and much more.  I use the text in an introductory course, so I don't get to all of the exercises.  Some cover more advanced issues than others, but this book is helpful to almost any level of fiction writer.  I am a writer too, and every time I use the book with my students, my own stories get a little stronger.  If you're a fiction teacher, try this book.  If you're a writer looking to advance your skills, this book could also be a big help.  You'll find stuff that goes beyond the routine fiction-writing advice.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book hoping to find some new exercises that would help me expand my skills.  But I found most of them too basic for my tastes.  This book might be good for people who are just learning to flex their writing muscle.  But for anyone who has been writing for a few years, don't bother.</span>
