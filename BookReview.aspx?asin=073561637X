                    <span>I was a little mislead with the title. I was expecting a help with a web-oriented database design. I was looking for info on secure design, user management, multi-language support, database clusters, etc...<p>But it does not. Actually it only talks about databases in 2-3 chapters and those are on a real basic level (create tables in Access en simple SELECT statements). <br>All the other stuff is the use of visual studio, Visual Basic, how to drop components, etc.<p>I do NOT recommend this book to any one with some programming expercience. If you know a little VB, made basic ASP(.NET) pages and played around with Access a few times then this book will not teach you anything new.  You will be more with this book: Microsoft Press book "ASP.NET programming with Visual C#.NET", ISBN: 0735619352. All my collegues (8) just loved it.<p>How ever if you have no to very little programming experience, new to dynamic webpages and still in the learning curve of (basic) database use. I would recommend this book.<p>--Wout<p>Web experience <br>* ASP 1.5 year<br>* ASP.NET 3 months.</span>

                    <span>This was very helpful book, full of examples. I like the writer's style, which is concise and moves right ahead. However, I wish that Jim used an increasingly popular method to reference the code-- with colored numbers or something to help call out which line he was explaining. His explanations got bogged down a bit by the way he referenced his own code blocks. Visually beefing this up, would have been welcomed.<p>I found his brief notes and tips to be useful advice- delivered from an experienced programmer to a beginning to intermediate coder. The majority of these were useful points. Authentiction and ADO stuff was good, but I needed more sources as well.<p>It took me some effort to find this MSPRESS edition. I do hope that MSPRESS hasn't discontinued this and that a new revision is in the works. Reccomended.</span>

                    <span>I really loved chapter 1.  Chapters 2 and 3 had way too much reference material without opportunity to use it.  I was trying to memorize too much detail.  Many things were mentioned with the idea they would be elaborated on later.  They could've been saved for later.  I'm only on Chapter 4 but I am really struggling to keep going and I have read many books like this cover to cover.  Because I do not do development in my current role this is a very challenging book for me.  I look forward to getting to later chapters but it is rough going.  I like that examples are Access based, not SQL server-based.</span>
