                <span id="Label1">This new edition of <i>Learning Java</i> has been expanded and updated for Java 2 Standard Edition SDK 1.4.  It comprehensively addresses important topics such as web applications,  servlets, and XML that are increasingly driving enterprise applications. This edition provides full coverage of all Java 1.4 language features including assertions and exception chaining as well as new APIs such as regular expressions and NIO, the new I/O package.  New Swing features and components are described along with updated coverage of the JavaBeans component architecture using the open source NetBeans IDE the latest information about Applets and the Java Plug-in for all major web browsers.  The accompanying CD-ROM provides all you need to start working with Java immediately. In addition to the many example programs from the book, the CD includes the complete J2SE SDK 1.4, the NetBeans IDE, the Jakarta Project's Ant make utility and Tomcat application server as well as BeanShell, a simple open source Java scripting language developed by author Pat Niemeyer.  </span>

                    <span>First off, I have experience with programming in C/C++ and a few other languages and I'm familiar with the basic ideas of object-oriented programming. But this book was not one I could start learning Java from. I ended up reading Dori Smith's Java 2 For The World Wide Web (the Visual QuickStart Guide) and had a much easier time figuring out the basics of Java. That book was easy to understand although it's extremely limited in scope. <P>That said, I think the biggest problem I had with "Learning Java" was the steep learning curve at the beginning. The very first examples seem more complicated than they really need to be. That makes it very easy to give up and go looking for another book. If you already know a little bit about Java, then you probably won't be scared off but if this is your first time trying to learn Java, your best bet is to look elsewhere first and come back to this later.</span>

                    <span>Approaching this book as a C/C++ programmer with essentially no knowledge of Java, I was not disappointed. "Learning Java" provides a broad overview of the many facets of Java, and it makes sure to point to other resources when the coverage is superficial. While many topics *are* only covered superficially, the sheer size of the Java APIs makes this necessary; at 826 pages, the book is certainly not a piece of fluff.<BR>Contrary to many reviewers' opinions, I appreciated the conceptual overview that preceded the more concrete chapters; I find that addressing the 'why' first makes the 'how' more intuitive. If you disagree, just skip to Chapter 4 to get started with language constructs!<BR>This book does not always spoonfeed the material; some of the examples require analysis to 'get'; however, I found the accompanying explanations to be sufficient, and I learn more when I have to pay attention. There are plenty of other reference books out there that provide more fluff...<BR>My biggest complaint about "Learning Java" is the lack of attention paid to the examples. Several of them had small, silly errors that prevented them from working as written. For instance, one of the intro examples had a method call that didn't match the signature. In a later chapter, a variable was referenced by an incorrect name. In each case, I was able to fix the problem without difficulty, but it illustrates the lack of attention to detail. When one of the first examples in the book won't compile as written, you are bound to frustrate some readers.<BR>Also, formatting in the examples could be challenging. The coding style tends to be compact and perhaps confusing when learning the language. A few times, indentation was just plain wrong, making transcription and understanding difficult.<P>Despite the weaknesses, I remain fond of this book. After reading it, I feel that I know Java well enough to dive into more complex topics on my own. A review by a careful and knowledgeable editor would probably win over some naysayers.</span>

                    <span>I read through some of the reviews for this book and I agree that this book is best for someone who is new to Java, but not new to object oriented programming. I would imagine that learning programming from scratch using this book would leave a lot of questions unanswered. But for someone with coding experience (like myself) this book offered a well paced overview of the language, some curious details (that would be irrelevant to a beginning programmer) and well thought out and clear examples. I would recommend it to anyone switching from other languages, but with some idea of object oriented programming.</span>

                    <span>As with most people, I usually dig O'Reilly books, but I made a big mistake here. Unlike other "Leaning" books, Learning PERL for example, this learning book did more to put me to sleep rather than teach me anything about Java. There were really only examples in the first chapter, then it lost it's track and felt more like someone's thesis on the subject than a real commercial book.<P>This book was very successful at turning me away from Java and O'Reilly for a while, until I found "Head First Java". If your looking to learn about Java, look at Head First, it's much better, fun and you actually learn something about java, good programming, OO and all the great subjects that come along with those.</span>

                    <span>Learning Java by Patrick Niemeyer & Jonathan Knudsen is one of the best Java books I've read. Most aspects of Java are covered chapter by chapter in chronological order. This is a good book for beginning programmers trying to learn Java or more experienced programmers learning a second language. Everything you need to write<BR>Programs and run your code is included with the book. A complete version of J2SE SDK<BR>1.4 is on the CD in the back of this book. I would certainly recommend Learning Java<P>to beginning as well as intermediate programmers.</span>
