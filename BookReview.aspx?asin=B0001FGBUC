                <span id="Label1">Thanks to Dana Brown's delightful <I>Step Into Liquid</I>, the surfing scene in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, should get a healthy boost. That's because Brown, in the tradition of his father, filmmaker Bruce Brown (<I>The Endless Summer</I>), has captured dazzling images of surfers riding curls in some of the world's most exotic--and sometimes unlikely--places. Besides the action on Lake Michigan, Brown leads us to Costa Rica, where the sport's senior elite (including <I>Summer</I> star Robert August) prove they still have the moves, and Oahu's North Shore, where the legendary Pipeline inspires this quote: "It's so scary, maybe you die a little." Most entertaining is a segment in County Donegal, where the American Malloy brothers startle the locals and meet their Irish counterparts on the grayest ocean imaginable. Great personal stories here, including the tale of Northern California's Dale Webster, who has never missed a day on the waves in 30 years. <I>--Tom Keogh</I></span>

                    <span>I bought this this disc to view overseas but the online licensing really sucks! I get a reject message everytime. Firstly you need to be located in the U.S./Cananda and secondly, it has to be renewed periodically. I had no problems with at all with the Coral Reef Adventure. The distributors and licensing companies had better take a long hard review of their licensing policies.</span>

                    <span>I'd wanted to see this film for a while, but living in Kansas it came nowhere near me to a movie theater (if it did at all).  I finally got around to buying the DVD and watched it last night on my television, and I'm already making plans to run it on my office computer some evening and project it onto a big wall.
<br />
<br />The cinemaphotography is simply amazing.  If you aren't impressed with the shots, you could be one of those poor souls that takes the ocean for granted.  This is a film worth watching over and over again.  
<br />
<br />I replayed the Cortes Bank (Mount) sequence three times last night.  Imagine riding a 66 foot wave!!  If you can find this movie - rent it.  If you love the ocean and respect the stoke, buy this movie immediately.  You won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I don't own this DVD personally, but I have seen the whole documentary.  I found it refreshing and motivating since I haven't picked up a board since I was in middle school.  I particularly like the segment on surfing in Ireland and Northern Ireland and the surfing in Half Moon Bay.  I totally recommend watching this on those rainy days when you have nothing better to do.</span>

                    <span>Seriously this is spilling over with random opinions and ramblings of personal experience. Its a hollywood take on surfing. If you want see a surf movie with soul go watch "Singlefin: Yellow" or "Thicker Than Water" or "September Sessions".</span>

                    <span>I love to watch the best rip and slash or watch insane big wave riders but this is truly a refreshing change from a lot of what's out there with some inspiring surfing as well as reminding us of what it's all about.  I watched this with my granpa, father and nieces and nephews who don't surf and they all enjoyed it.  For me it brought me back to why I braved great whites and 50 degree water in the first place as a kid.  Well done guys.</span>
