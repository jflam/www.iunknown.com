                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b><br>   <p>   The Extreme Programming (XP) methodology enables you to build and test enterprise systems quickly without sacrificing quality. In the last few years, open source developers have created or significantly improved a host of Java XP tools, from XDoclet, Maven, AntHill, and Eclipse to Ant, JUnit, and Cactus. This practical, code-intensive guide shows you how to put these tools to work&#160;&#8212;&#160;and capitalize on the benefits of Extreme Programming.   <p>   Using an example pet store application, our expert Java developers demonstrate how to harness the latest versions of Ant and XDoclet for automated building and continuous integration. They then explain how to automate the testing process using JUnit, Cactus, and other tools, and to enhance project management and continuous integration through Maven and AntHill. Finally, they show you how to work with XP tools in the new Eclipse IDE.   <p>   Complete with real-world advice on how to implement the principles and practices of effective developers, this book delivers everything you need to harness the power of Extreme Programming in your own projects.   <p>   <b>What does this book cover?</b>   <p>   Here are some of the things you'll find out about in this book:    <ul>    <li>    <div>How to automate the building of J2EE&#160;apps and components with Ant and XDoclet</div>    <li>    <div>Techniques for automating Java testing using JUnit</div>    <li>    <div>Procedures for automating servlet, JSP, and other J2EE testing using Cactus</div>    <li>    <div>Ways to automate Swing testing with Jemmy, JFCUnit, and Abbot</div>    <li>    <div>How to manage projects using Maven</div>    <li>    <div>Techniques for automating continuous integration with AntHill and Cruise Control</div>    <li>    <div>How to harness plugins for JUnit, Cactus, and Ant in the Eclipse IDE</div>    <li>    <div>Ways to implement Extreme Programming best practices</div>    </ul>   <p>   <p>   <b>Who is this book for?</b>   <p>   This book is for enterprise Java developers who have a general familiarity with the XP methodology and want to put leading Java XP tools to work in the development process.    </span>

                    <span>Extreme Programming (XP), a methodology developed by Kent Beck and Eric Gamma, has joined CASE/UML as a core practice in professional software development. The central tools for XP (JUnit, Ant, Cactus, JMeter, HttpUnit) are now covered in a practical reference by Richard Hightower that explains how these open source tools should be integrated into a project to achieve XP's benefits.<P>The book follows the construction of an online pet store--similar to Sun's J2EE Blueprint Pet Store but instead of focusing on J2EE technologies, Hightower's example illustrates how XP tools are integrated into a project.<P>The tuturials work through several iterations of the pet store. The baseline version has no connection pooling and no EJBs. It has several JSPs, a few classes that use JDBC, and some tables in a database.<P>The second iteration of the case changes the content management piece of the system to a container managed persistence (CMP) entity bean that implements the backend product management. This iteration demonstrates how to incorporate EJB deployment into Web applications and how to ensure that the unit testing of the category systems still works after the addition of CMP entity bean support.<P>The third iteration of the case study uses an EJB stateless session bean to add pooling of connections and prepared statements. This iteration is used to demonstrate JUnitPerf and show the time savings from pooling prepared statements when the site is hit by many users.<P>The fourth iteration of the case study creates a Catalog TagLib. Cactus is used to test this TagLib. This is an excellent example to learn how to operate and run Cactus tests and how to integrate them into the build/deploy process.<P>The fifth iteration of the case study refactors JSPs using the Apache Struts project. Then, it uses HttpUnit to test that the application still works. The HttpUnit test is run against the baseline and new version to show that the requirements are still met.<P>The sixth and final iteration of the case study refactors the Web application to use Exstensible Style Language Transformation (XSLT) instead of JSP to build the catalog view. It then compares the throughput of the two approaches using JMeter.<P>I've found it very difficult to follow the partially finished documentation for many of the useful open source tools needed for full XP. Having a book like Hightower's is invaluable to fully leverage the benefits of the XP movement in mid to large scale development efforts.</span>

                    <span>Note... I've edited my original review. My initial reaction has been assuaged somewhat over time... this book has been a useful tool for me regarding Ant and JUnit.<P>The choice of having the examples targetted toward SQL Server was QUITE disappointing. If you go by the title "Mastering Open Source Tools..." one can only be disappointed when the database of choice for all of the examples is SQL Server. To quote the authors "primarily it is what a large number of developers use." -- then why state that the book is about Open Source tools?<P>True, this is not intended to be a database book, but the examples are there for a reason and I think it is a safe assumption to state that if the reader is buying a book about Open Source tools, they would expect to use Open Source tools for the examples.<P>I wasn't disappointed that this book did not go into detail about XP... other texts are better locations for this information.<P>It would be a much better text if the examples were targetted toward an Open Source DB (MySQL, PostgreSQL).<P>I would; however, highly recommend this text if you have SQL Server at your disposal to utilize the extensive (and worthwhile) examples.</span>

                    <span>Seriously, I can't find any other book right now that lays Maven out in such an easy to approach way. All the material online is reference based entirely and my fingers are practically bleeding from digging through google every five seconds.

                    <span>I bought this book mostly because I am fairly new to open-source development and was looking for a good reference to tools such as Ant, JUnit, Cactus, and Maven. These chapters were concise and had plenty of supporting examples. I also liked the fact that the book provides plenty of tips, and has references to good practices. I definitely recommend it to less experienced developers, or to those looking to have a better understanding of open-source tools.</span>

                    <span>This book is a convenient way to get a decent introduction to Java tools because all of the information is condensed into one book. However, there is nothing in here that you can't read online for free if you take the time to find it. I am really angry that I paid $40 for a book that is full of typos. There are literally typos on every other page. I have never encountered so many typos in a book before this one. The typos are especially troublesome because they often occur in the examples so if you are unfamiliar with the syntax of the new tool being taught you will get unexplainable errors when the bad examples don't work for you. Print out online tutorials, this book is a waste of money.</span>
