                    <span>Elegant. Concise. Opinionated, offensive. Muhammad Ali takes on web publishing. This book does a very good job of explaining why there is no single approach to web publishing. Most books out there tell you how to "Publish in the Web using (insert your favorite platform here)" Philip Greenspun is the first author to come up with an articulated methodology to build web sites that add information value, and he does it by covering a myriad of different tools and explaining why and in which context they work. Although I do not agree with everything in the book (especially the author's claim that LISP is the best programming language ever), no design decision is made without a convincing explanation. Although the design philosophy fluff is pretty good by itself, he has also included enough code so that you can understand how the innards of web information systems work. Must-read for anybody who needs to do anything dealing with databases and the web.</span>

                    <span>If you buy one book on the web this year and you already know HTML, make this book the one, because you're not going to learn anything from the other ones anyway. <P> The quote you're looking for is "Why are they coming to your site? If you look at most Web sites, you'd presume that the answer is 'User is extremely bored and wishes to stare at a blank screen for several minutes while a flashing icon loads, then stare at the flashing icon for a few more minutes.'" <P> The book should really be called something like "Building Web Sites: How To Avoid Wasting Money". Clear ideas, no stupid hype, engaging writing. You may disagree with the concepts, but it's worth reading just to see what he has to say. <P> The text includes a "brain turned on" discussion of just about everything dumb in the web, from four page entrance tunnels to goofy multimedia presentations, to annoying interactive GIFs, to David Siegel. It doesn't tell you how much money you'll make putting up your dumb personal site, and is heavy enough to act as an "authoritative reference" in the general direction of managers that ask for stupid additions to the company site. Sure, you probably don't need a book to tell you all this - just a brain - but it's a fun read and you can look like you're engaging in "professional development" at work. See if you can get them to pay for it. <P> There's also a lot of discussion about how to interface a web server with a database. It's good, but it's not what makes this book great. <P> Added bonus: the best diagrams I've ever seen in a computer book, drawn on napkins. The lack of transition to goofy line art made them a lot easier to read. <P> The text, along with comments on the writing of the book, are available online at http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/wtr/dead-trees/ but I recommend just reading his comments and then buying the hardcopy. For one thing, you can read it anywhere rather than driving yourself blind reading a one inch thick book on your computer monitor. For another, you can hit people with it. This is one of the key qualities for a good web product, and the paper weight here really delivers. Sure, you could probably print out the entire web site and do the same with that, but the pages would fly everywhere afterwards. <P> I'd like to think that sending money in the direction of books like this would cause the industry book quality to improve as well, but my experience in the computer book publishing industry (whose marketing plan most closely resembles dumping the cesspool on the audience and hoping everyone gets wet) tells me otherwise. At least give your money to Greenspun, who deserves it for writing such a good book (and pukey green color, too!).</span>

                    <span>Philip Greenspun is a rare find: a techie who knows how to communicate. He doesn't even limit himself to one media! While other books may take a schlolarly approach to building websites, Greenspun's story is told by someone who's rolled up his sleeves. As the reader, you get to view web-database design through Greenspun's eye for detail. All tech books should be this good.</span>

                    <span>This book focuses on the goals of Web site design rather than the nuts and bolts. Although the book contains specific code fragments, it is not a coding book. Rather it is a chronicle of Greenspun's experiences in setting up more than 50 Web sites over the years. This chronicle contains many hard-won lessons that will help prevent the reader from making similar mistakes. <P> Greenspun has an easy-to-read writing style and a wry sense of humor. (The book has no CD ROM attached to the inside back cover but a picture of a CD ROM with the international "No" symbol overprinted. All code an more is available from Greenspun's Web sites, as you would expect from a book about Web sites.) He also emphasizes esthetic choices and subscribes to a minimalist visual style, in the book and for Web sites, that enhance reading and make downloads as fast as possible.</span>

                    <span>My copy is dog-eared. You can get the book online; I still prefer dead trees in hand. <P> You can read the table of contents and get a feel for the book. But what is best is Greenspun's attitude. <P> I think his best comment is that the hard part is the design and the easy part is to "Write a couple of programs that parse the HTML forms and turn them into actual database transactions". (pg 172) And then he provides examples of doing just this. <P> But as I said, Greenspun has an attitude that is very refreshing.</span>
