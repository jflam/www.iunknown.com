                    <span>If I could burn this book, I would.  It is that bad.  For an "Introduction" book used in an intro MBA class where most accounting types have already tested out of the class it is overly complex and confusing to the layman.  Wordy beyond belief.  The only redeeming feature is its ability to put you to sleep.  Keep it on the bed stand.</span>

                    <span>This was the first accounting book I've ever read when I took my very first accounting class at my graduate business school.  For those who are new to accounting, this is not at all a good introduction.  The authors simply inundate the reader with a plethora of information which is way too wordy and unnecessary at the beginning level.  The authors seem more concerned about leaving nothing out in their writing as opposed to teaching the readers about the basics of the balance sheet, income statement, cash flows, inventory valuations, etc.  It almost gets to the point in which I suspect the authors are simply showing off what they know as opposed to genuinely understanding that a reader like me has no previous accounting background.  The chapter contents are not too logically organized and the explanation of concepts are excessive and unnecessarily complex.  The authors seems to forget that when it comes to teaching accounting to someone who has never took accounting before, they should keep the concepts as basic as possible before going onto more in-detail discussions.  The authors does the exact opposite and explains the accounting concepts from the intermediate point of view first, leaving the reader to come up with his own interpretation of what the basics should be. This is a complete waste of time for the reader, for all students would prefer that the authors get right to the point, directly and clearly, about how to construct a balance sheet, income statement, etc.  The good thing about this book are the highlighted study problems presented in each chapter.  The questions are useful and stimulate good application thinking, and the answers provided are an adequate explanation of how the questions should be answered.  Unfortunately, the authors don't include enough of these study problems. If they had expanded upon these study problems and made them more comprehensive to the relevant chapter material, this book would have been a much more stronger teaching tool.  Instead, we have an unnecessarily complex and not too organized textbook which is not really adequate for the beginning accounting student.  Most of my fellow classmates did not enjoy reading this book and felt that it is an unsatisfactory way to be introduced to the world of accounting.</span>

                    <span>This book is the worst accounting text book I have ever seen. It is poorly organized and full of distracting explanations which turn easy and clear points into long and complex stories. <br>Definately supplier-oriented product by MBA professors.</span>
