                    <span>I'm only writing this to bump up the book's rating a bit and to offer a more positive opinion that the reader might take into consideration. You might assume from some of the reviews here that this is the worst jazz bio ever written, and it's definitely not the case. Shadwick is a fine writer, and his understanding of Evans' work is not in doubt. Sure, there are liner note excerpts quoted in the text, but find me a jazz book that doesn't call on liner essays, among other references. For the most part, Shadwick concentrates on the actual recordings themselves, and in this way, it truly is a "musical biography," tracing Evans' developments over the years as they are heard on record. At best, Shadwick's subjective descriptions/criticisms can offer even the hardened Evans fan (like me) insights into the music, and for the newcomer, it's a handy guide to what he/she can expect to hear. Not only are most of Evans' records examined, but most of the key tracks are discussed in descriptive detail, making for a fairly comprehensive overview.<p>The negativity of some of the preceding reviews here is so uncalled for as to be suspicious to me, as if some of these reviewers are just shilling for the "other" Evans bio, How My Heart Sings, and trying to keep sales of this one down. I've read some garbage jazz books before, and this isn't one of them. It isn't one of the best either, but the author does not deserve to be trashed for this labor of love. (Better written, I must add, than some more popular jazz bios, which I won't bother to mention.)</span>

                    <span>I also prefer How My Heart Sings over this one -I'm a huge Evans fan and as a jazz musician, I was thrilled about finding a "musical biography". Well, just repeating the same old stories as all the other books on the subject and then throwing in comments about the recordings -some of them suspiciously harsh, even- does not make it any more musical than any other biography. Not only that, but the times he comments on the actual music, he is almost invariably mistaken and wrong; "Freddie Freeloader" in NOT in a minor key and "These Things Called Changes" is based on "What Is This Thing Called Love", not "All The Things You Are" as Shadwick suggests. If he ever really studied the Manne-Hole live recordings instead of undeservedly dismissing them, he would know that Evans was already using the very same changes. As a collector of everything about Mr.Evans, I had to get this but I would not recommend it to anyone. Two stars for the subject alone.</span>

                    <span>I agree with other reviewers "...My Heart Sings" is vastly superior. Never mind the tiny print and wide columns which makes this book a conscious effort to even read, the writing gives you nothing of the feeling or experience of Bill Evans. Better to just listen to the music. I wouldn't even give my copy to other Evans' fans for fear of being associated with it so I tossed it. What a disappointment. Doesn't the author or publisher have an editor?</span>

                    <span>Like most other reviewers, I love Bill Evans' records and I hear a certain magic in his playing. The trouble with this book--other than the microscopic text and exceedingly wide columns--is its utterly dry and monotonous narration. <p>The book is fairly interesting--whether accurate or not, I couldn't say--in its account of Evans' quiet ascent from obscurity to the jazz pantheon he eventually came to occupy. Unfortunately, once we've learned how Evans reached the top, book becomes excruciating in its colorless, repetitive and tedious descriptions of Evans' subseqent recording sessions, tours, and record label changes.<p>Worst of all--and least excusable--is the fact that, somewhere along the way, author Shadwick seems to become disenchanted with the artistry of Bill Evans. If we're to believe Shadwick's account, the last 20 years of Evans' career were almost entirely uninspired and devoid of the creativity and innovation for which he's known and loved.<p>Whether he intends to or not, the end result is that Shadwick is essentially demystifying Evan's artistic legacy--and that's not a book I care to read.</span>

                    <span>If you want an excellent biography on Bill Evans, pick up a copy of "How My Heart Sings".  This book pales in comparison, but it is not without its merits.  It has excellent photographs and is well-organized.  The analysis of the music is rather subjective and unclear.  The writing style is dry and does not flow well.  Others have found several factual errors.  If you're interested in good pictures and a rough overview of Evans, "Everything Happens to Me" is worth picking up.</span>
