                <span id="Label1">Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake of <I>The Italian Job</I> stands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>"The Italian Job" is the latest in a series of remakes of 1960s heist movies, following "The Thomas Crown Affair" and "Oceans 11," and as far as Hollywood obsessions go, this is proving to be a pretty good one. Seeing the original before or after the remake it immaterial, because what is being remade is more the basic idea (Europe, gold, Mini Coopers) than the actual plot, characters, etc. The 2003 version from director F. Gary Gray begins the heist of $35 million in gold bars from a safe in a Venetian palazzo that is better than the heists in most heist movies. But that is just the prelude to what this movie is really about, which is an even bigger heist wrapped up in a still steaming bit of revenge.<P>Donald Sutherland is the father figure, Charlize Theron his daughter, Mark Whalberg the professional thief, Edward Norton the Judas, Seth Green the off-the-wall computer geek, Jason Statham as the lady-killing drives really fast, and Mos Def the hard of hearing explosives expert. The stand out performance is Seth Green's, who is becoming one of the most dynamic supporting performers around. His recurring rant in this film is that he is the "real" Napster: he created the software but it was stolen by a friend while he was napping. His part of the big gig is to control all the traffic lights in L.A., and you can imagine how much fun that would be. The characters are not exactly flat, but the main thing is how they fit into the grand design of the big heist.<P>This is not a film that takes itself seriously, not in terms of the planning and execution of the heist, but in terms of the violent action. "Napster" arranges all sorts of car crashes, but these are the sorts where people do not get hurt. There are a couple of killings, but they are on-point for the plot. Pointing out that in the real world people would be getting hurt during all this action is beside the point. "The Italian Job" is not a great film, but it is a very good heist movie. The action proceeds at a brisk place and you have the Mini Cooper chase scene to look forward to. This might not be an ambitious film, but given the failure of more pretentious films there is much to be said for a solid hesit movie. I wonde what Hollywood is going to remake next.</span>

                    <span>The Italian Job, is a clever and sophisticated caper. Nice cars, nice actors, nice settings, pretty much everything you'd like and want to see in a good movie. Mark Wahlberg stars as the main character, Charlie Croker, a pro at what he does: stealing. He's an excellent thief, and the main planner for a crew of theives including, Mos Def, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland. The opening of the film starts in Venice with a smart heist in process. When the thieves have gotten what they wanted: 35 million dollars in gold bars, one the theievs (Edward Norton) goes bad and makes it off with the gold and kills Sutherland's character in the process.<BR>Wahlberg soon recruits Charlize Theron (Sutherland's daugther) to help get revenge for their mentor and her father and to try and get possession of the gold back. <BR> The film's premise is simple but cleverly done. I for one never knew being thief could require so much dedication and devotion. The main highlight of this film is the climax is the car chase involving those beloved mini-coopers. I don't think this film had the best car chase considering there were other films with a lot better chases including T3:Rise of the Machines, Bad Boys II and The Matrix Reloaded. Though it is pretty good and worthwhile. I luckily got to see this on the big screen and it actually is worth it. The DVD has some good features, including a lot of behind-the-scene featurettes. <BR> The Italian Job is rated PG-13 for Violence and Some Language.<BR>The violence includes bloodless gunplay and some fistfights. The language is occasional but not too strong. See it!</span>

                    <span>Seing as two of my great loves are Seth Green and Mini Coopers, this movie was perfect! Seth has a hilarious role of the computer genius (the Napster) and my only dissapointment was that he didn't get to be in a Mini Cooper. &#60;br /&#62;
Other than that, It was just a wonderful movie.</span>

                    <span>Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) has planned a gold heist with a group of professionals in Venice, Italy, that displays his sophisticated style without using violence. In order to accomplish the heist Croker has asked the old-timer John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) to help crack the safe in which the gold is located. They get safely away with a large amount of gold, however, Steve (Edward Norton) has decided to keep all the gold for himself and kill the rest of the group. Steve shoots John while the rest of the group escapes, but they decide on settling the score with Steve as they decide to take the gold back with the help of John's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron). The Italian Job is a fun and suspenseful action film with car chases and dubious schemes, which leaves the audience with a good cinematic experience.</span>
