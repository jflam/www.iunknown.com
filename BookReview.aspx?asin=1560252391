                    <span>The quality of the writing is impeccable, and it has all the interesting facts a die hard fan wants to know.  It's filled with things you cannot find on the net... This is the 5th book I have on him, and by far it is the best.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book, but I would like more pictures-preferably in color.  But they go in great depth about many things like movies he was in, his wife and daughter, and his personality.  Although I like this book, I would not recommend it.  But if it is Ewan you are interested in, try "Ewan McGregor: From Junkie to Jedi."</span>

                    <span>I like this book. The writter goes into the history of McGregor. Robert Roy McGregor. The writter interviews some of Ewan's friends and school mates. There is 8 pages of pictures. All in black and white. The writter  looks at most of his important movies. Talk alot about feature movies. He  takes you into the process of what a struggle it was to make some of these  pictures. Especialy A Life Less Ordinary. He even goes on to why Ewan even  took the job. You find out everything about what gossip that happend on the  set to the things done off the set. The very interesting thing in the book  in the Filmography. It gives ratings, year, production company, cast and  crew. I liked it. It was different from the rest of the Ewan McGregor  Books. I pick it because of the great pictures.</span>
