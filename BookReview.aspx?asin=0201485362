                <span id="Label1">Surely, our society must have passed some technological milestone in order for component software to merit a comic novella. <I>Mr. Bunny's Guide to ActiveX</I> attempts to enlighten the reader about Microsoft's distributed-computing solution without actually explaining the technology, as more gauche programming books frequently do.<p> This book is funny! To wit (so to speak), an excerpt:<p> <blockquote>In Visual Basic, you form windows using <I>forms</I>. A form is a window that you form. At first forms are unformed. You must form your forms using the form designer (formerly the <I>former</I>). In the form former, an unformed form forms a uniform formation....</blockquote><p> You get the idea. This book is a hoot and a half. The basic idea is that a smarty-pants bespectacled rabbit and a hick farmer travel around together, having metaphorical experiences that (more or less) help explain how ActiveX works. Hey, Mr. Bunny makes about as much sense as any other approach to COM documentation, and he's a lot less pretentious.<p> <I>Mr. Bunny's Guide to ActiveX</I> will appeal to people who already have a pretty good grasp of what Microsoft's component architecture is all about--and who have realized it's a complicated morass worth a laugh or two. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>After reading through many books on ActiveX control and programming this book was a welcome relief. It is funny and witty and short.<P>This book is written largly based on using ActiveX control in VB. Anyone familiar with VB (even if they don't know ActiveX)will get most of the jokes and diagrams.<P>I would recommand this book to anyone that has had just a little too much technical documentation and would like a mental break. Hey, you may even learn something in the process.</span>

                    <span>Absolutely the MAD magazine of Windows programming! If you have a an "out there" sense of humor, and develop in VB or VC++, this book will keep you in histerics. Whether it be differences between COM, OLE and ACTIVEX (ActiveX sounds cooler, Com and ole together form ComOle - an Italian dish made of mozarella cheese and wine cork), or exercises to count the iinterfaces on your lawn ornaments, this book is a must have. It was just printed in China for crying out loud!</span>

                    <span>First off, if you want to learn about ActiveX, then this is not the book for you. However, if you want to be entertained by a parody of ActiveX, where wordplay, innuendo and absurdity about ActiveX are used to create some very funny jokes, then it is right for you. Mr. Bunny, the smart one with the glasses and pocket protector, and Farmer Jake, the guy in the overalls with the rake, are the main characters in a story about a "quest" for knowledge. <BR> Everything in the book is a joke; there is a very good one about CLSID registry entries, "Contrary to popular belief, the CLSID registry entries, when spelled backwards, do not contain the subliminal message 'I worship Satan'." If you have ever had to write and use CLSID registry entries, you know how much devil there is in the details. Points of additional reading contain entries such as:<P>* New York City Phone Book.<BR>* United States Internal Revenue Code.<BR>* ActiveX For Bunnies.<P>I found the last especially funny, the parody in relation to the "For Dummies" series and this book is quite good. Even the exercises are jokes; the following are given as end of chapter exercises:<P>* Optimize the following Visual Basic code: n = 1<BR>* Point<BR>* Click<BR>* Find the missing poodle.<P> The book is very funny and a welcome change from the relentless detail that appears in some programming books. I recommend it very highly as comic relief.</span>
