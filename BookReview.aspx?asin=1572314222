                <span id="Label1">Bruce McKinney's <i>Hardcore Visual Basic</i> is a revised edition of his guide to advanced programming in VB. Updated for Visual Basic 5.0, this book is best at outlining some of the new language features in Visual Basic 5.0, especially its improved support for type libraries and object-oriented programming. The heart of this book is dedicated to ways of accessing the Win32 API from within Visual Basic, which is presented in expert detail with a library of add-on functions. Sample DLL's, with libraries of VB extensions are included. The author also presents ways in which Visual Basic does and does not conform to an object-oriented programming model. Sample ActiveX controls, which use classes and the new ActiveX capabilities of VB5, are also presented. The last section, with a mix of tips and tricks for extending Visual Basic code, is also rather hit-or-miss. So is the author's humor--sometimes verging on sarcasm--which some readers will sometimes find irritating. (Once an employee of Microsoft, McKinney bravely expresses his dissatisfaction with the direction that his former company has taken with VB5.) Though this book completely ignores VB5's new enterprise features, database and Internet support, which are surely some of its most appealing enhancements, Hardcore Visual Basic does have a lot to say about developing in one of the most popular RAD tools developers have today. It can definitely ease the transition into object-oriented programming for VB developers used to the older programming style.</span>

                    <span>Bruce McKinney has written a thorough, well organised and well written book on Visual Basic. <P>I started off just wanting to use Visual Basic for graphics and Visual C++ DLLs for the real work. With clear examples of using the Windows API this book makes that a lot easier. But it also shows something of the possibilities of Visual Basic. I've ended up writing a lot more in VB than I had anticipated.<P>The CD-Rom which comes with the book contains a type library for the Win32 API. This saves a LOT of trouble typing in "declares" and types. The book is worth buying for this alone.</span>

                    <span>Definitely not for beginners. For a VB book, a lot of API stuff is well-covered. Also includes a very clear, if high-level, discussion of COM. The examples are well thought-out and executed. The real gems are the Windows type library and his VBCore and VisualCore DLLs. Win32 is essentially VB-unfriendly and Bruce McKinney has solved that problem for you. Just the time saved Declaring and cutting from win32api.txt cost-justifies this book. He's written a VB wrapper for almost everything that you would want to use. He even shows you in the sample code how to build your own vtables in VB. This book comes on the MSDN disk for VB6. Updates to the type library and his DLLs that work with VB6 can be found in his article. Buy it anyway and read it cover to cover. You'll be a better developer for it.</span>

                    <span>Even though this book is out of print, I would like to review it. Better late than sorry. This is the best book about VB I have ever read, and a tremendously inspiring book about programming. Even though VB is not my preferred programing language, this book really gave me a kick and I started to appreciate VB in a way that I had never done before.<P>Bruce McKinney does not only reveal all those sneaky details about VB that you whish you had known long before, but also teaches you a lot of useful stuff about the windows API, type libraries and COM. It is not a book for beginners, but should be read as soon as possible after passing the beginners level. Read it carefully from cover to cover, because it will reveal important details about windows and programming that you don't find in other books about advanced VB.<P>Unfortunately, this book is about VB 5.0, which means that it has lost its relevance in the ever changing world of Microsoft Visual Basic. It's a shame that Bruce McKinney did not write a programming book about a more stable programming language. With his knowledge, passion and inspiring writing style I'm sure it would have been a classic book about programming.</span>

                    <span>When I first picked up Hardcore VB, it sat on my shelf for a good three months next to the other 5 advanced VB books that I wanted to read first. Like anyone else, I thought I should read the less advanced stuff first. In retrospect, I realize that I probably could have started with Hardcore VB - and then tossed most of the other books in the trash. Bruce McKinney cuts through the fluff and assumes the reader can hold his/her own. His book covers the basics of COM, callback functions, subclassing and multithreading with awesome clarity - like no other VB book to date (perhaps Matthew Curland's new book is a close second). For intermediate and advanced VB programmers, this book is truly foundational - if not absolutely essential. Bruce McKinney's jovial approach makes all of this material that much more palatable than any technical book I've ever read. For my sake (and yours!), I hope Bruce chooses to continue writing technical books. Ten thumbs up from me and my colleagues.</span>

                    <span>I've been a VB programmer ever since VB 1.0 and a C/C++ programmer before that. With all of the "Teach Yourself xxx in 7 Days" books for beginners and the regurgitated help files with 80% of a 1000 page book taken up with code samples, Hardcore Visual Basic is hands down the best book ever written about programming with Visual Basic. Yes, it doesn't cover specific targets in depth (e.g., database programming, Internet programming, etc.), but it gives you the tools and the knowledge to really utilize the language and environment to its full potential. I haven't released a commercial or internal product without the VbCore.DLL and the Win.TLB support since I bought the book. If you don't have this book yet, be sure and get it while copies are still available. It is a true shame that it is going out of print...</span>
