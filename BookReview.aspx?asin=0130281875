                    <span>In this second edition of his excellent and helpful guide to Linux security, Toxen once again avoids the trap of padding the book with page after page of arcane code. Sections on constructing firewalls with IP Chains or IP Tables have been updated. The extensive index of resources in the back has also been updated, and new sections have been added in the text as well. It's still a great practical guide, and also (as in the first edition) contains a CD with useful programs on it. Still worth your money!</span>

                    <span>In the introduction, the author wrote "There are many useful details here, both for the person with a single Linux box at home and for those supporting multinational corporations...". Don't be fooled!<P>On passwords, he urges you to "...convert to shadowed MD5..." because "DES only uses 4096 different salt possibilities; MD5 uses 2**128." After screening Contents from beginning to end and following relevant keywords in the index, I simply could not find any reference to how that could be done.<P>In another chapter, as if spending 5 lines telling you how to disable a startup script by changing the first character of the name of a link in rc3.d from "S" to "s" is not enough, he has to actually show you the command line necessary: "mv S08iptables s08iptables". The rest of the chapter is spent on explaining the firewall rules found on the accompanying CD. You won't understand them unless you have read books similar to Ziegler's Linux Firewalls.<P>What's my point? There are lots of unnecessary details in a book at this level but you'll often not find what's really needed. Having said that, the book does however give some ideas on what can be done to harden your linux system. But if you want to implement any of them, you'll have to look elsewhere for instructions. 'Hacking Linux Exposed' is a much better book on securing your linux box.</span>

His examples are clear and direct to the point, which makes reading and understanding a breeze.<P>Whether you've been working with internet security or just starting, this book is a must have!</span>

                    <span>Real World Linux Security (2nd ed.) far exceeded my already-high<BR>expectations, having known the author and his expertise for a<BR>long time. Computer security is one of my secondary fields of<BR>expertise, as is Linux, yet I learned a lot from this book that<BR>I had previously overlooked -- and it helped me repair a system<BR>that crackers had attacked.<P>Bob writes in a very readable way that manages to be simultaneously<BR>entertaining and informative, a very rare combination.<P>He clearly realizes that a lot of readers will be in a hurry,<BR>looking for advice when there's already trouble brewing, so<BR>he starts with a very terse overview, going immediately to<BR>chapter 2 "Quick Fixes for Common Problems. Chapters 4 and 5<BR>cover the most commonly attacked subsystems and how they're<BR>attacked.<P>That's already book-length; over 250 pages. It goes on<BR>to Advanced Security Issues, Security Policies, Case Studies<BR>(wherein I'm mentioned :-) scanning and monitoring your<BR>system, regaining control, repairing damage, and much much<BR>more than I can mention in the max 1000 words here.<P>Extremely extensive, and both the table of contents and index<BR>are well done, something important to me for quick reference.</span>

                    <span>This book is at the top of my list when it comes to Linux security books. It<BR>has more information on securing Linux than any other I've read. And when I<BR>say Linux, I mean Linux not the plethora of applications and servers that run<BR>on Linux. Granted, it touches on some of the more "standard" servers, like<BR>Apache, Sendmail, and Samba. But the majority of the book is dedicated to<BR>securing Linux, servers, and applications in general. So, if you are looking<BR>for a book to tell you how to lock-down ProFTPD, this isn't it. Because of<BR>this limited scope, unlike other Linux security books that try to cover<BR>everything imaginable, it manages to cover the topic thoroughly.<P>The book starts off with "quick fixes" and then moves on to more advanced<BR>security issues. This is done so that you can get your system relatively<BR>secure as soon as possible, and deal with securing some of the more obscure<BR>and complex things in a progressive nature. It deals with just about<P>everything from making your users choose hard to crack passwords, to defining<BR>a written security policy, to collecting information about break-ins and<BR>getting law enforcement involved. This is a real well rounded and robust<BR>book.<P>Two things make this an awesome addition to any Linux user or administrator's<BR>collection. First, the author knows Linux inside and out. I was quite<BR>surprised to see security solutions that include kernel modifications as an<BR>option. In addition to his knowledge of Linux, the author has a very jovial<BR>writing style that you seldom find in books of a technical nature. I felt no<BR>need to force myself to read this book, because the author's writing style<BR>was engaging kept my attention. Second, the author (and Prentice Hall)<BR>included a CD with the book that contains software that the author wrote or<BR>modified (to extend its functionality and/or usefulness). The CD itself is<BR>worth the price of the book alone.<P>This book is a good buy and I would recommend picking up a copy of this book<BR>if you are running Linux in a business or home environment.</span>
