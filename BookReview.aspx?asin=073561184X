                <span id="Label1">How do you hire-and keep-the best software engineers in the business? What real-world practices can really motivate a team to produce excellent results? From startups to major corporations, virtually every commercial software company struggles with building teams and shipping great software on time. Now industry expert Ed Sullivan shares the hard-won lessons and best practices from his 17-year career in software development. In UNDER PRESSURE AND ON TIME, Sullivan describes a proven model for creating, directing, and growing a world-class development team. Discussion includes recruiting, interviewing, company culture, scheduling, release engineering, tools, key processes, beta management, project status, project closure, and other critical topics for which-until now-frustratingly little information has been published. But UNDER PRESSURE AND ON TIME digs one level deeper than other project management books, delivering the fire-tested practices and essential how-to's that help you lead software teams to greatness.</span>

                    <span>This book details common sense approaches to different aspects of software development - from defining requirements to development to software testing - that are too often overlooked or undervalued in many software shops. I am a developer, but the book contains a wealth of practical tips and techniques for project managers, developers, QA team members, and functional managers. I highly recommend this book to anyone involved in software development that is looking for ways to improve the quality of the software they deliver. I never write reviews, but for me this book ranks up there with Steve McConnell's Code Complete as one of those books that I am constantly referring to in an ongoing effort to improve my ability to develop quality software.</span>

                    <span>Ed Sullivan's summary of the practices that work at NuMega are a must read for any software development organization. Sure, a lot of the comments are just common sense, but from my experiences, they are rarely practiced. The project management section is trivial, obvious and better covered in other references. The details of the steps and the overall process that NuMega has successfully used are the valuable part of the text. Things like insisting on daily builds, test automation, and parallel development are the little gems that can keep you on a schedule. <P>A lot of people and books talk about this stuff, but few organization, (in my experience) manage to actually follow these methods. I think I would have liked working for Ed at NuMega.</span>

                    <span>Wow... what a great read... that is, it's a great read if you want to read the same sentiment over and over: Ed Sullivan is a very smart guy, and all the people at NuMega (now Compuware corp.) are geniuses. If you take a look at their current product offerings you might decide that Ed's "philosphy" _might_ not be the best way to go.<P>Just read the sample pages included here at amazon before you decide to plunk down your money on this obvious ego trip.</span>
