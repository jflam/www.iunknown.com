<div class="blogbody">

<h3 class="title">About me</h3>

<P>My name is <A href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">John Lam</A>. I'm a software developer first and foremost. I have shipped <A href="000263.html">eight commercial products</A> that I know of. If you look at that list of products, you'll notice that there was a conspicuous absence of any activity from 1986 until 1995. That was because I was busy working <A href="000262.html">on my other life</A>.</P>
<P>I've spent most of my time since 1997 educating the software development community. I've co-authored two books, and authored or co-authored many articles for various publications. My sort-of&nbsp;up-to-date bibliography can be <A href="000264.html">found here</A>.</P>
<P>From 1997 to 2000, I worked at <A href="http://www.develop.com">DevelopMentor</A>. I started off there as a COM instructor, like most of the other folks who joined towards the end of the 1990's. I then left the comfortable surroundings of COM and ventured into the murky waters of the web and XML. I authored and maintained DevelopMentor's popular Essential Web Applications class from 1998 until the time I left. Along the way, I got roped into <A href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A> and contributed to DevelopMentor's Essential XML class, and co-authored Essential XML with <A href="http://www.donbox.com">Don Box</A> and <A href="http://staff.develop.com/aarons">Aaron Skonnard</A>.</P>
<P>Since April of 2001, I've been doing my training work with <A href="http://www.wintellect.com">Wintellect</A>. I co-authored our <A href="http://www.wintellect.com/training.asp?id=3">Programming ASP.NET</A> class with <A href="http://www.wintellect.com/instructors/prosise">Jeff Prosise</A>. There are some really smart guys at Wintellect: <A href="http://www.wintellect.com/instructors/richter/default.asp">Jeffrey Richter</A>, <A href="http://www.wintellect.com/instructors/robbins/default.asp">John Robbins</A>, <A href="http://www.vb2themax.com/">Franceso Balena</A>, and <A href="http://www.programmers.net/artic/Esposito/">Dino Esposito</A> are some of the names that you've probably heard of.</P>
<P>I left DevelopMentor at the end of 2000 because I wasn't happy with the fact that I hadn't shipped anything besides conference talks, slide decks, articles and books since 1997. I was itching to ship something that other people actually use in their work. </P>
<P>A chance meeting with Hugh Teegan at the Speaker's event at the <A href="http://www.winsummit.com">WinSummit</A> conference in October of 2000 confirmed the path that my life was going to take. Hugh works at Microsoft. He also co-developed Transactional Active Server Pages. Hearing the excitement in his voice as he described the process of shipping the product really reaffirmed my feelings that I really need to develop software again. That talk also made it much easier for me to stick to my guns when I had to have my chat with Don Box at the end of November when I announced my intention to leave DevelopMentor (Don's a very persuasive guy).</P>
<P>So, what's next? Here's <A href="000265.html">my plan</A> for the next couple of years.</P>
