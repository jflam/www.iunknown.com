                <span id="Label1"><P> How do we as individuals and organizations survive and thrive amid tremendous change? Why are efforts to improve falling so short in real results despite the millions of dollars in time, capital, and human effort being spent on them? How do we unleash the creativity, talent, and energy within ourselves and others in the midst of pressure? Is it realistic to believe that balance among personal, family, and professional life is possible? <P> Stephen R. Covey demonstrates that the answer to these and other dilemmas is Principle-Centered Leadership, a long-term, inside-out approach to developing people and organizations. The key to dealing with the challenges that face us today is the recognition of a principle-centered core within both ourselves and our organizations. Dr. Covey offers insights and guidelines that can help you apply these principles both at work and at home -- leading not just to a new understanding of how to increase quality and productivity, but also to a new appreciation of the importance of building personal and professional relationships in order to enjoy a more balanced, more rewarding, more effective life.</span>

                    <span>I listened to the unabridged audio version straight through two times on a recent long car trip. I previously read "7 Habits" and consider it one of the top 5 books I have read. It is true that there is not a lot of new material in PCL but that is a misguided criticism. The author plainly describes it is an application of the 7 Habits message geared toward business management. B-School students will find OB themes interwoven throughout including bMod, Leadership, Organizational Alignment, the distinction between Management and Leadership, and other topics. I found this to be a useful frame of reference for grasping the message. I would like to see Mr. Covey tackle another topic but PCL is worth the effort. <P>That said, I must say that Reviewjim hit the nail on the head with his comments. As I read PCL I struggled with how to apply it. I am not a CEO or even a VP, so how do I start? My span of control is too limited to effectively apply PCL with maximum results. Even Covey teaches that it must exist throughout the organization. If top executives do not embrace PCL, how effective can I be in my own area?</span>

                    <span>I found the book intriguing. The book makes great common sense and has many quotable quotes. The foundation truths about leadership: "The Law of the Harvest"; "Life is one indivisible whole." Organizational ecosystem; four leadership paradigms; efficiency vs. effectiveness; trustworthiness is foundational; and seven chronic organizational problems are examples of a few the important lessons to learn. If you read nothing else this year on leadership, Principle-Centered Leadership is my first and best pick. All other leadership books are commentary. The book is a great read and keeps me well centered in an ever changing world of advice and new techniques.</span>

                    <span>In this great book by Stephen Covey, we learn Covey's philosophy for creating more meaningful relationships and successes in the workplace. something we should be striving to implement throughout business and industry.<P>Coveys shows us how to implement these techniques in the home and elsewhere and the result is we will be rewarded with happiness and a fulfilling future.<P>Prior to reading Principle Centered Leadership, I didn't think it was possible to successfully balance my personal, family and professional life.<P>Principle Centered Leadership is a great addition to Coveys classic 7 Habits of Highly Successful People.</span>

                    <span>This book brings the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People together with Demings 14 Points. If organizations were to use this methodology, they too would be effective. I recommend this book because it had a profound effect on an organization I was working for.<P>Can we lead better individual lives and have our corporations apply principles that will take those individuals to higher levels of accomplishment? America applies these principles in most of the best companies, these are enduring principles. <P>This is a book to read for leaders and teachers in business.</span>
