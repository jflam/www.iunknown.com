                <span id="Label1"><b>In My Hands</b> began as one non-Jew&#8217;s challenge to any who would deny the Holocaust. Much like <b>The Diary of Anne Frank</b><i>, </i>it has become a profound document of an individual&#8217;s heroism in the face of the greatest evil mankind has known.<br><br>In the fall of 1939 the Nazis invaded Irene Gut&#8217;s beloved Poland, ending her training as a nurse and thrusting the sixteen-year-old Catholic girl into a world of degradation that somehow gave her the strength to accomplish what amounted to miracles. Forced into the service of the German army, young Irene was able, due in part to her Aryan good looks, to use her position as a servant in an officers&#8217; club to steal food and supplies (and even information overheard at the officers&#8217; tables) for the Jews in the ghetto. She smuggled Jews out of the work camps, ultimately hiding a dozen people in the home of a Nazi major for whom she was housekeeper.<br><br>An important addition to the literature of human survival and heroism, <b>In My Hands</b> is further proof of why, in spite of everything, we must believe in the goodness of people.<br></span>

                    <span>This is probably one of the most remarkable stories that I've ever encountered and I don't understand why it hasn't received more attention. My husband and I listened to the audio tape which was beautifully read by Hope David.<P>IN MY HANDS is the autobiography of Irene Gut, a 17 year old Polish Catholic girl. The book begins with lovely recollections that Irene had of her early life in Czestochowa, Poland, where she was surrounded by her four sisters and loving parents. When the Nazi's invaded Poland in 1939, Irene was living away from her family in Radom where she was studying to become a nurse. When Radom was bombed, the Polish Army had to retreat and asked that some of the medical staff come with them to help take care of the wounded. Irene volunteered to go, and eventually ended up on the other side of Poland which was under Russian rule. Many miles away from her family, and eventually separated from the other hospital staff, Irene faced life alone, and saw the country that she loved controlled by brutes and killers. <P>At first this young woman saw the worst in the Russian soldiers and later she also met the German invaders who showed her another side of brutality. Despite the threat to her own life, Irene risked everything so that many others had the chance to live. This very inspiring memoir compares to HIDING PLACE the story of Corrie Ten Boom and her family. </span>

                    <span>In reading class, we were required to read a book about the Holocaust. I had read a few before, but I thought that they were boring and uninteresting. I thought that I would have to read another boring, uninteresting book. <BR>This book totally surprised me. It was the first Holocaust book I had read that actually had me feeling the emotions of the main character. This book kept me turning pages until the very last word. This person's true emotions were brought to life throughout this book by colorful language and interesting similes and metaphors.<BR>In My Hands is the story of Irene Gutowna, a Polish, Gentile girl, 17 years of age, who starts to work for a restaurant, which is run by Nazis. She never thought of becoming a resistance fighter. But she started small. The restaurant was located right next to the ghetto. Irene began to hide food under a hole in the fence.<BR>Then she eventually did bigger things, leading up to hiding 10 Jews in the basement of a German sergeant's house. He finds out, but keeps quiet. In return, Irene must be his mistress. <BR>This book was very good, and even made me cry. I think that everyone should read it.</span>

                    <span>I just finished listening to this book on tape. It was extremely well done from Irene's recollection of events. The Holocaust was an atrocity to society, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't study the topic. Hitler and his regime need to be understood to prevent similar occurences in the future. I can't image what she was going through during those times and I wonder how many of us could even begin to imagine her anguish.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book very much. It gave me a better understanding of what the Holocaust was really all about. I couldn't believe some of the scenes that she described about what was happeing to the Jews. The courage of what Irene did to protect people that she didnt even know amazed me. She never gave up on herself and believed that one person could make a difference. I was touched by the way Germans could treat such innocent people and was amazed at the scenes that she described in the book. Irene knew what she was doing was right and the more she saw such behavior the more determined she became to fight. One of the things I did not like about this book was that they focused more on what was happening to her and the people she was protecting then all the Jews in general and what was really happening in the concentration camps. Also it was hard trying to follow up on what was happing in the war. I got confused on when they were being helped out by other forces or when Germany was in complete power. I also would have liked to hear more about Hitler and the evil that he aroused. Over all I believed this was a very good book to others interested in the Holocaust.</span>
