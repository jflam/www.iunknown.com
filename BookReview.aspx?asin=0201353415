                <span id="Label1">If you're proficient at HTML, yet still fuzzy about Dynamic HTML, you're definitely not alone. Since the two browser heavyweights--Microsoft and Netscape--offer different flavors of DHTML, this promising technical advance for the Web is still in flux. <I>DHTML for the World Wide Web</I> is a no-nonsense look at where DHTML stands and how to use it effectively.<p> This Visual QuickStart guide delivers by offering a comprehensive look at using DHTML--in only 248 pages. The author wastes no time laying out the differences between the two vendors' approaches and establishing the common ground--mainly cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. With a fast-paced series of screen shots and step-by-step coding, you'll quickly learn the basics of CSS and how to use them effectively to control your typography and page layout. The book illustrates some of the most common uses of CSS--including multiple backgrounds, overlapping font styles, and columns without tables--clearly and quickly.<p> This guide also presents Document Object Models (DOM) to illustrate how to utilize dynamic event handling within your pages. Many popular techniques, such as moving banners, dragging objects, and creating pop-up menus, are included. An even balance of Netscape and Microsoft techniques makes this book a handy reference for any Web developer. <I>--Stephen Plain</I></span>

                    <span>I've read quite a few books on DHTML and this is one of the few that I come back to over and over for solutions and ideas. The book is roughly half-and-half CSS and javascripted DHTML. Unlike many of the laughable attempts at DHTML books out there, this one focuses on effects that work in BOTH major browsers, with a chapter each on browser-specific effects. Also, unlike other books, heavy focus is placed on complete working examples with full code listings rather than hypotheticals. If you learn best tutorial-style, this book's for you.<P>This book is not for novices at javascript. If you're new to scripting, start with Danny Goodman's javascript bible first. Likewise, know your HTML first. Most of the negative reviews written below can be ascribed to failure to read the book's notes and caveats before buying. Sure, there are a few typos, but the book's support site maintains errata and downloadable source code. And to the tosser who whines about "browser sniffing"--the list of interesting JS effects that can be created on both browsers without a bit of detection can be enumerated on one hand.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for someone that is familiar to HTML and wants to add some DHTML to their web pages. It is not a full reference book for JAVASCRIPT, but gives you the basics needed to get started using DHTML.<P>The book teaches you about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) from what theyare to how to set up an internal CSS, a linked CSS and an imported CSS.<P>It goes through CSS Fonts, text control, margins and borders, positioning, and background colors and properties.<P>One of the things I liked about this book is that for each section it shows samples of the actual code and screen shots of what the code produces in the browser.<P>It also tells you what code works both in IE and in Netscape and has separate chapters for each browser's specific code.<P>Finally the book has an excellent index and appendixes outlining code and code properties.<P>All in all this is a good book for someone starting out in DHTML but not for the expert.</span>

                    <span>JavaScript was dragged kicking and screaming into the ridiculous morass that is DHTML. Netscape has since abandoned its support for layers, so this book has become seriously outdated. DHTML is basically a dead end and it will soon go the way of the dodo. Even the tricks in this book aren't supported by newer versions of IE and Netscape, and most of the code examples in the book are incorrect anyway. You can go to the site to get the code for free, so there's no reason to buy a book full of incorrect code. When it was published it had cute tricks, but very few of them were actually practical. The only practical part of the book was the portion dealing with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which are now widely used. There are much better books on CSS than this one...O'Reilly's Definitive Guide on CSS springs to mind...and there are plenty of free web references you can visit to get up to speed on CSS. Start with microsoft.com and save your money.</span>

                    <span>This is not a beginner book you need to be comfortable with HTML and even JavaScript. This does get you going in DHTML and has a great appendixes and index which outline code and code properties. It tells you what code works in Explorer and Netscape and even goes as far as to put the ones separate which require specific code. The book teaches you about Cascading Style Sheets. This was a great start to DHTML!</span>
