                <span id="Label1">Three time Newbery honor author Nancy Farmer's epic fantasy, <I>The Sea of Trolls</I>, is gigantic in every way. There are big Vikings and bigger trolls. There are big themes--hope, despair, life and death. At a substantial 450+ pages, the sheer size of this hefty tome is impressive. But, like all of Farmer's fine work, the large scale has room for enormous quantities of heart and humor. At the center of this massive adventure is a small Saxon boy named Jack, who's never been much good at anything until the Bard of his medieval village makes him an apprentice. Then, just as Jack is learning to tap into and control his power, he is kidnapped (along with his little sister, Lucy) and taken to the court of King Ivar the Boneless and his half troll queen Frith. When one of Jack's amateur spells causes the evil queen's beautiful hair to fall out, he is forced to undertake a dangerous quest across the Sea of Trolls to make things right, or suffer the consequences--the sacrifice of his beloved sister to Frith's patron goddess, Freya. Along the way Jack faces everything from giant golden troll-bears to man-eating spiders, yet each frightening encounter brings wisdom and understanding to the budding young Bard. No quester who enters these pages with Jack will go away unsatisfied. Farmer's skillful melding of history, mythology, and humor, is reminiscent of both Tamora Pierce and Terry Pratchett's medieval fantasies, and will no doubt be HUGELY enjoyed by fantasy readers of all ages. <I>--Jennifer Hubert</I></span>

                    <span>This book is the story of Jack a young boy who travels across the land after being enslaved by Norsemen. I recommend this book to anyone who likes good fantasy books. This is a real page-turner and  Nancy Farmer did a good job with it.   </span>

                    <span>Reading this book is like enjoying a fabulous meal where all the flavors, colors and aromas are perfectly balanced. In this book the setting, characters, humor, and story all support each other to provide one of the most satisfying reads I have enjoyed this year.
<br />
<br />Jack has been accepted for training by a bard. As the berserkers arrive to pillage and burn his Saxon village, Jack and his young sister Lucy are abducted by the frightening Norse men. Jack must develop his fledgling skills as a bard to save them both.
<br />
<br />The story is rich and steeped in Norse mythology. A reader who is a fan of Tolkein senses the professor at his elbow as the story unfolds. Under the protection and enslavement of Olaf One-Brow, Jack attracts the enmity of the evil Queen Frith and must embark on a quest to free his little sister from the queen's death sentence. He is accompanied by a wiley crow named Brave Heart and his glory-driven shipmate, Thorgill.
<br />
<br />So many interests came together for me in this book, Beowulf, Tolkein, Norse mythology: this was a very enjoyable read.</span>

                    <span>The sea of trolls is about a boy bard named Jack and his sister Lucy. He gets captured by vikings or "northmen" and meets a girl named Thorgil, or the name that her mother gave her...Jill. Since it isn't the mothers right to name the child and the father who didn't want a girl but was forced to keep her, he named her Thorgil This is a really good book that everyone should like. The creatures in the book where well discribed and the battle scenes are easy to imagine having all that detail. The spider was huge and brown like a boulder and it was deaf and blind. If you are looking for a book of adventure and detail then this is a book for you.</span>

                    <span>This book was okay. There was a lot of adventure and it was suspenseful. I liked how they used Icelandic language when the Northmen talked. 
<br />	Jack, a Saxon boy, is the son of a farmer, a farm brat, nothing special. Then one day the Bard of the village asks him if he wants to be his apprentice. Everything is great, Jack learns about the life force, simple magic, and animals but then from across the sea Queen Frith sends Bard a Nightmare. Queen Frith is half human half troll and is married to King Ivar the Boneless. The Bard acts like a baby and Jack doesn't know what to do.  Northmen then attack the village kidnapping Jack and his sister Lucy.  Thorgil owns Lucy; a berserker wanna be who is fierce. Olaf One Brow owns Jack, the captain of the ship. When Olaf finds that Jack is the apprentice of the Bard they were supposed to make sure was dead, he brings him to Queen Frith. When Frith sees Jack he is Olaf's personal skald who sings songs of praise. As greedy as she is Frith wants a praise song too. Jack sings about how pretty her hair is and it falls out. Not having the knowledge to undo the spell Jack, Olaf , and Thorgil journey to Jotunheim, troll country, to find Mimir's Well. While fighting against a troll bear Olaf dies leaving Jack and Thorgil to continue by themselves.  Then they meet a couple of nine-foot trolls with orange hair and they show them to their palace to meet the Queen. The queen hosts a chess game so they can meet the Norns who control time and fate. These creatures decide they can go to Mimir's well. To drink from Mimir's well you must give something of extreme value up. Jack gives up the Rune of Protection and Thorgil gives up her will to die. On the way to Middle Earth the battle dragons and giant spider and other huge monsters. Jack knows how to get Frith's hair back but Frith being greedy doesn't do everything Jack says. This causes Frith to go mad and run off a cliff. Jack and Lucy go home but nobody really believes what they did, except for the Bard who had transformed into a crow and traveled with them. 
<br />	If you like fantasy and adventure books then you will like to read this book. Also if you like a book where bad things happen you would like this book.
