                    <span>Best book of the trilogy. It teaches you OO thinking 'by-example'. Through each of the four examples contained in the book you can learn at the same time the methodology and how to apply it (not an easy to find feature) from user requirement capturing to code development giving you the right 'tool' at the right moment. Reading the book is like being involved in the building of the system itself. For Smalltalk user can be useful since contains applications of the MVC paradigm.<br><br>I used it (with OOA and OOD) for years in a three-day course on OO and as the time went by, the part of the course dedicated to this book increased with a good feedback and interest from the 'students'. I abandoned this trilogy only with the advent of the UML, but I keep their teachings.<br><br>Buy it, or at least have it lent from a friend.</span>

                    <span>This book was my second OO book. I came from C, now, six years after, working all six with c++  ( object oriented mode, of course ) I remember it as the book from I really understand what  an object is, what is object orientation, not only a new ADT flavour. After working with this book I started to thinking in objects, not functions. <p>It was my jump from structural programming to object oriented programming. Perhaps this is one  of the best educational books I have ( and I have a lot of OO books )<p>First time I browsed it I discarded because I only want C++,  I didn't want this "strange language" (Smalltalk) wasting book's space.  But it force me to "object thinking" more than I suspected.<p>My next book was Grady Booch's OOAD, my two first foundation books about OO.</span>
