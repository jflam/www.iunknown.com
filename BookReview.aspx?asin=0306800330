                    <span>This is most recommended who loves Jazz and/or ever been a fan to Duke from the past and the future. I always been a long-time supporter to him since I was 9 or 10. This is definitely going into my book collection alongside Autobiography of Malcolm X, Miles: The Autobiography, Revelations: There's a Light After the Lime, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye, Hip-Hop America, As Though I Have Wings: The Lost Chet Baker Memoir, and mos definitely the Bible.
<br />
<br />I'm a huge fan to the memoir/biography section than I do most books I read about life and stuff. This would go on forever in a lifetime.</span>

                    <span> Classic.  If you consider the classic elegance of Edward Kennedy Ellington, it should come as no surprise that his prose is as lyrical and poetic as his music.  This is a wonderful collection of writings.  It is in effect an arrangement of essays and short pieces written with what I suspect is love about the love of his life-jazz, or music itself, if you will.  The book contains many short pieces-impressionistic sketches and characters of persons that Duke Ellington knew-musicians, friends, acquaintances, public figures.  But it also has a variety of essays-longer subjects interwoven with themes and counterpoint.  Ellington's is exquisitely musical prose-again, not to be surprised.  The organization is chronological, narrative, more or less.  Duke organizes with autobiographical passages followed by short portraits-Dramatis Felidae-that demonstrate the concreteness through brief descriptions of the persons that he knew with anecdotes that define them.  The book covers a life filled with friends and experience.  The variety is tremendous, and the life and the career are masterpieces.  The themes and subjects are multifaceted.  This is Duke Ellington's poetic literary suite posing as prose, and it should not be missed.  Really-it's great poetry and a terrific compendium of jazz history and experience.</span>

                    <span>I'm a great fan of autobiography.  Granted, often it is sanitized and self-serving, but there's nothing like hearing a person tell their own life, especially if the life is as important as this one.  Without a doubt,  Duke Ellington was the century's greatest American composer and bandleader;  the only ones who even come close to him (Aaron Copland, George Gershwin,  Cole Porter) had neither his longevity nor his variety.  And none of them  also maintained a working band through six decades!  I own almost every  recording ever released by Duke Ellington; his music has become indelibly  printed on my brain.  This book may not be the most accurate account of his  life (if you can handle a little armchair psychology, the Collier biography  is the best choice for that), but this is like sitting in a room hearing  Duke talk -- and play!</span>

                    <span>Wow what a book.  The best part about this book is that Duke wrote it.  You get it straight from him.  I recommend this book to anyone into the music.  <p>His accounts of his younger days were what most appealed to me.   He pays so much respect to the people he was surrounded by, both his family  and the community of musicians.  Sometimes the many names dropped can be a  bit much, but that was just his style--always letting people know who  helped him, who mentored him, who taught him, who he admired.  There's  scarcely a mean-spirited word in the whole book! <p>There is a lot of  variety to the way he tells his stories.  Sometimes its through the name  dropping profiles; sometimes its through interviews reprinted for this  book; sometimes its through out-and-out philosophical dissertations about  music and life; sometimes it's in the midst of his endless travelling of  the globe with his band.<p>For the musician looking for tips and advice,  there's plenty of Duke wisdom provided throughout.  His overall love for  music and musicians is just SOOO apparent.  My favorite piece of advice is  that he said he learned music exclusively through oral instruction, from  people in the scene who would share techniques and secrets seemingly as  freely as idle conversation (how different the musical climate is these  days!)<p>The last third or so of the book get a bit tedious for this  reader.  There just wasn't a lot of variety to his accounts of  globetrotting and meeting all the important people in all the countries.   What kept me going through these sections were the occasional gems of  advice or insight, but there's more of that in the first half of the book.   Thank god for the end of the book, a funny interview where the interviewer  is REALLY condescending to Duke, but Duke gets through is with all the  grace, wit, intelligence, and humor that makes him such a compelling  person, composer, and most of all, a genius and musical mystic.<p>Thank the  Duke for this book, and allowing us to get a glimpse of his life and all  his amazing stories!</span>
