                    <span>Anthony Minghella's tragedy of the weary soldier who only longs to be with his promised love. The theme is a variation on Homer's Odyssey where, after years of surviving the depravities of war, the hero-soldier undertakes a perilous journey home; reuniting with his loved one only after many trials and tribulations. Although the theme isn't new, the script properly grasps the attitudes and mannerisms of the time. The cinematography and editing is top knotch.<P>Nicole Kidman plays Ada, a preacher's daughter who, in 1860, moves with her father to the rustic bliss of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. Ada falls in love with Inman (Jude Law) but, before their love can be consummated, Inman answers to the call of duty and joins the Confederate Army. Before he leaves, Ada promises to wait for his return and to marry him. By 1864, Inman is a broken man: shocked by the brutal realities of war and seeing no purpose to the carnage. He sees the Confederacy as doomed and, longing for Ada, resigns himself to deserting the army. He begins his long perilous journey from the frontlines to his home. In the meantime, things go from bad to worse in Cold Mountain and Ada is forced to hold the house on her own. Exploiting her fears that Inman may be dead, prospective suitors unwelcomingly court Ada. In the meantime, Ada welcomes a runaway girl named Ruby (Ren√©e Zellweger)to help her with the farm's chores. The climax of the film rises as Inman comes closer to home. Sadly for both Ada and Inman, their reunion is bittersweet.<P>Again, the story is a thematic variation from the Odyssey. The warrior-hero leaves to face the horrors of war and returns only after a long life-changing journey. The acting is great although I think Nicole Kidman was too well groomed for her role. Even if immaculate and beautiful, women of the 1860s didn't look as if they just came out of a Hollywood beauty salon: especially those who lived and worked in a rural setting. A great romantic tragedy that appeals to both men and women. I strongly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I thought Cold Mountain was the best film of 2003. Anthony Minghella fashioned an extremely moving, visually lovely, and richly literate adaptation of Charles Frazier's novel. At the center is an unusual love story -- of two people who barely know each other, and yet who, with the memories of a few magical moments, invent a profound love between them in order to survive in the war-torn world around them.<P>Jude Law gives a beautiful and subtly expressive performance as Inman, the taciturn and deeply inward central character. Nicole Kidman is superb as Ada as is Renee Zelwegger in her Oscar-winning performance as Ruby. The relationship between Ada and Ruby becomes one of the movie's most moving elements. The massive supporting cast is filled with some of the best character actors in the industry.<P>Despite its old-fashioned epic richness, Cold Mountain is also filled with moments of extreme violence, which are shockingly and wrenchingly staged by Minghella. In addition, it's also a deeply musical film, with a haunting score by Gabriel Yared and numerous gorgeous songs from the old south. It's a shame that most critics condescended to this film, and chose to review it in the context of Miramax's (admittedly distasteful and relentless) Oscar campaigning. It is not strikingly original or free from the occasional Hollywood cliche. But it is lovingly made, beautifully crafted, and carefully paced. That's more than can be said for most films - Hollywood or independent - these days.<P>The 5 stars are for the film. The DVD transfer is - to my unprofessional eyes - crap. I'm astonished that Miramax would release such a visually stunning movie in such a grainy, unfocused, unvibrant transfer. It's a shame, and Miramax should be embarrassed.</span>

                    <span>I absolutely hated this movie. Nicole Kidman is too old to play such a young character. The story started depressing and ended suicidal! I actually bought this dvd and after I watched it one time, I threw it in the trash. The only good thing about it was Renee Z's excellent rendition of a tough country girl. Only watch this movie if you like self-punishment.</span>

                    <span>Cold Mountain is a very good movie. The only problems I have with the movie is it takes so long to get into (but once you do it's so worth it) and the fact that they barely met and were already madley in love! <P>As a previous reviewer mentioned there is a very explicit love scene. It is my opinion that the love scene is so very important to the movie. You almost feel the love between the two. The movie would not have made such an impact on me without this scene.</span>

                    <span>so it is OK to see people maimed and killed in horrible ways, but if two people have sex it is bad? Give me a break.</span>
