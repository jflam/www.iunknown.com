                <span id="Label1">What is more important--race or class--in determining the socioeconomic success of the blacks and whites born since the civil rights triumphs of the 1960s? When compared to whites, African Americans complete less formal schooling, work fewer hours at a lower rate of pay and are more likely to give birth to a child out of wedlock and to rely on welfare. Are these differences attributable to race per se, or are they the result of differences in socioeconomic background between the two groups?  <P><I>Being Black, Living in the Red</i> demonstrates that many differences between blacks and whites stem not from race but from economic inequalities that have accumulated over the course of American history. Property ownership--as measured by net worth--reflects this legacy of economic oppression. The racial discrepancy in wealth holdings leads to advantages for whites in the form of better schools, more desirable residences, higher wages, and more opportunities to save, invest, and thereby further their economic advantages.  <P>Dalton Conley shows how factoring parental wealth into a reconceptualization of class can lead to a different future for race policy in the United States. As it currently stands, affirmative action programs primarily address racial diversity in schooling and work--areas that Conley contends generate paradoxical results with respect to racial equity. Instead he suggests an affirmative action policy that fosters minority property accumulation, thereby encouraging long-term wealth equity, or one that-while continuing to address schooling and work--is based on social class as defined by family wealth levels rather than on race.  <P>Dalton Conley is Assistant Professor of Sociology and African and African American Studies at Yale University.</span>

                    <span>This book is both meticulous and very clearly written. Every time I had, while reading Conley's analysis, a nagging question in the back of my head, he went on to address it in far more detail than had even occurred to me. <P>Perhaps because of this thoroughness, _Being Black, Living in the Red_ fundamentally altered the way I think about certain social policies, and about race and wealth in general. It also interested me in sociology of inequality, a field about which I had known nothing. The book is incredibly informative about a matter of great public importance, but I appreciated that Conley seemed wary of overstating his case. I truly felt I was getting an honest, and extremely skillful, evaluation of the evidence.<P>Under the circumstances, I'd be hard pressed to do anything but advise you to read this book at the first chance you get.</span>

                    <span>This book expands the research base that identifies wealth as a key component of mobility, and an important factor that explains why blacks and whites have divergent outcomes. However, Conley may be overemphasizing the role of wealth, and forgeting that race is still a critical issues. In fact, his models show that wealth is only a small part of the story. A great deal of the unexplained variance in Conley's models may be attributed to discrimination in society. Although Conley mentions this briefly, more attention needs to focus on this aspect the issue. Nevertheless, the discussions of wealth are rich and well developed, making this an important addition to the literature.</span>

                    <span>The analysis is sound. This is to say, the examination of the relevant history and current structures, coupled with an examination of effects, is accurate and valid. However, the argument for implications is unsound - dangerously so. It seems that those driven to understand precisely why some people are faced with more challenges than others are usually willing to go the next step - to argue for engineered adjustments, blind to the fact that such programs engineer even more odious, systematic inequities.</span>

                    <span>This is truly a groundbreaking book. Dalton Conley finally reveals the key element on pg. 118 in two unassuming little words: reserve stock. This is, ladies and gentlemen of the judging class, what separates the races and classes, NOT skin color or intelligence level. In the absence of such, no one can truly believe (except in fairy tales) that most people can overcome grinding poverty and helplessness to become productive members of society. Aside from mere technical support, that cherished "reserve stock" allows one entrance into arenas not usually penetrable via associations with those generous enough to usher one in. Trying to overcome the obstacles of poverty is like trying to drag a car without snow tires up a steep hill. I commend the youthful yet astute Dalton Conley for his valuable work.</span>

                    <span>What would the USA be like today if former slaves had were given the elusive "40 acres and a mule"? How are the black poor in America different from the white poor everywhere? Although I haven't yet read this book, I am familiar with the dissertation on which it was based. This book is a definate must read for anyone with an interest in poverty, ethnic studies or our modern power structure. Conley successfully anayzes the connection between poverty and property that will no doubt leave many readers with a fresh perspective on the hows and whys of many "underclass" issues. I am anxiously to read this updated version.</span>
