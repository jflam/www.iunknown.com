                    <span>As a southern prep, I can certainly note differences in the typical northeastern (birth of preppy/typical preppy) life compared to the Southern Prep life. However, I cannot forget the day I received my copy of the book from my Dad. It says "A vintage copy of YOUR handbook, Dad, 1992," and boy was that true! I opened it and despite its 1980 publication date it accurately described my private high school in Atlanta! Amazing! And then it went on to describe "The First Apartment", "Getting Married", and "The Tailgate Picnic", all of which were hilarously true. "A prep wedding takes a whole weekend" being entirely TOO true; southern wedding + prep wedding = much more than a weekend. By the way, the "where the preps are" section is oddly still somwhat appropriate for Atlanta, my hometown, although the nightlife has changed quite a bit. I must mention that most of the photos are very funny, as they are obviously of the 1980s time and not current. This adds to the flair.<P>This book should absolutely be republished, with a more current focus. If I had enough money I would make this happen. And I would definitely include the Southern Prep as well as the Mod Prep. Please contact me if you are interested in a collaborative effort!</span>

                    <span>An ex high school girlfriend originally showed me this book and it suddenly all made sense to me. Why I wore polo shirts with the collar up, why I didn't wear socks with my shoes, and why I only wore cuffed khakis. Having gone to prep school and totally enjoyed it I found this book dead acurate. Some may think it's a tad dated, but in my crowd things haven't changed. We all still wear our collars up and our khakis cuffed. Now going to a college that is not very preppy (I'm ashamed to admit), my friends who are preppy are forced to keep it alive. We certainly stand out, but then you really cares. I wouldn't dress or act any other way. Thank god for Brooks Brothers, J-Press, and all the other great stores mentioned in the book. Not only that, but the explanation that "summer" is in fact a verb is so key.<P>It would be nice to see an updated version though.</span>

                    <span>Last summer I shopping at a store in Bar Harbor and a group of kids came in: maybe in their early teens. Each was skinny, wore a polo shirt and shorts, had shortish hair, and a deep tan. I could not for the life of me tell if any of them were boys or girls. All I could think about was the Preppy Handbook, and how they describe EXACTLY that phenomenon in the childhood section.<P>Why is this book out of print? It was brilliant, is brilliant, and will always be brilliant! Anyone who lives in New England should own this book.</span>

                    <span>When I first moved to new York City to work in the corporate world I came across Lisa Birnbach's Preppy Handbook. Suddenly everything made sense. I could understand why the blonde vice president in the elevator had the "executive look" and I didn't. I understood the vague references. Coming from somewhere where no one ever had tailgates, much less parties on them, it introduced me to a whole other way of life. I needed to understand preppies if I were to achieve success in the East and Lisa let me know the code. The book is a wonderful piece of cultural anthropology.<P>I routinely recommend this book to talented kids from other classes and other places who are trying to make it in the Northeast. Along with John Molloy's Dress for Success, this book made it possible for me to adapt to corporate life.</span>

                    <span>Extemely accurate description is now a sort of litmus test for the modern preppy: if you think that boat shoes, polo shirts with upturned collars, and cuffed khakis are "dated"... then you are not a preppy! That is the whole point. True, MOST people do not dress like this. But MOST people are not described by this book.</span>
