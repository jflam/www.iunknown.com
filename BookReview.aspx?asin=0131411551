                    <span>With the updated third edition, this book keeps getting better and better with age.  I've been using this book since 1991 when I was just a green programmer who got assigned to his first real Unix project.  I'm not one who dishes out praises lightly, so  for me to say that this is _the_ best network programming book around, there must be good reasons.  Stevens had a way of taking a complex subject and in a few pages, if you follow the text and examples, making it crystal clear.  The new authors, I believe, are continuing this fine tradition.
<br />
<br />Practically everything about network programming is here.  Many examples on how to use socket, bind, listen, select, accept, connect, read, write, you name it.  Theare are lots of sample code on how to write robust TCP/UDP clients and servers.  The programming style is clear and easy to understand.  The new edition has plenty of updates to follow the POSIX standards.
<br />
<br />This book will not make you an expert overnight, but it will make you an expert.  There are other network programming books out there, to be sure, but this one is at the top.</span>

                    <span>I cannot fathom a guess as to how many times the books in this series have saved my in project work over the years.  The only drawback with this series is that some publisher should endeavor to keep them up to date.  Serious Unix system programmers must have copies of the complete series.</span>

                    <span>It deserve place on your shelf. I just wanted to know more about sockets. The choice was right. There is no more mystery. I didn't go into details about code. That was not my goal. The goal was socket. I got what I was expecting to get.</span>

                    <span>This book, as with all other Stevens books, can be used as either a tutorial or reference.  The depth of information here is unparalleled.  I continue to be impressed with the detail in this book.  Fenner and Rudoff have done an outstanding job of maintaining quality and tradition this invaluable reference.  Avid Stevens fans will not be disappointed.  
<br />
<br /> 3rd edition updates include:  
<br />*IPv6  added 
<br />*POSIX 1003.1-2001 added  
<br />*XTI dropped  
<br />*T/TCP dropped 
<br />*SCTP added 
<br />*Key Management Sockets for use with IPSec Added 
<br />*Machines used for examples updated
<br />*Other material updated where appropriate (including new functions) 
<br />
<br />I bought this book a year ago along with Stevens "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment"  I read most of this book as a tutorial on network programming.  I continue to use it as reference.  I also read all of APUE.  Since then I've added TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 and UNIX Network Programming, Volume 2 to my collection.  I've come to apprecaite the painstaking detail, pure clarity, and conciseness that are the hallmarks of all Stevens books.      
<br />
<br />I'm thankful that Rudoff and Fenner updated this classic.  This book is all most will need for the sockets API.  I don't have the second edition, but I'm quite happy with the third.  It's good to have something that speaks to IPv6.  This is the best of the old and new.  I wouldn't mind seeing an updated version of TCP/IP Illustrated volumes 1 and 2 either if Fenner and Rudoff are up to it.  
<br />
<br />All of the Stevens books compliment each other really well.  Truth be told, the more Stevens books you read the better off you are. </span>

                    <span>I bought this book about a month ago and used it very extensively for my UNIX programming project. While this book is great and very comprehensive, I did find code examples very confusing. As coping a variable from the socket struct into variable and then from this variable into custom structure, then manipulating this custom structure and finally printing. It would be better to use as less transformation as possible. Because it makes very hard to find what this variable has and where it came from. At the end all I'm looking for is simple but good example of how to use sockets...etc, it's not a C programming book.</span>
