                    <span>When you work or deal with young people, talking about computers<br>is a big challenge and most of the times you feel like a "dummie or an idiot".  This forces you to run to Barnes & Noble or the local Library to end up more confused and frustrated not knowing which book to pick.<br>"The Healthy PC" is not as tedious as other computer books,<br>on the contrary once you start reading you will not stop, and if you follow the steps Carey recommends you'll feel very comfortable.<br>This is a great book, to bad he does not have any publications about hardware, but I understand his next book will be about "networking"  available next year, I can't wait to buy it.</span>

                    <span>Our computer club had a chance to buy and use Carey's new book, The Healthy PC. In my case I had already accomplished some of the suggestions in Carey's book, but others he included certainly did speed up my PC and make it safer. The book includes a number of performance and safety suggestions I had not heard of. His step-by-step instructions, as well as why we should consider each "fix", are simple and easy to follow. <p>My daughter has been complaining about problems with her PC. I know she will definitely benefit from Carey's book, since she is not a PC technie and is too busy with work to spend time learning how to fix it on her own. It's just the book for her. <p>Definitely a five star book that every PC owner can benefit from.</span>

                    <span>I recommend this book without any reservations, qualifications or any other comment that would minimize this superb book: All those symbols you didn't know e.g. EULA (End User License Agreement), GUI ( Graphical User Interface) and numerous others that I used to just pass over while reading because the authors seldom took the time to explain what the symbols stand for and what they function they perform on your PC, I now understand what the translation is when I encounter these symbols and how they work on your PC.<br>Carey Holzman writes cleary and in plain English so the content of this fine book is easy to understand. I just followed along with the numbered step by step instructions which are combined with the screen shots that clearly illustrate the written instructions of the author. Don't hesitate -- buy this book  and you will be rewarded with a much better understanding of your PC. As a bonus, perhaps for the first time you will be able to carry on a knowledgeable conversation with other informed PC users for the first time.<br>While I dislike the use of the term: empowerment; it certainly applies to this book. For the first time -- 4+ yrs.-- in working with computers -- an XP system -- and often feeling frustrated, I now feel that I really comprehend my PC and how it works. It is now my primary reference source that I will use with confidence.<br>Many thanks to Carey Holtzman.</span>

                    <span>This book is so full of practical home remedies for a computer I would have paid much more for it.  I received it one week ago and already my five-year-old E-Machine is humming like new.  I had many annoying problems with my PC and computer techs told me nothing could be done.  Just one example.....defragging.  I have literally been trying to defrag now for months and it would not complete.  Carey gives a process to do it, I tried it and it defragged in twenty minutes!!!  Please folks, order this book now and put it on "rush".  Tell your friends.  You will love it.</span>

                    <span>This book is a winner. After plowing through many computer books The Healthy PC is a refreshing experience. Step by step instruction helps you get your computer running in tip top shape.Easy to follow, and extremly informative The Healthy PC teaches you not only what to do... but the why also. I learned the meaning of words and phrases that I had been hearing for years but never had the opportunity to understand. After applying what I learned from Careys book my computer has never been running better. I would recommend this powerful teaching tool to ANYONE who owns or uses a computer. Thanks Carey</span>
