                <span id="Label1">A must see for anyone considering international adoption!  <P>Former TV News Reporter Rebecca Coates Nee takes you on her personal adoption journey to China. In this hour-long video, she shows you: why there&#146;s a need for adoption in China, how to choose an agency, cost estimates, requirements, the documentation process, helpful Internet resources, tips for managing the wait, how to prepare for the baby, common medical concerns, what to pack for the trip and what to buy in China.  <P>Then, see the heartwarming moment when she meets her baby and watch the adoption process in China unfold. Finally, watch how their bond develops during their first few months at home together.  <P>This video is independently produced and is not an endorsement of any agency, service or product. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to charitable children&#146;s services in China.</span>

                    <span>If you think you know it all (just as we thought) think again and buy this video. Give it as a shower gift, birthday present, Anniversary gift or whatever you can come up with to any parent or single at any stage in the China adoption process. <P>It's a definite must for anyone who's planning or is in the midsts of their process, Rebecca Coates Nee gives a detailed view of the process, the do's and don'ts. She shares her experience and gives recommendations from beginning to end. You'll definitely want to take notes.<P>Finally she shares her own adoption video footage with us and applies it towards suggestions for the rest of us. It's something I believe no China adoption parent in the process should be without!<P>*Take it from me, I'm usually the last one to get anything, I'm sure glad I got this!*</span>

                    <span>I just viewed this video yesterday evening, and was extremely impressed. The video is well-organized and highly informative, even for those (like me) who already know quite a bit about China adoption. Ms. Nee provides some valuable suggestions for making the process (including the trip) easier and more enjoyable. Also included is Ms. Nee's extraordinarily moving first meeting with her daughter. Whether you're just thinking about adopting from China, have already made the decision, or are waiting for your referral, this video is quite worthwhile!</span>

                    <span>This is a must have video! Becky Nee covers everything from the need for adoption to the paperwork, packing, traveling to China and bonding with baby. My husband and I took tons of notes and learned many new things through this informative video. In fact we are going to show it to our parents so they can better understand their grandaughter and where she came from. We feel we are much better prepared for our adoption trip next month. Also, it was touching to see her personal story and the moment she received her new daughter. I highly recommend!!!!</span>

                    <span>I have had the wonderful opportunity to view this film. It is filled with lots of great ideas and suggestions and Becky's training and talent as a news anchor really shows through. There are a lot of heart-warming scenes that as a prospective parent I would have loved to have seen before traveling to China. This film takes a lot of the mystery out of the process and allows the viewer a sneak peek as to some of the things they might expect to experience on this journey even though the process can be a little different for each family.<P>It is a great comprehensive guide to adoption from China and well worth taking the time to watch! I know that I personally get more out of viewing something rather than reading about it. For me as a parent who has already been through the process it brought back a lot of memories even though the regulations and a lot of the procedures have changed since 1998 when Mikaylin came home. A good resource for prospective adoptive parents considering adoption from China.</span>
