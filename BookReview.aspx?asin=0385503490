                    <span>My heart sank when I started the first chapter of "Island at the Center of the World": "On a late summer's day in the year 1608, a gentleman of London made his way across that city." Yo Russell, I spent good money on your book, I don't like being served up warmed-over literary devices like the "you are there" intro. Slang uses of words like "weird" and bitchy" sprinkled over the first dozen or so pages also rang false, as per other reviews. But Shorto's enthusiasm, humility and the intrinsic originality of "Island's" thesis eventually won me over. I would have liked to have read more about daily life in the colony and heard a bit less about prostitutes (have a good time researching in Amsterdam, Mr. Shorto?), but in all this is a worthy and enjoyable book. The author makes a strong case for the lasting impact of the Dutch legacy of diversity and religious toleration on American society, and the roots of that legacy in Dutch and European history. Judging by the recent brouhahas over Janet Jackson and Howard Stern, however, it may be too soon to downgrade Puritan legacies like prurience and hypocrisy as cultural mainsprings. Overall, a well-written and interesting work.</span>

                    <span>Shorto's book is uneven. For people who know little about early colonial history, it provides some interesting information about New Amsterdam and the politics of colonization. The most dynamic part of the book is the tension between Stuyvesant, the director of New Amsterdam, and van der Donck, attorney, activist, and reformer who sought to give the colonists some voice in the West India Company's control over the town's governance. Although Shorto promises to provide new and vital information about New Amsterdam based on the recent translation of heretofore unavailable (in English) records, the promise is not really fulfilled. The new information consists, essentially, of accounts of law suits, brawls, and mismanagement. I would encourage readers to overlook this unfulfilled promise as typical publishing hype. Harder to overlook is Shorto's own political agenda. At every opportunity, Shorto insists on telling readers that New Amsterdam was a diverse community where blacks, Indians, and Jews were "tolerated" and that New Amsterdam laid the foundation for contemporary America's embrace of diversity and multiculturalism. This sort of redundancy is tremendously annoying--even somewhat insulting. Moreover, it reflects a lack of critical vision that is unacceptable in a history book. The mantra of "strength in diversity" is largely wishful thinking, and there are any number of examples that illustrate how unrestrained diversity weakens society. Consider the rise of identity politics over the last two decades and the fate of public education owing to the huge number of non-English-speaking students in our classes. Shorto would have produced a better book if he had stuck to history and left his political editorializing at home.</span>

                    <span>Being both a native Manhattan-ite, and of Dutch descent, I'd have to say that in the NYC public school system of the 30's and 40's, good as it was, the origins of New Netherland were scarcely covered. Certainly the additional information contained in this book (which perhaps to an historical scholar may be too 'readable' and occasionally repetitious ) is a worthwhile addition to understanding how the Dutch influenced the future character of Manhattan. The documents which are currently being translated and on which most of Shorto's book is based, will surely become part and parcel of a more balanced view of Manhattan's earliest history.</span>

                    <span>My last name is, as you can see, Blauvelt -- no relation to the pirate in the book, more's the pity -- but from the branch that migrated from New Amsterdam into northern NJ and Orange County, where, indeed, is the town named Blauvelt. And the saying above is a bumper sticker my father gave me. But, onto this book. The premise: that it is forgotten history, is a surprise to one raised on much of the lore recounted here, but I suspect that once outside the environs, or, as some reviewers of age (I think) state, outside the NY regents exam system, it may actually be forgotten or never learned history. In any event, as a Dutch descendant of those days, it is great to read this history so wonderfully woven and described. Lore that was warp and woof of my growing up: that "planks", now political platforms, were first Dutch references to staking out parts of private investment/ownership in a ship. Or, that the "dollar" is from a Dutch word, and so forth. Shorto brings the whole Dutch colonization experience to life as I have never read -- in the pages of a book -- for those uninitiated. The Dutch, like it or not, had a profound effect on the tenor and direction of this unique nation. Shorto, given my steeping in Dutch lore, does not exaggerate or assume -- he tells it like it was. And, given the historic sources he is using, it is high time the formerly unknown van der Donck was given his due. An endearing and interesting character who takes on, in a David and Goliath struggle, the better known, if not admired or admirable, Peter Stuyvesant. Thank you, Russell Shorto.</span>

                    <span>Modern histoical narratives concerning Dutch New Amsterdam are few and far between. Ones that are amusing and informative reads are even more rare. The Island at the Center of the World is valuable for being both. <P>Centered on the history of New Amsterdam and its original Dutch environs, it is also written with a good sense of humor that this reader appreciated very much. Russell Shorto's descriptions are also great, even if he has no way of proving that the scenes he is describing are 100% hisotircally accurate. <P>His expansion of the thesis that Dutch multiculturalism eventually led to American multiculturialism may be a bit cunvoluted for some readers, but even if you don't fully agree with Shorto's history, the images that he presents in support of his ideas make for great reading along the way. <P>New Yorkers who love their own history will quickly devour this book.</span>
