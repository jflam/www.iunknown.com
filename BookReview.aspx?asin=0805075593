In this incisive and controversial book, Chalmers Johnson lays out in vivid detail the dangers faced by our overextended empire, which insists on projecting its military power to every corner of the earth and using American capital and markets to force global economic integration on its own terms. From a case of rape by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa to our role in Asia&#8217;s financial crisis, from our early support for Saddam Hussein to our conduct in the Balkans, Johnson reveals the ways in which our misguided policies are planting the seeds of future disaster.<br><br>In a new edition that addresses recent international events from September 11 to the war in Iraq, this now classic book remains as prescient and powerful as ever.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Some people may rant and rave about this and that aspect of this book, but it is really a fine piece of scholarship. The whole point of this book is East Asia and America practice capitalism very differently. America has, due to the Cold War, persued a military course of action. Now that the Cold War has ended, America is having a difficult time shifting. During the Cold War America bullied, cajolled, pushed, and manouvered Asian countries to follow a certain course. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, America is now trying to shove its version of Capitalism down the throats of various Asian nations and in the process causing tremendous financial strains in Asia and fostering deep resentment there. This anger by many Asian nations could develop into some kind of revolt against America in the future. Hence America's short term policy of today may cause a "blowback" that will come back to bite America in the future.<P>Mr. Johnson challenges conventional thinking. He calls America an empire and after reading his well reasoned book, I agree. America is having a hard time shifting from its last 50 year role as the chief Cold Warrior to a more equal partner with Asia. It has difficulty in understanding that different peoples and cultures do business differently. America sometimes behaves like a bull in a china shop. <P>My only critism of BLOWBACK is his conclusion early on in the book of who caused the Pan Am flight to be blown up over Scotland. Ignoring that, the book gets better and better the further you read. If you want a quick education about Asia and how it operates in business and how the U.S. responds, read this book.</span>

                    <span>Chalmers Johnson defines blowback as the "unintended consequences of policies that were kept from the American people." He also puts it in a simpler phrase: "a nation reaps what it sows." A lot of it is retaliation for political interference and economic imperialism. One example is the Lockerbie bombing of 1988, which was in retaliation for Reagan's bombing of Libya in 1986. (Note: this book was published in 2000, so his passage that "the innocent of the twenty-first century are going to harvest unexpected blowback disasters from the imperialist escapades of recent decades" is tragically ironic and foreshadowing. But blowback has been experienced by other empires, so America's not the only one. Look at the Soviet Union, Britain, and Rome.<P>Johnson explains America's imperialist influence in Japan, in particular, the notorious rape case in Okinawa in 1995. That was the most publicized case. In fact assault and harassment of Okinawans is commonplace. There's a clause in the U.S. forces occupation treaty that gives the U.S. military accused of crimes the right not to hand over guilty soldiers to the local authorities. It's kind of like the diplomatic immunity ambassadors in foreign countries get. (Remember Lethal Weapon 2?)<P>Individual countries are covered in detail: Japan, both Koreas, and China, in particular. The words "American Empire" in the title are no mistake. True, it's not outright political annexation as was done in the Roman, Spanish, or British Empires, but an economic hegemony. Where the Soviet created an Eastern bloc with countries such as East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, so did the U.S. No, not in Western Europe, but in East Asia, comprising of Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, and before their fall to Communist regimes, the former French Indochina countries. In fact, what's the first thing a newly-elected Japanese prime minister does? He flies straight to Washington D.C. to report in to his new masters.<P>Another factor of American foreign policy is its support, defense and economic, of repressive anti-Communist regimes, such as South Korea and Indonesia. America hardly batted an eye when in 1980, a student demonstration protesting martial law was violently put down in what became known as the Kwangju uprising. The same is true for the Kopassus commando squads in Indonesia, who violently put down Suharto's opponents.<P>Then there's Indonesia, where Suharto, who had been put in power by the CIA in 1965, was ousted with the help of the DIA because the IMF was unable to help Indonesia's financial problems. Conclusion: Suharto was no longer useful so he was dumped. The collapse of the Asian rim economies is also touched on.<P>Another similar pattern is how former dictators are given immunity for their crimes. Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in the U.S., General Chun Doo Hwan was pardoned by South Korean President Kim Young Sam, and Suharto was deemed too ill to stand trial.<P>The ultimate message in this book is indeed, that a country reaps what it sows. Solution: less imperialism, less interference, more peace, in other words, an end to the hegemony. There's so much peaceful potential that the U.S. has--why not use that?</span>

                    <span>This book is factually challenged and morally inconsistent. The central thesis is that the US aided Afghan Mujahadeen who then turned on the US. The problem is that Johnson, perhaps in a somewhat racist manner, can't seem to distinguish the Afghan people fighting for independence and the Arab foreigners. The US aided the former, the latter were funded from wealthy Saudis. Maybe Johnson thinks they are "all the same". Indeed, within Afghanistan, factions abound. Johnson's simpleminded, and frankly colonialist view, just muddies the water.<BR>Two other themes are 1) that fighting against the Soviets was a mistake (the 1.5 million Afghans killed by them would probably disagree). This theme will find favor with Leftists. 2) That the US shouldn't have "walked away"--an invitation to paternalistic neocolonial interference in an entirely alien Muslim culture. On the face of it, it doesn't seem like a particularly bright idea. <BR>Finally, after a long slog through Johnson's contradictory, blame-mongering book, I come to the conclusion that what Johnson is essentially saying is: "No good deed must go unpunished". The US aided Muslims in a fight for freedom. Rather than receiving credit, they were massacred. Thank goodness we have people like Chalmers Johnson to say "Told you so"...</span>

                    <span>Johnson rightly examines the unintentioned effects of American foreign policy. Keeping in mind that this book was originally written pre-9/11, his observations concerning Osama Bin-Laden are eerie. The book causes the reader to wonder what will be the consequences (blowback) of Bush's current foreign policy and war in Iraq.</span>

                    <span>For practical purposes the eastern Pacific is an American lake, yet how many readers understand the role an obscure island like Okinawa plays in keeping it so. I didn't. But I do now, thanks to Johnson's valuable little book. Yes, the work's title is misleading; it needs a qualifier like Blowback in East Asia to be more accurate. Nonetheless, the chapters on Japan, and Meltdown, respectively, are little gems. Everyone knows that Japan sells alot to the US, but buys little in return. It doesn't seem fair. Their workers are employed, while ours increasingly aren't, and those who are need food stamps to survive. So should we blame them for taking away good American jobs. Not if Johnson is correct. The primary locus lies in Washington and Wall Street, not in Tokyo, Seoul or Jakarta. Simply put, it's the economics of empire that's to blame, although the term "empire" is never used in polite discourse, nor for that matter does Johnson bother to define it. But, regardless of what the network is called, reality is reality, and problems of imperial maintenance do arise, even for the experienced managers of Washington DC.<P>The challenge lies in strong but dependent economies, like Japan's and South Korea's, who have evolved their own competing form of capitalism, yet still need markets to survive. Hence, to keep dependent Asian economies dependent and their subordinate polities subordinate, markets must be regulated and upstarts punished. The chief tools in this regard are trade policy and capital flows, topics about which the American electorate thankfully knows little. If using these for reasons of empire requires undercutting America's own manufacturing sector and the good wages that go with it, then that's the price of remaining Number One. How long the imperium can continue the juggling act, however, remains to be seen.<P>Not every chapter is the equal of Japan, or Meltdown. The chapter on North Korea is very helpful for understanding the current standoff. The two on China are informative, but have little to do with blowback or empire, while the one on stealth imperialism is sub-Noam Chomsky. Moreover, the final chapter, which should be strong in summation, has little substance beyond the mildly speculative. On the other hand, prologues are often little more than bland introductions. This one however isn't. Johnson's prologue outlines in brief but telling detail a personal journey from empire's unwitting spear-carrier to that of clear-eyed critic. In its own way, it's a rather inspiring odyssey. One can only hope that increasing numbers of Americans make the same journey, because, unfortunately, empires are neither peaceable nor democratic, and rarely if ever self-liquidate.</span>
