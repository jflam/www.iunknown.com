                    <span>It's difficult for people like George Carlin to live in such a crazy country. Anyone with a logical and objective mind can see the silliness of religion. It is the greatest scam ever pulled on mankind. The religious right with their backwardness and ignorance have plenty of time on their hands hence all the bad reviews here. Well if you lot want to chant on a daily basis to an invisible man in the sky that's your business.... the rest of us will just laugh our heads off at you and make sure your moralistic and hypocritical rules don't invade our wonderful free country. Go and join the taliban and form your own country and enjoy many hours a day chanting at the sky. It's a wonderful book from an american genius.</span>

                    <span>Much of this - and I mean MUCH of this - most Carlin fans already own in one capacity or another.  A lot of this consists of material drawn from his "You Are Diseased" record and other older stuff as well, so if you're already a fan, steer clear.  Having his material prsented in an audiobook format (him in a studio reading into a microphone with no crowd interplay) just deadens much of the material and makes you overly conscious of how he does the magic.  There are times when he reads off stuff that, when you hear it live, you think is aside material (the errant curse word, the witty follow-up).  When presented here, this normally dicey flavor just comes off scripted and flat.<p>Stick to his live records.  This is just an attempt to stay in the mix because the book versions do so well (bearing in mind, the books basically codify his stage material beyond the excellent "Brain Droppings" tome).</span>

                    <span>People probably thought I was insane as I drove past them in my car laughing at this very funny audiobook.  I have to guess that the audio version is better than the text because Carlin's delivery is so fantastic.  You really have to hear the way he says it to get the full impact of the humor.<p>Carlin is a master at two things: <br>1.) Carefully choosing the exact words to describe stupid things about life<br>2.) Expression and delivery<p>In this book he talks about some of the silly things we say like, "Give my love to so and so" and "Do you have the time"?  Both very funny sketches.<p>Its not a live comedy show so there is no laugh track which I find makes the silly nature of the subjects even more amusing.<p>At times, he goes overboard and I think his far left political commentary will offend but I'm sure he doesn't care.  Some of the jokes aren't that funny and I think he was running short on the "A" material.  Nevertheless, there is plenty of hilarious stuff here and if you're a fan of George Carlin you won't want to miss it.</span>
