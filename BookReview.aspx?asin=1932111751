                    <span>I'm old enough to remember awful books with titles like "Graphics Tips from Game Gurus". From the cover I was worried that this was that type of book. But there is wisdom in the saying "don't judge a book by it's cover". This is a very serious book about both the technical aspects of the job, and the serious non-technical process aspects of the job. As the author says in the first chapter "game programming is freaking hard."
<br />
<br />There are well written sections on 2D and 3D programming, including an excellent section on basic trigonometry. There is also some good timely material on working within the Windows framework. I would have liked some more material on 3D engines, but that's a minor flaw.
<br />
<br />There are two very solid chapters on process and testing. And a very good chapter on techniques that you can use to survive the death march.
<br />
<br />Game programming sounds fun and sexy but it's a very tough gig where the odds are stacked against you. Schedules are necessarily tight. Performance concerns are paramount. And the requirements are prone to change as the game play is refined. This means that all three points of the software project (quality, schedule, requirements) are in play. To survive you need knowledge, tools, wisdom, and a little luck. This book provides you with at least three of those four.</span>

                    <span>The author tries to hard to cover the basics of making games. It sort of reminds me a class study guide, i.e., everything lumped together in a highly condensed manner.</span>

                    <span>This book purports to be for the programmer who wants to write a game. But actually the author sells himself short! The principles that he describes here as best practices for developing games, can be applied far more broadly. To any program that has a GUI for real time human interaction.<p>For example, he tells how automated build scripts are vital and how milestone builds and multiple projects are useful. But all this of course applies equally well to any code project with several programmers involved. The chapters on debugging/testing are also quite general in scope, and useful in explaining that this is a discipline, in and of itself.<p>The book specialises to code examples in C++ for the various Microsoft OSs. In no small part because most desktops are running these operating systems, and if you are in a commercial effort, you go where most of your customers are. The choice of C++ is good and realistic. For games with a quick response time, compiled code is usually faster than interpreted. But then why not C, you might ask? Because C is procedural and scales badly when the source code gets over 100 000 lines. C++ is a much better choice.<p>The coverage of 3D graphics is only the bare minimum, as the author points out. For any application using 3D, you need at least another book, dedicated purely to the algorithms in that field, to be used in tandem with this book.</span>

                    <span>The title of this book suggests two things to me. The first is that it provides a complete guide to game coding. The second is that it fills the same role for game programming that the book Code Complete fills for programming in general, i.e. a journeyman's book that fills in the gaps left in introductory texts and broadens your knowledge to prepare you to move on to more advanced topics. Unfortunately by trying to do the former (which I don't think is possible in a single book), it falls a bit short on the latter, resulting in a (very) good book rather than the great book it could have been given the author's impressive background.<p>First, the bad.<p>It seems that the author never really decided what his audience is. Parts of the book (e.g. the introduction to 3D graphics) are written for total beginners, while others (such as the overview of game engines - all of which cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to license) are really only relevant to experienced professionals. The author/publisher really should have picked an audience and stuck with it.<p>Some readers will be annoyed by how platform-specific this book is, which really isn't apparent from the cover copy or even the other reviews. All of the code samples use DirectX, and there is a lot of space dedicated to Windows-specific information. Granted, Windows and DirectX are by far the most popular choices for PC-based game development, so this won't be an issue for most readers.<p>And now for the good.<p>The best parts of this book were those covering topics that typically get overlooked in other game programming books, namely things like pointers and memory management, scripting, creating automated build enviroments and code/resource management, debugging, and notably the entire section on production, scheduling and testing. Although some of these topics are covered in other books that are not specific to game development, putting them in a single volume and exposing game developers to them early on is a Good Thing.<p>Although the sample code was fairly sparse, what he did provide was extremely useful, in particular the resource file implementation, random number generator, and scene graph.<p>Finally, props to the author for maintaining a website and actively supporting this book. As an author myself, I know how much work is involved in doing so, and I recognize that it reflects the author's desire to really help people and not just sell books.<p>In conclusion, my overall impression of this book was very positive. It's marred by a few shortcomings, but overall, I think that most new game programmers will benefit from it.</span>

                    <span>I just wanted to weigh in with my thoughts on this book.  I really enjoyed it, no I loved it.  <p>I have an addiction that involves buying every darn programming book released on Amazon.  Many (most?) of those books sit on my over-stuffed shelf barely dog eared.  I tend to browse the books I own or just mark useful chapters.<p>Not so with this book!  I read it cover to cover.  I loved the real world advice, the conversational style, the war stories and the pragmatic advice on non coding aspects of game development like estimates, scheduling, QA etc...<p>I got the same feeling of enlightenment when reading this one that I did a all those years ago when I read the classic book "Code Complete".<p>Great job Mike.  I hope it is selling well so we can hear from you again especially on topics like AI and Sound.</span>
