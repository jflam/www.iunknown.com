                    <span>True Yankees never really leave.  This book proves it. Ball players who played for many other teams still consider their time with the Yankees (however brief) the highlight of their careers.  Only one bitter player in the bunch (Hal Reniff).
<br />Maury Allen is a walking sports encyclopedia, and this is a great book.  An easy read, and chock filled with Yankees information.  I loved it.  Maury should write "Part 2".  </span>

                    <span>Now that Jim Murray and Leonard Koppett are gone, Maury Allen may be the greatest literary link to our storied sports past. The man is a treasure. He has more first-hand knowledge of great sporting events of the past 50 years than any single writer, and this latest book is just another example of a terrific scribe at work.

                    <span>Wow, there they are, all of those men whose names have slipped from my memory over the years. From Stan Bahnsen to George Zeber. From Jay Johnstone to Dooley Womack. They are the lesser lights of baseball, the non-legends who played for the Yankees but who are a part of Yankees' history. This is great stuff! Allen picked 50 former players, tells us what they're doing now and then recounts some wonderful stories about their playing days and their sometimes small parts in Yankees' lore. These are the kinds of stories that you won't read in a newspaper or press release, and even though I'm not a Yankees fan, I enjoyed reading them. Allen has a wonderful knack for telling interesting baseball stories and he shows the human side of these journeymen players and how they loved the game. If you like going behind the box scores, you'll love this book.</span>

                    <span>What a great idea! There are countless books about DiMaggio, Ruth, Maris, and Mantle, but now veteran sportwriter Maury Allen gives us a glimpse into the world of the also-rans. It takes nine players to field a team, and in this book we catch up with some of the other guys who may have had a smaller share of the glory, but who helped make the superstars what they were. <p>Of course, a book like this rises or falls on the quality of the stories themselves, and I found every story to be fun and enlightening. If you have ever wondered what happened to some of your favorite Yankees, then pick up a copy of this book.</span>
