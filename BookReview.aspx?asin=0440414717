                    <span>This book is about a man named Gary Paulsen and all of the dogs he has owned that have had an effect on his life. Each chapter is about a different dog, and what it did to make the dog special to Gary.<BR>Because I am a "dog lover" I thought this book was great. It is written very well and I think it was worth reading. I like how it is about all different kinds of dogs, each dog has different personality and a different story. It's pretty exciting to read because you're always wondering what the next dog is going to do, whether it is saving someone's life or just making someone smile. Until you read My Life In Dog Years you probably won't realise the impact our pets or animals can have on our lives. There is an amazing relationship that we have with our pets and this book captures that.<BR>I recommend My Life In Dog Years to only people who truly love dogs. If you are not a "dog person" then I highly doubt you would enjoy this book. My Life In Dogs Years is written at a 6th grade level, but it is read by all different ages. It is a great book and if you love dogs then I guarantee you will love this book.</span>

                    <span>Gary Paulsen has owned many great dogs over the years, and each dog has its own special characteristics and abilities, in their own special way. Throughout the book, different dogs help, protect, and make Paulsen laugh during his bad times. Among some of the dogs were Cookie, the sled dog who saved his life; Snowball his favorite friend that he owned as a little boy in the Philippines; Ike, his mysterious hunting dog, who would never follow Paulsen home. Instead he would wait until the next day when Paulsen went to hunt, and he would be right by his side. One of my favorite parts of the book was the little twist about where Ike was always going, and why he didn't follow Paulsen home. Dirk was Paulsens K-9 bodyguard. Although he was small, don't let him fool you, he would take on any challenge that would lye in his path. Josh is a brilliant Border collie that Paulsen still owns to this day. Josh was more human than dog. When Paulsen would talk to him, he would not only listen, but in a way he would talk back. Josh has great talent, and is always watching out for everyone. My Life in Dog Years is definitely a five-star book. Paulsen used great imagery that you can relate to in your own life experiences. It was the perfect length book, that was not to long, not too short. It was a very detailed book that made you want to keep reading until you were finished. This book will make you laugh and make you cry. My favorite dog was probably Josh because of how smart he is, and how fast that learns things. All of the dogs were great companions, and had a close relationship with Paulsen. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs, or is just looking for a good read.</span>

                    <span>I chose this book, bcause it really looked interesting. This book is about the author, Gary Paulsen, and some of his dogs he has owned. My favorite dog was Josh, because he was the smartest and he always watched over his owner and friends. My favorite part was when another dog of his, Quincy, had jumped out of Paulsen's car into Dairy Queen. Over all, this book was too good to put down.</span>
