                    <span>Geronimo Pratt had one of the most honorable and incredible lives I have ever heard of. This book documents his entire life, from is Morgan City childhood to his unjust incarceration for the murder of Caroline Olsen. I literally had trouble putting this book down. It is a great read for anyone interested in the judicial system, the FBI's COINTELPRO, the Black Panther Party, and racism in general. READ THIS BOOK!!!</span>

                    <span>This book should be mandatory reading for every black person when they turn 15 years old.  To read what the gov't put this man through was utterly shocking.  After you read this book read "The Judas Factor - The Plot to Kill Malcolm X."  You'll be numb after reading these two books back to back.</span>

                    <span>... In this respect, Last Man Standing, author Jack Olsen's biography of former Black Panther Geronimo Pratt details a gripping, unfathomable, tale of a man wrongly accused of murder and as a result, spends decades in prison.<p>While growing up in the impoverished, rural Louisiana bayou, Pratt learned how hard life can be. Tough lessons from his hard nosed father, Jack Pratt, taught Geronimo and his sibblings the value of hard work, self-reliance, and mental toughness. Geronimo, unfortunately would be forced to rely on these lessons during his constant struggle for survival throughout his entire adult life, most of which was spent incarcerated. Along with the childhood teachings of his father and a passionate sense of determination, Pratt was able to endure a fate and hardships that would have broken the average individual. <p>Generations of African Americans after Geronimo Pratt will only be able to hear stories about what life was like in the 1960's and 1970's living as a radical trying to change the system by force. The Black Panther Party (BPP) serves as one of the most famous movements opposite the more visible nonviolent protests of the 60's. As one of the leaders of the Party, Pratt quickly rose to a powerful level within the organization. Ironically, Pratt's murder conviction was the result of members of the BPP uniting against him as well as the over zealousness of law enforcement divisions dedicated to the group's extinction. <p>A good portion of the biography centers around Pratt's trial for murder. Readers will find it hard not to get caught up in the conspiracy theories and paranoia that the defendant had to be feeling at the time. Compelling arguments made by Pratt's lawyer, a talented young Johnnie Cochran, will instantly put you in Pratt's corner. <p>After being presented with the facts of the case, I firmly believe that Geronimo Pratt was innocent of the crime of which he was convicted. Readers however, should remember that they are being presented with only one side of the story. The facts however, are presented clearly enough for each person to form their own opinion. <p>I felt that this book did a good job of bringing to light the good things that the BPP did (free meals programs, literacy/education initiatives, programs to combat poverty) but I think it did a disservice by glossing over the more militant edge of the organization. Despite that minor let down, I found this novel gripping, and uplifting and I would highly recommend it to any non-fiction reader.<p>I give "LAST MAN STANDING" a rating of 3</span>

                    <span>This is a riveting piece of narrative non-fiction, one of the truly appalling miscarriages of justice in modern times excellently told by a master of true crime writing.  geronimo pratt was framed by the fbi, LA police and LA district attorney's office for a murder he wouldn't -- and didn't -- commit.  "Last Man Standing" doesn't just capture the case, it brings the reader inside the maddeningly constructed cover-up and heroic attempts to finally achieve justice. You know how it ends but still can't put it down and don't want it to end.  what higher compliment can be said of a piece of writing?   it's a masterpiece.</span>
