                <span id="Label1"><I>Angel</I> is a fascinating glimpse into the psyche of rap's most  conflicted and charismatic MC. DMX commands arena stages, wrecks his competition  in battles, and takes time to show fans some tough love. Leading off this two- hour tale of the X is the 20-minute short "Angel," directed by Bill Duke. It's a  mix of Blaxploitation and horror movie clich&#233;s that contains a slightly  overwrought performance by DMX and a healthy-looking Mary J. Blige as the angel  of mercy who watches over us all. View "Angel" once and then forget about it-- the rest of the DVD is what makes it a must-have. "One More Road" documents  step-by-step how X and his team lay down an album in the studio and the creative  and emotional intensity surrounding the process. A full taste of DMX in front of  a hometown audience is given by "Survival of the Illest," shot during his  legendary 1999 performance at the Apollo Theater. <I>--Rebecca Levine</I></span>

                    <span>Every artist who puts out a DVD, should follow this project's lead. This has everything you could ever ask for. Virtually ALL of the artist videos. Classic live performances. A "real-life" look into the artist life. A short movie that depicts the ultimate presentation of how DMX's soul is at battle between the forces of good and evil to control one man's life. What else could you ask for? DMX - Angel is the perfect package. From the short 24-minute movie, Angel, where DMX tells us from a narrator point of view on his life and how he struggles to stay righteous, to his classic performance at the famous Apollo Theatre. Wouldn't it be great if they put out a DVD exactly like this on Eminem, Jay-Z, even Snoop Dogg? Unquestionably a definate satisfaction for ANY DMX fan. If you're a fan of his music....What are you waiting for? Get up and go cop this!</span>

                    <span>I got 'em all: Up in Smoke, Bone Thugs, Welcome to Death Row, Death row uncut, but this DMX dvd is the best one that's out there!<br>The Live material is da bomb, and the movie Angel is also very cool. The length of this dvd is over 2 and a half hours, so this is pretty much the longest of the ones I mentioned above.<br>If you are a Rap fan, then get it!<br>If you are a DMX fan, well, let's say you're not one if you don't got it!</span>

                    <span>Finally what we were all waiting for came out, a DVD of one of the greatest rappers of all time.It couldn't of been made any better, it has great sound and picture quality.It is set out into 5 chapters which are :<br>1 Angel<br>2 Tales Of X<br>3 One More Road To Cross<br>4 Survival Of The Illest<br>5 Da Reel<p>Angel is a 20 minute long mini-movie which stars Dmx and Mary J Blige. Its not amazing but worth watching once.<p>Tales of x is a look into the life of DMX and contains alot of never before seen footage of DMX's life.<p>One more road to cross shows how the very popular album and then there was x was created.<p>Survial of the illest is my favourite part of the DVD because it shows DMX on tour performing his classic songs of his first 2 albums.It also has footage of Method Man,Redman and LL Cool J.<p>Da reel has 10 of DMX's videos rangin from ruff ryders anthem to stop being greedy.<p>This DVD is a must buy for all DMX & Ruff Ryder fans or just anybody who likes rap music.</span>

                    <span>This dvd is everything dmx-the best of dmx should have been.<br>The sound- You got stero (dmx-the best of dmx only had very poor stero) and you got DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1(for every section of the dvd), when set on 5.1 and turned all the way up...man if you got a decent speaker system this how x should sound, the sound is amaizing.<br>The video: The pictuer quality is again crystal clear. dmx-the best of dmx had the poorest visuals ive seen on a dvd.<p>The DVD: The dvd is packed. Here is whats on it:<p>Angel-Angel is a short movie (about 21mins) it has religious theme and all the way through out you got X explaining his life and all the way through out you got different songs playing through the back ground, Mary j Blige stars in it, she doesn't do much and only sings for about 2 mins in the end.<p>Tales of x-It has footage of X in concert and interviews with X back stage, but its mainly X live on stage from the hard knock life tour.<p>One more road to cross-There interviews with X from his house and from back stage. This part follows him through the recording studio and has interviews with Lyor Cohen (president of Def Jam) telling you about signing X. It then shows X recording some songs then its got some more back stage of X with Fed Durst, Method Man and Redman, After its got X leting you hear one of his tapes from before he got a record deal.<p>Survival of the illest- Footage from X's first tour, includes backstage interviews and X on stage.<p>Da Reel-This is the section to go to, it has Get at me dog-Stop Being Gready-How's It Going Down- Ruff Ryders anthem- Slippin-What's My Name- DIRECTORS CUT of Who We Be- Party up-No More Love For Me and great deprssion (wich is just a trailer for his new album) The sound and video quality is top class. My only complaint is why are all the songs censored??? On the same dvd you got his live preformences uncensored but in the music videos all the swearing is out, apart from that the music videos are excellent quality (Dolby Digital 5.1) You also got the option of playing all, instead of having to choose one tune after the other.<p>In a dog's world- This is split in 4 sections, section 1 is History wich has all of X's albums along with the track list for all his albums. Section 2 Street flicks is never before seen photos of X  (it says on the dvd case of X and the whole blood line crew...the blood line crew weren't in the photo section.)<br>Then you got the option of Web site......Im sure you can figuer out what this section is and the forth section is About this dvd wich is just a list of credit for the dvd.<p>Audio selection- You got the choice of Stero of Dolby Digital 5.1, the sound is amazing.<p>This dvd is how all music dvds should be, it has MUSIC VIDEOS, INTERVIEWS, BACK STAGE FOOTAGE, CONCERT FOOTAGE and even a short film thrown in and the menues in the dvd are really cool too, it has moving images and X's tunes playing in the menues, IF YOU'RE A DMX FAN........YOU HAVE TO GET THIS DVD, IT HAS EVERYTHING.<br> GET IT NOW<p>p.s This dvd is ALL REGION so you can watch it anywhere in the world on any dvd player.</span>
