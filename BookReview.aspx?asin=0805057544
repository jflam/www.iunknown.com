                <span id="Label1">How has Microsoft been able to crush its competition every step of the way? The company's own version of history ascribes it to something like "really great technical innovation." <I>Barbarians Led by Bill Gates</I> presents a harsher and messier history, sharply questioning Microsoft's ethics and corporate wisdom while underscoring its fierce will to compete.<p>The authors present a history of Microsoft from the early '80s to the present, covering the big projects, both successes and failures, that defined the company's direction. It's a difficult story to tell, filled with complex technology and a large cast of characters who are rarely in the public eye.<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing to emerge is how many Microsoft ventures were mismanaged and how many opportunities were missed. The best-known of these is Microsoft's near-catastrophic failure to see the arrival and success of the Internet. The book also details the unplanned success of Windows 3.0, the demise of Pen Windows (which annihilated GO Corp. and its promising Penpoint operating system but little else), and the compromised design and slow success of Windows 95. A final chapter tackles the Netscape-Microsoft Web-browser war and Microsoft's head-on collision with the Justice Department.<p>Both authors are, in different ways, Microsoft insiders. Jennifer Edstrom is the daughter of Pam Edstrom, Gates's long-time PR chief and spin doctor. Marlin Eller is a 13-year veteran Microsoft developer who has worked on DOS, early versions of Windows, and pen computing. Both stand open to the charge of having an ax to grind, and the reader senses a lot of personal animosity at work. Yet anyone who has followed Microsoft for any length of time will recognize most of the war stories from other sources, and most of the new information presented has the ring, at least, of probability. Indeed, the value of this book is not so much in presenting new information as in marshaling it to paint a portrait of a company that has largely escaped this sort of scrutiny. <i>--Thomas Mace</i></span>

                    <span>As others have pointed out this first person/third person thing is quite hilarious.  After about the second or third time you come across this "Eller" fellow who seems to be always on the scene and always right, you look back and see his name on the cover.  But the funnier one is every now and then you can almost hear Jennifer Edstrom saying "and then mommy saved the day again ..."
<br />
<br />However I did give it more than the minimum, because I do think there is value in getting a perspective from what it looked like from the front line.  I did finish the book, and I think I got some insight into Microsoft.

                    <span>An insider's account of the development of windows and related events, Barbarians is excellent reading. It explodes the right wing fetish about the genius of Bill Gates, and nullifies the equally baseless conservative notion that huge bureaucratic enterprises are efficient, as long as they are private. It is also quite revealing of the dangers of allowing the monopolistic practices of any business to remain unchallenged. The thuggish tactics of Microsoft, from it's days as a IBM toady to it's genesis as Corporate bully number one, coupled with the mindless greed, the idea theft and the thick headed stupidity of the Microsoft upper management reveal the true nature of the corporate capitalist state.  Worse for Chairman Bill, the book cannot be dismissed as the sour grapes ranting of unhappy competitors since Eller made millions as a Microsoft software developer and Edstrom is the daughter of one of MS' chief PR goons. Barbarians should be read by fans and foes of Microsoft alike, if for no other reason than to witness the alienation and frustration of all corporate employees, even those that are millionaires. Death to the corporate state.</span>

Reading/viewing these titles before 'Barbarians Led by Bill Gates' will provide a good chronology.</span>
