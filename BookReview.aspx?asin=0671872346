                    <span>This is a very interesting book on history of science and economics and how they interact with each other. If you want to know how economics is related (or should be related) to science, start from here. Every economist should read this book.</span>

                    <span>Many popular science books are worthwhile "skimmers".  You can hop, skip and speed-read through them to quickly extract the meat.  Not so with Complexity, which has almost zero meat.  It's 99.5% trivia, from biographical info, to the feelings of mathematicians, to the beauty of sunsets, ad nauseum.  There is no math.  There is no science.  There is nothing to chew on.  If you are stuck in a Siberian prison and this is the only book available to read then I warmly recommend it.  Otherwise, you may find it a waste of time.</span>

                    <span>In many ways this is a history book.  It gives biographies and traces the thoughts of a number of very good thinkers.  Along the way it shows how isolated ideas from a great number of people blend together to generalize each other, leading to some amazing ideas.
<br />
<br />This is not a technical book.  This book is about breadth without much depth.  There are few if any formulae in the text.  There are only ideas building upon other ideas.  Look at it as a broad synthsis without rigor.
<br />
<br />To be honest the first several chapters were difficult to read.  This part was mainly biographical in nature and there were not enough ideas introduced to catch my interest.  After reading more and more, it became very easy to link the ideas into a more interesting cohesiveness.  In effect the book follows the traditions of evolving systems by combining what seem to be random bits and pieces to grow into something much more complex and useful.  it grows on you.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The cover of the book says " If you liked Chaos, you will love complexity". I just finished reading the book, that validated the claim. While Chaos is written as story of discovery of a new science, Complexity excels as a saga of men who ventured into previously unchartered domains addressing for the first time issues like:<p>What is life? What is driving force that caused cells to appear from a primordal soup of all elements, when the probability of so happening is infinitesimal? What causes evolution? Do nice guys finish last? What makes evolution, coevolution, adaptation, extinction work? Why do we organize ourselves into families, cultures, nations? <p>Why do stock markets crash, boom? What controls the emergence of economies? Why can USSR go from one of strongest nations/economies to the state of divided helplessness in less than a few years? <p>Why are we here? What is life? Artificial Life? Are we still evolving? What is the cause of increasing complexity?<p>On mundane level: What is non-linearity? What is Chaos? If this science is all that important, why did we wait this long for recognizing it?<p>What are the paradigms in which sociology and physics settle into same patterns? How neural networks were born, brought up and mastered? <p>This novel/book is as much about these questions as it is about the scientists who engaged in unravelling many of these mysteries. It speaks about their failures and successes, their approach, ethic and driving force, their fears, fights and friendships. For most part it reads like a thriller, and by the time you are done, you find yourself searching for another book on Chaos, complexity, life at the edge of chaos, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence. After just 358 pages, your imagination and knowledge of science leaps from Newton's linear models to the twentyfirst century stuff.</span>
