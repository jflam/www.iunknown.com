                    <span>This book, The Earth, My Butt, and other big round things is by Carolyn Mackler. This  is about a 15 year old girl named Virginia. She lives in New York city with her mom and dad. Her brother, Byron has just gone away to college, along with her sister, Anais who is in Africa studying animals. Virginia hates herself. She thinks she is dumb, ugly, and fat. She only has one friend and her name is Shannon. She had just moved to Walla Walla, Washington so her parents can study onions. Virginia's family is perfect....exept for her. She has to see a counselor, Mrs. Crowley, that has had some of the same problems as she has had. People often talk behind Virginia's back, and she thinks that she would pretend that it wasnt happening but...she ends up not agnoring it and spending her whole lunch hour inside the bathroom. This is a great book and I loved it. I would reccomend it to people that were older, becuase it was a little strong for my age, but it's still my favorite book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book's themes:
<br />
<br />1. Weight. As you can see from the title, this book contains a lot of heartfelt info about personal weight and image. Virginia is a good example by doing the wrong thing and learning from it. I loved the scene in the book when Virginia realizes that the girl throwing up in the stall next to her is the skinny, popular girl. Very satisfying.
<br />
<br />2. Relationships. Several in particular, Virginia's romance with Froggy, her relationship with her obsessive mother, friends, and so on.
<br />
<br />3. What's perfect? My favorite and most deep theme of all. Until her brother is temporarily suspended from Columbia for date rape, Virginia and the world thinks of the Shreves (excluding her) as perfect. But clearly Byron is shallow and un-perfect, and her parents follow a similar suit.
<br />
<br />But my advice? Read the book and decide for yourself. I think you will find it is well-written and goes into a lot of issues presented to girls of Middle, High, and Upper Elementary (5th and 6th Grade)Schools all across America (and also all over the world.)</span>

                    <span>I read this book and few months ago and I absolutely love it! This is one of the few books that I have read that actually captures what it's like to be a teenager and what teenagers actually go through (weight issues, boyfriends, sibling rivalary, etc...). Some people said that this book was sexually explicit but it really isn't at all. Another thing that I have read in the reviews was that it encouraged to develop eating disorders. The truth is that it actually encourages teenager girls to be confortable in their own skin and not to focus on their weight, but to focus on their health. I  think that this book would be great for any teenage girl that wants something to relate to. It's a must read!!!</span>

<br />
<br />Meet Virginia Woolf Shreves. She is the insecure, over-weight daughter of 2 seemingly very perfect parents and 2 perfect siblings. Froggy is her crush and the boy she fools around with on Monday afternoons. Virginia tries very hard to be just like the rest of her model family, but one phone call changes how she feels about them, her life, Froggy and herself.
<br />
<br />I loved how Virginia thought and the way she was so easy to relate to. I read this in one day and I am hoping there is a sequel. I would recomend this book to any teenage girl.
