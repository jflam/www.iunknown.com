                    <span>I bought this book with some skepticism.  After all, if it only takes 7 aseconds to market something, why does a whole industry exist to help the would-be entrepreneur spend a whole lot more? On reading the book the term  'catch-phrase' takes on a new (and profitable) meaning. Every telesales  person knows that he/she has about 4 seconds at the start of a cold call to  get the prospect's interest and the 'initial benefit statement' which helps  can be difficult to create. 'Seven Second Marketing' shows the reader how  to create not just a general IBS but one which will stick in the mind of  the prospect after the call is concluded - and still be there when the Sale  Process is continued at a later date. The essence of the memory hook, as Dr  Misner describes it, is that it is short, relevant AND memorable.  This  book shows how to create one and I recommend it strongly to anyone who  needs to be remembered by first-met acquaintances, business or social (or  even political!) Since reading this book I purchased two other books by Dr  Misner and both have contributed to my success as a self-employed  businessman. See the Amazon Index for details of these books. Happy  Marketing!</span>
