                    <span>Best known for "The Boys of Summer," Roger Kahn spent half a century writing on baseball and much more. This book is a collection of his essays, mostly on baseball and its players, but fifty years of writing is a lot of writing. Here are his writing on many, many other people, other activities. Still, this is Roger Kahn, even the baseball stories make you remember that baseball players are still people. 
<br />
<br />The short (5 page) Chapter 17 is on Joe DiMaggio's marriage to Marilyn Monroe. It brings a great sadness. This kind of reaching for the emotions is a thing that Roger Kahn does better than just about anyone else. He is able to look beyond the superstar personna to the peson underneath and then to bring this person to life using just the printed word. 
<br />
<br />The really good thing about books like this is that they mean that the words printed in a newspaper that will be thrown away the next day remain available. This is a supurb book, writing at its best. </span>

                    <span>Saying this book is almost as good as Kahn's "Boys of Summer" really means that "The Boys" batted 407, and "Beyond the Boys" batted 406.
<br />Wonderful, unbeatable prose, great stories told by one of the masters of baseball writing. It belongs on every baseball fan's bookshelf. Don't miss it.</span>

                    <span>I have never read a book by Roger Kahn that was less than five stars.  This volume is a collection of Kahn's work from books and magazine articles from his illustrious career.  Roger covered the Brooklyn Dodgers during the seasons of 1952 and 1953 which led to The Boys of Summer.  The book is divided into sections with chapters devoted to athletes, mainly baseball players, that have been subjects of Kahn's work over the past several decades.  The last chapter is a tribute to former Dodgers' outfielder Carl Furillo, The Reading Rifle.  It is absolutely first rate.  Some of the other sections of the book are devoted to New York's centerfielders of the 1950's, hitters and pitchers, fighters such as Dempsey and Ali, in addition to Billy vs. Reggie, and George M. Steinbrenner.  A very touching section is entitled "Heroes Off the Field" in which chapters are devoted to Jackie Robinson, Roberto Clemente, Ring Lardner, and Pee Wee Reese.  Another memorable section is devoted to "On Getting Old" with chapters on Robert Frost, Stan Musial (old as a ballplayer), sportswriters, and the previously mentioned Carl Furillo.  I did find one minor error in the Introduction written by Rob Miraldi when he said "he (Kahn) was sent to cover the crosstown Giants in the Bronx" after covering the Dodgers in 1952 and 1953.  The Giants as Miraldi knows played in the Polo Grounds which was located on the island of Manhattan.  If you have enjoyed Roger Kahn's previous books you won't want to miss this one, especially if you are a baseball fan.  This isn't a book to be read by a speed reader.  This is a book to be savored.</span>
