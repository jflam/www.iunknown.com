                    <span>As a medical practitioner who is not versed with the intricate details of quantum mechanics and relativitiy (let alone string theory), I have been waiting for some time to read a book which explains in laymen terms, yet not too simplistically, the most recent attempts to formulate a Theory of Everything (TOE). I have enjoyed many books on related topics by people such as Paul Davies, Stephen Hawking, Murry Gell-Mann, Timothy Ferris, John Gribbin, Michio Kaku and others, however I desperately wanted to extend my knowledge to String Theory and its applications. <P> I picked up Brian Green's book with alacrity and wasn't disappointed. This book explains in sufficient but not too laborious detail the most recent advances in String/M Theory. Overall, the book is well structured and illuminating. Pitching with the right amount of detail and employing cogent analogies makes it a very easy read for a layperson. The one thing I would have liked, however, was a little bit of mathematical detail although I don't honestly know if this is feasible given the breadth of the topic.<P> Certainly a must read for anyone intersted in keeping abreast of the physics frontier, albeit it in an amateur way.</span>

                    <span>Ah, the scintillating, supersymmetric stage whereupon siteth superstring theory! Enough play, this book is the layman's guide to the hardcore regions of physics. No more idle play with particle physics and atomic physics. Forget nuclear physics and neutron physics. Brian Greene attacks with ferocity the underlying heart of matter: elementary particle physics, the most difficult branch of physics and all intellectual endeavors ever undertaken by the human mind. Greene first lays the groundwork for the main focus of his book. He elucidates relativity, then quantum mechanics, and finally the incompatibility between these two pillars of modern science. Once these formalities are out of the way, Greene takes superstring theory by the reigns. He introduces the concept of the vibrating string, how strings resolve the incompatibility between QM and RT, the necessity for extra dimensions, the shape of these dimensions, the predictions of superstring theory, experimental evidence for this theory, further esoteric predictions of superstring theory, difficulties currently residing within the theory, and future prospects, to name but a few of its selling points. Greene is a master of analogies which help him explain many of the concepts in his book with relative ease. His use of analogies for well known concepts, such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect are novel and cute. It is a relief to see care taken to think up of new analogies than simply borrowing from the earlier pedigrees! Very well done! When all is said and done, this book might not be all that easy of a read for some. Having a thorough and extensive physics background and a true, deep passion for physics, this book simply quenched my thirst. Nothing was of any suprise. However, for the newbie, it may be difficult to digest three enourmous theories in only several hundred pages, and furthermore, requires a fair amount of love of the subject to be truly moved and appreciative of the content. After all, only a dedicated person would really want to read about surface geometry and spatial dimensions. Nevertheless, this book offers a good report on the progress of cutting edge physics.</span>

                    <span>This books is over-rated, but still better than most books on the subjects he covers. I gave it two stars to get your attention. It is actually a 3 or 4 star book. <P>I was dissappointed because the title suggested I'd read more about the mysteries of the beginning of the universe and some of the philosophical issues pertaining to the nature of existance and ultimate reality. While the author did give me some good mindfood at the end of the book, the coverage was too brief and far too restrained. I think he was aware of his peers reading it and was being too conservative. <P>I skimmed a lot. I kept an eye out for places where he quit trying to teach me details and made some interesting comments. I'll give him credit--there were plenty of facinating paragraphs---but they were hidden in page after page of boring stuff. Lets face it, this is arcane stuff! But the implications are interesting, at least to me. I think the book should have been about half the length. <P>I personally don't think it is possible to understand things like relativity without working some problems. When I took physics, I had to work a few problems to think about the stuff deeply enough to "get it." I don't think many readers are looking to work that much--most of us want a stimulating read. And as the author mentions, many believe that no one really understands quantum mechanics. Also, I did not like the analogies as much as some other readers. <P>I recommend this book to really really smart readers or to readers who know how to skim without losing interest. Some of the insights were worth looking for.</span>

                    <span>Toe central problem of physics today revolves around this conundrum: Gravity is governed by Einstein's relativity theory, which requires that space-time is smooth. Gravity has been experimentally verified. Atomic forces are govered by quantum mechanics, which requires that space-time is bumpy, foamy, and irregular. These atomic forces have been experimentally verified.<P>How can space time be smooth for gravity, and yet be bumpy for quantum machanics? Enter string theory.<P>This book is a terrific introduction not only to string theory, but to relativity and quantum mechanics as well. The first half of the book reviews the history and development of these theories, since they are a fundamental component of string theory. In particular, Greene's treatment of relativity uses some outstanding analogies to explain time dilation and gravitational warping. I thought I understood the basics of relativity; this book still taught me a few things.<P>Analogies are this author's strength. He uses them at every step to avoid the need to complex mathematical formulae. There are no formulae in this book (some will think that a minus, but I view it as a plus.) Using analogies, he's able to provide a comprehensible view of what 10-dimensional spacetime would be like, and how expanding one of the other dimensions might affect life in the Universe. These 5 pages alone are probably worth the price of the book.<P>If you want a glimpse of one of the cutting-edge areas of particle physics research without needing to study math for 10 years, this book can give it to you.</span>

                    <span>I have to credit Brian Greene. He did what I thought was the impossible: he got me interested in science. I've been a liberal arts-type since I can remember. The exact rules and laws of science always left me kind of cold, and so I found myself drawn to literature, poetry and music as the more complete descriptors of human experience.<BR><BR>But last Fall, I couldn't sleep one night and ended up staying up until dawn watching THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE. It was amazing and captivating. It got me excited in a way "science" hadn't since I was a kid, fascinated with the imaginative possibilities of space travel.<BR><BR>I was hooked and had to get the book. The tv program proved to be a great distillation of the book, but if you saw the program and your interest was piqued by the magical dance of superstrings and the mind-bending extra dimensional possibilities, you'll enjoy the full feast of Greene's book even more.<P>THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE is an enormous feat. It marries the rigor of scientific enquiry with the elegant, at times poetic, presentation of literature. Greene is such an able and down-to-earth explainer of complicated mathematical concepts that he makes even the most dyed-in-the-wool math hater think about signing up for some evening classes at the local college.</span>
