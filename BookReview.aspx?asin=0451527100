                    <span>On reviewer wrote this: "reward those who don't produce, and punish those who do," as the main theme of the Manifesto, calling it fantasy.  Is it possible that Bill Gates "produces" 2.5 billion times more and than a minimum-wage worker does who actually does the producing?  Not only is this an illogical point, it is not at all any kind of point being made by the Manifesto.  Punish those who oppress those who produce and let those who produce organize society.  That's the point of it.  
<br />
<br />This is a wonderful piece of writing that is extraordinarily well grounded in history and the study of classes in society.  It is not perfect and there is no reason to think it should be, but it holds more wisdom and less "fantasy" than, say, the Bible, which is a work of fiction with moral lessons that is the best selling book in the world.  
<br />
<br />It is hard to look at our culture from the point of view of someone wanting to change it when you are surrounded by messages that make you feel hopeless, by corporate media that does not report the news.  This is a look into that.  </span>

                    <span>This book is most likely the biggest piece of garbage that I have ever read. The concepts that are in this book are right out of a fantasy world. The main concept of this book is "reward those who don't produce, and punish those who do."</span>

                    <span>This book is quite enlightening.  Not because Marx's ideas necessarily reflect reality, but it shows how little many of Marx's critics understand him.   This book says alot of interesting things, the most important is that if certain conditions are met, the prolitariet will overthrown the bourguois.  It also outlines what a Communist, by his/her very nature, is.  However, there is no way to prove or disprove Marx's prediction, because the conditions for proletariet rule have not been met.  Also, according to his definition, no one can be a real Communist unless they have zero self-interest which is impossible.  The book is great until the last page when he calls for bloody revolution. 
<br />
<br />I do not see why people call this book evil.  Surely the Bible has inspired worse, but most would hardly call it evil.  Guns do not kill people, people do; if people choose not to critically think and be skeptical then all books will be evil.  This book is an interesting, and brief, account of European history with regard to class struggle and merely makes a claim (before the call to arms).  This book is hardly scientific, but is interesting and offers a usually shunned point of view.  Highly recommended.</span>
