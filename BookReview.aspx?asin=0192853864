                    <span>This book is well written and scholarly, but has a definite Mahayana and Tibetan bias. For instance, the assertion that reincarnation and states of future existance (hell beings, hungry ghosts, etc.) is fundamental to all Buddhist groups is not true. The docterine stems from a 1200 AD Cambodian text, and there are Buddhist discourses that warn against debate on reincarnation (with arguements about the implicit assumption of a self or soul that may lie in this belief). The other Very Short Introduction to Buddha is less biased. For a better introduction, I would recommend Rahula's What the Buddha Taught.</span>

                    <span>The Very Short Introductions series continues to engage me with each volume I read. Buddhism has been an area of potential interest for me for a while as a student of Philosophy and someone who takes an interest in religion and belief, but I've never got round to actually studying its core principles and history, and this volume seemed like a perfect introduction, being as it is from a fantastic series. <p>As a borderline liberal Christian/theistically-inclined agnostic I was intrigued by the Buddhist teachings, which Keown writes about in accessible but engaging style, and I certainly will be looking into the faith more in future. In our current world we all need to understand more about other traditions and be more open-minded about our own views, and for those who want to practise this by learning about Buddhism, I reccommend this book unequivocally.</span>

                    <span>Part of a series by Oxford University Press, this book, 'Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction', follows the same format as other texts in the Very Short Introduction series -- it has fewer than 150 pages, is well indexed, has a useful glossary, accessible and enjoyable narrative, and captures the essence in a very short space the major points of its topic.  There are probably nearing 100 volumes in this Very Short Introduction series (making it, ironically, not a Very Short series), but among those that I have read, this text stands out as being one of the best.<p>Damien Keown, of the University of London and the Royal Asiatic Society, addresses Buddhism past and present, East and West.  Beginning with narrative tales the help to exhibit the principles, Keown examines in turn the major questions.  First, with regard to Buddhism, is this -- is Buddhism really a religion?  Often categorised as such, it is often the exception proving the rule.  Many take strong spiritual and philosophical ideas from Buddhism (sometimes without knowing it) but do not subscribe the larger system of practices -- but perhaps most telling, Buddhism is a non-theistic way of being.  Keown looks at seven dimensions of religion, and concludes that Buddhism does fit a broader definition of religion.<p>Keown proceeds from there to look at the origins of Buddhism, the life of the Buddha, ideas of karma and reincarnation, and the central ideas of the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.  From these beginnings, Buddhism branches out, the largest grouping being the Mahayana (who get their own chapter), and other spreading first across Asia and then to the rest of the world.<p>Like other books in this Very Short series, there are useful maps, a nice snapshot timeline, and suggestions for further reading, should the Very Short introduction not prove sufficient (and for many, this sample will leave the reader wanting more).  I cannot speak too highly of this series, and of this volume on Buddhism by Keown in particular.</span>

                    <span>Written by Damien Keown (the version which came out in May 2000, not the one written by M. Carrithers), A very short introduction to Buddhism is one of the best "short-form" books on Buddhism I have read.  It has clarity and it is enlightening.  The author makes a complex subject easily understandable for readers who may not have much knowledge of Buddhism.  Even for advanced readers of Buddhism, the book was v enjoyable.  That is why I have given away over 20 copies of this book, and keep finding myself buying more as gifts.  I have never written a book rec until now, because I believe this book truly deserves one.  It spreads lots of good karma!</span>

                    <span>This is not only an accessible volume, but also a very insightful one. Damien Keown has a good understanding of Buddhism and presented it in a short and simple format. Yet within its simplicity lies many valuable pearls and insights that are rarely seen in books of this size. There is the brief discussion on what is suffering in which he explain to great clarity why certain terms were used and what they mean. His dicussion on ethics is excellent. I would strongly recommend it to any reader, be it those only seeking a brief introduction or those who are already very well read on Buddhism.</span>
