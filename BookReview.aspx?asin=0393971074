                    <span>Myself, SUKANT VYAS,am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, Dyal Singh (Evening) College of the University of Delhi, India and I also teach postgraduate students - Liberal Politicl Theory and Marxist Political Theory. I have reviewed many books on political theory specifically and have written research articles. This particular book has by now become a handbook for me as a teacher of political science. I do not think there is any better comment for this very useful book for all the scholars of political science. This book is recommended for all interested in politics.</span>

                    <span>I am using this book as the primary text of a graduate level course in Rational Action Theory. It is very clear and easy to read, and takes several different and complex matters, and simplifies them. The subject matter involves: How we make decisions, Politics, Statics, and Probability. Of all material that I have read on the subject matter including The Federalist Papers, The Prince, Microeconomics and Behavior, and An Economic Theory of Democracy, this is by far the easiest to understand. I rate this book four stars. I would have rated it five stars if it used examples that were more interesting, and held the reader to the relatively dry subject matter a little better. I am not trying to find fault with this very good work. I just think that it could have been even better if some minor changes had been made.</span>
