                    <span>I haven't read a book this good in a long time. Dan Brown keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time. It was very difficult to put the book down. The historical references are really cool as are the twist and turns that keep you wondering what will happen next. Anther major plus to the book is that Brown ties together all loose ends giving a very satisfying feeling at the end of the reading. </span>

                    <span>Hey, this is a fun and entertaining beach or airplane read.  Nothing serious, actually a lot of fantasy made up to look like something that could be real.  This really a prequel to the Da Vinci Code.  Robert Langdon is back in action.  I do enjoy Dan Brown's books but I don't understand their Huge success?  Mystery to me.  But then I don't understand the success of American Idol either.  If you like this type of thriller you must check out "MAP OF BONES" and "A TOURIST IN THE YUCATAN" my to favorites of 2005!</span>

                    <span>This book was one I found at random and started reading it. It is a very detailed book that is one of the few books that you do not want to put down. I'll not give the plot away except to say that what the author told me through his book is that the ends do not justify the means.</span>

                    <span>Ordinarily I do not read fiction, but once I got into this work, the more I realized the extent to which the author relied on historical fact.  Two books come immediately to mind, GIORDANO BRUNO AND THE HERMETIC TRADITION, and THE MALLEUS MALIFICARUM.  The timing of my reading corresponded niclely with the election of a new pope.  I appreciated the knowledge gained from reading of matters by an author who used facts to develop his plot.  I confess I harkened more to them than I did to the vehicles he used to tie the story together.  Still, the plots were essential to my greater understanding, and I enjoyed them.  My wife liked it too, and she is as adamantly opposed to my historical persuasion as I notmally am to fiction upon which she relies.
<br />She is looking forward to reading more of the author's works.  I probably will not.  I was especially impressed with the balance of his arguments between the art of science and the tradition of religion.  He was more than fair, and correct, in my opinion, as to the relationship between the two supposedly opposing positions.  Yet, it is true that extremists exist in each realm, but extremism often invites its own reaction that prevents the relevance of balance developed by the author.  It is a work that should be read by members of both groups, either presumed angels, and or demons.  For the truth is, there is less that devides them than one might imagine.  </span>

                    <span>I had actually planned on reading this book about a year (or two) ago but never got around to it then.  I was, to be frank, obsessed with Angels at the time, and what else would pop up besides Dan Brown's "Angels and Demons"?  I read it a few months later, at the advice and reminder from a friend.  I finished the book quickly (I do this with all bad books) and later went on to read "The Da Vinci Code" because it gained so much popularity.
<br />
<br />I was, of course, sorely disappointed.
<br />
<br />I understand why Dan Brown was placed in TIME's 100 Most Influential People.  He IS influential.  As a business man and a movie screen writer (if the rumors are correct, then also as a plagiarist who got rich and go away with it).
<br />
<br />In the near future, he will also be influential for his, "Evaluating Vatican Art for Dummies," and "Evaluating Da Vinci's Art for Dummies."
<br />
<br />Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  He's already written them, hasn't he?
<br />
<br />People do not like his books because they are good books.  They, besides my dad, do not like him for the so-called 'action' and 'suspense'.  They do not like him for his 'clever' plot twists.
<br />
<br />No, they like him because he can make even the most philistinic philistine feel like they know Da Vinci's works like the back of their hands.  Angels and Demons (I'm not even gonna put quotations on that title anymore) makes them feel like they've been devout Catholic professors of Renaissance works currently stowed in the Vatican.  HOnestly?  Dan Brown's interpretations of each of these works are worthless.  Fake.  Disturbing.  Practically disgusting.
<br />
<br />The Ecstacy of St. Teresa is NOT composed of an angel raping a poor saint with an arrow. Where in the world and all of Dante's hells did you get that, Brown? Your descriptions of your fake interpretations were worthless, too.  The MOST worthless part of it was that about half of all your readers around the world think the same way your twisted and money-lusting mind does.
<br />
<br />
<br />Honestly, when the Pope died, the...Fifth thought I had was, "I wonder how many people will claim to know something about these procedures because they 'read Angels and Demons.'"  I can bet it almost ALL of the Dan Brown population.
<br />
<br />This book deserves ONE AND A HALF (there wasn't a score for this, so I rounded down) for the fact it conned philistines and is a great self-help book for philistines.
<br />
