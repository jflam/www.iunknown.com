                <span id="Label1">Abate, abhor, abject, abridge, abstemious ... still awake? Good, because now there's a better way to learn all those words than plowing through those never-ending vocabulary lists devised by torture experts. <I>Tooth and Nail: A Novel Approach to the New SAT</I> is just what it says it is: a guide to the big, bad SAT words in the form of a mystery novel. Follow Caitlin and Phil's exploits as they wend their way through their first year of college and find intrigue behind the curtain of academia. As you do, you'll find a few words in boldface, each of which is defined and compared with other words in a glossary in the back of the book. Seeing the word in its context and immediately finding a definition is a much more satisfying way to learn than just to read word after unconnected word--you might as well read the dictionary! A preface explains in greater detail how best to use the book, and there are helpful SAT-style exercises in antonyms, analogies, and comprehension, so this makes a great all-around verbal package for the serious test-taker. If you <I>must</I> take the test, you might as well have a little fun doing it, and by the time you've finished <I>Tooth and Nail</I>, you'll be glad it doesn't end as a list: "...wizened, wreak, writhe, zeal, zealous."  <I>--Rob Lightner</I></span>

                    <span>I read this book for an english summer homework assignment. Although the back description and introduction allude to an interesting and valuable read, do not expect much. This book is a sore disappointment for anyone who possesses a genuine love of reading. The plot is unbelievably simplistic and unoriginal and it was difficult for me to believe that two well educated scholars wrote it. I was bored to tears after the opening paragraph of the "story" and have had a tough time finishing it. If it weren't for the fact that I will be tested on this, I would have gladly exchanged it for a more engaging read. In terms of SAT prep, it was not entirely helpful there either. Many times throughout the book, it seemed as though the authors exchanged simpler words for complex, lesser known SAT words. The problem was that the SAT words did not fit the context and were spoken by characters that would not have had any clue about the word. The characters were dull and 2-D without ever developing or being explored. The dialogue was unreal and forced. <br>All in all, this was a horrible book that did not teach me any new words. It was torture to read. Like a previous reviewer said, for SAT prep words read some classic novels where you will be entertained as well as educated. For a REAL mystery, try "The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown.</span>

                    <span>When I first saw this book, I was excited with this "novel" approach. My friend said it was good, so I started reading.<br>What I found, however, was that 95% of the words I already knew. I'm studying for my SATs, so I know a sizable amount of words. I was hoping to learn new and challenging words.<br>Some of the words are absurd. Words like biased, indifferent, spontaneous, captivating, articulate, tentative, convey, intiated, diverse (i just happened to flip to a random page (p.25) and am listing some bold-faced words) appear a billion times on the pages. Some of the words were new to me, like masquerade (which I doubt I will find on the SAT). Most of the words however were elementary and definately did not improve my vocabulary.<p>When I first read all those 3 star reviews I didn't want to believe them, so I tried the book anyway. Needless to say I am disapointed.<br>Aside from other problems that I won't mention (but other customers have, such as the lack of a plot or the flipping to the back, which you wont need to be doing very often if you're studying for the SATs), this book's vocabulary is very limited.<p>To sum it up, if you're looking to study for an examination and want to learn challenging words, try another book (personally I've been trying to memorize word lists and have ordered Kaplan's Ring of McAllister, another novel). If you don't know anything, don't want to study word lists, don't want to try other SAT vocabulary novels, or just want to review some basic vocabulary words such as adjacent, complex, nuture, diversity, bizarre, dominant............, well then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>I was required to read Tooth and Nail for my etymology class.  The whole purpose of this class is to learn vocabulary for the SAT.  While my verbal score did increase, it wasn't because of reading the book.  The idea is a good one:  using words in context is one of the best ways to learn words, in my opinion.  But, as many reviews have already stated, it was extremely tedious having to flip through the back of the book just to see what the word means.  I noticed that the longer I read, the less I flipped through the back.<p>The authors call Tooth & Nail a mystery novel, yet the "mystery" part only compromises the last 40% or so of the book.  The preceding stuff is just garbage -- extremely slow exposition.  There is even a chapter (the "radio chat" for those of you that have read this book) that serves ABSOLUTELY no purpose, other than to cram in words.  That's fine and dandy, except one thing:  the less interesting a book gets, the less likely you'll finish it.  You can tell that the authors haven't visited a college campus for a while (yet, I think they put forth valiant effort trying to make it seem real.)<p>Indeed, I augmented my lexicon from taking etymology, but most of it was from a wordlist book.  Contrary to what many people say, word-books are a good way to learn lists of words, so long as they provide exercises---this is what I recommend instead of (or at LEAST in addition to) this book.</span>

                    <span>Learning words in context is a great idea. It's the only method that works. This book was released in 1994 and for several years was the only one of its kind. But there are three new additions in this format--from Barrons, Kaplan, and A. J. Cornell Publications. Some people have complained that with this book it's problematic to have all the words at the back, in a glossary--because you have to keep stopping to find them back there. I agree with that. At least one of the above-mentioned books--The Wizard of Oz Vocabulary Builder--places the definitions on the same page as the words, and it seems to work well. Perhaps the next edition of this book can be reformatted that way.</span>

                    <span>Tooth and Nail. Charles Herrington Elster and Joseph Elliot.  New York:  Harcott, 1994. 283.<p>     The book, Tooth and Nail, was written by Charles Elster and Joseph Elliot to prepare the reader for the verbal part of the SAT by expanding the reader's vocabulary.  This book was about three college students trying to solve a mysery that had a big reward at the end which was coveted by an unknown adversary.  After reading the book, I found it to be great for learning new words and improving reading comprehension.  <br>     In the form of a mystery novel, Tooth and Nail is actually a guide to many challenging SAT vocabulary words.  Each bold word in the novel is defined in the back of the book in the glossary, some of which have synonyms.  By reading a word in context and then looking up its definition in the back, the reader will learn new words faster and more efficiently than he would studying a list of endless words.  More than twelve hundred upper-level words show up in the book that have popped up on numerous SATs, and will strengthen vocabulary based on the level of enthusiasm put forth to study them.<br>     On recieving a letter from the deceased, Propero, Phil, Caitlin and Leo go on a treasure hunt to search for a priceless, truth-revealing item.  Although they are excited and eager to get started, nothing could have prepared them for what they are about to encounter.  While searching for each clue, Phil and Caitlin were followed by a creepy fellow who tried assaulting them.  This angered the group because they knew someone was hot on their trail that knew what they were searching for and the value of it.  With this new information, they realized finding the treasure wouldn't be a piece of cake.<br>     By reading the book, I believe I have increased my vocabulary tremendously and think it has prepared me for the verbal part of the SAT very well.  By taking this into consideration, I think the book has fully achieved its goal.  Compared to other books that have preparation for the SAT, I believe Tooth and Nail is right up there with the rest of them.  For increasing vocabulary and reading comprehension, it is one of the best books out there.  I like that there are bold words that are defined in the back and how the author switches the characters' thoughts back and forth simultaneously.  The author describes the setting so vividly with every minute detail, that it feels like I have actually been to the campus before.  The character's body and facial expressiones and stature are so clear that I can picture them in my mind exactly how they look.<br>     All in all, Tooth and Nail is a solid, tenacious book that provides the reader with a promising vocabulary, improved reading comprehension and an interesting mystery that is fun to read, all combined into one.  After reading this book, I believe I am now prepared for the verbal part of the SAT in both aspects of vocabulary and reading comprehension.</span>
