                <span id="Label1"><P> On February 3, 1983, the men aboard <i>Americus</i> and <i>Altair,</i> two state-of-the-art crabbing vessels, docked in their home port of Anacortes, Washington, prepared to begin a grueling three-month season fishing in the notorious Bering Sea. Eleven days later, on Valentine's Day, the overturned hull of the <I>Americus</I> was found drifting in calm seas, with no record of even a single distress call or trace of its seven-man crew. The <I>Altair</I> vanished altogether. Despite the desperate search that followed, no evidence of the vessel or its crew would ever be found. Fourteen men were lost. And the tragedy would mark the worst disaster in the history of U.S. commercial fishing. <P> With painstaking research and spellbinding prose, acclaimed journalist Patrick Dillon brings to life the men who were lost, the dangers that commercial fishermen face, the haunting memories of the families left behind...and reconstructs the intense investigation that ensued, which for the first time exposed the dangers of an industry that would never again be the same.</span>

                    <span>This book is inevitably bound to be missed in all the hoopla attending the release of the film version of Sebastian Junger's "The Perfect Storm." That's a true shame, because Dillon's account of the dangers of commercial fishing in the Bering Sea is not only poignant, but an incisive look into how the loss of human life can bring about public policy changes that will save other lives in the future.<P>If you read the Junger book, you'll like this one, too. Dillon doesn't quite have the flair for characterization or drama that Junger wields, but he does manager to convey the horrors of a sudden capsizing in the frigid sea, a common event which few fishermen survive. The story focuses on the trawlers Americus and Altair, which disappeared in February, 1983, less than 25 miles off the coast of Unalaska Island in a heavily-traveled sea lane. The ships disappeared in relatively calm water. The capsized hull of Americus was spotted a few days later, but sank in 4,200 feet of water before divers could enter the hull and search for survivors or bodies. Altair was never found, save for some small bits of debris. Fourteen men, most of them under the age of 25, died in the sinkings.<P>Dillon covers the disaster's awful impact on the dead men's survivors, then moves on to a careful account of the Coast Guard investigation into the disaster. He fairly gives us hints in the narrative leading up to the sinkings that should tip even the most non-mechanically inclined reader to what probably caused the ships' losses. When it becomes clear later on what that cause was, Dillon's little trick allows us to feel the same sense of dawning horror that the ships' owner, a conscientious and decent man, and architect must have felt when they realized what had happened and that it had been preventable.<P>Finally, Dillon covers the political fall-out of the sinkings, which helped spur Congress to pass the first federal legislation mandating safety precautions on commercial fishing vessels. He tells it straight up -- how the victims' families and the families of other lost fishermen organized to get the law passed, how special interest politics slowed -- and nearly stopped -- its passage and how the persistence of these ordinary citizens and a few legislators finally carried the day.<P>This is a great book for those who love sea disaster stories. Dillon obviously has a great sympathy for the men who fish the Bering Sea and a keen perception of the brutal environment in which they must work and how dangerous their jobs are. He also does a fine job of documenting how the families left behind in Anacortes, Washington, (the home port of the two lost trawlers) lived with the inevitability that tragedy would find its way to their own doorsteps and dealt with the overwhelming sorrow and loss once it did.<P>But this book's real value lies in the account it gives of the political machinations required to pass even the simplest safety legislation. Public policy instructors would be well-advised to read this book and consider it for use in their own courses. It's "sausage making" at its most gut-wrenching worst.</span>

                    <span>Once I got past the scene-setting of the individual seamen who were inevitably the ones who drowned (sorry for that burst of cynicism, but the more touching the personal tale, the more likely they were to be among the lost), the book gets down to the business of telling us about the whole cycle of commercial fishing in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The miracle of this story is that Dillon captures both the personal and the intimate details of the individuals, but he also nails the macro-issues of the industry, its evolution and practices. As an added bonus, he gives us the inner chambers of our government and a cold-eyed view of how laws are actually enacted, a civics lesson that we should read and re-read. Great book, all around. A brilliant feat by Dillon, who makes it all flow so naturally that you don't even know you're reading virtuoso journalism of the highest order.</span>

                    <span>This book was okay. Since it was a true story it kind of was boring. I understand though, because people's life's arent a 24 hour action story. It was well written though, for a true story.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book expecting it to be about a great tragedy at sea, maybe encorporating a great survival story or a heroic struggle with the ocean. However, this is a book more about courts and hearings to assess liability for the accident and set new safety standards for the fishing industry not too much about the tragedy itself. If you like to read about politics and policy, this is the book for you, but if you like to read about stories at sea, you'd be better off choosing a different book.</span>

                    <span>Yes, LOST AT SEA is a sad tale. How can any book about the loss of life at sea not strike a somber chord? But author Dillon does a fantastic job of examining the probable causes contributing to the sinking of the crab boats "Americus" and "Altair" in Alaska's Bering Sea in 1983. The author's writing is crisp and engaging, and although tragic (14 men died on the two boats) the story itself is incredible! LOST AT SEA more than holds its own against "that other book" and is a must-read for all who enjoy true tales of the sea.</span>
