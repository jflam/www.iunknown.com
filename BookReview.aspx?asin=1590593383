                    <span>"Microsoft Sharepoint: Building Office 2003 Solutions" by Scott Hiller is a introductory book on Sharepoint technology for developers 
<br />
<br />Starting 4 chapters are on Introducing Sharepoint Portal server, Installation and on content creation (nothing for developer there). Next 3 chapters provide good understanding of web part development. There is chapter on Integration with office 2003 Smart document stuff. Next Chapter discusses the programming to Sharepoint object model. Next chapter provides some information on the Sharepoint Portal server administration and at the end it discusses the 2 office solution Accelerators (for Proposals and for Recruiting).
<br />
<br />This book contains good amount of sample code for the web parts development, and 2 Solution Accelerators chapters. Other chapters are of introductory knowledge on Sharepoint usage and administration. Depending on your need only few chapters might be useful. If you have knowledge of .NET development and want to understand web part development, web part chapters of this book along with the Microsoft Sharepoint SDK might be good place to start.

                    <span>Microsoft SharePoint performs two things for Microsoft. Firstly, as explained by Hillier at length, it offers more value to Microsoft Office users. By enabling relatively easy ad hoc collaborations, that can access data stored in various Office documents and SQL Server's database. Where that access crucially includes the ability to search the data. And then, of course, to modify any such desired data, if you have the necessary permissions.
<br />
<br />As Hillier discusses, SharePoint is another unifying glue over MS Office and SQL Server. The book is mostly aimed at programmers. Showing them how to make the WebParts using C# or VB under .NET. You can then use SharePoint to combine these parts into a simple application.
<br />
<br />But SharePoint does something else for Microsoft, which the book doesn't seem to discuss. In Chapter 1, Hillier says it is the rare company that "can afford to jettison Microsoft Office and Windows operating system for a new infrastructure." Actually, it is not that rare. Linux and open source applications can increasingly offer much functionality that is equivalent and cheaper. In this context, SharePoint can be seen as an effort by Microsoft to incorporate higher valued abilities in Office, as a further lock-in.
<br />
<br />Also, the searching described in the book should remind some of you of increasing competition in the search space. Google offers a search appliance for a corporate network. SharePoint gives that appliance competition.</span>

                    <span>Here ares ome of the bugs i had encountered with this book
<br />
<br />Missing hardware configuration on chapter 2 to start the 1.excersises in the book
<br />2.Some steps on installing and running web parts past security poorly stated.
<br />3.At time there was no data on the web page to demonstrate web part capabilities and other SPS features
<br />4. Documents do not move on chapter 8 
<br />5. Cannot get testing Secure Access to work on chapter 10
<br />6. Could not get the accelerartors to work on chapter 11
<br />
<br />
<br />This book is a very good introduction to SPS and the reader does learn alot on the subject. However some of the interesting features do not work from the book due to poor description or bad writeup. however the author was very thorough in his coverage.

                    <span>I was working through the MOC courseware, which is incoherent and riddled with mistakes, and I turned to this book using one of my time-tested methods for determining the merits of a tech book: I looked to see if it addressed the problem I was stuck on, and how skillfully it described the solution. I also look to see how well it attacks the most confusing subject I'm trying to come to grips with. 
<br /> 
<br /> This book succeeded fabulously on both counts. My particular problem had to do with pinpointing an error in which my new Web Part was rendered as an obnoxious and non-specific security error in a Web Part Page. The answer: make sure that your .dwp file has a properly coded 'Assembly' section in it. Scot's explanation illuminated the whole strong-naming and deployment cycle beautifully. 
<br /> 
<br /> As for the confusing subject, the first few chapters build an SPS portal from the ground up, explaining everything along the way. No one paragraph holds the key, but when you're done building this simple portal, you look up and the lights have been turned on. You start being able to successfully distinguish among portal, site collection, top-level site, area, topic (these are all variants of sites, btw), etc. and will know when when one is a better fit than another. The concepts that most experts fail to explain are no longer mystifying. That's a tremendous accomplishment. 
<br /> 
<br /> This book could single-handedly dispel the myth that SharePoint Products and Services require mystic knowledge to operate. 
<br /> 
<br /> Beware that the book's primary focus is development and programming, which it also explains beautifully, but even if you're an administrator, the first few chapters alone will be worth the price of admission. </span>
