                    <span>Since we see so many extremes in regard to this wonderful short novel, I thought it only fair to add my 2 or 3 cents worth. Like the others here I read UBAI in college, and it served as a opening door to another country of literature. Coover, along with DeLillo and Pynchon, is one of of our late 20th century masters taking, fiction into new realms, and exposing us to alternate ways of viewing our environment and personal relationships. Waugh creates an ordered universe that spins out of his control, moving in directions he never intended. From this, his whole (real) world falls apart; his fantasy world destroys what little relationship he has reality . J. Henry Waugh (read Jahweh) is a flawed God with a (now) flawed creation. This is a wonderful book, but not near as good as his masterpiece, The Origin of the Bruinists, which predicted modern day apocalyptic religious cults and the manipulation of media. Unfortunately this book is now out of print.</span>

                    <span>Impossible though it may seem, I think I can agree with (or at least understand) almost all that is written in these reviews. The fact is, Coover's hallucinogenic style is not for everyone. It's not for nothing that he is omitted from the DeLillo/Pynchon/Stone pantheon; he's a cult guy. I've read The Origin of the Brunists (Coover's first, I think, and an NBA winner as I recall) and The Public Burning, and enjoyed both immensely. He takes postmodernism to its utter horrifying extreme. But all who read him will eventually have to confront the power of his writing.<P>The idea of this book goes well beyond baseball, but baseball followers will find it especially compelling because of the familiarity of the setting. At the core of it is a lonely, singular man who invents his own reality and plays his hand as a deity. He loses himself more and more in his artificial world as things progress, wheeling and dealing his players, arranging their movements, watching their achievements and failures. The outside world loses its attraction. At the conclusion he has to confront, and then participate in, a life/death situation regarding one of his players. With that he slips into insanity. It is truly a scary read.<P>If you are familiar with and enjoy Coover's psychotic forays, then you must read this one. If you are more the Barbara Kingsolver type, well, stay clear.</span>

                    <span>The basic story of Coover's book is quite simple. Henry Waugh creates an intricate single-player baseball game that's played with dice. He plays entire seasons with his eight-team league; he keeps detailed statistics for every player and every game; he creates backstories and personalities for his players; he develops an administrative body for his league and imagines political debates among the players; and he acts as an official historian of the league, writing volumes of stories about the game and its players. When something shocking and unexpected occurs within the game, Henry gradually loses the ability to distinguish between reality and imagined events within the game. In the end, he is more or less consumed by his game. <P>As the synopsis above no doubt suggests, this story begs to be read as an allegory. One might read it as an allegory of God's relation to His creation. Henry, like God, is a creator who appears to have complete control over his creation, and yet, like God, his creation comes to take on a life of its own. When terrible things occur, he desperately wants to step in and set things right, but he also wants the game to retain its integrity. So Henry is like God in that he remains outside his creation even though it seems he could sometimes intervene to set things right. (Indeed, some of the game's players are said to have some sense of a higher power controlling their destiny.) One might also read Henry's relation to his game as an allegory of man's attempt to make sense of his world through art, religion, science, philosophy, etc. All that's really going on is the random event of rolling the dice, as, in some sense, all that's really going on in the universe is certain random physical events. And yet Henry imagines an entire alternate reality to make sense of the random events of his game. His player backgrounds and psychologies, his historical interpretations of the game, his imaginings of crowds and stadiums--all of this is intended to give the random throws of the dice some meaning, some significance to him. (This reading is also suggested by our one look at Henry at work in his job as an accountant. Rather than merely crunch the numbers, he reads a story of the operation of a business off his accounting books. He makes sense of the numbers by seeing them as evidence of something beyond themselves.) Finally, one might interpret Henry's relation to his game as an allegory of the artist's relation to his works.<P>These allegorical readings notwithstanding, it's also possible to read this book as a simple and moving story of one isolated man who gradually loses touch with reality. While Henry seems a decent enough chap, he has no family, only one friend (and not an especially close one), no real love interest, and no interests outside of his game. From what we learn in the novel, it seems his entire life consists in (occasionally) going to work at his mind-numbing job, stopping at the local bar to drown his sorrows, and sitting at his kitchen table playing his game. Since Henry's life is thoroughly dull and uneventful from the outside, the book focuses on what's going on in his mind. The focus of the book is his isolation and his attempts to create something important and lasting and to be a part of something larger than himself. The opportunity to create something important is what the game appears to provide him, and so it's not all that surprising that he ends up losing himself in his game. <P>This, of course, suggests that Henry can be understood as an example of the way in which alienated individuals can get lost in solitary pursuits that are made available to them by modern life. Because he lacks an community of people with which to identify, Henry ends up getting lost in his game in much the same way that others can get lost in books, television, the internet, etc. All of these things appear to provide their user with a connection to a world beyond himself, and yet total immersion in them brings you no closer to other people than you'd be without them. <P>I'd give this book 4.5 stars if I could; that seems a more accurate assessment. The reader should note that this isn't really a baseball book. It's more about the trappings of baseball--the statistics, the history, the players, the rites--than it is about the game itself. So this isn't a book for someone looking for a presentation of dramatic athletic feats; instead, it's a book for the baseball fan whose appreciation of the game is intellectual rather than visceral.</span>

                    <span>This is a savagely funny, brutally creative (and, at times, very dark) novel about baseball and the human condition that ultimately takes a theological twist. It is not for everyone, but would definitely be a treat to someone who has a fondness for black comedy and untrustworthy narrators - and some passion for baseball.</span>

                    <span>It's late, I've worked hard all day, and in the end, I find myself seeking new novels for reading later this week. I recommend THE SEVENTH BABE, or DAMN YANKEES. <P>Oh, and Coover's UNIVERSAL BASEBALL ASSOCIATION, INC; J. HENRY WAUGH, PROP. If you've read it, you KNOW how trippy it is to flow through; one can almost feel himself being sucked into the void with Waugh as he struggles to remain in reality (but which one really?)<P>Five stars says it all :)</span>
