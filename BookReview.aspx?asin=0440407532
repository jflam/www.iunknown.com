                    <span>Have you ever been struck by lightning or heard of someone being struck? A guy named Derek Holtzer was. Two years ago a guy named Brian Robeson was stranded out in the wilderness for fifty-four days. Now the government wants him to do it again but this time Brian has a guy from the government named Derek. While Brian and Derek are out there lightning strikes and Derek gets struck. Brian has to get him 100 miles down a river for help.<BR> Another book the author has written is the hatchet. The river is a sequel to the hatchet. The hatchet is about Brian getting stranded out in the wilderness for fifty-four days. Both books were realistic fiction. The main idea the writer tries to get across is if you're in a bad situation don't make a bad choice.<BR> I think anyone can read this book. It is not to hard and not to easy. One of the bad parts was when they were talking at the table. They did not use enough detail. One of the strong points was when Derek was struck by lightning. I knew exactly what was going on. Gary Paulsen has written three Newberry awards. The River has one Iral children's book council and parents magazine best book of the year. Watch out for lightning.</span>

This time he isn't going alone, a phsycologist named Derek Holtzer is coming to record Brian's every action.Then a thunderstorm comes in... and Derek is struck by lightning and goes into an instant coma. Now Brian must travel down a river on a small raft to a trading post for help. Tofind out more read The River</span>

                    <span>The River is a book about an adult that had just gotten back from the fifty-four day stay from the plane crash. He uses the hatchet in the book The Hatchet for protection and food. In this book, he puts the hatchet in a glass case and leaves it there when he goes back to do the trip all over again. After about a month of planning with Derek, Derek came over one day to ask if Brian wanted to do it again, but only for survival for others. When they arrive at the Necktie Lake, Brian said to leave the supplies in the plane. So they build shelter and get food after being eaten by mosquitoes and a really bad storm. Then one night, another storm comes back, only worse. Derek, being not so smart at the time, stands up and gets struck by lightning blowing up the emergency radio they had for emergencies only. So, Brian has to build a raft and get Derek on and go one hundred miles to get Derek out of unconsciousness. Now that I have given you bit and pieces of this book, you should have fun reading it. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>I thought that The River was a very good book. It is adventurouse, exciting, and you never know whats going to happen next. Right when you think yoy know the book, it turns into a whole different direction and something amazing happens! My favorite part was when Brian decides that they weren't going to have supplies. Only because it shows bravery and because you know something exciting will happen and the will need the supplies. plus, later in the book, an exciting twist comes and you would never expect it! Well, I wouldn't want to spoil it so the only way you would kow what happnes next, would be to read the book. I recomind this book to anyone who is in for an adventure.</span>
