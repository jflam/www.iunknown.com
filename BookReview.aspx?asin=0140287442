                    <span>This book is the type of rare work that draws its readers into a whole other world by making them see and feel everything that the storyteller does. We become almost a part of the life of this extraordinary woman and her passion not only for Kenya and Africa but simply for life and living. Each one of us dreams of some place or ideal as we grow, but few of us are fortunate or determined enough to turn those dreams into realities and go on to live them. Kuki Gallman along with her husband and children shows us what it is like to achieve and live our dreams and at what cost our dreams sometimes come. "I Dreamed of Africa" is a lyrical, magical account of one woman, her family, and the people and customs of the last continent in our world that truly has a soul. The message of this book and Kuki's continuing mission to preserve that world will stay with all who read it and they will be better for it.</span>

                    <span>An autobiographical novel about Kuki Gallman's experiences in Africa... <BR> The book is filled with wonderful descriptions of the African landscape and the struggles of daily life in this enigmatic <BR>country. Kuki engages the reader with tales elephants in her garden to the very real threat of lions that can kill in one moment of carelessness. It is clear through her writing that she truly loves and feels a spiritual conncetion to this land.<BR>Her upbeat attitude, "There has never been a day of boredom" and sincere desire to protect the environment has bolstered her through two tragedies that would break a lesser person.<BR>You may not agree with some of Kuki's life choices but you will be inspired, awed and envious of the adventures and environmental achievements she has made in her lifetime.</span>

                    <span>This book is a testimony to the human spirit and how one can overcome extreme adversity and channel that into productive life altering experiences. <P>I laughed and cried and didn't want this book to end. It was so motivating and not at all pretentious. It made me feel as though I could accomplish anything by merely wanting it enough. Mrs Gallman articulated the surroundings so well that it made you feel as though you were sitting next to her. I mourned each time something horrid occurred and laughed at the little things in her every day experiences.</span>

                    <span>I am utterly stunned that this book got so many positive reviews from readers. I got about two-thirds of the way through it before I finally let myself quit reading it.<P>Gallman has lead an interesting life; there's no question of that. The only trouble is, she's not a good writer. She tends to tell the reader things--like that her son was a special person--rather than showing us. And she tries way too hard to add mystical foreshadowing. Example: her son was killed from a poisonous snakebite. Years before, when he got his first pet python, she said that she felt uneasy. This is supposed to show us, the readers, how in tune with the world she is, how she's probably psychic. Excuse me, but I think any mother would be a little uneasy about their child having a lethal pet.<P>Do not waste your time with this boring, painful book.</span>

                    <span>I have little to add to the other positive reviews of this book; but half the reviewers seem to be criticising the author, rather than the book. While I do not deny it has faults (the fact that English is not the author's first language sometimes weakens the expression of her clearly genuine feelings)I am astonished at the resentment expressed in many reviews. Specifically, over the fact that the author happens to be a white and presumably wealthy European - as though this fact automatically makes her a hypocrite and her views and experiences less worthy... and furthermore, that this a fault of the book itself! Judge the book on its own worth, instead of making moralistic judgments about the author.<P>Ms Gallman doesn't claim this is the ultimate African story - it is the personal story of her life, her deep love of Africa and of her friends and family, and in my opinion of her remarkably brave journey. Many reviewers seem to criticise this book for failing to be what it was never intended to be in the first place.<P>Oh, and all the spiteful comments about the "rich white Europeans" owning airplanes!!!<P>For God's sake, we are not talking about private luxury jets here! Clearly reviewers have completely disregarded that this is AFRICA, where people have immense properties, where it takes hours and hours to drive on dusty and dangerous roads to your nearest neighbours. How some people have gained the impression they were simply flitting about in style for their own pleasure is quite beyond me. About the only way of practical transport to most places was by plane, and it would seem these were small and often rundown planes, where people took their life in their hands each time they flew them. So please, get over the fact that most people had planes!!</span>
