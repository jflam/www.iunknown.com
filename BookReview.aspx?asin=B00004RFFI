                    <span>Twister,directed by Jan DeBont,is a very fun film.(to watch,anyway,as I don't think I'd want to be a storm chaser)The performances weren't bad,especially Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as Jo and Bill Harding,a couple of storm chasers who are about to be divorced,and Bill is supposed to get remarried to Melissa,(Jami Gertz)but of course Jo and Bill wind up back together in the end.That's all very interesting,but what really makes the film is the action and special effects,which are incredible.The storms and tornadoes look very real,and some of the action scenes are really cool-such as when Jo and Bill drive right through the house during the big tornado towards the end,and the scene when the cow flies across the road and back again.The musical score by Mark Mancina is very good,and as I said before the special effects are incredible.Overall,this is a very entertaining movie,(not as good as DeBont's first film Speed,but much better than his last two-Speed 2 and The Haunting)although the characters do take a back seat to the weather.</span>

                    <span>Like "The Perfect Storm," another Hollywood blockbuster about extremely bad weather, "Twister" gives us a script that it wouldn't have taken an F5 tornado to demolish. Add a nonstop series of lapses in credibility (e.g., some poor trucker in an 18-wheeler gets sucked into the monster funnel cloud, but Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton sidle right up alongside killer tornadoes repeatedly, and get nothing worse than a bruise) and some of the clunkiest dialog ever to boom out of multichannel sound systems, and the result is a movie that makes you grateful for the fast-forward and skip-chapter buttons on a DVD player. To be fair, the storm scenes are pretty entertaining, if not nearly as scary or realistic-looking as they could've been. (It's not that the CGI effects aren't convincing; it's that the neatly composed and precisely staged tornado sequences don't compare to the shaky, grainy, sometimes chaotic real-life TV news footage that the Weather Channel recycles for "Storm Stories" and such.) And the DVD is a terrific workout for a home-theatre setup, especially the subwoofer. Unfortunately, the storm scenes take up maybe a half-hour of a two-hour movie, so the remaining 90 minutes is a workout of your patience for bad dialog and bad line readings (Philip Seymour Hoffman excepted). If extreme weather is your thing, you might do better to buy (or rent) a documentary DVD about it.</span>

                    <span>In the movie, the twister destroys a drive-in while The Shining is showing on the screen. One could only imagine that this amounted to a review of The Shining. I don't agree with this review. The Shining is a very good movie.</span>

                    <span>I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a remake of The Wizard of Oz. Boy what a letdown. Come to think of it I had the same experience watching Zardoz.<BR>While watching this movie, it became clear to me that "actors" are people who have been randomly selected to get in front of a camera and pretend to do things. The characters say things like, "these satellite readings have increased in the last ten minutes" "Keep monitoring this pattern" "Ok" Then there is a tossing aside of sodas and a melee of excited, riot-like running toward vehicles. Then there is more dialog, like "We're not going to be able to intercept!" "No, we will. Hang on!" "Are you out of your mind?"<BR>"We gotta get outta here!" "I know!" This last dialog is screamed over the sound of lots of wind. The movie appears to be about a weather phenomenon wherein lots of wind causes a general sucking effect: the script sucks, the acting sucks, the effects even pretty much suck.</span>

                    <span>I have had interest in the concept of severe weather for my entire life and had high expectations for the movie "Twister" and the result cuts boths ways for me. <P> The movie is of a married meteoroligist couple who are in the midst of getting a divorce, and have not gotten along for a very long time and they make a new invention that they believe will help them see what it looks like, inside a full blown tornado. They have ambition to deploy this new technology to disperse 'lighter than air' radio transmitters into a twister and record the signals to see what it may look like inside a tornado. <P> The special effects when the tornadoes strike are absolutely awesome not to mention the chase scenes especially towards the ending when the couple speed away from a tornado drive right through a house that was thrown onto the countryside road by a tornado (Impossible in real life) and the other of when a drive-in movie screen showing a snippet of the movie "The Shining" being ripped apart by a F5 tornado in the middle of the night. <P> "Twister" though suffers from several things and I can sometimes see where some of the detractors are coming from when regarding this movie. While the action scenes and special effects are amazing, the movie's plot lacks a good flow and the film drags on and on in several places and one scene which is just like a boring day at home would've been better left out altogether. Plus the characters are very unconvincing and lack personality. <P> Even for me who doesn't mind ocassional deviation from the laws of physics in movies, some of the tornadoe scenes are completely unrealistic. For example as I said earlier in a review, there is no way a twister could fling a whole house across a countryside road or even roll the whole intact house across the countryside because most houses are built on foundations and strong tornadoes in real life would shed houses into tiny pieces or otherwise reduce them to ruin. An F5 tornado would leave nothing of a house behind and can even rip the pavement off a road if the conditions warrant. \<P> This movie is nonetheless worth watching just for the tornadoes alone but this movie could have been a lot better than it turned out to be. While having it's share of flaws Roland Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow" is far superior on many levels and corrects a lot of the flaws of "Twister" in my opinion.</span>
