                <span id="Label1">Based on the bestseller by Stephen E. Ambrose, the epic 10-part miniseries Band of Brothers tells the story of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army. Drawn from interviews with survivors of Easy Company, as well as soldiers' journals and letters, Band of Brothers chronicles the experiences of these men who knew extraordinary bravery and extraordinary fear. They were an elete rifle company parachuting into France early on D-Day morning, fighting in the Battle of the Bulge and capturing Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. They were also a unit that suffered 150 percent casualties, and whose lives became legend. </span>

                    <span>This show is awesome and very realistic. I like it more than Saving Private Ryan. The only thing that I don't like about it is the DVD packaging. While the tin case is nice, the folding disc holders inside are rather messy to deal with.</span>

                    <span>Band of Brothers will remain one of the greatest World War II films ever made for years to come. As someone who has served eight years in an airborne unit and a veteran of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Joint Guardian (Kosovo), I can truly say this film captures combat on many levels. The level of detail in each episode raises the bar for future combat films to try and reach. From Normandy on D-Day to Hitler's Eagles Nest, this film follows Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment throughout it's WWII experience. The characters are true to life and offer an inside look at what American Paratroopers dealt with during the war. Special effects and outstanding choreography contribute to making this film an awesome visual experience. After a dozen or more times watching this film, I can't get enough.</span>

                    <span>Seriously, BUY this dvd series!  It is one of the finest you will ever view.  The filming style and colors are excellent.  You will find yourself wanting to go up and thank a ww ii veteran.  I grew up with ww ii having been the last big war--I still have a black and white photo of the five stars in my great grandmother's window for the 5 boys gone off to war, and have my grandfather's, flag, medals, discharge papers, etc.  Watching these gave a whole new appreciation for what those men went through--they truly were all heroes.

                    <span>For me this was a story about leadership. The story was excellent, the acting was excellent. I have only one complaint, they used the "F" word about a hundred times and that ruined the movie for me. Even Dick Winters himself complained about that in his book. Other than that the movie was excellent.</span>
