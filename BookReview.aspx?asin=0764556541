                    <span>Why grab up this newly updated and expanded fourth edition if you already have the last version? Because ebay is an ever-changing, dynamic, evolving, expanding website incorporating many new changes in recent years, and it's essential for any successful online auctioneer to have the latest update to techniques. From bidding successfully and winning to selling successfully, collecting money and shipping, Ebay For Dummies assumes no prior ebay experience and provides all the details necessary to succeed.

                    <span>Anyone with the least bit of PC knowledge and customer service skills can sell on any on-line venue. Most have it set up to walk you through step by step. Besides, eBay raised their fees so high as of 2/18/05 that many sellers are flocking to other venues like www.overstock.com/auctions!</span>

                    <span>I have been selling and buying on eBay for a little while now and wanted to expand myself. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I covers practically everything. From starting up, to buying, to selling, to shipping, to feedback and more. It is eBay made simple! Very informative. There is so much useful (and also very basic) information in here. If you are wanting to start using eBay (or are not very experienced with it), I definately recommend this book. </span>

                    <span>My friend who uses eBay a lot recommended this book to get me started. It worked wonderfully. I made a few buys and sold a lot of junk that was cluttering my house. Now my feedback is over 100 with a 100% rating.</span>

                    <span>I was very disappointed in this book. It was rambling, covered subjects of little interest (example: how to ship, post office, UPS, FedEx, etc..) but DIDN'T say anything about how to post a picture of your auction item, how to link to a personal web page,  or how to start an eBay store.<br>Less than one star in my book<br>Jeff Campbell<br>Houston, TX</span>
