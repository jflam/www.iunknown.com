                <span id="Label1">Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and expoitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.</span>

                    <span>Well, let us think about this a little bit...You want to learn Category theory, whether for some course or just for the fun of it, and now where do you turn in order to learn the necessary concepts. If you are a mathematician and have some experience, then you turn to the masters, the originators of the given subject and read their work. Sure, being the founder of a given subject does not imply that you are a good expositor and hence are capable of revealing the necessary concepts for the beginner-allow me to inform that Mac Lane is indeed as good as an expositor as he was a mathematician. For any doubters, I point you to the only other text you should read on Category theory, namely, "Category Theory" by Horst Herrlich and compare this text with Mac Lane's. Aside from that, and with respect to the text, for most beginners or interested readers I would suggest the following outline: Read 1.1-6; 2.1-3 & 8 possibly 2.4; all of 3; as for 4 skip section 3; 5.1-5; all of 8. Then, dependent upon your desires and or focus as well as your mathematical ability, it should become obvious which of the remaining topics should be read. Finally, the only other source I would recommend for learning Category theory can be found on-line using the keyword 'Awodey'. Anyways, Enjoy and good luck.</span>

                    <span>I entirely agree with the reviewer Lucas Wilman. <BR>As a book by the creator of category theory, it has extensively incorpoated relevant items. <BR>However I don't think this is a *must read" unless you major in the subject: you will seldom need more than what is covered in a typical homological algebra course.<BR>My inmpression is this book should be entitled "Categories for the starting/working category theorists".</span>

                    <span>It is difficult to make understand what "is" category theory. Is it a foundational discipline? Is it a discipline studying homomorphisms between algebras? Is it nonsense? Well, in my opinion this book does not help in gaining this kind of understanding. But all the stuff I read which have been written with that purpose in mind did not have any success - perhaps because I am not a mathematician, or perhaps because some concepts in category theory are really too abstract for anyone to give "an intuition" of them (you still can with functors and natural transformations, but try with adjointness...). This said, I found the book wonderful: Every concept is presented neatly. I use it as a reference each time I want a clear and rigorous definition of a concept. Sometimes this rigour helped me in gaining the famous intuition behind the concept.</span>

                    <span>This book is a fairly good introduction to the ideas of category theory by one of the creators of the field. Unfortunately, the book is sometimes sort of confusing, and doesn't give many as many examples as I would like. Category theory (while it has become a field in its own right), is really a way of thinking about mathematics. The way you learn a way of thinking is by working out examples & doing excersizes, but this book doesn't provide as many connections to other areas of math as it should.<P>I don't think that this book was really intended "for the working mathematician," but rather for someone with some independent interest in category theory.</span>

                    <span>This book is extraordinarily well written. It covers the necessary topics in a concise, orderly manner. HOWEVER, it presumes a substantial amount of knowledges concerning various algebraic/abstract structures in the field of mathematics. If you already have had experience with such structures, and are simply looking to understand them from a different perspective - this is the book for you. However, if you have limited knowledge with regards to advanced math (ie - grad level math) then try the book 'Arrows, Structures and Functors: The Categorical Imperative' by Manes and Arbib. This introduces the reader gradually to simple algebraic structures, monoids, groups, metric spaces, topological spaces, and the categories that can be built around them.</span>
