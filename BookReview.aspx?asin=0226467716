                    <span>I found this book highly significant and convincing in the linguistic and psychological framework of our current political structure. This book presents the frames of ideas behind liberal and conservative thinking, the psychological models that shape the two main avenues of perception and projection into all areas of life, morals; the basis behind religion and politics. The political sides, liberal and conservative are in essence only ideas that follow from these prior ideals. And what the author frames as the two models are, the two moral ideals of the Strict Father morality and the Nurturant Parent morality. Both are opposed to each other and yet, there are variants or combinations or radial categories which are gray areas which are not so clear cut. But overall, there are these two current trends that shape our thoughts.
<br />
<br />George Lakoff goes into each model, their traits, attributes, virtue and vices. I think he does a good job at maintaining neutrality. It is only later in his book where he identifies himself under the nurturant morality and thus a liberal and later in the book attempts to argue in his thesis in that direction.
<br />
<br />What these models boil down to is the family morality, and that of raising children. In politics it is the government as parents, the citizens as the children. And the views on raising children are the basis of frames behind political agendas. After detailed explanations of the two models, then applications to current political issues as in abortion, gun control, education methods, crime and capital punishment, welfare, affirmative action, foreign policies and so forth are discussed according to the two models.
<br />
<br />The conservative model represents the Strict Father Morality, which is about self-discipline, self-reliance, self-strength, your on your own, rewards and punishments which includes harsh discipline or tough love. The father takes the lead, and while treating others compassionately, he is the last word. Anotherwards life is a hierarchy, God head of Christ, God and Christ head of man, man head of woman, parents head of children, humans head of animals and the planet. And so it is a strict arrangement where the harsh laws of nature as in the natural selection, survival of the fittest is applied morally.This morality represents absolutes, therefore anything different cannot be allowed since therefore it is immoral. Rights of the individual take precedence where free market fundamentalism is concerned, while individual rights that infringe on those with economic power are considered as threats. So the upper hand lies in what is considered that "best," the self disciplined who has gained more financially for their hard work, their hard won discipline and reward. The poor receive punishments and suffer due to their own lack of self discipline.
<br />
<br />The liberal model represents the Nurturant Morality, which is about empathy, tolerance, degrees of relativity, flexibility, about open communication, about nurturance, tolerance, compassion and understanding. It allows differences and has vulnerability. It reneges some power to allow the other to grow on their own terms. Empathy is directed towards the unbalance of wealth and poverty, the economic framework, what is "fair" and equalitarian, also to the planet earth, animals, and all of life in general, under the ideas of free individual rights that do not interfere with the rights of others. Those with economic power that put their interests above others are considered as threats to the masses. The poor need a the same equal opportunities as the rich where it is not a matter of self discipline, but the lack of opportunities to advance in an unfair society.
<br />
<br />I think what is so crucial here is the liberal's ability to turn to a higher objective paradigm outside all other paradigms. Anotherwards, the liberal recognizes the validity of the conservative ideals, those of rewards and punishments, of tough love, of self-discipline, however here they are not absolutes, as they are relative within the particular culture, economic class, race, minority and so forth. So the liberal can very well be a conservative but only within the relativity within the group of fair values When it crosses the lines beyond fairness and equalitarian opportune justice, then the higher paradigm of flexibility in a non-absolute framework must be applied. And for this, I find liberal ideals of a higher evolutionary consciousness which works towards integral, holistic unity of peace and harmony, unlike the absolutes of conservatism which considers all outside its absolutes as immoral. There are conservative rules within each paradigm, but the moment circumstances of unequality and injustice apply, then there are no absolute blanket rules which apply to all paradigms. Adjustments are necessary, crucial for harmonious, peaceful existence.
<br />
<br />What I mostly enjoyed was his methods for liberals to correct the problem they are in. That is to form their own think tanks that do what the conservatives have done; obtain new language and/or particular meanings to words that fit the liberal paradigm. In this way, they will not defend conservative driven meanings to words, agreeing or maintaining defense within their frame of reference, only to maintain the answers within the conservative created definitions, but rather to use another reasoning linguistically within a new liberal frame of reference in word definitions. This is not a matter of semantics, but rather a separate perceptional projection which relates the parent nurturant morality over the strict father morality.
<br />
<br />I was visualizing a couple of years ago when Congress was passing around Clarke's book where questions were being raised on Bush and the Iraq question, that it would have been beneficial if it were this book, which I know no conservative or any one changes due to a book or persuasion, but at least it could radically wake up some liberals to understand the psychology behind their ideals. People only grow only when they're ready and willing to do so, otherwise they stay put in their model, their paradigm.</span>

                    <span>George Lakoff's recent "Don't Think of an Elephant" draws its main points from this earlier book, which explains in depth his theory that liberal and conservative political viewpoints in today's America stem from two radically opposed views of the ideal family. Lakoff is convincing when he quotes actual political writings and speeches to show how the family metaphor permeates political discourse. Until the very end of the book he confines himself to lucid explanations and applications of the two models, the "Strict Father" (conservative) and "Nurturant Parent" (liberal) paradigms. The last few chapters then turn into a hard-hitting indictment of the drawbacks of the former model, and an impassioned plea for all those who believe that the recent conservative ascendancy is steering America in the wrong direction to fight back--how? By first of all using the "Nurturant Parent" approach in raising their own children.
<br />
<br />More than any other book I've ever read about the current political scene in America, Lakoff clarifies why the conservative mentality can embrace apparently contradictory stances on such issues as abortion, capital punishment and gun control with such ease, and why liberalism has been more or less routed as a viable alternative up until now. His careful dissection of the failures of the "Strict Father" approach to family life and child-rearing exposes the falseness of the same approach to politics, and gives hope that the tide may yet be turned. This book won't convert any conservatives, or cause them to give up their ideas. But it may give people who wonder where simple decency and humanity have gone the key to begin taking back America. </span>

                    <span>These days, politics is getting to the point of being too personal. For some like Bush and GOP, it's an asset. For the rest of us progressives and independents, it can be a handicap more often than not. George Lakoff is out to prove otherwise. Learn the strengths and weaknesses and learn what you can do to peacefully strike back and strike forward at bad conservatives and libertarians who have been intertwining morality and politics to the point of pursuing the politics of personal destruction.</span>

                    <span>This thought provoking book is a Must Read for Americans of all political persuasions who want to understand the basis of America's Culture War.  The author systematically and persuasively describes the radically different family structures and moral values of Liberals and Conservatives and how they result in opposing worldviews.  Powerful stuff.
<br />
<br />This book also hits home for me personally.  I have lived in both liberal (Midwest) and conservative (Southern) cultures for many years, and I found the author's analysis to be both fascinating and extraordinarily accurate.  I sincerely wish I had read and understood it before I moved to Texas twenty years ago.  I had no idea that I was entering an alien environment, i.e. a vastly different culture based on conservative "strict father" authoritarian values.  It took many years of observation, on-the-job experience, and exposure to the beliefs and backgrounds of radically conservative friends before I began to comprehend the depth of our differences.  Even then, I did not fully understand WHY until I read this book.  Its liberal and conservative models exactly fit my personal experiences and observations, as well as the political behavior of both parties.  The author has made a powerfully persuasive case.  For the first time, I am able to see the "big picture."
<br />
<br />According to 2004 election polls, the major issue of concern to voters was morality.  For the many liberals who find this fact incomprehensible, READ THIS BOOK to discover the answer.  For conservatives who think liberals are hopelessly stupid, naive, unpatriotic, etc., READ THIS BOOK to better understand.  For those who are mystified that intelligent people can look at the same set of facts and arrive at opposite conclusions, READ THIS BOOK.  
<br />
<br />Thank You, George Lakoff, for illuminating this critically important topic.  </span>

                    <span>Wow. There's something with linguists and their ability to detect language patterns and how politicians frame the debate that is amazing. 
<br />
<br />Mr. Lakoff's book is a wonderful, entertaining and finally a mind-opening read. It's like reading Chomsky but without his endless repetition of facts and figures or historical data and his -sometimes unaccesible- obscure use of the language. I'm not a native english reader and Chomsky (another linguist) often leaves me scratching my head thinking "why did he had to use such obscure term or why is he making that point -AGAIN-?". In contrast, Lakoff's book is more broad, and at times more "clear" to the reader than Chomsky. 
<br />
<br />In some sneses he also reminds me of a much more elaborate, polished and intellectual version of "We're right, they're wrong" by Carville (an excellent complement to read with this book).
<br />
<br />Speaking of that, here's my definitive list: I recommend you this book along with other three that will open your mind like never before. These are:
<br />
<br />1. "FUZZY MATH" by Paul Krugman. Explains the Bush tax cuts, the real reason behind those cuts ("fight the future", you'll understand the meaning of that phrase when you read it)
<br />2. "We're right, they're wrong" by former Clinton advisor James Carville. (the less intellectual and the more gutsy of all three books I'll recommend here)
<br />3.  "One Market, under God" by Thomas Frank. 
<br />
<br />In short... I suggest you read this book, along with the above three.</span>
