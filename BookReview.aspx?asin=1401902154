                <span id="Label1">After years of spiritual study and reflection, inspirational speaker and bestselling author Wayne Dyer has emerged a highly esteemed teacher. His current message about tapping into the power of intention may sound like good old positive thinking: just stay focused on what you want, rather than focusing on the lack of having what you want. But the teaching here goes deeper than just controlling thoughts (although he does acknowledge that thought control is a surprisingly challenging and significant endeavor). This book might help readers land a better job, but it's more relevant for those who are ready to detach from an ego-driven life filled with quick fixes of happiness and step into a more authentic, joyful, and spiritually fulfilling life. His core teachings speak to tapping into a universal source of energy that can also be called the "power of intention." He calls people who are consciously co-creating with this energy source "connectors" and describes them as "individuals who have made themselves available for success...They don't say <I>With my luck things won't work out.</I> Instead, you&#146;re more likely to hear something like, <I>I intend to create this and I know it will work out</I>." Connectors are also committed to Dyer's "seven faces of intention"--creativity, kindness, love, beauty, expansion, abundance and receptivity, which he speaks to throughout the book. Each chapter concludes with five suggestions for becoming stronger connectors, such as how to monitor one's inner speech or shift out of low-energy beliefs. Some criticize Dyer for not giving credit to other teachers who offer this same message, especially Jerry and Esther Hicks (<I>A New Beginning I</I>) and even Ralph Waldo Emerson. It's impossible to know whether this was a deliberate omission, but it is obvious that Dyer has tapped into a growing conversation about co-creating with "source." Other leading-edge voices in this conversation include Eckhart Tolle (<I>The Power of Now</I>), Shakti Gawain (<I>Creative Visualization</I> ) and Lynn Grabhorn (<I>Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting</I>). --<I>Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>Dyer has made a career of telling people exactly what they want to hear, and this latest book is no different.  It's the oldest trick in the world--pumping sad, depressed, confused people full of other-worldly platitudes and half-baked beliefs and then taking their money for the privelege of listiening to him.  He uses an awful lot of vague terms which he never defines and then keeps rolling on without letting you stop and think.  What is "Source", anyway?  What is "spiritual" supposed to mean?  Dyer never tells us, so we insert our own preconceptions into his words, and, voila! a theory of Intentionality is born.  The answer to your drinking, over-eating, chronic depression, or lust for a Mercedes-Benz isn't your drinking, over-eating or chronic depression, or out-of-control materialism, it's your intention.  AHA!  Your intention has been screwing you up all these years.  Afterall, isn't it a lot easier to try and change your intentions and "co-create" with "Source" (I'm getting verklempt!) instead of dealing with your fear about not drinking (or over-eating or whatever.)  Yes, Dr. Wayne has a salve for whatever ails ya, and it's cheap at $25 a copy!  Step right up!   Folks: Emotions are tough, people are complex, and Dr. Dyer is full of s**t.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I first learned about Wayne Dyer from my mother, who has always sworn by his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, claiming that it had changed her life.  I was, of course, a bit suspicious of him for that reason.  After all, anything that your parent happens to be so enthusiastic about can't be really all that good, right?  So I stayed far away from any of Wayne Dyer's books for many years.  Of course, it also meant that I was always, however reluctantly, curious about what he had to say.  Fast forward to the fall of 2004, when I, now being older and more open-minded, finally got my chance to judge Dr. Dyer for myself.  It came in the form of his PBS special, based on material from this book, The Power of Intention.  I stayed up until midnight watching the first 2 hours, and went to bed suddenly energized.  I woke up at 6 am the next morning to catch the second half of the program - and knew at that time that I will never look at life the same way again.  I borrowed from my mother a set of Dyer's 6 CDs, The Secrets of the Power of Intention, and listened to them all within a week.  After that, I knew that I had to have this book - not just to read, but to own as part of my library.  Having read it all now, as part of the full "Power of Intention" program, I can honestly say that it is one of the most influential books that I have ever read.
<br />
<br />The Power of Intention: Learning to Co-create Your World Your Way by Dr. Wayne Dyer is in essence a handbook for how to approach life and adjust your outlook in such a way that you can achieve personal success and well-being.  It consists of three parts: the first part provides the tools for understanding "intention"; the second connects these tools to the different areas of your life that you may want to improve (such as self esteem, stress-relief, relationships, financial success, health, or life's purpose); the final part consists of just one chapter, illustrating what a person who is fully connected to intention is like.  This organization works very well by first providing an understanding of core principles of intention, and then building on them to outline specific steps and strategies for putting them to work.  The book's style is very fluid and personal - it allows the reader to quickly connect to the author's point of view and internalize his lessons.
<br />
<br />This book is a treasure trove of powerful life lessons for everyone, and I strongly believe that each individual will take away something unique to them and their situation in life.  What attracts me personally to Wayne Dyer's message is its underlying optimism about life and the universe.  At its core, it is about empowerment - it demonstrates that within each of us there is a source of happiness, healing, and abundance that we can activate if we so choose.  This power that each of us has to change our lives and the lives of others is captured in this sentence: "When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change".  
<br />
<br />I would be hard-pressed to come up with a criticism of this book, other than the fact that most of the ideas in it are not original.  Wayne Dyer freely references many sources, from biblical to scientific, and weaves his observations together into one coherent whole.  This book is, in a way, an artful synthesis of many ideas that he has studied throughout his life.  While this criticism may be valid, it is also what made this book especially impactful for me: I appreciated how he was able to pull together different philosophies into a single model for living a happy and fulfilled life.  These are not revolutionary ideas - but after all, few universal truths are.  Many of us already know them from life's experience.  However, it takes a great communicator like Wayne Dyer to deliver them in such a way that we stop, take notice, and our lives are forever changed.
<br />
<br />Having the benefit of hindsight, a few months after I immersed myself in this program, I can attest to the fact that The Power of Intention can, indeed, change your life.  Wayne Dyer's principles are helping me make an internal transformation by giving me the right outlook, sense of direction, and inner strength to deal successfully with challenging situations both in my professional and personal life.  And, as life has a way of coming full circle, I was thrilled to attend a live Wayne Dyer lecture last January with my mother.</span>

                    <span>We are what we intend!  The traditional view of intention is one of "stand-alone, self-determinism" without regard to our place in the universe.  Dr. Dyer stands this premise on its ear - presenting intention as a force which permits creation to unfold.  We are all part of this force, deriving our strength, struggling with our weaknesses, and impacting upon, as well as being impacted by, others.
<br />
<br />For those who would view this as new age gobbledegook, one can clearly see sound Christian principles and influences throughout the text (try substituting "God" and "Christ" for intention and this will become clear).  The principles at work are wholly connected to traditional spirituality, yet are expressed in a fresh new way, addressing the needs of people regardless of their spiritual orientation.
<br />
<br />There is a lot of information packed into Dyer's 250-plus pages, but one can gain a great deal of perspective from careful, reflective and meditative reading.  Two particular chapters of note are Chapter 7 (Respecting Myself at All Times) and Chapter 8 (Living my Life on Purpose) - themes which carry throughout the remainder of the book.  The reader would do well to read the book in small increments in order to derive maximum benefit.</span>

                    <span>It has some good sound bites to keep in mind. But, the reviewers below have a point when they say that Dr. Dyer has borrowed much from other sources. I would wait until this book comes out in paperback before buying - if at all. Another note for those who have read this book - I have an intent for 100 million dollars and a Learjet 45 for the last 10 years. It hasn't come yet! Then again, if I had a book with MY FACE ON IT, then maybe I COULD GET SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM AN AIRLINE! It has NOTHING to do with THE POWER OF INTENT, it's celebrity worship! Thank you very little Dr. Dyer!!!!</span>

                    <span>Wayne Dyer did a wonderful job in presenting the means by which to manifest whatever it is you wish to in your life via the power in your intention. 
<br />This is a wonderful book on its own. 
<br />I cannot understand why people will write harsh reviews about a positive book, citing that Dr. Dyer took those ideas from anyone. These are universal truths, and no one had exclusive ownership of the concepts or explanation of intention and manifestation. 
<br />There's a lot of wonderful concepts in this book. My suggestion would be to read it, apply whatever you can to make your life better, and if you want to buy other books as well, go for it!
