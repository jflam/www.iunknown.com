                <span id="Label1">"While there are critics who believe my courses are too difficult," writes Pete Dye, "the ardent golfer would play Mount Everest if somebody put a flagstick on top. . . . Unless a few golf professionals are bellyaching about my course design, I wonder whether I've done enough to challenge them."  To the millions of golfers who have played his world-famous courses, Pete Dye is either a creative genius or a demonic tormentor. To play well on Pete's courses, or on any of those influenced by his ideas, you have to know Pete. <I>Bury Me in a Pot Bunker</I> is his own story of how he revolutionized his favorite game by designing courses that both delight and bedevil golfers.   Peter and his talented wife, Alice, convert dull ground and swamps into beautiful by deadly course filled with Scotland-style mounds, deep pot bunkers, railroad ties, and tiny "target-golf" greens. <I>Bury Me in a Pot Bunker</I> tells the intimate story of how Pete Dye designed his celebrated courses and includes entertaining anecdotes about some of the greatest golfers in the world. It also captures Pete's essence as a humble, give-the-credit-to-someone-else gentleman whose sense of humor and optimism are legendary.  Some of Pete's famous courses include Harbour Town Golf Links, Crooked Stick, The Stadium Course at TPC, The Ocean Course at Kiawah, Teeth of the Dog, Oak Tree, The Stadium Course at PGA West, and Whistling Straits.  What the experts say about Pete Dye:  He created some of the world's top courses [and] had a profound impact on late-twentieth-century course architecture." -- Geoffrey S. Cornish and Ronald E. Whitten <I>The Architects of Golf</I>  "This is Star Wars golf. This place was designed by Darth Vadar." -- Ben Crenshaw on the Stadium Course at TCP  Pete Dye is one of the world's leading golf course designers. For over thirty years his courses have challenged ardent amateurs and PGA Tour professionals alike. A long-running American Express campaign dubbed him "The Man Golfers Love to Hate." Pete's wife and partner, Alice, is one of the greatest amateurs in the history of golf. They reside in Delray Beach, Florida.</span>

                    <span>Having played several of Dye's famous layouts, you realize this guy knows the game and challenges all facets of your shotmaking abilities (or should I say streches them.) Enjoyed the organization by layout. Must seem like real chapters in his life. Great book from a great architect.</span>

                    <span>Some think Pete Dye's golf courses are tricky or too hard. The courses Pete designs are built to be fair but punnishing for the right reasons. Played right, Pete's courses offer memorable rounds to the golfer. Now, it's not Pete who designs the course but a strong team of Pete, his wife Alice and his sons Perry and P.B. (architects in their own right) as well as the site managers and crews that are hired to do the building.<P>You'll learn that Pete designs courses on a sheet of paper and this is where his skills lie - understanding the land offered for the course and knowing how the wind and terrain will match in creating a great experience. Courses like PGA West, TPC Stadium (Sawgrass), The Pete Dye Club, Harbour Town and many others are discussed. One chapter per course.<P>Pete talks to you in this book. It's not an interview but it is presented as if Pete is telling you his life's story.<P>For a golfer looking for lessons, these are a different kind of lesson - from the eyes of a designer (and historically gifted golfer too). You will play better golf after you read this.<P>When you play a Pete Dye course, you'll remember Pete's words and how Alice was a main contributor to the design you're playing.</span>

                    <span>The whole Pete Dye story is here. Now I understand how Dye created the famous island green 17th at the Stadium Course at TPC and why Pete and his wife Alice were so heaviliy influenced by Scottish golf course design. This is a terrific book, with photos of all of his great courses.</span>
