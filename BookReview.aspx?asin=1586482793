                    <span>I already wrote a review for the report, but I have to say that after reading ALL the 96+ reviews about the report, that the vast majority either are giving stars for writing ("It reads like a novel!" Yeah!) or really do not know the subject at hand and are pleased with the report since it summarizes a lot of the time and gives you a context. I am not one to critique a government report because it is simple to read but let's not forget what this was supposed to be. This book is better as it gets to more actual testimony. Even so, here are some thoughts to help you through:
<br />
<br />1. Remember that they hardly had any funds - Bush gave them pennies to work with in contrast to the Challenger explosion or JFK assasination.
<br />
<br />2. Remember that Bush bitterly opposed the creation of the Commission and the White House previewed everything before release.
<br />
<br />3. Remember that the families of the victims themselves largely do not support this report and that it ignored many of their questions. Their views can be better found in 'Timeline of Terror' on this site)
<br />
<br />4. Remember that Bush refused to testify under oath, only finally talked to the Commission at the White House with Cheney at his side (originally for one hour only) and that they did not press him, and at first NO ONE was under oath and that none of his or Condoleeza Rice's last meeting were on the record.
<br />
<br />5. There was a conflict of interest from a number of the parties involved. and Bipartisanship (getting along) without blaming anyone was more important than getting at the truth. While I credit the Commission for their fair-mindedness, I think it went too far. This was not Pearl Harbor. There was ample warnings. Lots of them. About Usama planning to highjack and crash planes in the U.S. In N.Y. Into the WTC. Read the 'Timeline of Terror' which shows ALL the many, numerous warnings from all quarters re: the 9-11 plan. Usama had attacked us many, many times - It was no surprise. He had already declared war on us. It just took 3,000 lives to take him seriously.
<br />
<br />Anyway, all this is not a good way to get at the truth! 
<br />
<br />I have spent more than 19 years studying terrorism, the Middle East, Islam both radical and otherwise, Islamic culture and history in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, I have read the Quran and the Hadith (Al Bukhari's) numerous times. I have worked overseas in a number of these areas and know a number of others who have been as well. I could write reviews for a vast number of related books on this site since I voraciously read them at about one a week. And what I see is people ignoring experts and staff in the field for polemics by those with political axes to grind or grand theories of empire. Trust the experts. I wish our government would start listening to them, because they ALL complain that they are being ignored, not consulted, blown off, and asked to fix things after they've been broken.
<br />
<br />No Muslim, Usama included, is blowing up Americans because they hate our freedoms or because women are wearing too little on American beaches. That is a lie. They are attacking us because of our foreign policy and occupation (perceived) of the Muslim world. PLEASE READ 'IMPERIAL HUBRIS' or other works that will help you understand WHY THIS IS ALL HAPPENING and then we can hope to change it as a nation. With an informed populace.
<br />
<br />I say this for those reading the reviews and looking for answers. 
<br />
<br />A 'page turner' is not what I was looking for, not what the victim's families were looking for and I hope not what you are really looking for either. </span>

                    <span>This even-handed, non partisan, non biased report gives Americans the facts they need to understand how 9/11 occurred.
<br /> 9/11 should not be a political football, it should be a point of departure to make the changes needed in our intelligence community to make us ALL feel safer. To dismiss the reasoned introduction by Stephen Strasser just because the "New York Times is a liberal paper", as one of the other reviewers stated, is an indication that the valuable information contained in this and the soon to be released 9/11 Commission report will be politicized. It's a real shame. New York Times reporters are among the best journalists in the world, it's the reason the paper is so highly regarded and quoted in this country and around the world. Stephen Strasser has a track record as an excellent, seasoned reporter.</span>

                    <span>With a New York Times Author writing the introduction, it takes away from the actual reports.  The liberal paper of New York of course will put its spin on this one.  Skip the intro and read the facts, which are also easily accessible at the 9/11 commission website.   Everything contained in here is available for free on their website.  This is also not the actual report of the commission but transcripts of the hearings.</span>
