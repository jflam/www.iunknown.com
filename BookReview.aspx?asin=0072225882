                    <span>(Just to let you know, I do not personally know and am not affiliated with the author of this book or the publisher.)<P>I just bought this book, and I cannot agree more with the previous poster (a reader from Arizona). At first, I was skeptical, thinking that it it would be just another "teach yourself book". But, after a cursory view, as of this writing, this is probabaly THE best book for people with little or no programming experience to use to learn the basics of Java on their own.<P>This book looks like a masterpiece as far as teaching a beginner how to program in Java. The author Herbert Schildt seems to really have spent a lot of time figuring out how to present what could be difficult material to learn and simplify it for beginners. He seems to have limited the amount of difficult "computer jargon" in the book and instead explains everything using plain English. This isn't a book that you just read; it contains a lot of clearly explained step-by-step exercises and projects as the book goes along to allow the reader to practice what he/she is reading. The book is extremely well-organized and thought out.<P>I can't believe I'm writing this, but I think he has actually produced a book that will make it fun for a beginner to learn Java! The font type is of the friendly sort, and he smartly uses bold typeface to emphasize important terms. He also includes little dialogue boxes within the coding presentations to explain material. The book also contains quick drill questions (with answers at the bottom of the page) to reinforce blocks of material and "Ask the Expert" boxes where a reader can delve deeper into a topic. And he also explains everything efficiently and consicely. I even like the cover of this book; I think it has nice and non-intimidating colors.<P>The book isn't really a reference, rather it is a study tool. I suppose one could use it as a reference. (However, I bought his The Complete Java2 Reference 4th Edition, and I'll probably return it for now and buy it later if I do a lot of Java programming. As a study tool, this book seems better).<P>I might write another review after I finish working through this book.</span>

                    <span>I (a beginner programmer) had been struggling with Beginning Java 2 (also a good book, but much more complex) and picked this book up to supplement. It is an excellent resource for the newbie programmer to pick up the basics of programming in a simple and straight-forward way. A simple example program accompanies nearly every concept. The author is not trying to make you an expert and does not give lots of details. Instead, he holds your hand while you get your feet wet and get comfortable (metaphorically speaking). I went back to Beginning Java with a lot more confidence and a better understanding of basic concepts. I only gave four stars because the book only covers about 12 topics.</span>

                    <span>I started studying Java by this book. I could understand every topic explained by this author, i never get confused. He really is a great teacher. Even the vocabulary he uses is clean and easy (this is important for a non-english native)<BR>I always get back to this book to remember a concept that i had forgotten.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good beginner's book. The only problem is that Adobe Reader will not let you copy and paste the code samples. The function is disabled, and you have to type in all of the code by hand.<P>I am not sure I would buy this book again because of this. I have left this book behind and moved onto more user friendly books.<P>What a waste.</span>

                    <span>In our company, we have some junior programmers that I get to supervise. For them, this is essentially their first programming job. I was searching for a good introductory java book to help get them up to speed. After some travails, I narrowed it down to this book.<P>It explains enough about java to get new programmers off to a good start. Several of my guys said this book was highly "cool"! Glad they liked it.</span>
