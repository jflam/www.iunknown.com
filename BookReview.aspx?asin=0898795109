                    <span>This is really a wonderful book, but I think the title misleads a lot of people. Not only is this book great for comedy writers, but it's also just as good for comics of all types. Even if you're simply hoping to become a more humorous person in general, this book will for sure help you. I am more able to effectively make spontaneous jokes with my friends and I owe it to reading this book. I'm writing a screenplay for a comedy and that's how I came about this book, and I've run into a lot fewer writer's blocks and I've been able to increase the concentration of humor within the script. The only draw backs are its length and the writing. It's a little long, and the author isn't always easy to understand. His style breaks things down in a very technical sense, which can be hard to grasp at first. Other than that, I'd suggest it for ANYONE interested in humor.</span>

                    <span>I'm a photo journalist and I interview a lot of professional<BR>touring comics when they hit Orange County (California). I'm amazed at the number of times these big time pros have "Comedy Writing Secrets" in their rooms. Last month Drew Carrey was photographed reading the book in a national ad he did for library services. Since I've read and loved the book, I use it as a conversation ice breaker while I'm lightting the set. The<BR>comics then feel more relaxed knowing we enjoy something in common.</span>

                    <span>The fundamentals of comedy writing haven't changed since this book was originally published, and Mel Helitzer (who's taught comedy writing at university for decades) delivers a step-by-step course on comedic writing, thinking, and acting.<P>You'll learn the basics of comedy writing, the anatomy of humor, and the avenues by which you can turn your comedic talent into a well-paying pursuit√ëand why the demand for humor writers far exceeds the supply. You'll also find more than a thousand one-liners, bits, and speech excerpts covering the entire range of comedy techniques.<P>If you want a comprehensive guide to writing, selling, and performing all types of comedy, then this is the book you must read cover to cover and keep on your shelf for a lifetime of reference.</span>

                    <span>This book is an antique. I found this book to be completely dated and unhelpful. Unless your are Schecky Green and going out on tour on the Catskills comedy circuit don't buy this book. If you plan on opening with "Take my wife, please", then you will find this book very helpful, if not then don't bother...RKC</span>

                    <span>This is one of those books that are way too long than it should be. Very unfocused writing. Good ideas, but the author can't write. But three stars for a good analysis of what is comedy. Comedy is something with a surprise and something that makes you feel superior. The latter is so true and I never thought about it in that way...good analysis. The author really breaks down on the ingredients of a good joke. Good for anyone stuck and trying to create new jokes. But don't feel bad, Letterman has a team of writers that write his jokes, and he's still not funny.</span>
