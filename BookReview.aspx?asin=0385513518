                    <span>This book is for everyone!  Employees, Employers, Entrepreneurs, Everyday people, you name it.  Everyone is talking about this book.  I keep hearing stories of companies that are buying a copy for all of their employees.  So I had to get a copy too.  I am buying copies for all my friends and family for Christmas presents.  If you only purchase one book this year, make this the one.  There is so much contained in this easy to read book that all come away with inspiration.  I am proud to be a "Fred".</span>

                    <span>This real life story has the potential to change our lives. I loved every word in this short book especially after a very recent Fred experience. I can confirm that Freds exist and we need to learn a lot from such great souls, though they may be employed in very ordinary jobs.
<br />
<br />Last fortnight, while on a short vacation  with my family on the west coast of India we had engaged a taxi for four days for sight seeing. Suddenly there was a local strike on a sensitive political issue and all roads were blocked. While we were feeling very insecure and afraid of being caught in mob fury in the middle of our tour, the taxi driver made sure that he took us to our hotel safely, talking his way through small groups of miscreants who tried stopping vehicles from plying. We had to stay overnight at a hotel to continue the journey the next day when normalcy was restored. To my surprise, the taxi driver would not charge us anything for the extra time he had spent for us and on the other hand was feeling sorry that we were inconvenienced during our vacation. He invited us to visit the place once again so that he could take us to some more interesting places nearby. While he dropped us off at the airport, I just couldn't resist hugging him with a big THANK YOU from our family. I promptly rewarded him with a fat tip for taking such good care of us. Exceptional service from a very ordinary taxi driver. 
<br />
<br />This book teaches us to become Freds, locate Freds and create Freds. Mark, I am grateful to you for this extraordinary book. I also salute the real Fred who works for the U.S. Postal service in Denver who inspired you to write the book.</span>

                    <span>What I love about The Fred Factor is that it counters the notion that to succeed in business means somehow abandoning your values.  Mark Sanborn makes a case that success in business, or life, for that matter, is a matter of embracing the values of service, caring, and doing the right thing.  This is a book that should be standard issue for every employee of every company.  Outstanding!</span>

                    <span>Ever had a waiter ask, "Somethin' to drink?" while you look at your menu? How about a hotel clerk that says "Help you" like a question or a secretary who says "may I ask what this is in reference to?" when you try to call someone?  The fact is, we  hear so many monotone responses so often that "excuse me" "nice to meet you" and "have a nice day" seem to have no meaning at all.  But then there's Fred, the guy who looks you in the eye, goes the extra mile, and adds a personal touch to the service he provides you. In today's ever-so-competitive markets, you'd think the personal touch approach would be second nature.  The thing is, it's not, and this probably won't change.  Sanborn isn't trying to teach clever people a shortcut--he's simply trying to remind us that genuine effort and a personal approach will never go out of style.</span>

                    <span>This book mixes both an inspiring story of an "ordinary" mail carrier (Fred) with four key principles every employee needs to hear. I've been in Mark's audiences (where he tells about Fred) and have seen the reaction of "ordinary" employees to his message: They become motivated--and walk out with a few "to do's" to change the way they do their job. The book provides "the next best thing" to the speech. It's simple reading, with a straight-forward message that's applicable to anyone who wants to be a star performer on the job."</span>
