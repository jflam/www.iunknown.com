                <span id="Label1">In "Beyond Fear," Bruce Schneier invites us to take a critical look at not just the threats to our security, but the ways in which we're encouraged to think about security by law enforcement agencies, businesses of all shapes and sizes, and our national governments and militaries. Schneier believes we all can and should be better security consumers, and that the trade-offs we make in the name of security - in terms of cash outlays, taxes, inconvenience, and diminished freedoms - should be part of an ongoing negotiation in our personal, professional, and civic lives, and the subject of an open and informed national discussion.With a well-deserved reputation for original and sometimes iconoclastic thought, Schneier has a lot to say that is provocative, counter-intuitive, and just plain good sense. He explains in detail, for example, why we need to design security systems that don't just work well, but fail well, and why secrecy on the part of government often undermines security.&nbsp; A skeptic of much that's promised by highly touted technologies like biometrics, Schneier is also a refreshingly positive, problem-solving force in the often self-dramatizing and fear-mongering world of security pundits.Schneier helps the reader to understand the issues at stake, and how to best come to one's own conclusions, including the vast infrastructure we already have in place, and the vaster systems--some useful, others useless or worse--that we're being asked to submit to and pay for.</span>

                    <span>In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information about how to be safer, what things are dangerous, what to do in case of X, it is pleasant and surprising to see a book that tells you how to make decisions like these yourself.<P>Pleasantly apolitical, Schneier presents a concrete way to evaluate various decisions about security. Should you install an alarm system in your home? Should airline pilots be armed? While different in scope, the process of answering these questions is the same and presented in easy-to-understand language. This is not a book for "security experts" it is a book for all of us.<P>When you are finished reading the book, you are armed with the tools to make decisions about your own security and to evaluate the ideas presented by policy-makers. More importantly, you have the tools to rationally describe why potential policies would make things less secure rather than more secure.<P>This book is a valuable, perhaps necessary, resource for everyone. If you've ever worried about a particular threat and wondered what you could do, read this book.</span>

                    <span>Not quite what I'd expected. I'd read & enjoyed 'Secrets & Lies', and I thought this would be more of the same. This book is really a discussion about what actions have been taken post 9/11, and in parts it's a criticism of the overreaction that there has been.<P>However, its not overtly political, and gives dozens (perhaps a 100) practical worked examples of good & bad, effective & ineffective, responses to security issues, whether it be physical, electronic etc.<P>There is a 5-step process which I found useful to apply to everyday situations; and (in highly abbreviated form) these are : what are you trying to protect; what are the risks; risk mitigation; risks caused by the solution; trade-offs <P>The core message is : "as both individuals and a society, we can make choices about our security", and this book helps you understand how to make those informed decisions.</span>

                    <span>Bruce Schneier is a well known security expert and author of one of my favorite technical books of all time, Applied Cryptography. This latest book, Beyond Fear, is written for a popular audience and mostly discusses security measures taken by the US since 9/11.<P>While Bruce is thoughtful, clear, and provides excellent examples to back up his points, this book really could have used better editing. To me, it feels like a three chapters were spun out into an entire book by repeating the same points and same examples over and over again. <P>I still think this book is worth buying. The first 3-4 chapters alone are worthwhile. Spending some time thinking about the security the way Bruce thinks about it -- always from a cost/benefit standpoint -- is worthwhile. But, as I was, you might get a little frustrated by the poor editing.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I have read a number of the Pro and Con reviews. I think it is important to take a good look at the title of the book, and use that as a guide to a buying decision. This book is not an in-depth cookbook of technical approaches to combat hackers, but rather a sensible way of looking at the issues that contribute to an aura of security, the appearance of security, and actually being secure. I really liked the whole premise, because we are such an image conscience, and sound-bite oriented society that it can become quite difficult to deliver a thought-provoking treatise on a topic that many think they know so much about.<P>My only negative comment would be that it got a little slow at the end, for me. Maybe I was just tired that night or something. <P>He cites a few excellent examples of places or instances where someone did something that they honestly felt would contribute to increased security, when the actual effect turned out to be the opposite. If I may draw a crude comparison: if you appreciated some of the observations, and perhaps even the writing style and presentation in Hammer and Champy's "Reengineering the Corporation", then you will like and appreciate this volume. The way Mr. Schneier presents information, and the way he introduces you to perceived vs. actual may strike you as being similar. (No offense meant to either author - I enjoyed both)<P>Happy trails.</span>

                    <span>I first read about Bruce Schneier in an eye-opening article by Charles Mann in the September, 2002 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. It seems that you don't have to make the false choice everyone is agonizing over between security and liberty. You can have both.<P>Schneier's book expands on the ideas in the article. Although Schneier is a technology fan and it is his livelihood, he realizes that sometimes a live security guard can provide better security than cutting-edge (but still fallible) face-recognition scanners, for instance. He explains why national ID cards are not a good idea, and how iris-scanners can be fooled. <P>These are ideas for security on a large scale, for airports, nuclear and other power plants, and government websites. For security on an individual or small business scale, try Art of the Steal by Frank Abagnale. But even if you don't run a government, Beyond Fear is a fascinating read about how your government is making choices (and how they SHOULD be making choices about your security and about your rights.</span>
