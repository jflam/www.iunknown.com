                <span id="Label1">Celebrate the 200th anniversary of the White House with this richly illustrated new book on America's, if not the world's, most famous residence.  Abigail Adams dried her wash in the unfinished East Room.  Benjamin Harrison left the lights burning all night because he feared being shocked by the newly installed electric switches.  LBJ waged an obsessive battle with the water pressure in the shower, demanding showerheads on all sides. His successor, Richard Nixon, promptly had them removed.  The White House has not always been the ideal home, and as each president moved in, he transformed the house in small and large ways to fit his family's needs.  <P>Real Life at the White House celebrates two centuries of domestic life in this historic abode. In forty-two chapters - one for each administration - this stylish sourcebook takes us on an intimate tour of the daily life of each president and his family, bringing into view everything from china patterns to built-in closets (a luxury added during the Truman renovation), from plumbing to telephones (Coolidge refused to use the phone for business) from architectural structure to state dinners and family meals.  <P>Filled with hundreds of anecdotes, photographs, and  presidential quotes from Washington(who never lived there but oversaw the first plans) to Clinton, this thoroughly engaging book captures the texture of presidential life while documenting the very human history of a house.</span>

                    <span>I was just fascinated to see how forty families lived in one house. Real Life at the White House is full of wonderful anecdotes-many of them I hadn't heard before-and it really gives you a sense of how history happened, all in one place. It's well written and charming. I agree with curator Clement Conger, who calls this book "the best" of the genre.</span>

                    <span>Real Life at the White House not only compiles into one fascinating book the history of the house itself, but some serious insight into the office of President, the types of men who have found themselves in the position, and how it changed them for better - or worse. It is amazing what we DIDN'T know about Ike, about Kennedy and about Reagan. Some of it is downright scary! While it is reassuring to know we have managed to stumble along as a nation because of, sometimes in spite of, the people who have held this high office, one is often reminded also that "absolute power corrupts absolutely", whether it is the President, his spouse, or the chief housekeeper.</span>

                    <span>I found this book full of information about the different Presidents and their families and how they adjusted to living in the White House.<P>There is a lot of information about earlier, less known Presidents, and I enjoyed reading those chapters.<P>I was also interested to read about all the pets over the years.<BR>Every family seemed to have all sorts of animals.<P>It was interesting to read about the First Ladies and their "quirks". Mary Todd Lincoln ran up clothing bills that she tried to hide---just like Jackie.<P>Other stories that I found amusing were that Nixon would not allow guards or policemen to speak to him or Mrs. Nixon. Betty Ford couldn't understand why they ignored her greetings until this was explained to her.<P>Ronald Reagan served tea to Prince Charles who did not touch it because, as he explained later, he didn't know what to do with the little bag!<P>Many such amusing stories made this a truly enjoyable book. I recommend to anyone wanting to know about living in the White House.</span>

                    <span>I was so excited when I got this book. I love stories about Presidents. However, everything in this book I had read somehwere else. Same old boring stuff. No new pictures. Basically, I thought it was awful.</span>

I found it full of fasincating stories that really show what it was like for forty families to live in one house over 200 years.</span>
