                <span id="Label1">Windows security has often been considered a dry and unapproachable topic. For years, the main examples of programming security were simply exercises in ACL manipulation. Programming Windows Security is a revelation providing developers with insight into the way Windows security really works. This book shows developers the essentials of security in Windows 2000, including coverage of Kerberos, SSL, job objects, the new ACL model, COM+ and IIS 5.0. Also included are highlights of the differences between security in Windows 2000 and in Windows NT 4.0.  <P>Programming Windows Security is written by an experienced developer specifically for use by other developers. It focuses on the issues of most concern to developers today: the design and implementation of secure distributed systems using the networking infrastructure provided by Windows, the file server, the web server, RPC servers, and COM(+) servers.  <P>Topics covered include:   <P>* COM(+) security, from the ground up  <BR>* IIS security  <BR>* How the file system redirector works and why developers should care  <BR>* The RPC security model  <BR>* Kerberos, NTLM, and SSL authentication protocols and SSPI  <BR>* Services and the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)  <BR>* Logon sessions and tokens  <BR>* Window stations, desktops, and user profiles  <BR>* The Windows 2000 ACL model, including the new model of inheritance  <BR>* Using private security descriptors to secure objects  <BR>* Accounts, groups, aliases, privileges, and passwords  <BR>* Comparison of three strategies for performing access control--impersonation, role-centric, and object-centric--and their impact on the design of a distributed application   <P>Programming Windows Security provides the most comprehensive coverage of COM(+) security available in one place, culled from the author's extensive experience in diagnosing COM security problems in the lab and via correspondence on the DCOM mailing list. </span>

                    <span>This is the most comprehensive Windows security book for programmers there is. There are many books out there on how to administer Windows security, but very few on how to program it. About two years ago I started on a project that implemented fine-grained private object security and read everything I could find on the topic; there wasn't much. During that project I was able to read some very useful articles from Keith in MSJ/MSDN magazine. This book includes topics covered in his magazine articles, but adds more detail. It also covers more topics and pulls it all together in one comprehensive book. Even though I thought that I had been exposed to most of what this book covers I went ahead and read it. I still learned a lot, especially about logon sessions and Windows stations and how they affect the security of your application. I think that every Windows developer should read this book because what this book covers affects you even if you are not interested in security. Web programmers should make sure to check out the section on IIS. This book would have saved me so much time if I would have had it two years ago. I read some of the other reviews and found the ones about the font size kind of ridiculous. Everyone has his or her personal preferences on font and style, but I am reviewing this book based on content. I give this book five stars.</span>

                    <span>Anyone involved in Windows NT/2000 security development would benefit from adding this book to their library. Brown definitely does an excellent job of explaining one of the more difficult aspects of Windows NT/2000 development -- in fact, I'd say that his treatment of ACLs, security descriptors, desktops, window stations and access tokens is among the best that I have read. The only reason that I don't rate this book with 5 stars is that it does not include anything on the LSA APIs. These are some of the more intimidating APIs that a security developer will ever tangle with, but they are essential for such handy little tasks as joining workstations to domains, creating and/or modifying user or group machine rights, or coding replacement GINA dlls. You can find some pretty decent refrences to these APIs (as well as some decent code examples) on msdn dot microsoft dot com, but you have to hunt for them. Having the LSA included in a handy reference such as this book would definitely make it worthy of a five star rating!</span>

                    <span>Keith Brown's book is a refreshing change from the 'stick in something about security in a side-bar' approach taken by so many authors. Finally a book which explains lucidly what amounts to a very complex topic; and does so in an understandable and enjoyable fashion. If there were 6 stars on the rating scale then it would get a 6...</span>

                    <span>I've been a professional software engineer on Win16/Win32 platforms for over 11 years, doing COM development for most of that time. I have never encountered a source of technical information that comes close to the lucidity or completeness of the Developmentor Series.<P>Keith Brown's contribution to this series on Windows security continues the tradition of solid, well researched and clearly written treatise on topics that affect, and should concern, every developer who is serious about producing high quality code on the Win32 platform.<P>Most developers trip over security because the fundamentals of identity, authentication, etc. are not well understood. This book provides a thorough introduction to the ideas that underly secure systems as well as a complete explanation of how they are implemented by Win32. Very useful for those of us who don't bend spoons with our minds for a living (still laughing over that analogy--thanks Keith!)<P>If you use COM (and who writes for Win32 and doesn't these days?) then the wisdom in Chapter 9 alone is worth the price of the book.</span>
