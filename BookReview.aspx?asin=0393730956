                    <span>Linton seems to believe that artistry is more important than a standard method. He writes a convincing approach to doing your portfolio from scratch instead of using those zippered cases which he does not believe reflect one's creative or design talents. He seems to think that the 'vision' of the portfolio comes from a thorough understanding of page structure and the creative potential of a well-rehearsed two-dimensional page layout - understanding negative space and how to use it effectively. I have had him as an instructor in one of his portfolio design workshop classes and he 'preaches' what he writes and it worked well for me. So i endorse the approach because i know its thorough and effective. He is also quite personable in his presentation and very good speaker - well organized and extremely thorough. Great Book!Looking forward to more stuff from him in the future possibly on computers and portfolios.</span>

                    <span>Portfolio Design is probably the best book on the subject for those involved in architecture and the related disciplines who are looking for support and guidance on how to design their portfolio with artistry and a clear sense of legibility and organiaztion. I found it to be highly recommended by faculty and students and then purchased a copy for myself to see. I graduated this past spring and i know many people who have similar experiences not knowing what to do about your work for grad school apps or employment interviews - this text helped enormously. The author is a well-respected artist and professor of architecture with many other books to his name.I heard him lecture at the AIAS National Forum this past week - and wow - everyone was really interested in what was presented - how to approach the problem - its all broken down for you. I think it would help anyone who wants design guidance with artistry.</span>
