                    <span>This book perhaps is the easiest to read and understand. Kind of step-by-step tutorials. Each chapter is followed by a useful sample. Some useful and interesting stuff on Web development using GDI+ and printing. Chapters are organized very well. I would add more complex samples. Rest is pretty straight forward. Overall an interesting reading. If you are trying to understand GDI+ classes, not bad at all.</span>

                    <span>This book is completely worthless.  You can read the .NET Documentation and get the same information.  A matter a fact most of it is that same as the .NET documentation.  Don't waste your money on this one especially if you have some background in graphics programming for Windows.</span>

                    <span>This book is all about GDI+ drawing, which is basically every thing defined in the System.Drawing namespace. I didn't expect information on Printing and building interactive GUI applications, which was kind of neat. Definitely some interesting and useful stuff and ton of sample code. </span>

                    <span>Simply the best...<br>This book is the best practicle guide a developer can have with him if he needs to work with GDI+. The most refreshing part of the book is the examples that are part of the book.<p>For a developer like me who has to work under narrow deadlines, this book helped me do the stuff with less time spent looking and researching for stuff. <p>I am not so much of a MSDN reader, quite frankly MSDN gets me confused, and GDI+ is a subject that needs a structured approach to it. hence, msdn only provides much more info than required hence creating confusion.<p>I would recomend this to every developer who wants to play with GDI+.</span>

                    <span>There are not too many books dedicated to GDI+ and Graphics Programming in .NET but this book is definitely one of the finest technical books written on GDI+. As such I am a big fan of AW's .NET Series managed by Don Box and group because of the quality of contents and experts involved in the series. <p>This book delivers what is promises. Author's writing style is pretty straight forward, which I liked the most. Author talks to the point. As a beginner, you will get it right away. <p>There are some chpaters such as performance and best practices, Advanced Imaging, Advanced 2D, Transformation and Printing where advanced users will definitely learn what is not discussed in MSDN documentation or in any other books. <p>All explainations are followed by a sample code, which is pretty nice to have. Just read and run the code. All samples in the book are a seperate project so that's kinda cool.<p>If you are involve with writing drawing, printing, painting, and UI applications for Windows Forms or Web, you may want to try this one.</span>
