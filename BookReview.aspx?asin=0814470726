                <span id="Label1">In our hype-infested society, honest and positive word of mouth can  multiply sales explosively. But for those who think it happens by chance (as  most marketers do), this book will be an eye-opener.   <P>The surprising truth is that word of mouth can be implemented as strategically  as any other form of marketing--and at significantly lower cost! This is  especially good news for any seller of products or services who must maximize  every marketing dollar.   <P>Central to this book is the innovative Decision Matrix, which helps readers  identify who their potential buyers are and what messages those prospects need  to hear from friends, coworkers, and trusted advisors. This matrix is followed  by step-by-step guidance on how to construct an integrated "no vested interest"  campaign that leverages all channels (including traditional media, the Internet,  and PR), penetrates successive tiers of audiences, and builds sales  exponentially. Marketers will learn how to:  <P>* Target the predominate adopter type (innovator, early, middle, late, laggard) * Create the content--the actual words--needed to accelerate the process * Identify the sources and delivery mechanisms that will be most persuasive * Use a wide variety of the methods that trigger runaway word of mouth.</span>

                    <span>WOW! I never knew that Word of Mouth Marketing could be turned into a powerful system for success. George Silverman gives you the real honest scoop. No double talk or theory here. There are concepts in this book that are truly revolutionary, like the decision acceleration strategy for increasing your sales. Absolutely brilliant!<BR>I've read and re-read Word of Mouth Marketing and given it as a gift to many of my friends. In fact, my copy is full of highlighting, paper clips and post-it notes. It has become our company's business bible, and George Silverman is my guru. Word of Mouth Marketing has become my secret weapon in business.</span>

                    <span>There are several good books on word of mouth and viral marketing (and I read everything on the topic), but none like this - written by a master implementer. Silverman reveals previously secret techniques he personally implemented for his clients in dozens of competitive wars. And because he's done it all first hand, he's able to illustrate every principle with fascinating real-world marketing examples. No one knows where word of mouth fits into the sales and advertising cycle better than Silverman. He's at the forefront of turning the whole field into a technology and a new media - treating word of mouth as something you can massively cause, not just a side-effect of a great product or PR. He spells out the principles, strategies, and specific techniques - many of which he invented - and how they relate to each other and to other media. The book is full of checklists of do's and don'ts, many of which aren't at all obvious. He explains how to maximize the leverage, getting 5-10 times more per promotional dollar spent. (Was there ever a better time for that?!) Heaven help your competitors who haven't read this book after you have.</span>

                    <span>I've read numerous marketing books over the past five years. The Sercrets of Word-of-Mouth reallys stands out. It addresses perhaps the most powerful yet most overlooked (and least tapped) area of marketing. Few books or marketing courses outline or discuss word-of-mouth marketing as clearly as George Silverman does in his book. His easy to read book offers numerous recommendations on using word-of-mouth. While I already do some of the things recommended by Silverman, I gained valuable ideas on how to improve what I am currently doing and learned other strategies. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I have 10+ years of experience marketing and launching high tech (and non high tech yet innovative) products of various sort and i found this information both accurate, invaluably concise and making good business sense. I find it an excellent complement to more theory oriented books like the "tipping point" and the "anatomy of buzz".<BR>These last two books will explain you how words of mouth works but will not give you any really in depth insight about how you can make words of mouth work for you. "The secrets of words of mouth marketing" does.<P>To give just and example: the "decision matrix" described in chapter 5 is an extremely concise and rich tool for anticipating the concrete information that customers need to hear in order to decide about a product. For instance if you are currently targeting early adopters kind of customers then the matrix will tell you the exact content of what they need to hear in order to help them "decide to decide", "weigh information in your favor", "engage in a trial" etc. The decision matrix will also tell you what middle majority/pragmatist customers will need to hear to make the same kind of decisions and of course it's not at all the same (those of you wondering what I mean by early adopters, middle majority etc will find the info in the book -- this belongs to the diffusion of innovation theory of Everett Rogers something that any person seriously interested about words-of-mouth need to know about anyway by reading the two other books or this one).<P>You might have notice that in the previous paragraph I have been speaking about what customer "need to hear" and not what your company "needs to tell them". I think it's one of the great success of the book in helping us to really see the difference between the two, to understand that what you company say is less important than what your cstomer say and think and to understand how words-of-mouth can be "organized" in order for the two to match better.<P>Great book!!<P>Bruno Levy</span>

                    <span>This book not only covers the power of Word-Of-Mouth marketing, but it actually deals with one of the most overlooked, and also the most important aspect of marketing: the decision making process. Ignore this aspect, like many marketers do, and your campaign will sputter or simply die a slow, agonizing death. Give it the attention it deserves, as Mr. Silverman explains, and you suddenly hit a homerun while others stand in amazement at what you just pulled off. <P>With all that said, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in taking their marketing knowledge and skill set to the next level. You will not be disappointed as it isn't just another rehash of the same old thing repackaged between two shiny looking covers.</span>
