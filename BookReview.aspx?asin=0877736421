                    <span>It's strange why autopoiesis has taken so long to be taken seriously when there is overwhelming evidence from many fields that we need to move away from our old paradigms of thought, particularly our reliance on Aristotelian logic. Whether one looks at Prigogine, Perlovsky, Chaitin or Jantsch there is clear evidence that we (and I mean those embedded with the 'grand' tradition European thought) of desperately need to change our way of looking at the universe.<P>This book presents a clear overview of how Maturana and Varela arrived at their conclusions. There are many sidebars that fully explain important points; it is obvious these two are good professors and know where they need to go into more depth so the reader may grasp salient arguments. Their views on cognition and knowledge are very different from the child-like expositions put forward by the vast majority of Western philosophers and this book develops the groundwork for understanding autopoiesis.<P>Post-rationalist thought is just beginning to be a "field" in Western philosophy and this book should be on the shelves of anyone interested in trying to really understand the universe.</span>

                    <span>Maturana and Varella offer stunishing insights as to the recursive nature of reflection and how this phenonenom is rooted in the very nature of what it means to be human. By establishing a connection that cognition is rooted in relationships at the cellular, level a picture of complexity is painted that offers suggestions as to our very nature. The implications on human dynamics and organizational transformation are astounding. A must read for anyone who is serious about understanding the complexities of organizational transformation.</span>

                    <span>However Amazon writes "by Humberto Maturana" we cannot forget the other writer (Francisco Varela) dead about three years.<P>Both come from the research started by Stafford Beer in Chile and they are not alone: People as Terry Winograd or Fernando Flores are in the same package and all of them give powerful reasons against the so-called GOFAI (Good-Old-Fashioned-Artificial-Intelligence).<P>Maturana and Varela are not the first but, for sure, they are among the brightest.</span>

                    <span>The reason I like it is not because I suddenly got interest in the field of biology, but it gives me an exposition of Phenomenonlogy philosophy (Husserl, Heiddeger, Gadamer), not from very abstract first philosophical princples, but from phisical and biological roots, so renders this heavy idea far eaiser to be assimilated (although it is still enormously heavy to me:-) ).<BR> <BR>So why I like Phenomenology and Autopoiesis? It fundamentally change the way I see the world, both in terms of the nature, humanbeing, and society. Those concepts of "Structural Coupling", "Natural Drifting", "Structure Determined Behavior", "Consensual Domain" are very powerful and proves how so much of our common sense are fundamentally wrong. Those powerful idea has implications and applications, which permeat our life everytime, everywhere. <BR> <BR>Drawing on those conceptualizations, I can induce convicing answers to those seemingly simple, but actually very complex questions, at a underlying structural level, such as why defeating ourselves and changing our bad habit is so difficult and how to achieve that feat? How we can be in control of our own lives? Why misunderstanding with and among our relatives, friends are so common, and how to handle? Why different persons have the exactly contrary interpretations to the same situation, the root of multi-perspectives? Why constantly our contributions to others result in indifferent response or even revenge (this conceptulization is actually, sometimes wrong).... and, maybe most importantly, why love lies at the core of our being!<BR> <BR>I also, borrows the idea of Autopoieis to elaborate and address the corporate cutural issues inherent in the ERP system implementation, which is the core idea of my dissertation that I am now working on. <BR> <BR>Rememeber "Matrix"? the movie features Lewis, the idea behind this movie can be explained precisely by the concept Autopoiesis. The idea of Matrix, which is built to control human mind and render them to slaves of power supplier is ofcourse, radical, but if we can learn from Neo, the main figure, try to break out of our mind structure, to learn to be more open, then it is much likely that we can realize our full potential as human being, the most advanced form of Autopoiesis. The concept of Autopoiesis gives you the RED PILL!<BR> <BR>Science is powerful not because it is true, science is true because it is powerful! I believe if I keep asking myself the question "why", remain "childish" in this sense, then I gonna make a difference from the ORIGINAL me!</span>
