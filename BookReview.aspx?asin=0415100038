                    <span>If you're considering learning Amharic, look somewhere else. This book attempts to present a condensed tutorial on the use of colloquial Amharic, and in my opinion fails miserably. <P>First, let me start off by saying that Amharic is an extremely complicated language to learn. It is nothing like Spanish, French, or Italian. It is a semitic language, of the same family as Arabic and Hebrew, and contains over 200 characters. On saying that, I believe that it requires more than this book has to offer. Some of the words used in the book are humorous, and will probably prompt laughter by an Amharic speaker (it had me laughing quite often).<BR>It does have some useful phrases and words however, such as the time of day, the days of the week, and very basic greetings. It also has a good section in the back on the conjugation of verbs. <P>What really shocks me is that Ethiopians collaborated on this effort. My guess is that the people who worked with David (I think he's English) lacked a strong command of the english language, or he didn't consult with them before going to print.<P>If decide to buy this book anyhow, don't be offended when someone laughs at you, stares blankly, or wonders why you're addressing them as being elderly, when they're in their 20's.</span>

                    <span>I love Ethiopian music among other things Ethiopian and I bought this in order to improve my understanding of the Amharic lyrics of some of my favorite Ethiopian singers (GiGi, Dawit, Aster, Abonesh, etc.) It's turned into an obsession and passion to study this beautiful language. This is a thorough, fun, extremeley helpful course. For example, The lessons on "glottalized" sounds (sounds made in Amharic that we don't make in English) helped me to better understand, say, GiGi (has a series of highly recommended albums sung entirely in Amharic--beautiful!) when she belts out an Amharic word that my ears can't grasp. Helpful, good, easy to follow lessons. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This is an exellent book to learn amharic from for those really interested in penetrating this extremely difficult language. The author takes you through the amharic alphabet, after which you are prepared to read any amharic text with correct pronounciation. To understand amharic, however, much practising is needed. I managed to learn sufficient amharic from the first 4-5 chapters, so that my 2 weeks journey to Ethiopia became several fold more interesting and inspiring. I managed to convince people I met, that I had spent years in Ethiopia!! That certainly says more about foreigners in Ethiopia than myself.</span>

                    <span>I like this book very much. This isn't an easy language so it is very slow going (or it was for me, anyway). The tapes provide indispensable practice in listening as well as making sounds that don't exist even in other Semitic languages. A couple of suggestions for making the book a five star book: First, include a section that shows how to hand-write the Amharic syllables. I still feel very awkward writing Amharic although I've been at it for quite a while. Also, I would like it if in the glossary in back there was a Roman transliteration as well as Amharic. I don't want to be dependent on romanization (and it certainly isn't necessary) but in many cases there are geminate (doubled) consonants in the middle of words, which isn't shown in the native writing system. A transcription would be a help in insuring correct pronunciation.</span>

                    <span>A clear presentation of a complex language. The "Colloquial" series varies in quality, but this is one of its best examples. It covers the phonology, grammar and writing system of the contemporary language in gratifying (some may say "daunting") detail, and the cassettes complement each aspect of the book. The abundance of explanation and examples is especially striking, given the paucity of other textbooks for Amharic. For its size and price, this book is definitely a winner. <P>The only course I know of that surpasses it is "Amharic Basic Course," produced by the National Foreign Affairs Training Center...If one wants to delve this deeply into the language, it might be a good idea also to check American university press offerings.</span>
