                    <span>Ok, one of the things that interested me in this film was the trailers I saw in Europe:  a young nubile female strips, etc etc.  But the backdrop - 1968 Paris and its petite revolution - appeared the ideal context for a true film journey.  I have long felt ambivalent about Bertolucci:  his Last Tango was brutally shocking to me and a high school sweetheart, his Last Emperor appeared to exploit the cheapest "Asiatic mysteries" to me, an American half-Chinese.  But there is no doubt about the psychological depth in his unusual and audacious films, which always offer the unexpected.
<br />
<br />This film is ironic in the way that many American films would never dare:  while student street fighting goes on, some pretentious youths - with conversations sooo like those I had sooo near that time - are creating their own little artistic-erotic world, safe in a cushion of bourgois money that is disturbed only by the strikes of basic services like garbage haulers.  I do not know if Bertolucci disdains the little revolution of 1968, but it forms an unspoken reference point to some serious adolescent experimentation.  I suspect that they are not studies in contrast for what was going on outside - in retrospect so selfservingly trivial and off-base an effort to re-make society in the space of a week - but a pure metaphor for what it all meant.
<br />
<br />The protagonists are middle-class film nuts, who are taken up in the carneval of the 1960s with all its excesses and self-important sillyness.  I was similar to them, I admit, but was not in as exotic a place as Paris, though I felt destined to live there for a while (and did in the late 70s, largely for the reasons of the American character).  They play film trivia games, which when lost resulted in bizarre "forfaits sexuels" that are extremely titilatting to us folks who like to recall their reckless youth.  But it becomes deep as the protagonists get lost in their own personal labyrinthes:  the twins obsessed with eachother and with art, the American with the beauty of European difference and quality.  Having lived through so much of it, I empathised with all of them and did not find them as ridiculous as many reviewers have:  they are just young, experimenting before making tough choices, and enjoying it all while searching for some elusive ideal.  Haven't we all passed that way?  Or shouldn't we all have?
<br />
<br />I will have to watch this many times before arriving at a definitive interpretation, but then that is the way with truly great art.  Also, I believe that this film will age well, will be interpreted at many levels as I enter old age.  Bertolucci really gets the double-sided nature of lucky youth:  they both see more than adults absorbed by a career trajectory and yet their insights can often be callow and pathetically selfish.  But hey, that is part of the jurney of life, and this film plumbs a lot of that depth with panache and zest.  I loved it.
<br />
<br />Warmly recommended.</span>

                    <span>"Dreamers" offers sexy scenes and actors, but ultimately everybody is unsatisfied and unhappy, in the trademark French way. The French fascination with brother-sister incest continues. Ambiguity is the name of this game, and nothing gets spelled out--who loves who or how much. If you want a complicated love triangle and a fair amount of nudity, then "Dreamers" fits the bill. Nothing profound here.</span>

                    <span>Horribly @nal in very a different non-Bertolucci sense of the word, "The Dreamers" is a thoroughly disengaging excuse for taking Freudian sex dysfunctions, applying them to adolescent `when the parents are out' home parties between specific limited circles, including family members, it seems that someone here should maybe actually tune into what goes on in college these days and how digital camcorders have defined the income of every seventeen to twenty-three year old sophomore student with an internet connection, alcohol and the neophyte wannabe film star who is willing to go all the way for $5.95, one Bernardo Bertolucci comes across as thinking himself provocative with this piece of breaking wind... the local Bingo hall is sure to gossip, but we are left feeling that maybe the man who directed "Last Tango in Paris" probably thought that it is still `h@rdcore', the NC-17 rating (probably because some southern mother lobby group camped outside a censor's office) only suggestive of something Larry Clark style, turns out to be as about as offensive as seeing your baby son in the bath tub, although shock horror wow, we see some men's things more than often, it all comes off as pretty hooky, horrible collisions of acting talent because of nudity, probably thinks itself a lot more clever than what it really is, you will snooze yourself into the copyright screen. 
<br />
<br />An American boy in Paris, meets film buff brother and sister, meets the parents who leave and they turn the apartment into Sodom and Gomorra while we get the famous pretend 'acting' scenes from the movie "Leon" repeated here a few times, all before probably one of the worst endings ever committed to celluloid (what was that??), an adulterated rotten egg is still a rotten egg and `titz' don't quite sell as much these days, Bertolucci would well to also understand that `beavs' and `nobs' are pretty much in our face so much that we can sit down and eat our cornflakes without so much as offending Jesus once with our minds, if you watch this once then go watch "The Last Emperor" ten times for penance.</span>

                    <span>This film captures the feelings and attiudes of the '60's generation in Europe and America exactly as I remember experiencing them myself.We all only  saw a part of the whole insane drama that unfolded in those times .Many friends were lost to drugs or war.The characters in this film represent the feelings of insecurity and change we all felt during this totally unique era.The music,cinematography and acting were all brilliant.</span>

                    <span>One reviewer said this movie is remarkably voyeuristic; the problem is: I cannot imagine who would want to see the things that go on within the dreamworld of these three young people in 1968 Paris. 
<br />
<br />Watching the previews for this film in the months preceding its release, I could only think this was another overdone Bertolucci homage to excess. When I did see it in its totality I was dumbfounded by its pointlessness, though, it captured the revolutionary excitement and free-spirited dynamic of Paris in that era. The sickening relationship that develops among three characters-- one American student and two incestuously close Parisian siblings-- did not make for an interesting character study. None of their motivations and reactions even made sense, particularly the psychotic sister who seemed to be suffering a deeper, untouchable madness that ultimately prevented her from being a part of the 'real world'. </span>
