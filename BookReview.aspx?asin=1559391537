                    <span>This book grew out of a smaller work entitled "I Wonder Why;" it "is not designed to be a comprehensive introduction to Buddhism, but to clarify points, provide Buddhist perspectives on modern issues, and stimulate the curiosity and questioning minds of the readers" (p. 10).  The author makes some profound statements about questions: p. 7: "In the beginning one should remain skeptical and rely on questioning and checking the teachings based on one's understanding" and p. 9: "I believe that spiritual practice is more about holding questions than finding answers.  Seeking one correct answer often comes from a wish to make life-which is basically fluid-into something certain and fixed."  The latter applies directly to Buddhism itself: p. 77-8: "As the Buddha's teachings spread from one country to another, they adapted to the culture and mentality of the people in each place without changing the essential meaning...The external forms and ways of doing things are not the Dharma."  Thus, she differentiates between true practitioners and p. 118: "joss stick Buddhists."  Needless to say, this book is for people truly interested in or at least honestly curious about Buddhism.  The author corrects many incorrect views: p. 42: "There is nothing inherently wrong with the world; the real problem lies in our disturbing attitudes" and p. 63: to set reachable short-term goals as well as long-term resolve when purifying negative traits and actions.  In addition to considerable information on helping the dying, a mantra to say when about to eat meat (p. 109: "Om Ahbirakay tsara hung" said 7 times & pray for animal to have fortunate rebirth), types of Buddhist nuns and robes, and especially children (p. 132: "When children see an adult sitting peacefully, they get the idea that they can as well" and p. 134: "Love is more important to children than material possessions.  Choosing to earn more money at the expense of good family relations may mean later having to spend that extra income on therapy and counseling for both parents and children!").  Her words are worth considerable thought though they are quite basic and virtually nonsectarian.  It's worth your time now since: p. 41: "No one dies thinking, `I should have worked more overtime.'"</span>

                    <span>Great Introduction to Buddhism<p>This book was written in response to many - "can I ask you a question about Buddhism?"<p>I really enjoyed the question and answer style that this is written in - for example in chapter one the question is asked - "What is the essence of Buddha's teachings?" and an excellent and easy to understand answer given. "What is the goal of the Buddhist path?" and again another easy to understand and terrific answer given etc - <p>These and other great questions throughout the book are questions that someone looking into Buddhism would be asking.<p>Some of the questions I hadn't really considered before, but was really glad they were asked and fully interested in the answers and learned new things.<p>This is an easy and enjoyable book to read. Great for the beginner or someone just curious about Buddhism. Great for someone further along the path to sit, smile and enjoy.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a good beginner's book on Buddhism, and found it with this one.  Thubten Chodron did an excellent job in teaching the basics of Buddhism, it's history, and the difference in interpretations by various nations.  She breaks down the chapters into various topics, from "Meditation" to "Social Activism & Ethical Issues."  Each chapter is composed of Q&A's, like "What is karma?  How does it work?"  After reading this book, I got a great idea of how Buddhists view their world.  This book is rather brief (150 pages) but it accomplishes it's intended purpose well.</span>

                    <span>These are questions and then their answers by a Tibetan Buddhist nun.  And they are very very good.  Because they are questions that students rarely ask.  Some issues seem remote from Buddhism.<br>But they are not.  So this book is a real gem.  But it should have included a really good prelude to each of the 21 chapters.<br>One feels a little like one missed the main discussion and arrived only for the question and answer period.  Please buy<br>"Open Heart, Clear Mind" by the author and make these two books a dynamic duo.</span>

                    <span>Venerable Thubten Chodron is a wonderful writer - she explains things simply and sometimes humorously, and always holds the reader's interest. If you are beginning to practice Buddhism or are contemplating doing so, this book is a great place to start. It is the perfect book to give to friends or family members who are not familiar with Buddhism but want to understand your newfound spirituality.</span>
