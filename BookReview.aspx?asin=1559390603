                    <span>I'm really writing this review in response to the previous. Nepali cooking is not about PRESENTATION---it is about TASTE! Nepali cooking, unlike so much American cuisine, sometimes looks unappealing until one takes their first bite, then wow!! If you really need you food to look attractive and 'just like the pictures' then this is not for you, stick with box mixes and Betty Crocker. If you are looking to make something different and special, then this edition is a dream! I cannot say enough good things about this book.</span>

                    <span>I actually bought this book in Nepal after serving for 2 yrs there as a Peace Corps Volunteer. I knew I'd get a hankering for some home cooked Nepali specialties once I got home. I haven't made the majority of the recipes in it, but it was certainly worth the cost of the book for the ones I have made, especially the spicy fried pork cubes which I make quite often. Kasto meetho lagyo!</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent cookbook for people who want to use new techniques and recipes in their kitchen. Nepali food offers an interesting array of spice combinations and food preparation, including sun-drying and curing. The Pan-Fried Asparagus and Potatoes is an excellent vegetarian dish, as is the Sun-Dried Lentil and Vegetable Balls with Potatoes. The Marinated Lamb Kebobs are great for grilling; try the Gundruk soup if your culinary spirit is bold and borderless. This book is well worth its modest price tag, and I recommend it to my friends who like Indian and Asian cuisine.</span>

                    <span>My Nepali friend says the book does good representation of Nepali cooking although there were a few recipes she couldn't recognize. There are traditional Nepali dishes along with Indian and British-influenced ones (e.g. chop). This is not for people who care about pretty pictures, but for people like me who would rather have MORE RECIPES.</span>

                    <span>I like this book especially for the straight-forward simplicity of the recipes and, especially, for the great tasting food.<P>It is good for both vegetarians and omnivores!<P>Several cooks contributed so the cook gets a variety of styles, probably from different parts of the american Nepalese society.</span>
