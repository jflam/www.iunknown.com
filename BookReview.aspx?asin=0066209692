                <span id="Label1">In this stunning pictorial journal, 100 talented professional and amateur photographers, many of them award winners, have captured the essence of our most profound relationship: family. Cutting across race and nationality, their photographs -- chosen from 40,000 entries worldwide -- bring to life the intimate moments and emotions shared by all families, whether in Australia, Rwanda, Colombia, or the United States.<P>Taken from the most ambitious photographic competition and exhibit ever staged, the M.I.L.K. Collection -- Moments of Intimacy, Laughter, and Kinship -- these photos depict the joy, heartbreak, and love that shaped and make up our lives. Here are the bonds that bring us together as parent and child, sister and brother, youth and elder. From a father's first look at his new baby to a weathered grandma's embrace, the laughter of octogenarian uncle and nephew to the promise of a mother's kiss, these powerful images tell the story of humanity and celebrate its deepest emotional connection.<P>The M.I.L.K. project was conceived to honor what it is to be part of a family. Look at the men, women, and children on these pages. In their faces you will recognize yourself and your loved ones, for you, too, are a member of the great kinship that is the human family. As James McBride writes, "without family, we are all a tribe of nomads, cut adrift, disconnected, wandering the earth with neither time nor place nor history to give our aching souls a home." Family is a universal homecoming, a commemoration of the human spirit itself.</span>

                    <span>I was in Auckland, New Zealand at the end of my Christmas vacation, and walked into the M.I.L.K. exhibit by the harbour. The exhibit moved me like I had never been moved before. It made me laugh, cry, and brought a great end to my trip. Best yet, the books contain more shots than the exhibit did. The only problem with the book compared to the exhibit is that the explanation of the photographs are at the end of the book and not on the pages so one must flip back and forth a lot (the stories behind all of the pictures are half of the experience). I highly recommend the entire series- very well worth the money.</span>

                    <span>While this book had the potential to be a real stunner, sadly<BR>it falls short. First of all, the book jacket and 5 large<BR>pages of written comments are practically illegible because<BR>they are printed in silver ink. Very difficult to read.Why even<BR>bother? Secondly, there are several fold out pages which are irrelevant, more gimmicky except for one vellum page imprinted with the profile of a child, which presents a lovely soft-looking image and then the more intense image.<BR> Third,the photographs at the start of the book are just blatantly there...upon investigation, again with tiny print in silver, one gathers they are there to introduce the various topics of m.i.l.k.But their placement there does nothing to whet one's appetite. It seems redundant to see the same photo, <BR>later in the chapter in which it belongs.<P>Fourth, the print size of the photographer's name next to the<BR>photo is too miniscule. Again, difficult to read. Fifth, while the poetry and quotes are okay, I think it would have been more appropriate near each picture to have the information about the photographer instead.<BR>After all, the photographers responsible for the images come<BR>from all over the world, and what better international group<BR>to help express "family"? Also, it would help give a clue as to<BR>where the photo was taken. Instead, the information about each<BR>photographer is relegated to the back of the book, and again,<BR>is small and very difficult to read.<P>Additionally, I think the "Milk Collection" standing for<BR>moments, intimacy, laughter, and kinship is too confusing <BR>because of the current Milk Advertising Campaign When I first<BR>heard of this book, I thought it was affiliated with the milk<BR>ads. <P>The opening photo of new infant born still umbilically attached<BR>is frightful. This photo works much better showing the<BR>context of the 2 surgically attired attendants.<P>Redeeming this book are perhaps about ten really powerful,<BR>special photographs, but the overall design of the book does<BR>not enhance the images, it sorrowfully detracts from the flow<BR>and impact of those few very wonderful images.</span>

                    <span>This volume celebrates the family as humanity's fundamental unit. Think of the book as a family album for all of humanity, by capturing all of the wonderful and touching moments (including the sad ones) that make us all part of the human family. As such, the book reinforces love over prejudice related to surface differences, and a human focus over a political one. Some will be disturbed by the images of women nursing, and others will find the messages to be a little too political. All will enjoy the great photography. <P>The book's images include black-and-white and color photographs of pregnancy, birth, nursing, child care, smiles, twins, wonder, dads, carrying, hugging, hanging out, music, beaches, saying goodbye, kisses, marriage, dancing, festivals, conversations, love, grandparents, the aged, eating ice cream together, walking, and intergenerational connections. These themes are sometimes formally built up, and sometimes just carried on for two images or three. <P>Perhaps the most stunning two photographs are of Kim Phuc. She was the little girl in the famous 1972 photograph of napalm's horror. The other shot is of her holding her baby, Thomas, while revealing some of her napalm scars on her shoulder and back. She had never expected to marry and be a mother. Her happiness in motherhood is bound to bring tears to your eyes. <P>The book's captions are interesting. Before the frontispiece, they are just one word per image. In the rest of the book, you get one quote per image to help put the visual message in perspective. You can either read these or not. The book works well either way. <P>The opening essay will seem overly political to some. If it doesn't agree with your views, just skip it and go on to the photographs.<P>The essay has a number of key sentences that capture the book's overall feel. "These images speak to all of us with clarity, universality and . . . joy." "Family is the last and greatest discovery. It is our last miracle." You are encouraged to see this as a "family album." As you look at the images, you should "hear the sounds of hearts beating all across the world." "We have hope." "That kind of love, family love, makes us powerful beyond measure." "May your love, like these pictures, last forever." <P>The project itself (Moments of Intimacy, Laughter, and Kinship -- MILK for short) is worthy of comment. The organization ran a global competition to select these images. 17,000 photographers provided 40,000 images. From those, 100 photographers are represented here. I think this is a good model for how more photography and art books should be done. Obviously, you have to have a great screening committee and editor, but we should more often try to create the combined best of all people. Don't you agree? <P>As a result of the competition and fine editing, the works are truly wonderful in their emotional appeal, compositions, and diversity of themes and styles. No single photographer could ever have hoped to capture all of this. <P>If you like the book, I suggest that you give it as a wedding gift to those you know who would enjoy it. I can think of no better time to reintroduce the concept of family.<P>After you enjoy the book, may I suggest that take some time in the month ahead to experience the most meaningful images in the book that you have not done lately? When was the last time you held a newborn? . . . sat on a park bench eating ice cream with an aged relative? . . . carried a sick person? <P>Let the beauty of the experiences flow into you!<P></span>
