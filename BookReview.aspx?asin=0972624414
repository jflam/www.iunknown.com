Part of my life has been like a puzzle needing pieces, but I am understanding more about myself and my life everyday. This is my story..." <BR> So begins the honest, lyrical reflection of a pre-adolescent girl on what she knows of her adoption from China, and the strength she gains from her acceptance of her bittersweet experience.  <BR> The book addresses the underlying feelings and emotions that color the world of the China adoptee. At Home in This World effectively describes and empowers a young girl looking for acknowledgement, empathy and emotional validation. It also enables pre-teen readers to put their early lives into perspective, while emphasizing the supportive love that encircles them within their own families.  <BR> What is your life story? Everyone has a one, and with a little detective work you will be certain that no one has a life story as extraordinary as your own...</span>

                    <span>There are at least two things that make this book stand out from the growing field of literature about adoption from China: it is told from the perspective of a child, rather than an adult, and it takes into account the sad feelings, as well as the happy ones that we parents remember so well.<P>In her introduction, the author (a mother of two girls from China) describes how she first put together an adoption story that emphasized all the wonderful things about adoption including a "...baby-book heavy on adoption-day photographs." Then she realized that "The relentlessly positive spin I chose to put on my girls' pre-adoption birth story was confusing to my daughters, who recognized buried feelings that didn't always parallel mine." She found that she needed to address and legitimize these feelings. <P>This is not to say that the book is sad. The young narrator tries to make sense of why her birthparents would leave her, she wonders what they look like, she notes that she looks like a "confused little baby" in her adoption video, and she talks about early dreams she had of being lost after she went to sleep at night. She says "I understand all of these things in my head, but it is so much harder to understand in my heart." She concludes her story by saying that she is bringing her sides together ..."One girl from two places who is growing up to be at home in this big, wide world."<P>After the story, the author includes some information at questions that parents and children can discuss after they read the book.<P>The book is illustrated with charming watercolors by Qin Su, a native of China. They have a fresh, direct quality to them.<P>This belongs on adoptive parents' bookshelf along with Mommy Far, Mommy Near by Carol Antoinette Peacock and Kids Like Me in China by Yin Ying Fry.</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book, especially for pre-teen children who are just beginning to think more deeply about issues raised by international adoption. The watercolors are beautiful, the concept is excellent and the narrative well written and very strong. At Home in This World will help older children think about the issues surrounding their abandonment and adoption and may help many of them articulate their own ideas and feelings. I especially like that this story is told through the voice of an older child rather than an omniscient narrator or parent. It invites the reading child to identify with the narrator and leaves room for the child to spin the story as she wishes. An important contribution to the emerging literature written for internationally-adopted children.</span>

                    <span>I think the best way to share the impact of this book is to relate the following--after I read the book to my daughter, Jaclyn, who was adopted at the age of 4 from China, she silently cluctched the book to her chest and then placed it in the pile of "treasures" she has. Needless to say the book had a powerful impact. This book was very needed as there was truly a void in books that help the slightly older girls express "their" story. Jean did a fabulous job in doing this and in conveying, as part of the education guide, the importance of helping our kids relate and understand their stories. The book also has captivating photos and is truly a treasure!!! I can't recommend it highly enough.</span>

                    <span>From the moment my own adopted daughter said, "I don't look like anyone in my family", I realized again the importance of explaining her story in words that she could understand and take to heart. "At Home in this World" is the book that so many adoptive parents have been waiting for.....a story told in words that children can truly understand. The main character writes: "Part of my life has been like a puzzle needing pieces, but I am understanding more about myself and my life everyday." Our adopted children want this more than anything....to understand their stories and how their lives began. "At Home in this World" is the perfect book to help an adopted child know that there are others feeling the same way they are. It doesn't downplay the very real feelings that adoptees often have about not being able to know their birthparents or wishing they looked like their new family. It is honest and genuine. I found it to be a very empowering book for my daughter, showing her that it is okay to speak openly about the truth that she did indeed have a life before adoption. <P>After reading this book, my almost five year old daughter and I were in the car with a whole vanful of teens. My daughter turned to my son's friend and said, "see my brown eyes? My birthparents gave them to me." "At Home in this World" was an important book that helped show my daughter that she has her own story to tell, one that has both loss and joy, and one that she can indeed be proud to call her own. I can't recommend it more highly.</span>

                    <span>This is the book I've been waiting for. Jean MacLeod has so eloguently put to words the thoughts and feelings of my own daughters who were adopted from China. There has been a large void in the adoption book industry, but this book now fills it! Written in the first person, At Home In This World, is the narrative of a 9 year old girl who was adopted from China as an infant, trying now to make sense of her past, and to understand her feelings of the present. Just as my own daughters struggle to make sense of their lives from long ago in China, and now as part of our family, so does the child in this book. The author has normalized those feelings and thus helps the adopted girls of China to see that ALL their feelings about their journey are normal and perfectly fine to have. I love this book, and will buy a copy for both of my daughters. This is a book for them to treasure, and to someday share with their own children, as they describe the journey they have lived.</span>
