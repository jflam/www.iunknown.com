                    <span>This is a great book. I rarely give a book 5 stars, but this one has earned it.<P>The author's technical and standards body background is a tremendous help in helping the reader sort out the substance from the hype. This book covers XML and cryptography basics, DTDs, XML Schema, XML digital signatures and encryption, and SOAP.<P>I like the author's comparisons of XML with other encoding schemes, particularly ASN.1 DER which is prevalent in the security standards world. <P>Also helpful are the author's "soapbox" comments, which handily dispel the notion that you should accept all parts of a standard as the absolute truth and the final word. For example, "X.500 identities are baroque hierarchical names in which each level of the hierarchy consists of an arbitrary, unordered set of attribute-value pairs. They are just one of the complexities and false assumptions (such as the assumption that everyone would allow themselves to be listed in one global public directory, including companies listing all their employees) that doomed the X.500 Directory as originally conceived". I love it!<P>You'd be hard pressed to go wrong with this book.</span>

                    <span>Collaboratively written by Donald Eastlake (Co-chair of the joint IETF/W3C XML Digital Signature working group) and freelance technical writer Kitty Niles, Secure XML: The New Syntax for Signatures and Encryption is a solid, accessible, step-by-step guide to the processes for encrypting and ensuring security of XML applications. Individual chapters competently address canonicalization and authentication, encryption, cryptographic and non-cryptographic algorithms, and much, much more. Highly recommended for advanced XML users, Secure XML is a comprehensive, technically proficient, and detailed instructional resource and reference filled from cover to cover with extensive discussion and practical examples.</span>

                    <span>Suppose you have XML data that you want to regularly<BR>send to Bob, across the Internet. But it is of a<BR>confidential nature, so you don't want to send it as<BR>plaintext. Well, you can try using low level<BR>encryptions, like SSL or TLS. But these don't give any<BR>authentication, ie. Bob can't tell that you actually<BR>sent them. Also, once Bob gets the messages, they are<BR>all in plaintext, so he can't easily protect these<BR>against others, if he is on a multiuser computer.<P>One answer is to incorporate encryption into XML, by<BR>defining cryptographic standards that sit atop XML,<BR>and generate XML documents with encrypted data. These<BR>let you and Bob use powerful XML-based routines like<BR>XPath, XLink and XPointer. Plus, you can now do things<BR>like append your digital signature to your plaintext<BR>file, encrypt the combination with Bob's public key,<BR>and get a resultant XML document that you can send<BR>Bob. Upon receipt, he can decrypt it and verify that<BR>you are the author, all the while dealing with XML<BR>documents.<P>This book explains the emerging XML standards that<BR>make this possible. They discuss at a high level the<BR>various cryptographic algorithms, like AES [Advanced<BR>Encryption Standard], Diffie-Hellman and MD5. Little<BR>mathematics is needed, as they leave the mechanics of<BR>the algorithms to other books. Instead, they describe<BR>the XML infrastructure that uses these.<P>The book has a necessarily comprehensive description<BR>of canonicalisation; which refers to the rewriting of<BR>an XML document in a standard form, prior to<BR>encryption. Otherwise two semantically identical<BR>documents would give different ciphertexts, which is<BR>confusing.<P>If you have been wondering if you should encrypt your<BR>XML documents, and how to do so, this book may clarify<BR>many issues.</span>

                    <span>When you read the XML specification, you will notice that it contains no notion of security. Critical security functionalities such as encryption, digital signatures, and authentication are simply not part of the XML standard. XML is similar to many other protocols, languages, and operating systems in that it was originally developed without any thought to security and privacy. It is only after serious security vulnerabilities are discovered and publicized that they are patched. But this find, patch, fix mentality of information security is dangerous in that security problems can exist for months or years before they are found.<P>Similarly within XML, much of the security functionality has been added post- facto, namely in Canonical XML, XML Signature, and XML Encryption Syntax and Processing. By adding security to the core feature set of XML, the W3C has ensured that,<BR>to a degree, the find, patch, fix method won't be the manner in which XML security is developed. A good reference book can help you navigate this XML security landscape. <P>Topics such as authentication, encryption, XML signatures, algorithms, and keying are discussed. For the most part, the bulk of XML security is covered.<P>Donald Eastlake, the lead author of Secure XML: The New Syntax for Signatures and Encryption, is the co-chairman of the joint IETF/W3C XML Digital Signature working group, a member of the W3C Encryption and W3C XML Key Management System working groups, and co-author of the XML Digital Signature, XML Encryption, and XML Exclusive Canonicalization standards. It is clear that Eastlake lives and breathes XML. As Eastlake is a writer of numerous W3C XML standards, and standards are often written in a terse and abstract manner; his book has a slightly stiffer writing style than XML Security. If you can get over this style, you can appreciate the comprehensive and uthoritative look at XML the book provides from one of the key architects of the syntax. <P>Secure XML covers and details every XML security feature. Also, it spends a lot of time giving examples of syntax and language use. This is especially so in chapter 9, XML Canonicalization - The Key to Robustness. Canonicalization is the extraction of the standard form of some data and the discarding of insignificant aspects of the data's surface representations. The book notes that getting the right canonicalization is one of the most important, yet difficult aspects of digital authentication within XML. Chapter 10 goes into great detail about XML signatures and authentication. The chapter gives numerous code examples of various contexts, schemas, and elements that readers can use on their own XML servers. Chapter 10 also has numerous notes and historical information about XML security with information that can't be found elsewhere.</span>
