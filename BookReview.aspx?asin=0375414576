                <span id="Label1">An exhaustive, soul-searching memoir, Bill Clinton's <i>My Life</i> is a refreshingly candid look at the former president as a son, brother, teacher, father, husband, and public figure. Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a "vast right-wing operation" determined to destroy him, and the "morally indefensible" acts for which he was nearly impeached. <i>My Life</i> is autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons.  <P>Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makes <i>My Life</i> remarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice:  <P><blockquote>I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain.</blockquote>  <P>However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion and <i>Kitchen Confidential</i>-type revelations about "what it is like to be President" make <i>My Life</i> impossible to put down.  <P>To Clinton, "politics is a contact sport," and while he claims that <i>My Life</i> is not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to "take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could." While <i>My Life</i> is primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose "mindless search for scandal" protected the guilty while "persecuting the innocent" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed.  <P>At its core, <i>My Life</i> is a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to "drain the most out of every moment" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></span>

                    <span>"I will study and get ready, and perhaps my chance will come." -with these words referring to how that encounter with President Kennedy affected him, William Jefferson Clinton starts the exposition on his life's work.
<br />
<br />The books reads like a diary from Clinton's boyhood to right after leaving office, having served the maximum term for a US President. Clinton's recall of past friends/acquaintances is quite photographic - it seems he already knew that he would become important enough to publish his own memoir and needed to remember names.
<br />
<br />Quite interesting is his evolving campaign strategies that took him from attorney general to Arkansas governor and eventually to President. In this field, Clinton has no peer. In fact, he frets more about his political mistakes like the car plate tax that cost him reelection as a governor, than his personal failings(the Lewinsky affair was treated more as a political failing than a personal one). Much vitrole is of course reserved for Ken Starr - the independent prosecutor whose appointment he approved to his deep regret. 
<br />
<br />All in all, the book is saved by its subject as it tends to drone towards the end. The reader has to labor just to get a few morsels of information but it's worth the effort. His insights on his successor proved to be prescient. Also pertinent are his thoughts on "Black Hawk Down" in Mogandishu, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Bush vs Gore. 
<br />
<br />In the end, people would want to know what the first Baby Boomer president thinks and stays with him till the end of his story.</span>

                    <span>I am not particularly a fan of politically based biographies/autobiographies, but I was interested in understanding Bill Clinton's take on Bill Clinton. 
<br />
<br />Approximately the first half of My Life is very interesting. It details President Clinton's boyhood and his journey into politics. 
<br />
<br />The second half of the book is more difficult to read. It reminded me of the sections in the Bible with all the "begats". I imagine that President Clinton wrote the last part of the book directly from his journal notes. This section of the book would probably be very interesting to political and history buffs, however. 
<br />
<br />My Life was very easy to read initially, but took perseverance to finish. You will definitely feel a sense of accomplishment when you DO finish reading this book. </span>

                    <span>No wonder William Jefferson Clinton was a two-term president. In his book, MY LIFE, Clinton proves himself a spell-binding storyteller whose love of the spotlight, combined with great political instincts, propelled AND has kept him in the national spotlight for so long.
<br />
<br />Early on, it's obvious that Clinton is an intellectual heavyweight with enough southern charm and charisma to make the combination almost lethal to anyone who ran against him.  
<br />
<br />It's rare that someone this bright and insightful enters politics . . .and even with his self-confessed shortcomings and many lapses in judgment regarding his personal life, I have no doubt that this country was in good hands during Clinton's two terms.
<br />
<br />No matter what your politics or personal feelings about one of the most polarizing figures of recent times, after listening to MY LIFE, you cannot help but admit that the man is a master of the game called politics and we'll not see his like again soon.
<br />
<br />Enjoy!  </span>

                    <span>I was going to wait until I finished reading this book to review it, but honestly, I can't make myself read another page.  I'm about 2/3 of the way through it and that's as far as I'm going.  If I was writing a term paper on Clinton's politics I would find this book a valuable tool.  It's a very descriptive factual log of events having to do with and leading up to Bill Clinton's polictical career, but this book is sadly, short on heart, due partly to a lack of all but the most basic information about Clinton's personal life and also partly due to the drawn-out devotion to the minutest of details and the straight, whole truth and nothing but the truth facts.  It's simply not fun to read, even being a big fan of his.  Now, I know that this book is about a politician, and is going to be about politics.  I find politics in general an interesting topic, but I thought this book would be about Clinton's life (see the title), not simply Cinton's career.  I always liked him because he seemed so friendly and real.  This memoir, on the other hand, seems more like a stark textbook.  
<br />
<br />I also was annoyed numerous times during the "story," by the feeling that Bill Clinton was using the text of his book to deliver personal messages to oh-so-many individual people who he met and knew throughout his life.  Like, to let them know he remembered and appreciated them, and to give them a pat on the back by mentioning their first and last names in his book. I wouldn't have been surprised to turn a page and find an account of all the passengers he ever flew with on Air Force One, and then if he had mentioned the names of a few of their kids for no apparent reason, that would also have fit right in with the style of this book.  But to the rest of us reading who are not one of those hundreds of people who got to be mentioned in a president's memoir, it made for a boring and dissapointing read.
