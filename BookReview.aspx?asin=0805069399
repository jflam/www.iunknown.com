                    <span>Robert J. Remini may be the most qualified author in the entire American Presidents Series. Remini is the leading expert on Andrew Jackson and Adams was president in the Jackson era, having been elected by defeating Jackson and then, losing his bid for re-election against Jackson. I was taken by the parallels between the Adams dynasty and the Bush dynasty. Both John Adams and George Bush were elected president after serving as vice president to a popular president. Both lost their bids for re-election. The son of both had the same first name but was known by a middle name; John Quincy Adams and George W. Bush. Both of the sons were elected in very controversial elections in which they lost the popular vote. Indeed, Adams was elected by the House of Representatives after getting Henry Clay's support in what was described as a "corrupt bargain" by Jackson's supporters. Bush's re-election broke the pattern of similarities since Adams, like his father, was a one term president.
<br />
<br />Remini examines Adams' early life and notes that he was dominated by his mother, Abigail Adams. Her pressure lead him to become well educated and a perfectionist. He traveled to France with his father when the elder Adams was minister to France and he was educated there and became fluent in French. In raising his own three sons, he had very stern expectations of them and all three were disappointments to him. His pre-presidential career included a very solid term as secretary of state under James Monroe.
<br />
<br />After losing his bid for re-election, Adams served in the House of Representatives and had a long, distinguished post presidential career. He was a staunch opponent of slavery and like his father, but unlike most other presidents up to his time, he never owned a slave. In a famous trial involving slaves who revolted on the slave ship Amistad, Adams was the attorney who defended them.
<br />
<br />Today, we often get the feeling that politics has sunk to new lows of negative campaigning. However, the campaigns of Jackson against Adams were as dirty as they get. Adams was accused of arranging sexual favors for foreign diplomats in treaty negotiations and was labeled a pimp. Jackson married a woman who was believed to be divorced but, it turned out her divorce had not been final. When the error was discovered, Jackson and his wife corrected it and renewed their vows. This did not stop Adams' supporters from having a field day making vile attacks against Jackson and his wife, and labeling Jackson's offspring as illigitimate. Today's campaigns are relatively tame.
<br />
<br />Remini is a great scholar who has written extensively about Jackson. Here, in this short book, he has written another fine biography. I recommend this book in particular and the other books in the presidential series in general.

                    <span>Referring to Marshall Newman's review.  The Macaulay that JQA read and Remini mentions was Catherine Macaulay (1731-1791), an historian and a distant relative of T.B. Macaulay (1800-1859).</span>

                    <span>This is one of the few, possibly the only, early American President I am aware of who is consistently treated poorly by historians. It is almost like there is some unspoken conspiracy to paint the man as some kind of slacker. The closest we can come to this kind of consensual disapproval is how the American press treated Gerald Ford's athleticism. In Ford's case, this former center for the University of Michigan football team, an excellent recreational skier and a man who consistently shot golf in the low 70's was treated as an uncoordinated clod, who could not put one foot in front of another. Something similar is going on with the depiction of JQA.<p>Independent of his parents in Europe for 6 years, much of that time by his own choice, his biographers treat him as a mama's boy. That's right, the same man who undertook his first diplomatic mission for the United States at age 14! And it goes down hill from there. <p>Incredible successes as Secretary of State under James Monroe are glossed over, a Presidential vision for America that was the equal of Washington, Adams (his father), Jefferson, Madison and Monroe's combined, formulator of the Monroe Doctrine, extender of the Continental limits of the United States from sea to sea, ardent abolitionist who fought the Gag Rule in the House of Representatives for 9 years (that's right, he defends our most fundamental of freedoms, freedom of speech, and during a 9 year Congressional battle, defeats those who would have suppressed this freedom within our own Congress), founder of the Smithsonian, the list of this man's unbelievable accomplishments goes on and on.<p>Professor Remini should be embarrassed for this mediocre effort. Was JQA stiff, prickly and unyielding? Of  course he was. Was he obstinate, arrogant and difficult? Again JQA is guilty. But after his outstanding works on Jackson, Webster, and Clay for Professor Remini to simply repeat Nagel's poor work and not take the time and opportunity to fairly and accurately report on this man's life accomplishments has got to be some form of academic bankruptcy. This book is only 155 pages long. And those pages are small. That should tell you something. Save your money.</span>

                    <span>Full disclosure.  John Quincy Adams is one of my heroes.  I eagerly  grabbed this book but almost didn't finish it.  The strong later chapters which effectively describe the Adams election, administration and later time in congress are paid for by a load of psycoanalisys of Abagail Adams, John Quincy to the point where the reader just wants to say ENOUGH!<p>When the writer calls Adams is a poor father and follows it up with a description of him informing his sons they should work hard, avoid drinking, and  follow religion I must conclude that he doesn't want me raising children either.  When he lambasts Adams for wanting to raise his sone the way he was raised saying that he should know better, he ignores that the method used produced one of the greatest statemen in the history of this country.<p>Later on it gets better the author rightly hits Adams as a poor pol but extols the virtues of his honesty and single minded devotion to what he believed was right.  His chapters on Adams vision and his fight against the gag rule are great reading as are  all chapters from the point that Adams serves in the Monroe administration.<p>The author's bias' are plain and the lens that he sees Adams life is apparent to any reader, but that lens can't cloud the life of the man, it can only make reading this story an annoyance for a time.<p>I suggest going right to 1816 and reading from there.  The book is worth reading but it was enough to convince me that I would avoid this author in the future.</span>

                    <span>Remini writes well but can be a little dry in places, so be warned. He does spend adequate time reflecting upon JQA's prodigious intellect. It's a matter of debate who was our most intelligent President: Lincoln, Madison and Jefferson would certainly garner their share of votes. But John Quincy Adams warrants serious consideration: he was an intellectual titan with an astounding breadth of intellect. He was impossibly well-read, sober, amazingly articulate with a rapier-like ability to demolish opponents or defend his position. It's debatable whether he was, in fact, America's most brilliant President, but this book goes a long way in making that case.<p>Remini wisely delves into Adams' private side and quotes extensively from his own words. If you are looking for a glum recitation of Adams' political life, look elsewhere, this is a more human biography. There was a refreshing amount of material focusing on Adams' boyhood, and the chapters covering his Congressional years are especially interesting. His story reads like something from a novel: failed President transformed into one of the most influential Congressmen who ever serve in the House.<p>My only minor criticism is that Remini does not sufficiently explore or explain Adams' brilliant son, Henry, who grew up to be a caustic and clever chronicler of the late 10th century. Otherwise, this is a solid book, well-written, thoroughly researched and illuminating.</span>
