                    <span>The man behind this book, Peter Thomson, really uses all the techniques mentioned in this book.   I know because I've been lucky enough to meet him.   He is a big, tall man who people quickly warm to because of his inherent `presence'.   He naturally has a commanding air about him, which lends itself very well to his profession of speaking at seminars.   Peter is very adept at knowing when to pause, when to speak and what to say to provoke `active' thought and `active listening'.   He's also very tuned in to his audience, and can turn around a topical answer on the spot.    <p>This book is a very comprehensive and gives fully explained examples of how to use the many different communication techniques available to all of us.   It's true to say that the methods and ideas in the book are not so much secrets, as mysteries to most people.   And that's why until they are fully explained and broken down into chunks of information, with such clarity and insight by the author, it is normally challenging to comprehend many of them.      <p>I think beginners would probably feel more confident reading one chapter at a time and practising some of the techniques before using them `live'.    The more competent communicators amongst you would certainly have no problems using the methods `live' first time.    It is an unequivocal fact that everyone can certainly learn something new.   You will also find it very useful to re-visit the book, time after time, especially as your confidence grows.   You will come up with new thoughts and new ideas to try out.    After all, Peter has been doing this for over twenty years and he still manages to keep his ideas fresh and up to date!</span>
