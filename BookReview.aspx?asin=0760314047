                <span id="Label1">This is an introduction into what it really means to be a U.S. Navy SEAL in today's U.S. Navy-in the sea, in the air, and on the land. The U.S. Navy's elite specialists are among the most highly trained forces capable of undertaking dangerous missions into enemy territory. Hollenbeck takes you through the relentless twenty-five week training, including "hell" week, when soldiers are put through five days of training with fewer than 4 hours of sleep.</span>

                    <span>If you're a SEAL fan and have read The Warrior Elite then this is a great companion to the book. It's not a book you read though - this one's all photos and a bit of text. The pictures of SEAL training are the best, actually, I know of NO OTHER book that has as many pics of BUD/S training. You see all the pics of what Dick Couch wrote about in Warrior Elite. Funny thing is that you see the guys from that BUD/S class because their names are written on their clothes but the author makes absolutely no mention of the people in the photos. <P>Another reviewer said the pics were "old and outdated." What?! They're all the pics that were NOT used in Couch's book and are from one of the latest BUD/S classes, the class that Couch wrote about. Couch's Warrior Elite isn't a picture book - this one is and it's great.</span>

                    <span>Very disappointed.<P>This book appears to have been thrown together very quickly. I read the Warrior Elite and really enjoyed it. My hopes were similar for the latest Couch book about BUD/S. Instead of giving the reader current pictures from BUD/S classes Couch reused pictures from his Warrior Elite book. The pictures are old and outdated. <P>Worst of all, reading To Be a Navy SEAL gave me an uncomfortable sense of Deja Vu. Reason being most of the text was "cut and pasted" from the Warrior Elite.<P>Read the Warrior Elite. Don't waste your time and money on this rude afterthought of a project.</span>

                    <span>Finally, a complete book on Navy SEAL basic training. More than stories from bystanders, this book has pictures of everything a potential SEAL goes through. Somehow, it seems more real this way. Good job by the authors.</span>
