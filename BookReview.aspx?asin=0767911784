                    <span>This is the book counterpart of a video reconstruction.  As best I can tell from the extensive endnotes, the author did a phenomenal research job, and then (from my point of view) turned his work into fiction.  Instead of presenting us with the facts (fascinating in themselves) the author presents everything "through the eyes" of the participants, pretenting to be in their thoughts, and using quotation marks with the abandon of a novelist.  We all know that this is just plain made up, but by using this form of presentation, the author blurs the distinction between fact and fiction.  He DOESN'T know what these people were thinking, and making it up implies that he does; requiring me to search the footnotes at the end of each sentence -- what is true and what is made up? For example, on the first page we follow Ken Lay's thoughts as he is driven to work -- the footnote shows us the source for what kind of car it was -- but of course no reference for Lay's thoughts (and even if Lay had said what he was thinking, we have know knowledge that he told the truth).  Accordingly, although the book is entertaining, I demote it to a "2" for horrendously bad journalistic practice.</span>

                    <span>I'm certain that all of us like to read a good book. One filled with intrigue, deceit, back-stabbing, illegal acts, social issues, fear, egos, greed, scandals,etc.
<br /> 
<br />All the ingredients of an interesting novel. Only it's not. It is the true story of  ENRON's humble pipeline beginnings to its bankruptcy and the saga of a hidden but eventually disclosed paper trail.
<br /> 
<br />The book---"Conspiracy of Fools" by Kurt Eichenwald.
<br /> 
<br />Notwithstanding the complicated financial transactions involved, it is written in a fast moving manner by a winning New York Times writer</span>

                    <span>Everyone knows the Enron scandal.  The directors of the corporation have been depicted as nothing less than caricatures of corporate greed and the company itself a cliche of managers run amok.
<br />
<br />This book ends all that.  It brings dimension and personality to everyone involved and does justice to the events that transpire in a very evenhanded way.  The "fly on the wall" narrative and the incredulous attitude of the author constantly ask the question we all wanted to ask right from the start: "What were they thinking?"  Even moreso, a corollary becomes "Why did everyone else just let it happen?"  Hard to believe, but the problems of Enron could have been predicted back in the early 90s.
<br />
<br />This is a top-notch book and worth every penny.  Its not particularly difficult to comprehend (the dialogue and complex schemes are broken down for laymen to understand), and believe it or not, its a quick read. Once it absorbs you, you just won't put it down.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in three days.  I have a two year old to chase around, so that tells you just how much time I devoted to finishing it.  COF reads like a thriller.  I kept waiting for the bad guys to get caught and became more and more incredulous that it took so long. 
<br />
<br />COF does an excellent job of showing what a dangerous combination greed, hubris and ignorance is and how prevelant it is in corporate America.  Throw in a dash of politics and you have a national scandal.  
<br />
<br />Eichenwald does a good job of showing us all the nuances of what happened at the executive level of Enron, but I was disapointed that we never got to see any of it from the perspective of the thousands of employees that woke up one morning without jobs or retirement funds.  We also never see the impact of Enron's fall on the varous companies and local governments that invested so heavily in them.
<br />
<br />My last "complaint" is a silly one.  There were no pictures of the principals featured in the book, which is pretty standard for non-fiction stories.  I wanted to know what Lay, Skilling and the rest looked like so I could put faces with names.
<br />
<br />Overall, well worth the read if you want some suspense and/or an insight into just what went wrong at Enron. </span>

                    <span>I never thought I would like to read an Enron book, but my father really pushed this on me. I LOVED it. This is the best book I have read in years, certainly since A Civil Action. It is thrilling, unbelievable, captivating. I am up late writing this because the book kept me up until 3 and now I am having trouble not thinking about it. Unlike other books of this type, the research is incredible. Anyone who reads it has to thumb through the footnotes, and see all of the documents and other information that Eichenwald pulled together. A fabulous reporter and a spectacular writer all add up to a great book. </span>
