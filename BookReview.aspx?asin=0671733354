                    <span>I am in the midst of this fine book and irregardless of when it was written,in this case after WW11, the human condition then and now is the same....situations vary but people's emotional health and the effects of negative thinking and worrying stay the same...this book draws on ancient wisdom peppered with the wisdom of it's age that is still and will always be relevant as long as people don't accept change and the need for rolling with the punches.
<br />Drawing on Biblical,Eastern,Western,Capitalist and known personalities of the day, Carnegie in a very readable way convey's the Power Of Now..he weaves a web that is recognizable by all.
<br />What especially amazes me is the regard he has for William James, America's foremost psychologist (debatable) whose ideas influence current Buddhist and Existential psychoanalysis in what can be called the spiritual growth movement.
<br />There is a time tested simplicity here that needs to be embraced by all despite the complexity of the current post Holocaust world.
<br />Full of quotes and stories, it's message of control what you can and leave something for G-D to worry about allows one to defeat existential despair embracing day to day meaning while living with the unknown quantity in all human life.

                    <span>Mr. Carnegie's books are timeless. "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" began changing my life many years ago. Taking Mr. Carnegie's advice, I have reread it several times since then and am better for it. Worry, like many chronic problems, can jump back out at you when you feel as if you've already beaten it. This book allows the reader to return to it again and again. It acts like a family member or a close friend-always ready to give you some perspective or to remind you of what's important. 
<br />This book offers concrete and practical things that can help the reader escape from the destructive pattern of worry. There is no author or self-help guru out there who can provide you with a more natural or common sense approach to this issue. James Green, author of "If There's One Thing I've Learned."</span>

                    <span>I have had this book for years and can honestly say that is probably one of the best self-improvement books on the market today.  The book is peppered with stories of individuals who overcame tremendous struggles and angst.  Some of the stories are a bit outdated and hokey, but if you can get past that, the informational content still holds true for today.  Each chapter contains practical bullet point info that anyone can use and the chapters are summarized at the end to re-iterate the main points covered.   This is an invaluable guide for those of you who are ready to start living a worry free life.  Worth purchasing for your home library and would be an excellent gift for a friend or family member.  Also worth considering would be the audio version of this book.  </span>

                    <span>I have just completed reading this book and I'm amazed that the press of life causes me to worry to death about things that are only fleeting, at best.  This is a wonderful book to get you back to some balance in your life.  I will reread it again to pick-up on principles that I may have missed in the first reading.  This is one of those books that make you say, "I wish I could read this again for the first time."  It makes you want to change your bad habits.</span>

                    <span>Yes, this book will change your life.  I believe that it is the best book since the Bible.  I have bought it a number of times, and given it to people.  I have several copies right now.  My first one was so long ago that it only cost 35 cents!  Even if you only read the first 50 pages it will tremendously improve your life.  It is worth many times its purchase price.  The information in every chapter is like going to a therapist.  You will say, "why didn't I know that before?"  Click on it right now and buy it before you miss out on this opportunity for a new and much better life from the day that you start to read it.  I have no financial interest in this book and don't know the author personally.  I just love the book because it has done so much for me.  I have recommended it to many people and I have even given talks about this book to groups to which I belong.</span>
