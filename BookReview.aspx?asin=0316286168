                    <span>Flexner writes a balanced biography, something that not all Washington scholars have done.  He is clear about Washington's failings, but he also is not embarrassed to discuss his amazing strength of character and great achievements.
<br />
<br />On occasion one could tell that the book was condensed from a multi-volume work work as Flexner summarized points instead of relating things in detail.  Also, there are no footnotes and only a brief bibliographical essay, so one really can't tell where he got his information without going to the larger work.  But overall, it was a pleasure to read and very informative.
<br />
<br />I would have liked to see more about Washington's faith, as it seems to have been very important to him.  Some authors talk about nothing but Washington's faith, which seems to me to miss the point of explaining the totality of his life and career. But  almost to ignore isn't good either.
<br />
<br />Flexner does an excellent job explaining why Washington was so important to colonial and post-revolutionary America, which is what makes this book worth reading.  He also does a marvelous job showing how Washington learned from his mistakes and gained experience in politics and combat well into his 40s.  </span>

                    <span>Flexner's vast research and delightful prose make this the best Washington biography I've ever read (and am likely ever to read).</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The biggest problem I had chosing to read this book was deciding to read this or Joseph Ellis' book on George Washington.  I have a feeling that the Ellis book was more insightful and provocative (as was "American Sphinx", about Thomas Jefferson), though I chose this book because the author had previously written what is considered the gold-standard, highly acclaimed, 4 volume work on George Washington, and this book was slightly longer, 400 pages vs 250 pages.  The Flexner book is 35 years old, however, as opposed to the Ellis's book, which is brand new, but I don't think this made a difference.
<br />
<br />Regardless, the book reads like butter (unlike Chernow's Hamilton), covers a lot of information, integrates lots of primary source quotes well, and does a good job of providing background material against which to understand Washington.  You should know that Flexner states in the introduction that this book is not just a patchwork, rehash of his 4 volume opus, but a total re-write.  And that is what I perceived.  [As an aside, you may want to download Washington's Farewell Address from the internet, it's about 8 pages long.  There is a whole chapter on it in the book, but the text of the Address does not appear.]
<br />
<br />The "problem" with writing a "complete" biography about Washington is that there is so much information on him.   For between 25 and 40 years, Washington was the most important political figure in the colonies and the United States, so doing an all-inclusive biography on Washington in one volume and making it meaningful (not just a bunch of hackneyed summaries) and full of primary source material is difficult.  In this regard you couldn't ask for a better book to read than Flexner's.  
<br />
<br />Furthermore, competing texts on Washington by good authors, who have done thier own research and drawn their own conclusions, will likely cover many different aspects and details.  Ellis's and Flexner's books probably complement each other.
<br />
<br />The Founding Father's and the creation of the United States is an absolutely fascinating and relevent topic.  This is the seventh major book/biography I've read in this topic in the past year.  </span>

                    <span>This book reads as if it was a term paper for a high school sophomore.  After reading Adams by McCullough and Jefferson by Ellis, this book was so bad that I ended up pulling my bookmark and leaving in on my return flight from Vegas.  Skip this poorly wirtten book and get the Washington biography by Ellis.</span>

                    <span>Since I did not read the original four-volume biography, I do not know what material was not used in the condensed single volume.  However, in my humble opinion, the single volume is a good read.
<br />
<br />The narrative of Washington's life is smooth reading - chapters were often less than 10 pages and dealt with only one theme in Washington's life rather than the 30-40 page chapters dealing with a variety of issues seen in other biographies.  Sometimes I find lengthy chapters to be distracting.
<br />
<br />Particularly enjoyable were the narratives of:  Washington's early life, French and Indian War service, Revolutionary War service, life with Martha Washington and her children, and military/political relationships with other famous figures of his day.  Since I am an ex-military officer and am not a political junkie, the military aspects of the biography more interesting than the political narratives.  I gained a greater appreciation of Washington went through to lead the colonies to victory in the Revolutionary War and the intense political pressures he experienced during the war and his presidency.  Reading on how he endured and stood strong only increased my respect for the man.
<br />
<br />Whether a high school/college student, history buff, biography fan, you will enjoy reading this condensed biography of our first president.  The book manages to include many details of Washington's life and avoids becoming a dry read.
<br />
<br />Read and enjoy, highly recommended!</span>
