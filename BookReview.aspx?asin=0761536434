                    <span>This book is really amazing, a must read for videogames fan or not. Talks its history since the first pinball machines that leads to the videogames industry, from Pong to GTA...
<br />I only don't give 5 stars because it don't have much photos...I really don't want a kid book, but adding photos in a book like this is essential because not all the people knows how the machines looked liked on the past.
<br />This problem can be solved by buying the package listed below with The Illustrated History by Russel Demaria and Johny Wilson...
<br />Thanks Steve L. Kent for this great book and I am waiting the next edition, since the Xbox is only mentioned, without a big cover... </span>

                    <span>Video games have been an industry that has gotten more than it's fair share of flack. "They cause lazyness, truency, they are violent, etc." The thing people forget though is that video games are FUN. The industry itself has become a mammoth, racking in millions and joining the film and music industries as one of the big players in the entertainment business. The book is a big, retrospective analysis of the history of electronic games, from there humble beginnings at M.I.T. to the contributions by the "video pioneers" Nolan Bushnell and Ralph Baer. The book highlights some of notable points in the ride, such as:
<br />-The pinball business and how the success of pinball in the 70's made way to the transition of video arcades.
<br />-"Pong" and how it's success broke the initial game installed at a bar in California due to coin overflow by the games popularity.
<br />-The yen shortage in Japan caused by "Space Invaders"
<br />-Atari, how it was the fatest growing company in the world, and became an arcade giant and the first successful home system company despite Nolan Bushnells liberal views on running a business (whirlpool board meetings, pot-smoking employees, a beer keg in his office)
<br />-The food that inspired Pac-Man, the greatest video game of all time.
<br />-The Golden Age of video games in the 80's, followed by the "video game depression" in 1983.
<br />-PC computers and the games created for them (Commodore, Apple, Amiga, etc.)
<br />-Nintendo, the game that saved the company, and how it brought back video games in the mid 80's with the NES, a robot, a toy gun, and a game with the main character named after the company landlord.
<br />-The Nintendo/Sega war during the 90's
<br />-The creation of the ratings board for video games due to games such as "Mortal Kombat".
<br />-The new generation of video game systems with the X-box and Playstation systems.
<br />-Many of the lawsuits and influential court cases caused by video games (ex. Tetris, Game Genie, etc.)
<br />
<br />This book is a ton of fun to read, and with many interviews with some of the best in the business, it's a book that is also informative. Bravo Steve Kent on a job well done!</span>

                    <span>In many ways, this book may be misrepresented to people.  Its not simply "hey, remember how awesome this game was?" type of book, nor does it look at games from a technical side (though technology is featured at times).  This is more to do with the social impact of games.  As such, it does not spend excessive time on the failed consoles, or failed games (though the exception can be made for the Atari-buster known as E.T.).
<br />Its a very useful book, I'm using it for a college class!  Its probably the first 'text book' i'll actually look forward to keeping!  The book is about as comprehinsive as one volume can be (and obviously, books like High Score and Game Over will complement this book).  It is comprehensive, and exhaustive, as there are many excerpts from the people that made the games, and changed the world of home entertainment.  A great book, when teamed up with a personal history of video games, this can shed some light on the people and events behind the games.</span>

                    <span>This comprehensive book covers the entire history of video games, from the first pinball machines right up to before the launch of the Gamecube and Xbox.  Telling the story from the viewpoints of the people who actually made the games happen, this book gives gamers and non-gamers alike a better appreciation of video games and the changes that they have brought to the world, even when they weren't for the better.  Strongly recommended.  I hope there will be an expansion pack someday.</span>
