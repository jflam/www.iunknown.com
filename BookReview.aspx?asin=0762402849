                    <span>I am a resident of New York and I have a few posters of the skyline of the city. However, after 9/11 I wanted more pictures. I've been to all of the tourist attractions and places in The City that are not so well known. This book does a good job showing the main attractions and the most famous landmarks while including some scenes that capture the typical New York. For example, there is one shot of midtown traffic (not a specific landmark, but typical of life in The City). Because New York City has so many landmarks and sights to see, it is difficult to capture all of them in a book. This book does a good job of showing the most important sights of The City from multiple and unique angles. <P>However, some of the pictures are disappointing. Specifically, pictures of Times Square are about 8-10 years old and it has changed significantly in that time. It was always full of billboards and advertisements, but now it is so much brighter and greater now than the way it was portrayed in the pictures. I had also expected more written information from the book about the sights. Lastly, some pictures only show parts of some of the buildings, like the public library.<P>Overall I have a very favorable impression of the book. The pictures are good and that's most important. Despite the afore mentioned weaknesses I recommend this book as a picture book of NYC especially in light of the price. The book was definitely worth what I paid for it. I would also recommend this book for people who have never been to NYC.</span>

                    <span>New York is always refered to as a tourist attraction for the United States. I have never been to this city but i've always wondered what it really looked like. Sure they show the skyline on certain television shows but they never get in-depth the way the photographer has. The book captured New York's beautiful attractions and I begun to wish i lived in NYC . I was informed intelligently on everything that the book had a picture of. As an added bonus the pictures were of very high quality.</span>
