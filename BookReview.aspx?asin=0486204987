                    <span>A good puzzle is much like a classic novel. You read it and then after a certain period of time, you can read it again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. These puzzles of Sam Loyd, which were published over a century ago, stretch the brain cells as much now as they did when they dazzled the people of a younger country.<br>   The problems follow very standard themes. Having read many puzzle books, I recognized the form of all of the puzzles in this one. However, they are so well stated that reading them is a significant part of the fun. It is also an interesting piece of historical perspective that puzzles were also a very popular staple in newspapers over a century ago. Reading the puzzles and looking at the diagrams also takes you back to a different age. Some of the caricatures of the figures could not be used in the politically correct atmosphere of today. It also seems most unlikely that a problem involving nuns being abducted by soldiers would be published in a modern newspaper. Therefore, it is necessary to cut a little historical slack when you read the book.<br>  Sam Loyd was the best puzzlist that America has ever had. The only possible challenger is the editor of this collection, which is most fitting. I enjoyed the book immensely, even though I was in most cases rereading rather than solving for the first time.</span>
