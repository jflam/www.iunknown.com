                <span id="Label1">The Human Genome Project has revealed that we possess a surprisingly  small number of genes, especially in light of our fairly complex bodies.  In <I>The Birth of the Mind</I>, NYU psychology professor Gary Marcus  brings together current research on how our genetic code assembles that  most mysterious physiological structure, the brain. Readers fascinated  by the works of Steven Pinker and other mind theorists will be  fascinated by Marcus' descriptions of strange--and sometimes  disturbing--sensory experiments carried out on chimps, ferrets, and  kittens that show how the brain organizes itself in the presence or  absence of external stimuli. Further, Marcus writes that there's nothing  particularly special about how the brain is built and maintained.<p>  <blockquote>What's amazing is how little of the overall scheme for  embryonic development is special to the brain. Although thousands of  genes are involved in brain development, a large number of them are  shared with (or have close counterparts in) genes that guide the  development of the rest of the body.</blockquote><p>  With plenty of evidence supporting the notion of multi-function  "housekeeping genes," Marcus concludes that our hopes for finding single  genes responsible for various brain disorders are likely unfounded.  <I>The Birth of the Mind</I> offers an engaging and often witty look at  how our genetic code can be simple enough to make basic proteins and  complicated enough to help us learn languages. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>This is an extraordinary book. This is science writing at its best. I highly recommend this book because it is very enlightening as to the nature of our brains. There are about 30,000 genes in the human genome. About half of these are expressed in the configuration of proteins found in the human brain.
<br />
<br />The human brain has about 100 billion neurons. You might be inclined to say "but only 30,000 genes." However, genes are complex proteins that work in combination to form the mind so there are almost endless combinations that are available to determine the functioning of the 100 billion neurons.  </span>

                    <span>     Marcus says, "From a mind's-eye view, brains may seem awfully special, but from a gene's-eye view, brains are just one more elaborate configuration of proteins."
<br />
<br />     This book is a compilation of very recent research about how the brain as an organ puts itself together.  This process is not unlike the process for any other organ, but results in a product that is highly malleable and ripe for environmental adjustment.  The book has been explained very adequately by many reviewers, so I will mainly try to provide you with some representative quotes and add only a few comments.
<br />
<br />     About Nature vs. Nurture:
<br />
<br />     "The nativists are right that significant parts of the brain are organized even without experience, and their opponents are right to emphasize that the structure of the brain is exquisitely sensitive to experience."
<br />
<br />     " At the core of our story has been a tension between the evidence that the brain can - like the body - assemble itself without much help from the outside world, and the evidence that little about the brain's initial structure is rigidly cast in stone.....To an earlier generation of scholars, the evidence for innateness and the evidence for flexibility seemed almost irreconcilable.  Most scholars simply focused their attention on the stream of evidence they were more impressed with....Both sides have their points.  The brain is capable of awesome feats of self-organization - and equally impressive feats of experience driven reorganization.  But the seeming tension between the two is more apparent than real: Self-organization and re-organization are two sides of the same coin, each the product of the staggering amount of co-ordinated suites of autonomous yet highly communicative genes."
<br />
<br />     The above non-debate (to a hard science person) is well-covered, but the jist of the book is more about how the pre-wiring occurs, relying occasionally on computer science analogies:
<br />
<br />     "Each gene acts like a single line in a computer program."
<br />
<br />     "As soon as the IF part of the gene's IF-THEN rule is satisfied, the process of translating the template part of the gene into it's corresponding protein commences."
<br />
<br />     "With one more trick - regulatory proteins - that control the expression of other genes - nature is able to tie the whole genetic system together, allowing gangs of otherwise unruly free-agent genes to come together in exquisite harmony."
<br />
<br />     "Each gene does double duty, specifying both a recipe for a protein and a set of regulatory conditions for when and where it should be built.  Taken together, suites of these IF-THEN genes give cells the power to act as parts of complicated improvisational orchestras."
<br />
<br />     How do the "billions of neurons in your brain" develop "trillions of connections between them."  There is a well done scientific description given, but I also like his caricature description:  "Even in a simple organism like a worm, the mechanics of (neuron) migration are so complicated they could have been borrowed from one of John Madden's playbooks.  Cell number 1 goes right, number 2 goes left, and cell 3 goes long for a pass."
<br />
<br />     About language development:
<br />
<br />     " If language came onto the scene relatively quickly by evolutionary standards, it is because much of the genetic toolkit for building complex cognition was already in place."
<br />
<br />     "To understand the origin of language will be to understand how a relatively small set of new genes coordinates the actions of a much larger set or pre-existing genes."
<br />
<br />     "If language arose de novo, it would, I suspect, have to go through a long series of gradual steps, but if language arose by a novel combination of existing elements - such as neural structures for memory, the automatization of repeated actions, and social cognition - it is possible that it could have developed relatively quickly."
<br />
<br />     "A language module may depend on a few dozen or a few hundred evolutionarily novel genes, but it is likely to depend heavily on genes - or duplications of pre-existing genes - that are involved in the construction of other cognitive systems, such as the motor control system, which coordinates muscular action, or the cognitive systems that plan complex events."
<br />
<br />        There is lots more, including an appendix on methods for reading the genome, but I'll close with this quote from the final chapter:  "In the coming decades, we will all - collectively , as a society - need to decide what we think about biotechnology and what applications we are and are not willing to allow.  The debates we have now, about cloning and stem cell research, pale in comparison to debates we are likely to encounter as the technology for manipulating genes advances."
<br />
<br />     About a personal item:
<br />
<br />     When I was in school, I decided that I needed to study a concept an arbitrary number of times (say, 5 times), maybe from the different points of view of several scientific disciplines, in order to really learn it.  I guessed that synaptic and neuronal pathways could be built up like bicep muscles.  Marcus covers this and calls it "synaptic strengthening," along with a lengthy explanation that "More than a hundred different molecules may be involved, and there are at least 15 distinct steps in the process."
<br />  
<br />     I highly recommend this excellent book.

                    <span>This is an extraordinary book.  It brings the reader up to speed on the fascinating and important research that is uncovering how genes and the environment conspire to build brains of extraordinary complexity.  The writing is crystal clear, the style is engaging, and Marcus makes the cutting edge science he's discussing accessible to any intelligent reader.  This is science writing at its best.  If you enjoy reading other great science writers like Pinker and Dawkins, you'll find this a great read!</span>

                    <span>If you are among those still arguing the "nature versus nurture" debate has been resolved, visit an English Lit class.  The humanities continue skirting the notion that genes play a role in our mental life.  It challenges our ideal of "free will".  Marcus, in this matchless survey, argues that "what's good for the body is good for the mind".  And few dispute that genes build bodies.  The mind, like the body, has deep evolutionary roots.  Even the simple organisms inhabiting the planet with us today show how brains develop.  Increased complexity of body is reflected in brain structure.  And the mind, he reminds us, resides in the brain.<p>Marcus explains his notion with a wealth of research, most of it very recent.  He explains how similar our brain structure is to that of other animals and what that implies for behaviour.  The mechanism of building brains is common to all animal life, even when the final product varies.  Genes transmit signals - "recipes" - of structure and function for all parts of the body.  Brains, he continually reminds us, are not that different from livers.  Neurons proceed from points of origin, finding appropriate areas to reside and assume functional duties.  From origin to operation they show flexibility and adaptability.  In this, Marcus argues, it's clear the brain is no different than any other organ. <p>It is our brain's interaction with the rest of the body that sets us somewhat apart from the other animals.  Language, the element we hold so dear in protecting our unique status, is given a thorough examination in this book.  There are no "language genes", Marcus stresses, but there are identified genes, notably FOXP2, known to impact speech ability.  He explains that looking for "genes for" something is futile.  Genes interact in too convoluted a manner to expect simple associations between a few nucleotides and something as complicated as speech.<p>Marcus offers a novel term to counter those railing against the strawman "genetic determinism".  Having explained how evolution has led to building brains, he declares them "prewired" but not "hardwired".  "Prewired" means that basic functions are spelled out biologically, but don't limit our interaction with our environments.  All brains permit flexibility by neurons interacting with each other as conditions vary.  We can learn because we are prewired to learn.  However, we've only begun the research where our brains are concerned.  <p>Marcus presents this trove of information with amazing clarity.  His topics aren't simple mechanisms or ideas, yet he conveys it all with graceful logic.  He avoids "dumbing down" the science, yet nothing is lost in his presentation.  His theme and supporting examples, buttressed by a glossary and extensive bibliography, are expressed in delightfully accessible prose.   Some explanatory graphics depict various elements and mechanisms in furthering the reader's understanding.  The underlying concept is "universality" and it's easy to see how his ideas apply to all animal life.  <p>This is a valuable book, easily absorbed by students, professionals in many fields, including, in the final chapter, lawyers.  The general public should be the primary market for this book since Marcus makes clear what has been learned may be applied in various ways, from "gene therapy" to "designer children".  He doesn't avoid the hard issues in showing how recent science has closed off many myths while opening as many new options.  Further research is needed, he argues, to avoid foolish mistakes.  Those failing to read this book may make or allow those errors.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]</span>

                    <span>I very much enjoyed and learned from this new and innovative book, Birth of the Mind by Dr. Gary Marcus.  Still, before I could write my own review I came across a professional review in one of Britain's most distinguished journals, Nature Neuroscience.  I present it instead:<p>"About half of the estimated 30,000-odd genes in the human genome are expressed in the brain. Among these genes is hidden the explanation for our unique human cognitive abilities, and for many of the differences between individual people. Developmental neurobiology is the essential bridge for connecting genome to behavior, but despite its obvious importance, there has not yet been a popular book devoted to this subject.<p>"The Birth of the Mind is an ambitious attempt to fill this gap. The author, Gary Marcus, is a cognitive scientist, but he has learned a lot about developmental neurobiology and has written a concise and very readable introduction to the field. By drawing on related disciplines such as genetics, cognitive science and evolution, he provides an overview of how the interaction between genome and environment gives rise to the human brain and by extension the human mind.<p>"Marcus gives as clear an account as I have ever seen of the nature versus nurture  'debate' In fact, most biologists no longer regard this as a debate (genes and environment are both important), and the fact that it is still perceived as such by the public may reflect the lack of clear popular account, which this book now provides.<p>"He also dispels a more recent myth, namely that there is a ~gene shortage that precludes genes from encoding complex behaviors. It is admittedly surprising that we have only 30,000 genes but 100 billion neurons, particularly given that the nematode C. elegans has nearly as many genes yet only 302 neurons. But as Marcus makes clear, genes are complex individually and give rise to even greater complexity by acting in combination; moreover, the truth is that we have no basis for surprise, absent a theory to explain how many genes are needed for a given degree of biological complexity"<p>"Einstein famously advised that everything should be made as simple as<br>possible, but no simpler. Marcus takes this to heart, and his book contains<br>many simplifications but few misrepresentations.<p>"... enjoyable to read [and written] with a light touch .... I have no <br>hesitation recommending it to students, scientists from other disciplines, or lay readers wanting to learn something about this fascinating and fast-developing field."<p>[Nature Neuroscience, April 2004, at p. 117, by Charles Jennings, Executive<br>Editor of the Nature Research Journals.]</span>
