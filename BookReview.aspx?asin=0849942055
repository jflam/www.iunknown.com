                    <span>During one sermon, my pastor wanted to share a story from a certain author he liked to read.  Well, by the time he finished re-telling the story, I had decided I wanted to find one of Campono's books and find out if there were more stories as equally rivetting.    Needless to say, I was not disappointed, not in the least. Once I started to read his collection of stories, I kept wanting to "taste" the next one.  Each story is so rich in wisdom.  Some stories were easy to read.  Others caused me to put the book down and take an honest look at the strength of my Christian walk.  And for every story that caused me to rise up in laughter, there would also be a story to cause me to sit and weep.    My challenge to you is to read this book and see if you will still be the same Christian you are at the end of the book as you were when you started.</span>

                    <span>I was actually looking for a different book by him that had been recommended and purchased this on a whim.  It is excellent!  The stories are short, to the point, and often funny and/or extremely moving.  It inspires me to do more as a Christian.</span>

                    <span>This collection of human stories include ones personally experienced by Campolo and collected by him.  A very few were even familiar to me.  Most touched my heart in some way, such as the story of the street person who only wanted...but I'll let you read that yourself.  Campolo's book would be useful as a source for sermon or other teaching illustrations, though I fear it may be so popular as to reduce the effectiveness of it.  Hard to put down!</span>
