                    <span>This book has two huge chapters on JTable and JTree with lots of examples which I found very useful. For example, how to fix the first two columns of a JTable while the other columns can scroll. Excellent coverage of Events as well. Great book and good examples.</span>

                    <span>The good news is this book has a fairly detailed cover of JFC! However the bad news is it doesn't cover new features and enhancements in J2SE 1.4 for AWT, Swing, etc, even though it was published in the year of 2002. That means many of classes, interfaces, methods, constants, and codes mentioned in the book are obsoleted or deprecated now, not mentioned to the other new changes in JDK 1.4. I believe that the author has struggled to keep up with the current update too, as well as readers.</span>

                    <span>I found it excellent. It's clear and smart. He points to the point giving even example on how to provide backward compatibility or how to re-arrange your code to use newest sdk.<BR>I would suggest it to every body already know java and would improve his/her knowledge.</span>

                    <span>If you are new to Swing, don't miss this latest book to guid you knowing all the features. If you are an experienced Java programmer, you will love to know all the detail in Swing. It does have wonderful explainations and every details about Swing. The only deficiency I would say is there are too many methods in Swing to make a good arrangement in indexing. You really need some time to consume the content.</span>
