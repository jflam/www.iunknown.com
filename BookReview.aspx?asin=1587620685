                <span id="Label1">Term Sheets & Valuations is the first ever in-depth look at the nuts and buts of terms sheets and valuations. The book, written by leading venture capitalist Alexander Wilmerding of Boston Capital Ventures, covers topics such What is a Term Sheet, How to Examine a Term Sheet, A Section-by-Section View of a Term Sheet, Valuations, What Every Entrepreneur & Executive Needs to Know About Term Sheets, Valuation Parameters, and East Coast Versus West Coast Rules. In addition, the book includes an actual term sheet from a leading law firm with line by line descriptions of each clause, what can/should be negotiated, and the important points to pay attention to. A must have book for any executive, entrepreneur, or financial professional.   <P>Praise for Term Sheets & Valuations:  <P>"This primer should be required reading for every entrepreneur. It is short, authoritative and worth its weight in gold." - Murray Low, Executive Director, Columbia Business School, Eugene M. Lang Center for Entrepreneurship  <P>"An invaluable resource for executives and financial professionals." - Graham D.S. Anderson, General Partner, EuclidSR Partners  <P>"A valuable resource for entrepreneurs..." - Jeffrey Donohue, Esq.</span>

                    <span>This is a first rate book-regardless if you are a seasoned venture capitalist or first time entrepreneur. Having been a venture capitalist for 22 years now, the term sheet in this book is boilerplate-but it is 1 of the 4 boilerplate term sheets every legitimate lawyer/venture capitalist uses as a term sheet-and available for the first time ever in the "public domain." In addition, what makes the book so valauble is the line by line wording and analysis for entrepreneur favorable, investor favorable and neutral. I highly recommend this book to every entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and executive of every level-it is a MUST have on your bookshelf as a timeless reference.</span>

                    <span>This is by far the most widely used title by every venture capitalist. I would highly recommend this book to every vc, lawyer, and management team member (especially) of every company looking to obtain venture financing. You could not find better advice on negotation points, changes to wording or overall guidance on a term sheet than Wilmerding's advice in this book. Especially look at Chapter 3 where Wilmerding goes through line by line what every parapraph means on a term sheet. Also check out Wilmerding's other book, Deal Terms, or Raising VC From a Tier 1 Firm (which includes the entire text from Term Sheets & Valuations and Deal Terms).</span>

                    <span>After having this book referred to me by about 7 of my venture capital friends I decided to take a look. Well, I was very impressed as this is the first venture capital book I have seen to provide a true insider's perspective. This book literally tells you exactly the wording you need to use to make the section applicable to you - whether you are a:<P>Venture Capitalist<P>Entrepreneur<P>Lawyer<P>Etc.<P>Look at the below section and the detail it provides (you should note the book itself goes on to explain what this entire section means and what each section specifically does):<P>(4) Conversion:	[Investor Favorable, Middle of the Road and Company Favorable are the same.]<P>The holders of the Series [A] Preferred shall have the right to convert the Series [A] Preferred, at any time, into shares of Common Stock. The initial conversion rate shall be 1:1, subject to adjustment as provided below.<P>(5) Automatic Conversion:<P>Investor Favorable:		<P>The Series [A] Preferred shall be automatically converted into Common Stock, at the then applicable conversion price, (i) in the event that the holders of at least two thirds of the outstanding Series [A] Preferred consent to such conversion or (ii) upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock of the Company at a per share price not less than [3 times the Original Purchase Price] per share and for a total offering with net proceeds to the Company of not less than $40 million (a "Qualified IPO").<P>Middle of the Road:		<P>The Series [A] Preferred shall be automatically converted into Common Stock, at the then applicable conversion price, (i) in the event that the holders of at least two thirds of the outstanding Series [A] Preferred consent to such conversion or (ii) upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock of the Company at a per share price not less than [2 times the Original Purchase Price] per share and for a total offering with gross proceeds to the Company of not less than $25 million (a "Qualified IPO").<P>Company Favorable:		<P>The Series [A] Preferred shall be automatically converted into Common Stock, at the then applicable conversion price, (i) in the event that the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series [A] Preferred consent to such conversion or (ii) upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock of the Company at a per share price not less than two times the Original Purchase Price (as adjusted for stock splits and the like) and for a total offering of not less than $5 million, before deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses (a "Qualified IPO").</span>

                    <span>As a VC, I can tell you this is THE book every VC, lawyer, investment banker and entrepreneur has on their desk regarding term sheets. It is a great overall reference and the line by line explanations are extremely important for anyone doing deals. I would also highly recommend Wilmerding's second book "Deal Terms" and "Executive Reports: Raising VC From a Tier 1 Firm" which includes this entire book, Deal Terms, Ways of the VC and a list of top VC Firms. I am also told this book specifically is available as a CD-Rom (sold separately), in a Word document, that you can use for your own dealings.</span>

                    <span>As an entrepreneur trying to secure venture financing, this book was a godsend. Not only did it help me better negotiate with my investors, but it made me seem like I really knew what was going on and had experience in the area. It also saved me thousands in legal fees since I was able to make suggestions on my own time (not lawyer time). My backers were quite impressed with this book themselves and all bought copies after I shared it with them when the deal closed. If you have any ties to venture capital at all, this book is worth it's weight in gold.</span>
