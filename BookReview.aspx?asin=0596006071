                <span id="Label1">With its rep for being the sort of machine that won't intimidate even the most inexperienced users, what's the appeal of the Mac&reg; for hard-core geeks? The Mac has always been an efficient tool, pleasant to use and customize, and eminently hackable. But now with Mac OS&reg; X's BSD core, many a Unix&reg; developer has found it irresistible. The latest version of Mac OS X, called Panther, makes it even easier for users to delve into the underlying Unix operating system. In fact, you can port Linux&reg; and Unix applications and run them side-by-side with your native Aqua&reg; apps right on the Mac desktop.  Still, even experienced Unix users may find themselves in surprisingly unfamiliar territory as they set out to explore Mac OS X. Even if you know Macs through and through, Mac OS X Panther is unlike earlier Macs, and it's radically different from the Unix you've used before.   Enter <i>Mac OS X Panther for Unix Geeks</i> by Brian Jepson and Ernest E. Rothman, two Unix geeks who found themselves in the same place you are. The new edition of this book is your guide to figuring out the BSD Unix system and Panther-specific components that you may find challenging. This concise book will ease you into the Unix innards of Mac OS X Panther, covering such topics as:<ul><li>A quick overview of the Terminal application, including Terminal alternatives like iTerm and GLterm</li><li>Understanding Open Directory (LDAP) and NetInfo</li><li>Issues related to using the GNU C Compiler (GCC)</li><li>Library linking and porting Unix software</li><li>An overview of Mac OS X Panther's filesystem and startup processes</li><li>Creating and installing packages using Fink and Darwin Ports</li><li>Building the Darwin kernel</li><li>Using the Apple&reg; X11 distribution for  running X Windows&reg; applications on top of Mac OS X</li></ul>The book wraps up with a quick manpage-style reference to the "Missing Manual Pages" --commands that come with Mac OS X Panther, although there are no manpages.   If you find yourself disoriented by the new Mac environment, <i>Mac OS X Panther for Unix Geeks</i> will get you acclimated quickly to the foreign new areas of a familiar Unix landscape. </span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book, it's a treasure trove of information throughout. Generally speaking Mac's goal is to keep things simple and the majority Mac user's are perfectly content with that. I would even say that most Mac users I've met don't care to learn UNIX. That's a shame, they don't know what they are missing! The only reason that I became interested in Mac is that it now has the power of a stable, mature and secure operating system, UNIX! Apple has the best of both worlds, the power of the UNIX OS and the beauty of the Mac interface. <P>With Mac's simple approach, sometimes it can be difficult to get techinical details. For a technical person, this book is welcome. But I wouldn't consider this book to be overly "geeky." Anyone with some experience with UNIX could find useful information in these pages. For example, did you know that you can use GIMP (a very powerful free image editor program) as your default image editor for iPhoto? You can use a lot of cool, free, open source software with Mac OS X. That's another good reason to learn alittle UNIX! This book goes into a lot of detail on how to install GNU free software and other packages.<P>The book is divided into 4 Parts: Part I. Getting Around, Part II. Building Applications Part III. Working with Packages Part IV. Serving and System Management. Then there's a lengthy Appendix on the file system, command line tools and missing manpages. In a nutshell the book starts with general information, then covers Networking and Programming topics. A good place to start is to find the Terminal Application in the Utilites folder and drag it to the Dock for quick access. I'm more of a network guy than a programmer, so naturally I gravitated to the networking chapters. But to tap into the full power of UNIX one must be able to edit and write some scripts too. This book has some practical scripting examples. It also touches on using your Mac OS X client as a server. I'm sure that I'll be refering back to this book, it's a good one to have in the library.</span>

                    <span>As a would-be "switcher" still waiting for the 3 GHz Mac and a<BR>mainstream OSX book from amazon, I've found myself on foreign soil with this book. What is the Dock, what is "rootless mode", what is a disk image? What does it mean to open a directory?<P>I'd like to suggest that you add a few pages of explanations of Mac specific things for those poor Unix souls who have seen the light but haven't yet received their new toys, and for those who are just evaluating the brightness of the light before they jump.<P>M Somogyi</span>

                    <span>With an existing knowledge of *nix based operating systems I was easily engaged and enchanted by the idea of converting from a Unix based machine such as those produced by Sun Microsystems to an Apple. I found that there is great interoperability between Mac and *nix based software applications. The idea of running the Aqua interface over BSD's skeleton sounds like a nice fit with it's Mac ease of use and it's powerful *nix processing and configurability. The book focused quite a bit on the commands and flags associated with Unix but with the Mac twist. There was also a great chapter on third party applications shipped/available for Mac OS X and pointed out key elements of the titles. Overall I would have to recommend this book to both advanced Mac users as well as the Unix enthusiast.</span>

                    <span>For many years, Mac and unix users lived in parallel universes. The operating systems were totally different and the fans of either tended to hark from different fields. <P>Well, ever since Apply redid its Mac to use the Mach kernel, now a Mac runs a dialect of unix. No less inferior than any other version. In some ways, this book is interesting in how it caters to the unix crowd. The book has numerous screen captures of the OS X UI. It sure is pretty! Even unix geeks ought to appreciate this.<P>Graphics-wise, perhaps the closest overlap of the unix and Mac experiences comes in the book's chapter on X Windows [=X11]. Most unix versions use X11 to implement their GUIs. The chapter shows the X11 treatment on the Mac to be very seamless. Though the Mac actually uses Quartz to make its GUI, an X11 development kit is provided, that will satisfy any X11 developer.<P>Unix is distinguished from traditional Mac or Microsoft OSes by emphasising a command line, and very powerful utilities that are often accessed via this command line. Panther gives you most of the common unix utilities in this customary environment.<P>Overall, unix fans might like this book for its presentation of a very cohesively integrated system that is perhaps easier to use than any other unix or linux offering.</span>

                    <span>This second edition is a substantial upgrade in both content, and clarity of prose. The technical depth that was a little overwhelming in the second section has been smoothed over and some parts have been moved out of the core of the book and into the appendices.<P>The unique value of the book is in it's ability to anticipate and answers the questions of Unix users who are looking to migrate to OS X, and in that it performs very well. Ever question I had in moving from Linux to OS X is answered in this well-organized work.<P>The book starts with the Terminal and how it can be tweaked or even replaced. It then covers the unique startup and directory services. Other user level services and applications are covered, but I liked the last section on third party tools the best. That chapter alone would have saved me a lot of time before I bought the book. The second section covers building applications on the unix layer and this edition adds a chapter on Perl which is excellent. The coverage of Fink, which is a critical, if poorly named, tool for OS X has been greatly improved in this edition. The fourth section, on databases, is well-written and is a nice-to-have to for readers, but it probably not exactly in line with the book as it's not significantly different with OS X.<P>If you are switching from any unix to OS X you will find this book a well written and invaluable accelerators to get out over the hump of getting the right tools and finding what and where to tweak.</span>
