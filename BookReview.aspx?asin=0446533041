                <span id="Label1">Some widows face their loss with denial. Sophie Stanton's reaction is one of pure bafflement. "How can I be a widow?" Sophie asks at the opening of Lolly Winston's sweet debut novel, <I>Good Grief</I>. "I'm only thirty-six. I just got used to the idea of being married." Sophie's young widowhood forces her to do all kinds of crazy things--drive her car through her garage door, for instance. That's on one of the rare occasions when she bothers to get out of bed. The Christmas season especially terrifies her: "I must write a memo to the Minister of Happier Days requesting that the holidays be cancelled this year." But widowhood also forces her to do something very sane. After the death of her computer programmer husband, she reexamines her life as a public relations agent in money-obsessed Silicon Valley. Sophie decides to ease her grief, or at least her loneliness, by moving in with her best friend Ruth in Ashland, Oregon. But it's her difficult relationship with psycho teen punker Crystal, to whom she becomes a Big Sister, that mysteriously brings her at least a few steps out of her grief. Winston allows Sophie life after widowhood: The novel almost indiscernibly turns into a gentle romantic comedy and a quirky portrait of life in an artsy small town. At all stops on her journey from widow to survivor, Sophie is a lively, crabby, delightfully imperfect character. <I>--Claire Dederer</I></span>

                    <span>Grief, an experience that touches all of us, is the focus of Lolly Winston's warm, witty, insightful debut novel. Of course, grief is a subject that has been discussed ad infinitum but there's not a dollop of cliche in this story of 36-year-old Sophie Stanton who lost her husband to Hodgkin's disease. <P>Unfortunately, as Sophie points out she didn't have a dress rehearsal for widowhood, and she has not the faintest idea of how to cope with it. Experts will tell us that there are five stages of grief, Sophie goes through 15 in one year. Beginning with denial she segues to oreos (overeating), anger, depression, bargaining, waitressing, baking, acceptance, and thanksgiving. This is an incredible journey for Sophie, and a memorable experience for the reader.<P>Her attempt to heal begins with a grief therapy group recommended by her psychiatrist. Once there, she finds herself wanting to ask if it would be alright if she threw plates at her former mother-in-law who wants to come over and pack up Ethan's things for Goodwill. Sophie dreads "the thought of her snoopy paws all over his Frank Zappa CDs and Lakers T-shirts. She'd probably want to chuck his frayed flannel shirts, which I've started sleeping in because they're soft as moss and smell like Ethan."<P>Midnight trips to the fridge have swollen her former size six figure, and she has lost all interest in her Silicon Valley job. She desperately wants to be what she believes widows should be - regal in their mourning. Sophie isn't even coming close. Further, she loses her job.<P>Fleeing mother-in-law and memories, Sophie sells her house and moves to Oregon where she hopes to begin anew. Starting over is far from a breeze - there's dating, an occupation she hasn't indulged in for quite a while. It's awkward, embarrassing. Evidently, she's forgotten how to be single. She does find a new job but soon discovers that being a waitress may need some skills she lacks.<P>As another outlet she signs up for the Big Brothers Big Sisters Program, hoping for perhaps an eight or nine year old girl with whom she can bond. Instead, she's given Crystal, a mixed up early teenager with a knack for starting fires, cutting herself, and getting expelled from school. On the plus side, Crystal does make Sophie laugh.<P>There's more in Sophie's diary of loss to renewal, including a romantic interest and a new business. Each step of the way is related with insight, compassion, and humor by an outstanding new voice, Lolly Winston.<P> - Gail Cooke</span>

                    <span>What an unusual premise for a sweet little romance to take off from: our heroine is in her thirties, recently widowed after only a few years of marriage. It's difficult to make profound grief funny, but Lolly Winston manages it in spades. There's an especially funny scene in which Winston keeps the point of view and voice and tone that of Sophie, her grieving narrator, while she's coming completely unglued (showing up for work in her bathrobe and slippers, scarfing down carbs and sweets - hot dog buns with honey! - and talking in gibberish). In writerly terms, this is called Your Basic Crazy Unreliable Narrator, but Winston holds it together just long enough for the poor woman to be packed off to a shrink.<BR>Somewhere between quitting her job and being fired, she takes a leave of absence in the interest of mental health, treks off to pretty Ashland, Oregon, and begins, improbably, to try patching herself together by becoming a volunteer Big Sister to a very angry pyromaniac teenage girl - not the most sensible choice, but what the hay: it's a romance novel, after all.<BR>And, right on cue, in comes Mr. Wonderful.<BR>Happy ending, eventually, of course. Lots of improbable stuff along the way, but this book is so well written and handles the vagaries of grief so well that you've gotta love it.</span>

                    <span>Sophie Stanton wasn't planning on being a 36 year old widow. Faced with her husband Ethan's death,she tries to be a good widow ..."a graceful composed Jackie Kennedy kind of widow." No such luck. Sophie pushes down her grief and anger,until a spectacular work place meltdown(which she attends in her bathrobe and bunny slippers).No longer will she be in public relations at Silicon Valley's Gorgatech,pitching the pluses of the company's new scrotal patch. She can't even face her mother in law, Marion, who seems untouched by her only son's death. She clings to Ethan's belongings and tries to face life alone. <BR>Eventually she finds refuge in Ashton,Oregon living with her college friend Ruth. Life just isn't meant to be pretty. Sophie finds as she tries to navigate building a new life she has to not only accept that Ethan hasn't just "stepped out for a minute" but is never coming home and she can choose to go on. <BR> This is such a tender, witty, well written story that I had a hard time believing it was a first book. Lolly Winston deftly weaves the various stages of grief ,acceptance and continuing life without a false note. The characters are engaging, the situations poignant, heart wrenching and sometimes hilarious (Al,the grief group guy is a classic). Through it all Sophie comes to terms with her loss, Ethan's frailities,and the ability we all have to continue to reach out to help others and heal ourselves.</span>

                    <span>Good Grief is the perfect book to take with you to the beach this summer. Why? Because it's well-written chick lit with a twist chick lit that will actually make you smile, and sometimes even laugh out loud. Sophie Stanton, the charming narrator of this novel is 36 and recently widowed. Let me warn you, the first several chapters of this novel, while well-written and gently humorous, are sort of a downer--Sophie is pretty much miserable and her life is falling apart. My advice: try to read them in one sitting and get to the more middle parts of the novel, where she starts to get her act together. You can breeze through this novel in a couple of hours. Sophie is a wonderful character--likeable, you'll want to root for her. A fun, light read.</span>

                    <span>"Good Grief" is a book rich with all of the textures, emotions, ups and downs of life, with a healthy dash of sarcasism and humor. Winston's tale is heartwarming, while reading it I laughed, cried and took visits to similar situations down Memory Lane. I have been heartily recommending this book to everyone. Great pace--good read, especially for the beach!</span>
