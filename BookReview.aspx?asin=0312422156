                    <span>One would think that a book with over 500 pages would become redundant by the end of it, instead it was a magnificently written book with the real life scenerio and feel. I could almost invision Cal/Calliope. I also could imagine the voice change ups. Excellently done. It is a must read book and ranks up there with several books I have bought over the winter from Amazon, such as Atonement,Hallelujah, Paper Life and Nightmares Echo

                    <span>Middlesex is a straight up great book. Yes, there are some elements that deal with alternative sexual identity classification. No, that's not the main focus though. Middlesex is about personal journey and the perseverance of the troubled spirit. I read Middlesex because of the constant comparisons to My Fractured Life, Saturday, and The Kite Runner and  I was not disappointed. There is a beautiful organic flow to the words in the spirit of running water that refreshes, cleanses, and invigorates. </span>

                    <span>Jeffery Eugenides is a beautiful writer. He takes subjects that are off kilter, controversial, or just plain awkward and he makes them somehow beautiful. If you look at the best books being celebrated, an argument could be made that "Middlesex" is the meeting point of where those books overlap. "Middlesex" has the flowery beauty of "Secret Life of Bees." It also has the ability to deal with emotional pain and raging sadness in a incredibly moving way as done in "My Fractured Life." Finally, there is the element of the obscure forced into the world of the norm as done in "Atonement." I'm still trying to figure out if "Middlesex" is one greatest book of all of them because it bridges the elements of each, or if it is not quite as great as the others because it only has elements. I'll probably realize the answer once I give all four another read. That they deserve another read so soon does guarantee their greatness. </span>

                    <span>A great great novel, worth reading for humor, historical fiction, drama, character development and plot...it combines every aspect of an awesome novel.  I did not put this book down. Side note--I did not like Virgin Suicides at all...</span>

                    <span>Middlesex is an extremely well written novel based on gender confusion and the fascinating recount of the history of a family. This book kept me reading during my every free moment, even when I had the opportunity to read one or just a few pages. Just like The Usurper and Other Stories, and Virgin Suicides, this is a great book which any reader will have difficulties putting down for a moment.</span>
