                <span id="Label1"><i>Jeffrey Richter's Advanced Windows, 3rd ed.,</i> is a useful guide to system programming in Win32 in C. The book starts out with advanced topics such as working with Win32 processes and threads, and then moves on to other Win32 kernel objects like heaps and memory-mapped files. The book then explores thread synchronization (and how threads can be made to work effectively in parallel) and explores how to create responsive programs that process messages asynchronously. Chapters on file I/O and device I/O are especially useful for those who need access to the advanced functionality available in Win32. This book presents hard-to-find material clearly, including the structured exception handling model used in Win32 operating systems, and completion ports (which also allow I/O operations to run in the background). An appendix on Win32 fibers will be useful to UNIX system programmers who want to bring their code quickly to Windows. Though the source code is written in C here for widest available audience, the programming strategies and technical information is applicable to C++ programming as well. All in all, this new edition of Advanced Windows is a very useful, readable book that presents in-depth information on several valuable Win32 programming topics. It's worth noting that many of these advanced API calls and features are not easily available to MFC programmers.  </span>

                    <span>This book is a fantastic reference for Windows programmers.  However, as others below have mentioned, its fourth release is now available under the title "Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows."  If you're comfortable with Windows programming and are looking to get into some of the meatier areas, check it out.</span>

                    <span>Anyone doing serious Windows development using the base Win32 API's must have this book. It covers intermediate and advanced usage of the file system, DLL's, memory architecture, memory management, thread synchronization, memory mapped files, and a host of other more advanced topics. The coverage of the various subjects is complete and the code examples well written. Really anyone doing development under the Win32 API will benefit greatly from this book. Get it. I hope this helps J.</span>

                    <span>Not just a "How do I..." book, but also a "Why should I..." book.  <p>Richter writes in an easy, conversational, and readable style about difficult and technical topics related to Win32 programming - thread management and local storage, differences in the handing of DLLs in Win32 and Win16, using virtual memory, etc.   In addition, the author makes explicit distinctions between the behavior of 95 and NT when appropriate.<p>Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>The firt thing you should know is that this book is not for Advanced users of windows. It's for Advanced PROGRAMERS in windows. which isn't clear from the books name. I normaly don't like books except when they are exceptionally usefull. So many authors write so much and give you a little. you see books that are 1200 pages. but you can put the usefull consise information in 400 pages.<p>This book is RREEAALLY difirent. It's 1000 pages are realy a 1000. Jeff doesn't talk alot. gives you precise consice understandable detaild info. So much info. What's outside and inside. So many things that are not explained in the MSDN. (speacialy when he talks about the kernel objects)<p>This book is not a complete guide to win32. BUT it's very complete in the topics it describes. To me, now I can say I'm an advanced win32 programer.<p>The only misleading thing in the book is it's NAME. I think it should have been cald "Advanced Windows for programers"</span>

                    <span>Jeffrey Richter's Advanced Windows is easily the most frequently used (and  borrowed) book on my computer bookshelf.  It is well written, complete, and  contains descriptions and examples of non-GUI Windows programming you  simply can not find anywhere else.  I plan on buying both of his new books  as well.  All of his books are utterly without hype - it's like reading  just the meaty parts of MSJ/MSDN magazine.  Long Live Jeff Richter!</span>
