                    <span>I read Fat City sometime in the mid-sixties, when it was first published, and was immediately captivated and envious of Gardner's powerful style and talent.  If you appreciate and admire Hemingway or  Steinbeck you will likely feel the same about Gardner, who, unfortunately, has not published anything since.  Perhaps this small gem of a book was the only one he had in him.  Even so, this novel is a remarkable accomplishment and may well become an American classic.  What intrigues me the most in this work is that Gardner gets it all down right--the sights and smells and sounds of the seedy streets and flophouses; the drifters and dingy diners; the sweaty gyms, barsweeps and whores and how it is to work as a stoop-laborer in the fields, especially the true-to-life characters inhabiting the pages.  Fat City is simply a well-crafted execution of art throughout and is as pleasurable to read now as when I first picked it up years ago.       </span>

                    <span>This is one of my all time favorite novels.  It beautifully captures the desperation in the lives of its characters and does it in a style that is a model of grace and economy.  The deeply insightful portrayal of the painful relationships between the men and women, who inhabit it's world, is one of its many pleasures.
<br />
<br />Gardner is one of the greatest novelists, just on the strength of "Fat City," the only entry, in his oeuvre.  </span>

                    <span>"Fat City" is a novel that delivers an uppercut of grit, sadness and human endurance to the reader. Harsh, powerful, and poignant this novel is beautifully rendered in taut prose. It is remarkable how in theme and style Gardner's writing resembles the paintings of the 1930's artist, George Bellows, who also depicts the struggles of boxers and urban poor both in the blood speckled ring and in tenement strewn wastes of American cities. Bravo Gardner, you have your equals in Selby, Melville and Hemingway! But one wonders why this talent has not come into the ring another time and graced his readers with another novel?</span>

                    <span>Leonard Gardner's short novel, "Fat City", set in Stockton, California in the mid-1950's, appeared in 1969.  Gardner wrote the screenplay for the movie, directed by John Huston, in 1972. The book remains in print in a series of novels based in California called "California fiction".  I came upon this book by chance.  It is little-known but a treasure.<p>The book is about boxing and low life, faded dreams, lack of prospects, booze, rooming houses, failed relationships in a small California town.  The two primary characters are Billy Tully and Ernie Munger.  Billy at age 29 is a washed-up fighter who has lost his wife and several jobs and is sinking deeply into alcohol and oblivion.  Ernie is 19 years old and a boxer who may have potential. He marries a young women named Faye, after getting her pregnant, and takes up the ring as a professional in order to support his wife and child.<p>The paths of the two men cross in the gym at the beginning of the book and their careers take parallel courses.  Billy had lost an important fight in Panama some years earlier when his manager, Ruben Luna, forced him to travel alone to Panama in order to save on expenses.  He makes an attempted comeback at the age of 30 and actually wins a decision in a brutal match with an aging Mexican fighter.  He returns to fighting to try to save himself from depression over the loss of his wife, his lack of prospects, and his loneliness.<p>Ernie Munger is young and works at a gas station. Although he has some boxing potential, his skills appear limited.  As had been the case with Tully years earlier, Ruben Luna sends Munger out of town, (to Las Vegas) for a fight to save on the expenses.  This is Munger's first professional fight which proves more successful for him than did Tully's fight in Panama.<br>The book ends darkly, but with a hint of the possiblity of personal growth and true independence for Munger.<p>The descriptions in this book of bars, of women, of cheap hotels, of the training for fights, and of the fights themselves is compelling.  This is a strong picture of boxing at its seamiest which yet captures the fascination that this sport holds for many -- myself included.<p>There are also many scenes in the book of the life of seasonal, agricultural workers in northern California.  One of the most memorable portions of the book occurs when Tully and Munger sign on for day work in picking nuts. Tully climbs upon a ladder on a tractor and beats the nuts from a tree with a stick where they fall on Munger's head as he gathers them into a bag.  The rage and the frustration of both men is palpable.<p>Gardner writes with a spare understated style which does not moralize.  The characters and their experiences speak for themselves.  It is highly effective.<p>There is a picture here of despairing men with small visions but also a real sense of underlying humanity, of hope, and of valuable, if fallen ideals.  This will be a rewarding novel for the reader who wants to go slightly off the routine path.</span>

                    <span>A vivid, compelling tale, replete with memorable characters -- a punch drunk pugilist and pickled crop picker -- in unsettling scenarios. You, I. . . almost every one of us has hit bottom and asked how'd this happen, is there no way out? These guys hit harder than most, and we feel every bump along the way. For them, there are no easy outs. As for us, we come away appreciating our lot in life just a little bit more.</span>
