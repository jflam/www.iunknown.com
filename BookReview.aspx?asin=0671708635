                <span id="Label1"><I>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change</I> was a groundbreaker when it was first published in 1990, and it continues to be a business bestseller with more than 10 million copies sold. Stephen Covey, an internationally respected leadership authority, realizes that true success encompasses a balance of personal and professional effectiveness, so this book is a manual for performing better in both arenas. His anecdotes are as frequently from family situations as from business challenges. <p> Before you can adopt the seven habits, you'll need to accomplish what Covey calls a "paradigm shift"--a change in perception and interpretation of how the world works. Covey takes you through this change, which affects how you perceive and act regarding productivity, time management, positive thinking, developing your "proactive muscles" (acting with initiative rather than reacting), and much more. <p> This isn't a quick-tips-start-tomorrow kind of book. The concepts are sometimes intricate, and you'll want to study this book, not skim it. When you finish, you'll probably have Post-it notes or hand-written annotations in every chapter, and you'll feel like you've taken a powerful seminar by Covey. <I>--Joan Price</I></span>

                    <span>Covey is easy to understand, and his teachings are solid. He skillfully leads you through some mental exercises that open up new vistas of insight. The concepts themselves have stood the test of time; it's Covey's presentation and way of tying everything together that work the apparent magic. I read this book nearly 10 years before writing this review, and have referred to it often since then. Covey's contribution to mankind, through this book, is major. "Seven Habits..." may well be one of the great life-changing tools of our time. Why should you read this book? As Covey says, "Put first things first." This book lays a firm foundation from which you can reach new heights--both professionally and personally. If you have any desire to take control of your life, to be happy, to succeed--this book (or tape) is for you. If you enjoy chaos, uncertainty, and failure, don't read this book.</span>

                    <span>I am not a person who reads the same book more than one time, but this book makes me read it over and over. I am changing for effective person now through this book. It has enough value to study and research several times to change our basic personal nature. I don't want to describe these 7 specific principles now in advance. However, I am sure that you can't change anything if you just skim these 7 habits. You must study this book. <P>Strengths: First of all, it is easy to read it. It doesn't make us have a hard time figuring out difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences. The only thing we have to do is to read and feel in our deep mind and then try to apply the principles to our own situation. The second good point is that it encourages us a lot through using many simple examples. We can apply these principles in our all life and all situations such as home, company, school, and so on. We can be effective people, not just famous successful people.<BR>Weaknesses: Somebody may think that this book uses too many examples to describe the 7 habits. Sometimes they help me understand these 7 principles more, but they can lose my interest about that principle by using too much time. <P>This book emphasizes that our short term attempts can't help to change our solid nature which we have had for a long time. This book will show us the specific ways to change our nature in the long term. Therefore, you can be one of the effective people in your family, company and yourself if you read and apply these principles in your life.</span>

                    <span>I have worked for major corporations and I have been self employed in direct sales and network marketing. Hardly a day goes by when I don't find someone who recommends and in many cases, carries The 7 Habits around with them in their briefcase.<P>In a world of me, me, me, me. It's great to have a noted and highly respected authority like Dr. Covey teach the concepts of "Win-Win" and "seek first to understand, then be understood."<P>I am also happy to see that Dr. Covey has endorsed network marketing and recommends it. easy to understand why. Network marketing is indeed the wave of the future so it makes sense that the professionals of the present and the near future will be applying Dr. Coveys techniques just as those Fortune 500 companies have been doing since the 1980's.<P>Great book. I highly recommend it to everyone and especially network marketers who want to significantly grow their business.<P>Thank you Dr. Covey for a great book.</span>
