                    <span>Colorado's Best By Bruce Calighey and Doug Whitehead<p>Reviewed by Curt Peoples<p>With so much travel information on the Internet, I sometimes wonder:  Why do authors continue to write travel books?   Colorado's Best  answers the question by showing that the best travel authors still write  about places they've personally visited and enjoyed.  If you like Colorado  (or think might like Colorado), you should buy this book.  <p>The authors  are well qualified.  Bruce Calighey has written The Colorado Guide, now in  its fourth edition.   Doug Whitehead produces Colorado Getaways, a weekly  travel television show in Denver - he's like the Charles Kuralt of  Colorado.<p>The authors take you to every corner of the state, with over  200 entries of the best cultural and historical places, outdoor activities  and events, and places to eat, drink and stay.  The book entertains because  the "bests" listed are truly remarkable, sometimes bizarre and  not always on the beaten track.   My three favorites:  Best Way to  "Get in the Mood" at the Glen Miller Festival in Fort Morgan,   Best Hot Springs at Mount Princeton, and Best Drive-In Without a Car in  Monte Vista. <p>Most atypical, compared to many travel guides, is the  writing style:  personal and thoughtful with a tone that says, "I  really like this place, I think you will too!"  I want to take my  daughter to the Kit Carson County Carousel because the authors have done it  themselves, stopping for a short rest and staying for hours.  I want to go  to Crested Butte because it's apparent Mr. Calighey and Mr. Whitehead have  been there, sampled the restaurants, and now recommend the four best in  town.  They suggest a few hills they've skied that I've never seen in the  slick brochures.<p>Best piece of writing in the book:  the description of  the Sand Creek Massacre Memorial.  It starts, "Certainly 'best' isn't  the most precise word to describe this simple, yet hauntingly affecting  memorial to the brutal and unjustified murder of American Indians by U.S.  troops, but the event without question merits consideration."  In four  poignant paragraphs, you'll be compelled to learn more about the lost ways  of traditional Native American life.  This is what travel writing should  be.</span>
