                    <span>Derek Hutchinson has led kayaking expeditions around the world and teaches highly regarded seminars on the sport. However, he seems unable to clearly translate this teaching ability to print. This book reads like a laundry list of things to do in a kayak: equipment choices, paddle strokes, rescue techniques, rolling, surfing maneuvers, etc.; without rhyme or reason as to their purpose or when they should be executed. The book does cover a complete range of topics relevant to the sea kayaker: all topics just mentioned plus weather, tides, navigation, wind, etc. Unfortunately, many sections are out-of-date, such as the equipment section; a lot of information, such as that on nautical charts and on weather, is specific to kayaking in Britain; and some information, such as that on tidal currents, is just plain wrong. I did learn quite a lot from the sections on turning strokes and eskimo rolling, but not as much as I feel I should have and not enough to know where or when to use a particular technique. Overall, I was disappointed with the quality of instruction presented in this book.</span>

                    <span>Derek Hutchinson really went to the extent in this book. It was really helpful. Definateley gave history, tips, and techniques. It was a very effective book for beginers like myself. Well drawn diagrams of techniques made learning easy and fun. Hutchinson really gave it all to you. It was exently written.</span>

                    <span>The author is one of the greats in sea kayaking expeditions and kayak design, and generously shares the wealth of his experience with his readers. An excellent A to Z book for a beginner, as well as an intermediate kayaker. Very well written, magnificent illustations, great (British) sense of humor. The deficiencies: very vague on correct forward stroke techniques; describes many variations of eskimo roll, but again somewhat vague on how to learn to roll. Also the section on features of different kayak models is 15 years out of date, not updated for this edition. RECOMMENDATION: Buy it by all means, but it should not be your only book on the subject.</span>
