                <span id="Label1">Family connections are vitally important to children as they begin to find their place in the world. For transracial and transcultural adoptees, domestic adoptees, and for children in foster care or kinship placements, celebrating the differences within their families as well as the similarities that connect them, is the foundation for belonging. As parents or caregivers, we can strengthen our children&#146;s tie to family and embrace the differences that make them unique. Each child will have their own story and their own special place to belong.   <P>This beautifully illustrated and uplifting book, for the 2-5 set, will help to create the intimate parent/caregiver and child bond that is so important. While others may notice the physical differences between us on the outside, inside we are the same.</span>

                    <span>My 8-year-old loved this book. She was fascinated by the illustrations and the idea that despite our physical differences as a racially blended family, we are very much the same inside, where it makes all the difference. Excellent source for starting a dialogue with any child.</span>

                    <span>I have found this book to be an excellent connecting point with our children who were adopted. The way that Kitze acknowledges physical differences and yet affirms the similarities that truly matter is reassuring for children who have concerns about not resembling their adoptive or foster parents. Multicultural illustrations add to the thoughtful writing.</span>

                    <span>Carrie Kitz has written a wonderful story for all families to enjoy together. My girls, ages 5 and 2, ask me to read it over and over. As a mom to one daughter from China and one from Cambodia, I especially enjoy the message the book sends- we may look different on the outside, but on the inside, we are the same.</span>

                    <span>Don't be fooled by the cover. Carrie's newest creation speaks to the entire adoption and foster community. " I Don't Have Your Eyes" is the novel, one-of-a kind kids' adoption book we have needed.<P>Although a " feel good" book, there is nothing sterotypical about how adoption is discussed. The illustrations include and normalize all different type of families. <P>"I Don't Have Your Eyes" helps kids go beyond " blood" and "genes" as the only important ties between family members. Instead, Carrie gently points out, even more important, shared strengths and similarities. The book's concrete examples ( with a little dab of houmor) are delightful.<P>Congratulations to Ms. Kitze for carefully considering the needs of the adoption community as she publishes her 'adoption and empowerment- themed' books.<P>Beth O'Malley M.Ed adoptee and newly adoptive Mom ....</span>
