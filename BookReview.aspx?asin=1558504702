                    <span>In "Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72" Hunter Thompson, speaking about Hubert Humphrey said, "There is no way to grasp what a shallow, contemptible and hopelessly dishonest old hack Hubert Humphrey is until you've followed him around for a while." The same observation applies precisely and directly to the author of this text (another Democrat of the Hube's generation), Thomas "Tip" O'Neil.
<br />
<br />The book reads like a set of apologetics for congressional obstructionism, bloated Federal government, and an imperial congress. It should read that way, because that's just what it is. For all the many long years that O'Neil was in the congress he was a monument to the mechanisms and bloated government that have hopefully been swept away in the last 10 - 15 years. 
<br />
<br />Tip was corrupt and devisive. It often seemed that his very mode of speaking was calculated to aggravate listeners--the book's prose style sure feels that way. 
<br />
<br />O'Neil's alleged "wit" is on full display here and his shuck and jive Yankee simpleton "good ol' boyisms" are in the book for the viewing. O'Neil's so-called humor was pathetic, and frequently was comprised of long looping, elliptical non sequiturs. Please don't claim I don't get the joke; I get it, but none of it is funny.  
<br />
<br />The contrast that leaps most readily to my mind is between John Kennedy and O'Neil. Kennedy was a leader. He looked ahead to an ideal future and worked to achieve his goals regardless of the political penalty. He had principles and a core, and explained why his policies were important. O'Neil was a politician pure and simple, he enjoyed wielding power for power's sake, not necessarily to achieve a greater common future for America.
<br />
<br />The fact is that O'Neil was one of the classic obstructionists of the 20th century (he even obstructed governance when his own party held the White House). His "rules" as expressed in this book (rules which O'Neil in his muddleheaded way seems to believe pass for profundities) are little more than a recipe for patronage politics; they will not lead their practitioner to higher statesmanship. 
<br />
<br />A read of this book, and a careful examination of O'Neil's career will have you howling for congressional term limits. 
<br />
<br />The book's subtitle is also a giveaway: "The Rules of the Game." O'Neil saw politics as a "game," not a higher calling. 
<br />
<br />Tip, Hubert, Lyndon, Jimmy, and their greasy ilk are (mostly) gone from the scene. History has swept them away and placed them squarely where they belong on the ash heap of history. Still, this book is informative and important from an historian's viewpoint--it is a detailed view about how corrupt and contemptable mid-to-late 20th Century congressional "business as usual" really was. </span>

                    <span>Whether knocking on doors or meeting folks at the county fair, the best way to persuade people is the personal way. In this short but sweet book, former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neil shares a lifetime of stories to illustrate this important lesson. Even if you aren't an avid reader, you'll find it difficult to put this book down.

                    <span>The other reviews for this book amaze me... it seems that the other reviewers like their authors to relate common sense principles with a common thred of self-serving arrogance. <p>Tip said nothing in this book that everyone doesn't already know. And his constant references to himself in 3rd person get annoying by the 10th page. Who actually refers to themself as "a great man"???<p>Tip does.</span>

                    <span>To the uninformed, political popularity that arises from local power would seem to be due to extraordinary abilities in the economic and social power circles of geographic regions. In assessing the impact, however, of the geographic dispersion of power, what becomes evident from genealogical studies is that families grow in power and prestige from intentional, and sometimes, discriminatory and malicious exlusion where power is meant to be concentrated within the "family group," sometimes extended to friends, and even sometimes, to female family members, etc. Contrary to the popular Soprano perspective of increasing power blocs to thwart competition, it is often the usurping of power by closely knit unrelated forceful groups that have been able to break the chain of privileged, presumptive entitlement created by the social aristocracy from which pre-19th Century economic wealth has grown, and often continues to be reserved like the fine champagne it is, and has always been. The difficulty of extending the benefits of these fine wines of privilege arises in the knowledge vacuum of the ever growing pyramid of members unaware of their heritage, and their potential inclusion, thereby winnowing benefits to ever, smaller groups of the noticeably "well bred, and therefore, well educated." The antithesis of democratic equality therefore operates only as a parallel universe, a poor relative, to the long ago entrenched, forcing greater stress among all those left behind, and supposed to be included, to ever greater methods of producing influence to share in the producive resources available. This strain on democracy results in local strangleholds by political players desperate to combat the forces of the closed society that has evolved as America where geographically local rules govern success. To some purists, then, the fact that all politics is local is not successful democracy but a demonstration of a failed democracy as an idealistic form of government.</span>
