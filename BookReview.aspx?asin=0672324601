                    <span>I'm coming from a solid VBA background and am now switching gears and decided to learn Java.  I found this book to be at a good pace and the humor helps to keep you from becoming too frustrated.  It certainly takes more than 24 hours, but I don't think the title was meant literally.  It took me about 3-4 months to get through it and that's skipping the last 4 chapters, which deal with graphics & sound, stuff I don't really need yet.  I have a day job, which involves programming, so I couldn't do it everyday or I'd would have gotten burned out.  </span>

                    <span>This is the book where I first learnt about arrays and OOP. Starting with an example with the tochararray function was really confusing. This book just fired information. You might like that, but the details are hard to understand. 
<br />Even now, I still don't understand OOP. 
<br />Functions presented to you aren't really done well. I found too many of the "it'll be later explained in later chapters" way too hard to follow. You aren't even ready for that stuff. Can't you have better examples; examples that don't need the advanced stuff?
<br />Arrays. It was too confusing about multidimensional and singular arrays. 
<br />I gave this book up before the end of the hour on OOP
<br />I can't recommend this book if you want to learn JAVA as another language to know. Although I haven't read the one in 21 days, it should be relatively better. I didn't understand my fave lang. C by Tony Zhang writing in 24 hours, but with the guys in 21 days. 
<br />
<br />Overall, this is not a good book; it doesn't seem like any of the 24 hours books is any good.</span>

                    <span>I agree with a spotlight post that said the author skimmed over difficult areas and spent too much time on easy areas. I am a beginner but have some experience in JavaScript and VB, but I found myself ready to throw this book out the window and burn it at times. How to use boolean operators are not explained, threaded programs are not given enough detail, and the best part of the language, applets, are hardly mentioned throughout the book! I don't recommend this book to others.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up to expand on my C and C++ knowledge and learn the current (at the time) implementation of Java.  Some information is presented very well, while other sections of the book just give a cursory explanation of the material and quickly move along.  For example, the sections on using Swing to create a GUI was very detailed, while the section on responding to events from your GUI was not as clear.  Complete-program examples are provided throughout the book, which is must better than just code snippets.  The author does a good job of introducing references online where you can get help on your own.  I really enjoyed the author's writing style, with just enough humor to keep things interesting.  This book is fine for a "quick fix", but to really learn the language, I would recomment the Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days book (4th edition), which this author co-wrote with Laura Lemay.</span>
