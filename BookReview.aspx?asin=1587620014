                    <span>This book was obviously written at the peak of the internet "Boom". The majority of the companies cited as examples of the onslaught of the new economy are no longer in existence. Earnings are barely mentioned. Companies cited as the movers and shakers of tomorrow are now penny stocks. The total lack of balance relative to other sectors is appalling and in retrospect is by itself educational. Everyone bought into the hype including the entire VC industry. This might explain why they all sat on the sideline in 2001 trying to regain their sense of direction. The entertainment value is a 5 and the educational value a 1. It is your choice.</span>

                    <span>I was very impressed by the knowledge in this book. It has a ton of useful information for everyone from entrepreneurs to investors to other financial professionals. In addition, the content is fresh and much more applicable to the "after the shakedown" landscape than other venture capital oriented books such as eBoys, Confessions of a Venture Capitalist and Done Deals. This is a great book that has a ton of useful information straight from some very accomplised venture capitalists.</span>

                    <span>10,000 years ago there was a civilization where people would throw money onto the street and it would turn into huge castles and fat bank accounts. Then there was an unknown worldwide catastrophe and that world completely disappeared. Later on a book was discovered where the people throwing all the money around told their stories, oblivious to the coming world catastrophe. Its fascinating to see inside the minds of these primitive humans.</span>

                    <span>This is an extremely unique and exciting book. I have always had questions for venture capitalists, and reading this book answered many of them. The style is clear, and it is very easy to understand. The interviews have obviously been conducted meticulously, and very good questions are asked. If you run an internet business or are going to have any future interaction with venture capitalists, you would be silly not to pick this up and read it.</span>
