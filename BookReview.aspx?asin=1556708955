                    <span>Where I'm coming from-- I have an associates degree in photography, and I worked as a photographer through my college years. It's been about 10 years since I took pictures for a living, but I still shoot lots of film and read a couple photo books a year to keep current. <P>If you are an experienced photographer: This book is NOT a technical guide, it's more of a style guide. I found this book useful for reminding me about the basic principles that make great people pictures--get close, use natural light, shoot lots of film, etc. I'm adding the book to my collection, but you may want to rent it from your library.<P>If you are a new photographer: I think you'll find this book very helpful. It doesn't dwell on techno mumbo-jumbo, and it explains how to get great pictures without special, expensive equipment. The lessons are also useful for inspiring you to "just do it." Simply put, it is the BEST book I've ever read for baby photography, and I think you'll love it as much as I did!</span>

                    <span>Do you love your children? Do you wish to have good pictures of them, without hiring a professional photographer? Without learning about f-stops and ASA?<P>THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.<P>It's easy to read, and fast - no technical words inside - written for sleep deprived fathers and mothers. The book shows how you can shoot the best pictures of your baby without buying anything: simply stated, put the baby next to a window (find the right light), get closer to the subject, and switch the flash off. Inexpensive, isnt'it? Well, there's another hint: shoot more films! (Yes, this is a little bit more expensive, but it's nothing, compared to the price of hiring a professional photographer.)<P>Where's the magic? These simple hints help avoiding all the common mistakes amateurs do.<P>You can find in the book also funny, brilliant ideas, tips and tricks to take pictures that will definitely constitute your family photo-treasure.<P>The author is quite honest saying that most of the pictures in the book were really shot using a professional lighting system; I think there is no hope to get the same superb results at home, but this is not the point. If you need perfect, professional photo of your baby,<P>go to a professional photographer.<P>But if you want get the best picture of the teeny-tiny with your existing equipment, this is the book for you. More over, you are the only person that knows every breath of your baby and you are always next to him/her. A professional photographer owns a expensive equipment and has a lot of technical knowledge, but cannot be next to you everytime and surely nobody loves your baby more than you!</span>

                    <span>I flipped through this book at a store and was so amazed. Full-color, great presentation of deceptively simple ideas. His premise is this - - Amatuers take medicore photos because they: <BR>**Don't shoot enough film. (Take more pictures!)<BR>**Don't get close-enough to the subject (use your zoom! get close!)<BR>**Use flash (turn your flash off!)<P>This is a great, easy book with real tips and you will amaze yourself at how much you improve your photos after reading this.<P>The only shortfall, as I recall, is that he doesn't include tips on photo-finishing. A good picture is dimished with a bad print. Some advice on how to deal with your photo lab, how to find a good one, and how to request different types of boarders and papers would be excellent.</span>

I not only got great ideas from the book but it also helped me understand lighting and gave me a better understanding for my camera. Thank you Nick Kelsh!</span>
