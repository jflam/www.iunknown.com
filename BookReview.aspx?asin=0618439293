                    <span>Having finally finished, "Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy", I see now that the 2005 Newbery year was one filled with books for older child readers.  Whether those readers are into racism or autism, the subject matter of the winners was particularly complex and mature.  And in none of these winners is the subject more mature than in "Lizzie Bright".  Basing this tale on the true events that occurred on Malaga Island, just off the coast of Maine, the story is a thoughtful look at the meaning of racism, friendship, human connection, and loss.  It's not going to strike the kids who read it as a cheery devil-may-care book.  But its magnificent writing keeps it from becoming another "Kira-kira" sob-fest.  In any case, it's the kind of story that'll give you reason enough to stop, think, and consider.
<br />	
<br />According to Turner Buckminster's calculations, he was in his new home of Phippsburg, Maine for approximately fifteen minutes shy of six hours when he realized that, "he didn't know how much longer he could stand it".  For one thing, he's the son of the town's new minister.  And when you're the minister's son you're expected to be the soul of virtue.  Turner's not a bad kid, but he has a heck of a way of getting into trouble.  It's only when he escapes to the seacoast and meets Lizzie Bright Griffin that things start to look up.  Lizzie's one of the black people living on the tiny island of Malaga, just off the coast of Phippsburg.  It's a poor community (this is 1912, after all), but they get by.  Unfortunately, the town's been losing money and it seems the Buckminsters have been hired by the city's fathers to help them in their goal of ridding Malaga of its inhabitants so as to set it up as a tourism site.  That means throwing Lizzie and all her neighbors off the only home they've ever known.  As Turner comes to terms with what it means to shrug off the scandalized eyes of the townspeople, as well as his parents' disapproval, he learns that for all the sorrows life may hand you, there can sometimes be salvation in the blink of a whale's mysterious eye.
<br />	
<br />Now there's some pretty heavy-handed subject matter going on here.  You have perfectly nice little old ladies and young lively black kids being carted off to insane asylums (1912 insane asylums at that).  You have several major characters die, usually off-camera, without so much as a howdy-doo.  You have evil presented as godliness (topical considering the times in which we live), and the good of the almighty dollar aligned with God's supposed will.  And that's not even touching on the racism issues, the human rights issues, and the rights children have in the eyes of the law.  This is a book about bullies and how one stands up to them.  I think what I really loved about "Lizzie Bright" was that Schmidt never took the easy road out.  There aren't any miracles here or unexpected changes of heart (save one, but it's believable).  People in this book are a set of contradictions, but for all that they do bad things they may not always be bad people per say.  Bad things happen to good people, and they happen a lot.  If you don't want your kids to know this, then you may as well grab the nearest Dick and Jane compendium and pretend that history never happened.  But if you want to give them a well-informed, sometimes dark, but always interesting novel to peruse, this is it.
<br />	
<br />Now I did have some qualms here and there.  There's nothing I hate more than an author/filmmaker/playwright/etc. who relies on that old "magical-black-friend" motif.  You know the one I'm talking about.  You'll find it in any story where an uptight white person meets someone of a different race and suddenly gets in touch with the earth/their feelings/what's really important/and so on.  And there is a bit of that here.  There's also the fact that there's rarely a black person in this book who comes off as anything but saintly.  I like my characters to have a little depth to them.  A little good and bad.  But here the blacks sort of fall under the "victim" banner and never leave it.  I wish they had as much complexity as, say, Turner's preacher father, but there doesn't seem to be much chance of that.  Still, Lizzie's okay.  She's kind of a likable version of that gawdawful "Ida B" (another children's book that came out in 2004 and that you should avoid at all costs).  Lizzie gets mad at inappropriate times and she's never as nice to Turner as she should be, so when I say that the African-Americans in this tale never show enough depth, I'm excluding the title character.  Lizzie's a fascinating character, and one that you wish you saw more of.
<br />	
<br />This is a book to spark some highly hepped up debates.  You may well find yourself shaking with anger on one page and sighing with infinite relief on the next.  Schmidt really defines himself here as one of the finest children's authors living today.  When you read the line of a character who asks, "So, Turner Buckminster III, when you look through the number at the end of your name, does it seem like you're looking through prison bars?", you cannot help but smile.  Perhaps this book will not be remembered as Schmidt's best, though.  I have a feeling that as an author he'll have a lot more to say to the children of the world.  Let's hope they're bright enough to listen.

                    <span>This book is clearly a quiet winner.  It is one that slowly catches your attention, and then it will not let it go.  The word that keeps entering my mind is quiet.  There is racism, religion, and other "ugly" elements to this book yet all of these issues seem somehow quiet to me.  
<br />
<br />I would have liked the friendship of the boy and Lizzie to  unravel a bit longer, but I did find it believable.  The more I read, the desire to read more became louder. I definately think this is a book that is meant more for older adolescents, but even sixth graders could enjoy it with minimal guidance.  Overall, I want to read more from this author and I hope to see more books like this one out.</span>

                    <span>Though Lizzie Bright, like Kira Kira, will be better received by young adults, the writing is far superior to the depressing formula of the latter. There is a lot of poetic prose and interesting character developments in this historical piece about religious life in Maine during the early 20th century. I still wouldn't think that Lizzie Bright is Newbery worthy because it is too heavy themed with death, religious persecution, and the sentencing of the elderly to insane asylums. This would be an excellent novel to teach, however, if you were working on figurative language and character development. Outstanding writing from Mr. Schmidt.</span>

                    <span>"From so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."<br>--Charles Darwin, THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES <p>"Like angels appearing in the sky,<br>whales are proof of God."<br>--Cynthia Rylant, THE WHALES <p>Because it is based upon a series of true, race-related events in Maine during the early 1900s, LIZZIE BRIGHT AND THE BUCKMINSTER BOY might make you think of Karen Hesse's WITNESS. Several of the "good guy" characters--Mrs. Carr and the elder Mrs. Hurd, for example--have a charm reminiscent of the idiosyncratic folk in BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE. But, because of the depth of the evil behind the tragic real events upon which the fictional story of Lizzie and Turner is built, the feelings of despair and anger with which we're left evoke memories of such books as MISSISSIPPI TRIAL, 1955 and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. <p>The enchanting Lizzie Bright Griffin, a girl of great strength and few words, belongs to the youngest of many generations of African Americans who have called Malaga Island home. <p>"Lizzie held close against her grandfather as the people of Malaga Island came out from the pine woods, gathered around their preacher on the shore to hear what had been said. Before they turned, Lizzie felt her grandfather ebb as though his soul were passing out of him, the way the last waves of a falling tide pass into still air and are gone. "She took a deep breath, and she wasn't just breathing in the air. She breathed in the waves, the sea grass, the pines, the pale lichens on the granite, the sweet shimmering of the pebbles dragged back and forth in the surf, the fish hawk diving to the waves, the dolphin jumping out of them.<br>"She would not ebb.<br>"Then she turned with her grandfather to tell the gathering people of Malaga that times had moved on, and they would have to leave their homes." <p>Across the water, on the mainland, Turner is the new kid in town. And even worse--from his perspective--he's the new minister's son. <p>"Turner Buckminster had lived in Phippsburg, Maine, for almost six whole hours.<br>"He didn't know how much longer he could stand it." <p>Here, as with the fight over the towers in Elaine Konigsburg's THE OUTCASTS OF 19 SCHUYLER PLACE, the root of conflict involves money and property values. Phippsburg's shipbuilding industry is dying, and the local "boys with the bucks" reckon that tourism may be the source of future prosperity if only the "less desirable" portion of the community can be run out of town. <p>" 'Would you look at that monkey go? Look at her go. She climbing down or falling?' Deacon Hurd watched the last leap to the ground. 'Sheriff Elwell, I believe she thought you might shoot her.'<br>" 'Wouldn't have been any trouble, Mr. Hurd. One less colored in the world.' " <p>The character who is most difficult to decipher in this story of Turner's coming of age is his father. Reverend Buckminster was hired by the church leadership and is supposed to be serving God. However, he is being pulled in various directions: by the white community, by his own knowledge and conscience (or sometimes lack thereof), and by the beliefs of the maturing son he apparently loves, albeit in a stiff, 1912 Congregationalist ministerial fashion. <p>"And suddenly, Turner had a thought that had never occurred to him before: he wondered if his father really believed a single thing he was saying.<br>"And suddenly, Turner had a second thought that had never occurred to him before: he wondered if he believed a single thing his father was saying." <p>Reverend Buckminster is but one of several characters who end up throwing Turner a curveball. <p>The innocent, against-all-odds friendship that develops between Turner and Lizzie repeatedly caused me shivers, delight, and despair. It is first among the many reasons why LIZZIE BRIGHT AND THE BUCKMINSTER BOY is an entertaining and important piece of YA historic fiction. (...)</span>
