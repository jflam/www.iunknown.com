                    <span>Revealing autobiography of the scientist who transformed the world by synthesizing the Pill.<br>"I have no regrets that the Pill has contributed to the sexual revolution of our time and perhaps expedited it, because most of those changes in sexual mores would have happened anyway."<p>Djerassi give us an incisive picture of his personal life. But the biggest part of this book tells the intriguing story of the synthesizing of the Pill and the problems to prove that there were only minor side-effects: a battle with the FDA. A good lesson for every scientist.<br>He is perhaps too harsh for the environmental fundamentalist. But he remarks among other things that "... in general, life in the modern industrial world has not contributed to increased death from cancer", and that "99.9 percent of all pesticides consumed by humans are derived not from synthetics but rather from the plants themselves".<br>Also interesting is the story of the Pugwash Conference, whose altruistic goal was corrupted by a struggle between the cold war warriors.<br>His biggest confession "At heart, I'm still a gambler."<br>Excellent work, not only for scientists.</span>

                    <span>To read from the works of Carl Djerassi is to sample the mind of a creative genius the breadth of whose life activities spans scientific research to writing fiction and plays. His autobiography is best read in  the context of some of his other works.  This review of his autobiography  will reference two of his works of fiction, The Bourbaki Gambit, and NO.     <p>These books will never be on the best seller lists. Yet it precisely  because of this that they should be read by scientists and engineers as  food for thought. These books grew on me. By the time that I had finished  them, I had experienced compelling plot lines. More importantly I had  experienced the emotions of scientists at the beginnings and ends of their  careers. Is Djerassi, at an age where many are spending their days playing  golf or reliving their pasts, using science in fiction as metaphor for his  own career? Is not the promise of the medical advances of the last several  decades the time and the vitality to explore new horizons and to boldly  embark on a new career, rather than to ride quietly into the sunset? If  nothing else, these works celebrate creative solutions to how one manages  one's career throughout one's life.<p>The Bourbaki Gambit has Max Weiss,  professor of chemistry at Princeton University, being forced into a  retirement that he neither wants nor is prepared for. Stunned at a sudden  loss of all that has been his life, Max considers others in his predicament  and hatches a plan to show that retirement age does not mean the end of  contributions. The plan? Nothing less than to jointly make a fabulous  scientific discovery, and publish it as a sole, fictitious author. Does the  plan work? Read the book.  <p>If this was all you read, you might be  tempted to say that this is the swan song of an old professor, but NO takes  us to the other end of the spectrum. The device for this book is the  molecule nitric oxide, which is active in many physiological processes.  Specifically this book is a fictionalized account of the development and  commercialization of a predecessor to Viagra. urialism. In the end, both  husband and wife fulfill their careers by going full circle. <p>To better  understand these works as metaphors for a scientific career, you must read  Dieresis's autobiography.  The rather cumbersome title, The Pill, Pygmy  Chimps, and Degas' Horse, prepares the reader for what comes -- a highly  readable journey through a series of defining events in his life.   Question:  is it better to read the fiction first, or the autobiography?   Clearly this is a man the power of whose ideas transcends science or  literature.  Approach the autobiography as an insight into his mind.  From  persecution in 1930's Vienna as a teenager; to dealing with the provincial  culture of the Mid West at the outset of World War II; to performing world  class chemical synthesis from an isolated setting in Mexico in the early  1950's (activities which led to the synthesis of compounds that ultimately  became the oral contraceptive); Carl Djerassi defined his surroundings.   Lesser individuals may have been victims of their circumstances, but Carl  Djerassi took his surroundings and prevailed.    This is the message of  this autobiography.<p>Now back to the question -- which to read first.   Read the fiction first. Technologists can enjoy these as stories that speak  to them.  An engineer nearing retirement will immediately bond with Max  Weiss, who struggles with the complexities of retirement.  A young  technologist, one contemplating entrepreneurship, or a dual career couple  will find kinship with the protagonists in NO as they struggle with  pursuing their visions.  Then read the autobiography. What makes the  stories so good is that he is writing from experience.  The young  technologists in NO, working in Israel, could be the young Djerassi working  in Mexico City.  Max Weiss could be Djerassi at a Gordon Conference poking  fun at priority at any cost mentality of some scientists. And the ever cool  Diana Doyle-Ditmus represents the ideal for an intellectually and  physically active senior lifestyle.  <p>These books, read either as a set  or individually, can be an inspiration to technologists at any point in  their career.</span>
