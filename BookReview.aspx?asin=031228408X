                    <span>Okay, there is some interesting information here, but there's also quite a bit of fiction. Too often, the author infers the state of mind of his subjects. So he was a friend of Miles. Was he also psychic?<p>I agree with another reviewer that the book is fawning. While the author of this book ascribes much of Miles' anti-social behavior to principle, still another reviewer correctly points out that it actually reveals him to be a jerk. The author's adoration of Miles taints his objectivity. The result is an unwitting and failed attempt at a snow job.<p>Ashley Kahn's book on the making of Kind of Blue (which see) is not as adulatory, but in attempting to include musical information Kahn makes many errors, and glosses over the numerous mistakes Columbia Records made in recording and releasing the album.<p>Browse through this book for the fun of it, if you're amused by fairy tales and delight in the hype of a press release.</span>

                    <span>A 200+ page book about one album may seem like overkill, no matter how influential and good the album is.  Which is one of the main problems with the book.<p>So come prepared if you decide to read this book.  It is not meant for the casual music fan.  Also, you should listen to the CD several times, before, during and after reading this book.<p>Nisenson does a good history on the musical background of the record.  His bios of Evans, Adderly and Coltrane are well-researched and thoughtful.  <p>Nisenson goes into the race issue but in 2003, his ideas come across as stereotyping.  His theories are bogus, as is all racism and stereotyping.  You don't have to be white to be a great classical musician, why does jazz reflect being black.<p>He tries to paint a balanced picture of Miles Davis, although he fawns way too much.  Nisenson seems to fawn way too much, justifying Davis' pettiness and cruelty as part of his genius.  Davis may have been wonderful in his music, but otherwise, he was a jerk.  Nisenson says that Davis always tried to make his music accessible to the public, but never explains adequately why he ignored the audience in a performance.  He says that Miles called that "minstrelsy", but other performers with similar talents and egos never saw it that way.  <p>Kind of Blue was revolutionary in its use of modes instead of chord changes.  To understand this, you need a great proficiency in music theory.<p>Nisenson writes about Adderly, Evans and Coltrane until their deaths (all of them passed away at a fairly early age).  He drops Davis after the 60s.<p>The writing here annoyed me for another reason, Nisenson constantly uses "I" throughout the book.  This is totally unnecessary.</span>

                    <span>Interesting read but it feels like the author skims by the information a bit too quickly.  Deals a lot with the implications of Kind of Blue on later musicians and on how a lot on how the Kind of Blue sessions came about (both musically and physically).  The book also includes a chapter on each of the musicans included in the sessions (there is a chapter on Trane, Cannonball, Davis and Evans.  For some reason, Cobb, Chambers and Kelly don't warrant their own chapters).  I was sort of disappointed with the book overall as there wasn't a lot on the actual sessions themselves.  Good book for the general history of the sessions, but it if you want to dig deep you'll need something more.</span>

                    <span>Unlike other reviewers below, I haven't read the author's other books, so I have to judge this one on its own merit.  As far as his knowledge, he provides an excellent overview of various jazz styles and competent quick bios of the major players.  My problem is with the pastiche-like feel of the book.  It feels like the author slapped together a whole bunch of short encyclopedia articles, added some musical commentary and bang, had a book.  At times it feels less than professional -- he mentions the drug and dope band thing about 20 times, plus a bit of namedropping on all his personal meetings with Miles.  <p>Despite the fact it reads a bit like a late night college paper, I did learn a lot about jazz history, the lives of the players and the mood of the album.  The author knows his stuff in this regard.  If you're a big fan of the album, you'll cull some interesting information from this book.  Don't let the small writing problems get in your way.</span>

                    <span>This books reads like it is a collection of excerpts from the author's previous works on Miles and Trane, both of which are infinitely better than this book.  The other recent work by Kahn on the making of Kind of Blue is infinitely more informative and original.  Niesenson's book provides no real new information on the making of the album.  The sole redeeming virtue of the book is the chapter on George Russell.  Anyone who has struggled with Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept will appreciate Niesenson's attempt to explain how the "concept" helped shape the direction of Miles, Trane and Bill Evans.</span>
