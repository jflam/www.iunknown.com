                    <span>Eureka! What a find. Besides being a phenomenal ROADSIDE history book (best used with an automobile traveling the highways and byways), it is worth the purchase for the 100s of black & white photos that are found throughout the book. In my recent two week of travel through New Mexico there was not a ghost town, pueblo, town or city that was not expounded upon. <P>Folks, this is a wonderful book, and works best as a supplement to a good traveling guide (my recommendation is Fodor's New Mexico [see my review]). Now, I will admit that traveling guides usually have a brief sketch of the history of locations, but Roadside History expands that and the photos are priceless. Strongly recommended</span>

                    <span>This book is really fascinating. I was thinking about getting another book on the history of New Mexico but I wasn't quite sure about it. The sales clerk at a bookstore in Sante Fe recommended that I get this one.I didn't even see it until she pointed it out to me. Boy, am I glad she did!<BR> Once I started looking at it at the bookstore I found it so interesting that I could literally not stop reading it.I guess that was a good sign that I should buy it.<BR> My boyfriend and I have never been to New Mexico- and as we drove through little towns along the way I opened up the book and read about the history behind each town. It was very informative and helpful.<BR>It has great black and white photos and neat drawings that depict the historical events in a fascinating fashion.<BR> Every town is mentioned- even tiny ones that no one has ever heard of such as: Wagon Mound, Maxwell, Embudo, Watrous, Valmora, Tatum, Dora, Lingo, White Rock, etc....<BR> It mentions Los Alomos and the Manhattan Project, Taos, Albuquerque, etc...<BR>This book gives a history of each town, how and when it was founded, by whom, and in some cases how the town got its name.<BR>I highly recommend this book. You won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I quit reading the book right after the authors state that "Geronimo was never captured, unless he let himself be because hewanted a good meal..." This is highly insulting to Native Americans everywhere, and completely in error. For an Apache, being held captive was absolutely the worst form of torture imaginable (see "Once We Moved Like the Wind). Geronimo died in an 8X10 cell at Fort Sill, Oklahoma after being held prisoner for about 20 years. I was so incenced that I threw the book away.</span>

                    <span>This book guides the traveler/reader to interesting places in New Mexico that are also historic. It is set up so that someone driving along a road can read about the various towns and sites along that road. It is a great book that I found very useful to read and use. <P>Ginger</span>
