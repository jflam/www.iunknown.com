                <span id="Label1"><p align="left"> On February 6, 2001, my nine-year-old daughter happened to wander into the room during a television segment marking Ronald Reagan's ninetieth birthday. She watched for a moment. Then she turned to me and asked, "Dad, is that the President you worked for?" </p> <p align="left"> What answer could I give her? How could I make her see? I wanted my daughter to recognize that the world she inhabited was freer and more prosperous because of that old, old man on television. But I also wanted her to grasp my personal debt to him, to understand all that he taught me-how to work and how to relax, how to think and how to use words, how to be a good husband, how to approach life itself... </p> <p align="left"> I needed to tell my children how Ronald Reagan changed my life. </p> <p align="left"> In 1982, as a young man, Peter Robinson was hired as a speechwriter in the Reagan White House. During the six years that followed, he was one of a core group of writers who became informal experts on Reagan, absorbing not just his political positions but his personality, manner, and way of carrying himself And the example Reagan set-as a confident, passionate, principled, generous-spirited older man-molded Robinson's outlook just as he was coming into his own. "Hard work. A good marriage. A certain lightness of touch," he writes. "The longer I studied Ronald Reagan, the more lessons I learned." </p> <p align="left"> At the core of <i>How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life</i> are ten of the life lessons Robinson learned from the fortieth President-principles that have guided his own life ever since. But it also offers a warm and unforgettable portrait of a great yet ordinary man who touched the individuals around him as surely as he did his millions of admirers around the world. </p> <p align="left"> Drawing on journal entries from his days at the White House, as well as interviews with those who knew the President best, Robinson etches his portrait with fresh observations, telling detail, and that "certain lightness of touch" that recalls the master himself The result is nothing less than a love story-an account of the profound respect and affection that one young man came to feel for the President who changed his life forever. </p></span>

                    <span>This is the first book I've read about Ronald Reagan and I will definitely seek to discover more about our 40th President.  
<br />
<br />It is amazing how Peter Robinson's memories and experiences are intertwined to present a picture of man who proved that an individual can indeed change the world.  
<br />
<br />I found myself writing down quotes from the President and insights from Robinson so that I could further reflect on how I too could learn from the example that President Reagan set, not just as a leader but as a Godly man. 
<br />
<br />This is not just a book about the 40th President, but a book about just how influential certain people, with whom our life paths are intertwined, can be, if we allow it. By describing the consistent goodness of this man, Ronald Reagan, and by focusing on him as a person, I felt as if I too could sit down at Reagan's ranch under a live oak and feel comfortable.  
<br />
<br />I also liked how Robinson deeply reflected on the profound influences that Reagan had on all with whom he came into contact.  And although Reagan's own children had difficulty being close to him, I believe Robinson's book shows us how Reagan, through his life's daily example of belief in the goodness of man, can be a "father" somehow to us all. 
<br />
<br />In a time where now our own fellow Americans themselves are trashing our county's values and objecting to life here in the U.S (which I believe Reagan would be completely shocked about), this book is a reminder of who we all can be in the sphere in which we live.  Peter Robinson, we want more from you!  Keep writing!  
<br />
<br />It is truly a book that is so much more than meets the eye at first glance!</span>

                    <span>The moment I saw Peter Robinson on a television program touting this book, I knew I had to own it. While I was a child growing up during the Reagan administration, even then I was keenly aware of how great and enigmatic the fortieth president was. This book did give an excellent insider's view of the Reagan White House, including great stories and 'naming names' if you will. Yet Robinson also explored Reagan's weaknesses - his trouble connecting with his children as well as trusting those under him during Iran-Contra, even though his gut told him otherwise.<p>Bottom line - As great as Ronald Reagan was, he was still human with faults and imperfections all his own. The important lesson is not what happens when you fall - we all do - but how you respond. Reagan came back from an assassination attempt and political scandal. He had a job to do and a Cold War to win. You need only to look at the people who lined the streets and filled the rotunda during the week of remembrance to see the result.</span>

                    <span>The central question of Robinson's book is, "How did Reagan do it?" <p>Robinson's personal observations while working for President Reagan along with interviews with friends and associates provides insight into the virtues and character of Ronald Reagan from which we can all learn. A prospective view, as it were, of Reagan's life for use today.<p>Robinson assumed Reagan's serenity was a result of his luck in life's lottery. A closer examination of the facts revealed a different case. Reagan's father was an alcoholic in a small Midwestern town at a time when the children of alcoholics "suffered a particular kind of hell." <p>Reagan's first wife, Jane Wyman, divorced him resulting in "the worse trauma of Reagan's life." <p>And then his movie career ended in his early forties leading to a television career (then considered a lesser medium) because he "needed the work." <p>Robinson's conclusion? "He was serene because he's been unlucky, learning to bring good from bad so thoroughly that he retained his equanimity even after an attempt on his life."  <p>Through a series of aphorisms Robinson draws lessons from the life of Ronald Reagan: "When life buries you, dig." "Do your work." "Life is a drama. Do something." "A bias for action." "Words matter." "You have a head. Use it." "Easy does it." "Laughter is a profession of faith." "Say your prayers." "You matter."<p>Reagan's former work as a lifeguard and actor figured prominently in the development of his character. As a lifeguard he had saved the lives of seventy-seven swimmers in the Rock River.   In contrast to Marxism's belief in the inevitability of history, Reagan had personal experience that one person can make a difference in the lives of others and in history. <p>As an actor Reagan became accustomed to the idea of alternative endings.  A fellow speechwriter put it this way, "He understands open-endedness and contingency. He sees life is a drama in which a lot of scenes still haven't been written." <p>During Robinson's tenure at the White House there was posted on a  White House bulletin board a card which read, "Pray as if everything depended on God. Work as if everything depended on you."  <p>This unattributed aphorism of faith and free will was first coined by St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits.   Robinson writes of that motto, "That, I thought, was a neat summary of the way Ronald Reagan led his life, and ever since I've recognized that habit or pattern of life as an ideal." <p>The United States was blessed to have Ronald Reagan serve as our fortieth President. As his old adversary Mikhail Gorbachev stated, "If someone else had been in his place, I don't know if what happened would have happened."</span>

                    <span>As I am writing this review I am listening to the Reagan Funeral.  When I read this book written by Mr. Robinson I was inspired beyond all measure.  My wife and I were expecting our first child and I told my wife due to the writing of this book we will name our son witht he middle name Reagan.  She agreed!  This book opened my eyes and my heart to a world from which I lived in, but could not comprehend.  Mr. Robinson thank you for writing such a book!  Mr. Reagan thank you for your leadership.  My son was born May 26, 2004, and his name is Luke Reagan Burkholder.</span>
