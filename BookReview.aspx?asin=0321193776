                <span id="Label1"><P>With its ever tightening integration with Adobe's full suite of creative products and its own increasingly sophisticated feature set, InDesign is winning legions of Quark converts. If you're among them--or if you've decided to sidestep those programs altogether--you need this book! In these pages, the Adobe Creative Team uses a series of project-based lessons, tested in the company's own classrooms and labs, to provide a thorough grounding in the InDesign school of page design. You'll find step-by-step lessons in InDesign CS fundamentals plus plenty of the advanced tips and techniques you need to take your page designs to the next level. The workbook-style format includes self-paced lessons followed by review questions to reinforce the knowledge and a CD with all of the files required to complete the book's projects. Throughout, special focus is given to the features new to InDesign CS: an updated Story Editor, nested styles, separation previews, the Package for GoLive command, and more. </P></span>

I tested this book with my first class recently and the exercises worked flawlessly.

                    <span>This book truly is a nice introduction to Adobe's InDesign CS. The chapters are well-laid out and the exercises are beautiful in their design and in their completion.<P>However, there appear to be ongoing problems with those who edit the "Classroom In A Book" series. As they add or change exercises over successive editions, they neglect the opportunity to validate their end result. As a result, the feeling one gets when realizing things do not work as described is similar to the feeling one has when purchasing an expensive car only to have it in the shop numerous times due to manufacturing defects.<BR> <BR>For instance, I jumped to chapter 11 to find out more about interactive documents (due to my general familiarity to desktop publishing) to find that the picture on page 393 has an incorrect document name (it should read "11_interactive.indd" from the renaming we were told to perform three pages earlier).<BR> <BR>I then jumped to chapter 14 to continue work on making PDF's only to find that five pages in, we are told to work with a file that does not exist anywhere, "flowers_screen.pdf". Three instructions further down, the correct name is dropped in again, "desserts_screen.pdf", as though nothing had ever been wrongly said in the first place. Other problems within that chapter include a note on page 464 that incorrectly describes the need to use the shift key to get a browser to appear (for me, the browser comes up in a separate window without the key) and a supposedly "final" screen shot without the proper results (page 466).<BR> <BR>These types of errors create functional problems when learning. There are other editing problems that do not impact or detract from the experience, such as wrongly bolding a period on page 90, wrongly stating an option as "Beveled" instead of "Bevel" on page 401, or a misplaced colon when describing the "Vertical Justification Align:" area on page 402. But know there are other functional problems throughout the book, too.<P>This book is much better edited than their "GoLive CS Classroom In A Book", which had to be removed from publication due to the sheer number of extreme problems (see the full series of reviews here on Amazon and the ongoing thread at the Adobe GoLive forum). However, both books smack of what appears to be a general lack of pride in their work. Perhaps because it is written by actual Adobe employees, they believe they are beyond the need to validate anything. Adobe Press has yet to issue errata on any book they've published, so don't expect help from the publisher or Adobe.<P>I would definitely purchase this book, but be aware that you will find yourself wondering how anyone could have let through such obvious flaws.</span>

                    <span>InDesign is Adobe's replacement for PageMaker. I acquired the program as part of Creative Suite Premium. I had no exposure to page layout programs prior to delving into this book. Through the concise lessons, the clear and direct writing style and some very good examples, I've become enthralled with the program.<P>I've used other books in this series and this volume is just as helpful as the other Classroom in a Book installments. You are not hand held the entire way, but you are provided with enough direction that you feel as if there is an instructor right beside you. After completing the first real lesson, I felt confident enough to take on several design jobs and work them on my own. The lesson examples are all practical, yet there is a lightheartedness to the samples that makes the lessons all the more enjoyable. Read the story in the fictitious "Sonata Cycle News" for an example.<P>In addition to page layout, InDesign is a feature rich art program. Adobe provides good instruction on using these features, but you are also reminded that PhotoShop and Illustrator are the preferred professional tools for graphics work. This may be the one weak point in the book, but it is also a strong point: Adobe promotes the other tools found in the Creative Suite. Personally, I have no gripe with this promotion as Adobe does teach you how to use the drawing tools that are native to InDesign and how to use these same tools to improve generic canned clipart images. I was amazed at the complex artwork InDesign is capable of producing.<P>In the latter stages of the book, the user is introduced to creating interactive pages, preparing documents for publication and / or distribution as a PDF. Some may object to this as self-promotion, but PDF documents are becoming a more common means of distribution. This volume is not a primer on PDF production, but rather how to prepare you work for easier transition to PDF. With the exception of the interactive features, many of these same rules apply if the final document is being sent to a print bureau for high quality / volume reproduction. Even if you are producing small quantities, the quality tips are invaluable.<P>I give the book full marks for being readable, imparting more than a casual knowledge of the program to the user and being fairly priced. The lesson progression is logical and the projects are well paced. The book, like the program, is capable of standing on it's own, but if there is a feature that particularly attracts you, you may wish to purchase some additional training material emphasizing that skill.</span>

                    <span>If you really want to learn, and you are patient and go through each lesson, you will get just as much training as the expensive instructor led courses. I have never used page layout or publishing software and I am feeling more proficient with each lesson. This is my third Classroom in the Book purchase and I rate it as good as any of the beginner training courses on the same titles. Matter of fact, the only course I took was Photoshop 7 for beginners, and the instructor taught from the Photoshop 7 Classroom In A Book.</span>
