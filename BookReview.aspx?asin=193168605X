                    <span>The Action Hero's Handbook is a fascinating little book. While<BR>I was a little disappointed in the Vulcan Nerve Pinch and the <BR>Jedi Mind Trick, the rest of the book had very interesting<BR>and potentially useful information like, how to get out<BR>of handcuffs and how to escape a sinking cruise ship.<P>This is a great book to give to people who live unusual<BR>lives or a book to buy for yourself if you're the kind of <BR>person who travels or just find adventure wherever you<BR>go. You might not have a great need to catch a white<BR>shark, but it's always possible these days to encounter<BR>someone with a gun that you may need to disarm or deal with<BR>an intoxicated driver who seems bent on running you over, <BR>and the Action Hero's Handbook tells you what to do in both circumstances.<P>As great as the book is, I gave it four stars only because a <BR>few minor things are missing: for example, while the book tells you how to avoid getting hit by a car or a truck, it doesn't cover SUVs, which to me is an important little detail. But overall, it's a great book to have.</span>

                    <span>This book is from the creators of The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook series and is in the same tongue-in-cheek style of presenting valuable information. This time around, the focus is on skills that can turn you into an Action Hero. It covers such topics as how to catch a great white shark, perform the Vulcan Nerve Pinch, take a bullet, and how to dirty dance. All the information comes from experts in their field, be they detectives, stuntmen, surgeons, pilots, and wedding planners. Recommended.</span>

                    <span>This brilliant book expands on the previous Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook series and adds humour to what was previously a rather boring instructions you'd find in a box of something you were going to put together type series. In The Action Hero's Handbook the authors pretend you the reader want to be an action hero and guide you step by step through how to spy proof your hotel room, survive being run over by a truck, save someone hanging off the side of a cliff and other stuff your not likely to do in real life but would if you were an action hero like James Bond, Rambo and other action characters. <P>This book is not afraid to make fun of its advice which previously wasn't done in the Worst-Case Scenario series by the authors although certainly was by readers. There's a lot more advice in here as well. Even if you don't want to be an action hero you'll still laugh you head off from cover to cover. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>When my brother loaned me his copy of this book I was definitely intrigued. Then when I started reading it, I just could not put it down. I loved it so much I just had to get my own copy. It has all sorts of useful information including: how to disarm a thug with a gun, how to save someone from falling off a cliff, how to pick up someone in a bar, how to secure and read a crime scene, how to fight off a ghost, and how to make a clean getaway. So, if you're thinking of becoming an action hero or you just want a good book that is both entertaining and helpful, then this one is a definite must have.</span>
