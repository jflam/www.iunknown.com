                    <span>Couldn't help but put my 2 cents in here.  My 3 year old daughter was given this book about a month ago and we've read it at least 5 times a week since.<p>She has a bookshelf full of fun books (pop-up, little golden books, dr. suess etc) but she chooses this book again and again.<p>I just noticed this week that if I start a sentance from the book, she can finish it w/o hesitation.  We went thru the entire book this way.  At age 3, she's saying things from the book like, "they are one for a penny", "how much money do you have"...hearing a 3 year old talk about arithmetic is also amusing.  She can almost recite the entire book, just about word for word, and she's only had it a short while.  I can certainly see the potential here and I never say no to reading it.  She can now spell cat and is working on dog.  It really is all about repetition, and this book allows just enough details to keep parents reading it.</span>

                    <span>"Morris the Moose Goes to School" is a fun story that kids enjoy reading and listening to. I remembered reading and loving the book from when I was a child, so I bought the book for my own children. It has been a great book to use in teaching them how to read, because it holds their interest, they want to read it because it is funny. "</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for children to read. Before I started Kindergarten 15 yrs. ago(I'm 20 now), my sister taught me to read this book. She was 7 yrs old and thus was attending school and I wanted to learn to read. This book, taught me a little about ABC's, counting, and what it was like to attend school...except for the moose being there of course! I remember Morris trying to hide but his antlers kept sticking out.LOL! When I finally started Kindergarten, myself and a fellow classmate Becky were the only two students capable of reading large words and regular books. I believe that this was because of the foundation layed out by this book... it made reading fun.I recommend this book and would actually like to get my hands on it if I could!</span>

                    <span>Morris the moose goes to school is a great book.  At first Morris does not know what the teacher is talking about because he never went to school.  But then he goes to school and learns how to read and count.  He isn't very smart at the first part of the book, but by the end of the book he is much smarter.  He loves going to school!  Morris learns a lot and YOU will LEARN alot too.  I take this book in the car when we go places.  I like this book because I can read it by myself. YOU will LEARN alot about Morris if you choose this book.</span>

                    <span>"Morris Goes to School," is a story about a Moose who at first doesn't know how to read or count.  At the beginning of the story Morris goes to the "Fish" store to by candy.  The clerk tells him he's in the wrong place and sends him to the "Candy" store.  When Morris goes to the candy store, the clerk tells him the candy is a penny a piece.  Morris counts his money, but counts it wrong.  The man asks Morris if he went to school, and Morris said, "no."  So the man takes him to school, where he learns how to read and count.  Morris then goes to the "candy" store and gives exactly five cents for five gumdrops.  This story teaches children that by going to school, you can learn things that you might not have known if you didn't go.  It also teaches them, that everyone should have the right to go to school.  I recommend this book for everyone. It was always my favorite book, when I was a kid.</span>
