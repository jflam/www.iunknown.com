                <span id="Label1"><P> Are employee attitudes correlated with financial success? Unequivocally yes! according to consultant and bestselling author David H. Maister. Based on a worldwide survey of 139 offices in 29 professional service firms in numerous lines of business, Maister proves that companies perceived by their employees to practice what they preach in matters of client commitment, teamwork, high standards, and employee development are more successful than their competitors. Put simply, employee dedication causes improved financial performance. <P> Through in-depth interviews, Maister explores the crucial role of the individual manager in promoting high morale among employees. <I>Practice What You Preach</I> boasts specific action recommendations from the managers of these "superstar" businesses on how to build an energized workplace, enforce standards of excellence, develop people, and have fun -- all in the name of profit. As a result, <I>Practice What You Preach</I> can help any manager increase profitability, and provides proof that great financial rewards come from living up to the standards that most businesses advocate, but few achieve.</span>

                    <span>David Maister's latest book again breaks new ground. In "True Professionalism," he showed how authenticity in professional practice increased the satisfaction of both clients and practitioners. Now, with this impressive study, he presents sound empirical evidence that firms whose critical values and actual culture mesh, enjoy greater financial success. Amazing! But if some of these conclusions seem easily intuitive, then why do not most firms enjoy these results? Maister says the answer is they lack the courage to do those things the evidence suggests ought to be done. Having the courage to actually implement the strategy adopted and the values professed may be the key step to both the clients' and the firm's success.</span>

                    <span>The dust jacket suggests that Mister is "widely acknowledged as one of the world's leading authorities on the management of professional service firms." To me, his intellectual curiosity and reasoning skills resemble those of a highly-skilled anthropologist who has studied hundreds of cultures throughout the world inorder to understand why some are healthy and others are not. The results of his research are obviously of interest and value to professional service firms but also, in my opinion, of greater importance to organizations which are not (as literally defined) professional service firms. I presume to assert, moreover, that precisely the same values and principles which Maister affirms are those which characterize any healthy community. Specifically, one in which trust, respect, and integrity are cherished; in which there is an appropriate combination of fun and discipline; in which there is an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence; and one in which the development of each person is a shared commitment. <P>In this book, Maister shares the results of his study of 139 offices of 29 firms in 15 countries in 15 different lines of business. To the approximately 6,500 people who participated in this study, he asked "a simple question": Are employees' attitudes correlated with financial success? The answer is an unequivocal "Yes!" Maister already knows that the world's most highly admired companies (e.g. those at which competitors' employees seek employment) are also the most profitable and have the greatest cap value in their respective industries. "What is even more powerful, as the book shows, it is [employee] attitudes that drive financial results, and not (predominantly) the other way around. Why do so many people want to work for Southwest Airlines? The airlines' most frequent fliers know the answer: employee attitudes. It is no coincidence that Southwest Airlines has consistently out-performed all other airlines, financially and operationally, for more than 20 years.<P>Maister offers what he characterizes as "new evidence to support important, but perhaps familiar, conclusions. (Hence the book's title: the message is not to preach new things, but to practice what most managers and firms already preach.)...The summary is deferred until the latter portion of the book." As is his style, Maister urges his reader to be alert to "lessons" he (Maister) may have missed or failed to stress. He also urges the reader to judge for herself or himself which "lessons" are most important. For me, the most valuable material is found in Chapter 7 when Maister explains what he calls "The Predictive Package." He identifies and discusses nine key statements such as "Client satisfaction is a top priority in our firm." He suggests that affirmations of these nine statements "represent a great place to get started" and that is true IF everyone involved fully understands what the implications of each "key statement" are, especially insofar as each member of the organization is concerned. <P>In the last chapter, Maister observes: "People must believe that the manager has the courage to believe in something and, more importantly, the guts to stick with it. There is no greater condemnation of a manager than to say that he or she is expedient, and no greater commendation than to say that he or she truly lives and acts in accordance with what he or she preaches." I am reminded of the fact that Dante reserved the last and worst ring in Hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality. The manager Maister describes so well in Chapter 20 is also a leader....a moral leader, with or without title or social station...whose values and behavior nourish the lives of others. Although Maister's most recent study has finite evidence to support his affirmations, we need only reflect on our own abundance of experience to appreciate those affirmations and, more to the point, to then live our lives accordingly.</span>

                    <span>Heavy but invaluable reading, this book presents the results of author David H. Maister's study of 139 offices of 29 professional service - more specifically, marketing and communications - firms in 15 countries. His objective was to identify the attitudes that correlate most strongly with financial success. He found what's been known all along - that financial success correlates very strongly with the perceived good character and integrity of management. When employees believe that management practices what it preaches, they seem to give extra effort and get astonishing results. The idea that character counts as much as, or perhaps more than, structure and corporate policy will be hard for many to accept. It takes courage, commitment, faith and humility to become the kind of person this study recommends. But this information shows us that, to contradict baseball player Leo Durocher, nice guys finish first.</span>

                    <span>While there's definitely some value in the things he says about the relationships between work environment and client respect, it was hard to say that his use of statistics matched what I remember from college. It would've been worth either eliding the high-level use of statistics entirely or just subjugating larger sections on the correlations and significance to a detailed appendix -- like papers on new type systems, people want to know that the semantics are sound in detail, but don't necessarily want to see every proof of every lemma interspersed with the text.<P>Additionally, it wasn't clear how to turn this into anything other than personal action items. It was easy to understand that you should change things in your company, but there wasn't a ton of advice around how to actually make the changes suggested.</span>

                    <span>Despite having a wide body of experience in business criticism and a credible approach towards analyzing business culture, David Maister exhibits far too many episodes of 'statistical ignorance' in his conclusions and statements to capture my attention or even allow me to finish reading the book.<P>Perhaps the audience was not engineers, mathmeticians, or anyone else who know their way around 'correlations' and 'significance' -- I frankly don't know. But I can assure you that David could have dealt himself a greater dose of credibility and 'statistical significance' if he'd had more experienced statisticians review his staggered conclusions.<P>I definitely credit him with opening my eyes to a handful of new 'culture management' techniques. But my eyes still sting from the idea that this gentleman has made a career out of mishandling simple correlational numbers and the science behind them. A simple example is the assertion on page 49 that 'positive' correlation is equivalent to 'significant'.</span>
