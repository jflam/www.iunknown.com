                <span id="Label1">The theory of evolution is regarded as one of the greatest glimmerings  of understanding humans have ever had. It is an idea of science, not of  belief, and therefore undergoes constant scrutiny and testing by  argumentative evolutionary biologists. But while Darwinists may disagree  on a great many things, they all operate within a (thus far) successful  framework of thought first set down in The Origin of Species in 1859.<p>  In <I>The Structure of Evolutionary Theory</I>, a monumental labor of  academic love, Stephen Jay Gould attempts to define and revise that  framework. Using the clear metaphors and personable style he is so well  known for, Gould outlines the foundation of the theory and attempts to  use it to show that modern evolutionary biology has lost its way. He  then offers his own system for reconciling Darwin's "basic logical  commitments" with the critiques of modern scientists.<p>  Gould's massive opus begs a new look at natural selection with the full  weight of history behind it. His opponents will find much to criticize,  and orthodox, reductionist Darwinists might feel that Gould has given  them short shrift. But as an opening monologue for the new century's  biological debates, <I>The Structure of Evolutionary Theory</I> sets a  mountainous precedent in exhaustive scholarship, careful logic, and  sheer reading pleasure. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>A lifetime of clear and concise thinking comes to full fruition in Stephen Gould's "Structure Of Evolutionary Theory", a work which masters the intricacy and vast scale of biological evolution with a prose that would be the envy of the harshest english composition teacher. Indeed, in an age of literarily skilled scientific giants such as Edward Wilson and Richard Dawkins, to name but two, Gould has succeeded in giving his readers a book which will go down in the history of scholarship as one of the truly clarifying perspectives on a theory that has consistently proven itself to be the only unifying principle of life on earth.<P>While some readers might be intimidated by the sheer massiveness of this book, as well as by Gould's extensive use of technically oriented terminology, they will ultimately be rewarded in their struggle by coming away with a sure-footed understanding of why Darwin's essential theory has stood the test of time and survived to reap the status that all theories aspire to: the ability to consistently explain and predict phenomena, which is the defining trait of any theory's true power. While it may be that many will still dispute Gould's "puncuated equilibria" explanation of speciation, as compared to the school of gradualism, that should not be taken as a sign of any real chink in the armor of basic Darwinism, but rather a sign that the study of evolution is still healthy and vibrant with respect to the intellectually arguable nuance and tempo by which genetic mutation and natural selection produced past and present life. <P>Gould's book highlights this debate and succeeds in throwing into high relief the cutting edge of both contemporary arguments and the burgeoning empirical research used to bolster or temper them. Whether you buy into his specific interpretations of it or not, the fullness of your understanding of the body of evolutionary knowledge will benefit greatly by a cover to cover reading of his book.<P>In conclusion I would say that both the scientific community and the reading public owe a debt of gratitude to a figure such as Gould who, after having played a significant role in reviving the essay as a form of written communication, has done an equally excellent job with respect to tackling its polar opposite with an enormous 1400 page treatise that is sure to entice, entertain, and help educate the next generation of critical thinkers.</span>

                    <span>Cleary the capstone to Stephen Jay Gould's life and career. While his hundreds of articles in NATURE put him at the same cocktail party with Carl Sagan, this tome puts him at the same party with Charles Darwin. Another reviewer hit it on the head. This book is not as accessible as his other writings. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory is intended for the experts in the field of Evolution. It presumes a lot of the reader, background that frankly even with a BS in Zoology, I don't have. At 30 bucks, it's a great value for the money, one of those books you'll keep around and read a chapter or section at a time. I don't think Gould intended to be pedantic, but he was clearly thinking at a level above most of us. A quick excerpt to demonstrate my point. From the bottom of page 152: "The challenge of punctuated equillibrium to natural selection rests upon two entirely different issues of support provided by punctuational geometry for the explanation of cladal trends by differential species success and not by extrapolated anagenesis, and for the high relative frequency of species selection, as opposed to the exclusivity of Darwinian selection on organisms." If you can figure this out, even in context, you can have my Mensa card.</span>

                    <span>As a non-biologist I found this book tough to read. First, at nearly 1,400 pages the book suffers from a complete lack of editing or even clear sense of organization. SET does not really flow, but, rather, vomits forth sections and subsections in an unending torrent of seemingly ill-planned and overly huge chapters. Second, the book was filled with duplication, uneeded "I'm-so-smart" self-congratulation, and varied in how readable it was. It often went from being a broad conceputal overview focusing on clear theoretical argumentation -- the justification for species-level selection, for instance -- to (me at least) mind-numbing excursions into jargon-filled technical studies. The result was that Gould ended up writing a book ill suited for laymen or experts in the field -- a mish-mash resulting from writing for too broad an audience.<P>On the plus side, there is a hell of a lot of stuff in there. I feel I now have a fairly good grasp, for an interested layman, of evolutionary theory, especially the drawbacks of "conventional" Darwinian natural selection, and how Gould's suggested theoretical "fixes" -- punctuated equilibrium, hierarchical selection, and species selection -- improves upon Darwin. The deep historical detail Gould goes into when discussing the history of Darwinian thought is also nice, especially for an outsider with little knowledge of evolutionary theory. I also enjoyed Gould's take on "Galton's Polyhedron", explanation of "spandrels", and the connection he draws between structural constraint and selective forces -- concepts I can use when thinking about outcomes in my field, the social sciences. <P>On the whole, I would say SET is very rich in detail, informaton, and explanation, but gets low marks for exposition. The book could clearly benefit from further editing which is why I give it only 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>I agree wholeheartedly with the review by "A reader from Vic, Australia." This book is a classic example of what happens when an author gets too big for his editor. The notion that he even had one must be taken as a matter of blind faith, as there is no empirical evidence for it.<P>Gould might well have had something important to say in this book; certainly, that was my hope when I bought it. Unfortunately, however, he was too busy stringing together endless chains of metaphors and inventing analogies -- many of which are dead ends -- to tell us what it was.</span>

                    <span>This is a massive book and a fitting final achievement for the immensely popular intellectual. I would recommend it to people who are interested in a deep understanding of Gould's point of view. Gould was undoubtedly a great thinker and his view of evolution is more complex and sophisticated than that of the vast majority of biologists. His most notable real achievement may have been counteracting certain misconceptions about Darwinism, although it is not entirely clear that anyone ever held the misconceptions he claims to have dispelled.<P>So, why the two stars?<P>1. His writing is appalling: pretentious, long-winded and cluttered with irrelevent and misleading literary and sporting analogies. For people who want to understand the arguments, rather than admire florid prose and elegant historical rambles, this is very irritating. The Chronicle quotes Gould as saying: "If I'm competent in anything, it's writing." He couldn't be more wrong.<P>2. The book is desperately in need of a good editor, not just to correct (1) above, but to eliminate a massive amount of repetition. Gould had no tolerance for editing, never redrafted and composed solely on a typewriter, and that shows very painfully. As Library Journal put it - "bloated, redundant and self-indulgent".<P>3. It's said that the book was written with the intention of establishing Gould in the popular imagination as Darwin's successor. With this aim he pulls a lot of dirty tricks on the reader, ranging from misleading metaphors, to straw men, to selective quotations. These are cleverly structured and stated with great authority, making them very difficult for the non-expert to pick. <P>4. Just because his view is sophisticated, complex, historical, and rich in literary allusion, doesn't mean it's correct. In fact, the vast majority of evolutionary biologists remain skeptical of Gould's claims, for good reasons that he does not explain. <P>In summary, the book may be worth reading for evolutionary biologists. It is a terrible book for the laypeople who are Gould's main readers. In contrast, Richard Dawkin's books are highly accessible, enjoyable, and convey core concepts very clearly.</span>
