                    <span>If you are designing, building and deploying Web based applications using Microsoft's .NET Framework run and get this book. Currently, there is no other book that can match the breath and depth of the topic covered in this book.<P>Contrary to what the title may imply, in addition to ASP.NET this book also covers how security should be addressed in the building of Serviced components, Web Services and Remoting. The chapters on Code Access Security are among the clearest that can be found anywhere.<P>This book takes a holistic approach to Security in that it addresses threats to the network, host and application layers. The old adage of a chain is only as strong as its weakest link is taken to heart in the book so guidance is provided on how security should be addressed across tiers and at multiple layers. Secure app development across the entire software development and deployment lifecycle is considered within the scope of this book.<P>In addition to Secure Coding guidelines, Extensive guidelines are provided that show how the Network, Web Server, Application Server and Database Server should be secured.<P>One of the things that I like about this book is that the guidance that is provided is task and role based. So even though the book is 800+ pages, it can be very easily used as a ready reference.<P>Multiple checklists that deal with Design, Build, Securing and Assessment are given and can be used out of the box.<P>In short, don't wait. Go get it now!<P>From the book's introduction:<P>Part I, "Introduction to Threats and Countermeasures," identifies and illustrates the various threats facing the network, host, and application layers. The process of threat modeling helps you to identify those threats that can harm your application. By understanding these threats, you can identify and prioritize effective countermeasures. <P>Part II, "Designing Secure Web Applications," gives you the guidance you require to design secure Web applications. Even if you have deployed your application, we recommend that you examine and evaluate the concepts, principles, and techniques outlined in this part. <P>Part III, "Building Secure Web Applications," allows you to apply the secure design practices introduced in Part II to create secure implementations. You will learn defensive coding techniques that make your code and application resilient to attack. <P>Part IV, "Securing Your Network, Host, and Application," describes how you will apply security configuration settings to secure these three interrelated levels. Instead of applying security randomly, you will learn the rationale behind the security recommendations. <P>Part V, "Assessing Your Security," provides the tools you require to evaluate the success of your security efforts. Starting with the application, you'll take an inside-out approach to evaluating your code and design. You'll follow this with an outside-in view of the security risks that challenge your network, host and application.</span>

                    <span>Truly useful how-to-secure your server book. Goes through locking down your OS, web server (IIS), SQL Server installation,<BR>.NET configuration, and web application do's and don'ts.<BR>Very helpful when I configured a server which I rented from a dedicated machine hosting service.<BR>Only reason for four stars rather than five, it is really based around Windows 2000 server. Needs to be updated for Windows 2003 server.</span>
