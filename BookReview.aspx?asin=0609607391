                <span id="Label1">As the old hair-coloring commercials used to say, you're not getting  older, you're getting better. In this sophisticated little picture book,  V&eacute;ronique Vienne, bestselling author of (<I>The Art of Doing Nothing</I> and  <I>The Art of Imperfection</I>)  and a feature writer for magazines such as <I>Martha Stewart Living</I> and  <I>Redbook</I>, contends that growing up doesn't simply mean you're not getting  younger anymore; it means you're finally at the point in life where the real fun  begins. After all, Julia Child didn't write her first bestselling cookbook until  she was 49, Harry Truman wasn't elected to national office until he was 50, and  Paul Cezanne didn't have a major exhibit of his paintings until he was 65. The  "second part of your life is second to none," she writes, and the best is yet to  come.<p>  In 10 essays complemented by 25 duotone photographs, Vienne advises us to begin  anew by throwing away old things ("outgrowing is part of growing up"), letting  go of what's become obsolete, and reinventing adulthood ("become the kind of  grown-up who makes young people wish they were pushing 40, 50 or even 60"). In  short, get comfortable in your skin, with your intelligence, with your soul. The  message is: growing up has little do with age--and everything to do with making  your life easier, happier, and more fun. No doubt, this savvy little gift book  will get lucky recipients on the right track. <I>--Nancy Monson</I></span>

                    <span>I found this to be a wonderful book. It's refreshing to hear someone express how age is beautiful and how we should embrace it rather than hide from it. I was dreading age before I read this book. Now, I look forward to the knowledge life has to offer me. I want the wisdom that comes from experience. I want to be able to have wrinkles from laughing as an emblem from when I enjoyed so many moments. What I like most about this book is just Veronique's unique perspective. It's looking more at the good in life, rather than focusing on the bad. She found exquisiteness in age.</span>

                    <span>When I first picked-up *The Art of Growing Up*, I randomly opened it and the first line my eyes fell on said "Decide once and for all never to apologize for your age". I knew then that I was going to like this book.<P>A small and elegant little tome filled with gentle and playful reminders that there is poetry in ageing if only we use the wisdom of our years to accept it, as well as dance with it. The more we fret over the years we rack up, the harder we make things on ourselves. Just because you are a woman of a...ahem....certain age...doesn't mean you can no longer embrace whimsy, swathe yourself in color, seek out adventure, or dream big dreams. It is a time to write your own myths, savor your gifts, revel in your mysteries, and stop dwelling on clichés. <P>This book is sprinkled generously with lovely black and white photographs that include women of all ages and contains ten chapters all beginning with "The Art of....". Each chapter ends with a list, which thrills a consummate, and sometimes rather obsessive, list-maker like myself. A couple of my favorite lines are: "Use long words around short people. Teach a five-year-old to say 'facetious'" and "Be the designated observer of both grief and wonder".<P>This would make an excellent gift for women friends, even those still in their twenties - give them a taste of what they have to look forward to rather than dread.</span>

                    <span>As so many other young women, I dread growing old and losing IT (if I have it, otherwise losing the possibility of ever getting IT). However, after reading this book I felt much calmer on the subject. The author speaks to the reader like a friend, and teaches that there are many ages in a woman's life, where different styles and attitudes are appropriate. Old can be chic! Young does not necessarily equal chic!</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I have read by Veronique Vienne and I will surley read more. I am 43 and many of the things Ms. Vienne wrote about I believe. It will be a book I will refer to often. I plan to give copies to my "40 and over friends" I'm not sure my younger then 40 friends will apprecitate just yet, or maybe its just that I want to keep this book special between the 40 and over crowd. The photography by her daughter Jeanne Lipsey is done beautifuly. I woud love to have some of her prints even.</span>
