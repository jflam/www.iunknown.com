                <span id="Label1">If you are a serious runner, you want to improve your ability to run faster and longer without injury. Many runners have bought better shoes or spent longer hours on the track trying to improve, only to end up frustrated with back and leg pain. But the secret to improving your run is simple--your stride is only as good as your physical abilities allow. Making a few simple changes in strength, flexibility, speed of movement, and technique will help you reach your genetic potential.  In <I>Explosive Running</I>, Dr. Michael Yessis, a respected sports fitness expert, demonstrates the method he has used successfully with thousands of runners. His method consists of three overlapping steps all runners should go through in order to improve their performance and make the transition to effective, efficient, and faster running.  Included are detailed discussions of the biomechanics of running, special strength exercises, stretching, troubleshooting common problems, nutrition for optimal running, and tips to maintain a running program. This book employs unique sequence photography that captures and analyzes movements that are key to a good running stride. <I>Explosive Running</I> will give you a much greater understanding of the sport and help you improve in a much shorter amount of time than most other books on the subject.  Michael Yessis, Ph.D., is president of Sports Training, Inc., a training facility for professional athletes. He is the author of <I>Kinesiology of Exercise</I> and <I>Explosive Golf</I> and has appeared on "Today" and CNN.</span>

                    <span>This book would be great for anyone who is serious about running and desires to find ways to increase performance. The sections that break down the actual mechanics of running are complicated, but I found them to be interesting. The sections on stretching and weightlifting exercises specifically for running are outstanding. The chapter on the effects shoes have on feet and the case for spending more time barefoot is also a highlight.<P>If you are a casual runner who is happy and not interested in making running a top priority in your life, then I would personally skip this book. If you are "into" running and seeking a deeper understanding of what the mechanics of the run are and how to improve your run, then I cannot see how this book would not help you.</span>

I was also gratified to read the authors endorsement of barefoot running! If you are a serious runner seeking to improve your speed, endurance and running economy. This is the book for you. <P>Tim<BR>Anacortes, Washington</span>

                    <span>...definitely the most informative book I have ever read on running. This book will take away the mystery and supply a healthy dose of reality. Dr. Yessis is both informed and to the point about individual running ability and its application.<P>Anyone seeking to understand how it should work need only buy this book. Enjoy, I know I have.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book... and am preparing to read it again.<P>I have read a lot on running, and have even taken a few courses, and then I read this book - what an eye opener! I quickly realized how biased some people that teach running courses are, and how little actual knowledge is out there on many of the topics that are introduced in this book. A couple of examples:<P>The section on barefoot running. This is the part of the book that the big shoe companies don't want you reading. I think that it's largely true, though most would have trouble believing, it - I think that the author has done an exceptional job of backing up his theories on this one. As soon as the snow melts, I will be unlacing my shoes for the first time ever ;-)<P>The book has a great deal of information pertaining to running stride. A lot of what I have learned revolves around the theory that you were born with a certain stride, and you should just "run like you run" - don't worry about your stride. Obviously (if you have an open mind) you can see through that garbage, and get "real" with your running. Tons of pictures to back this up (someone could argue that the quality of the photos used in the book are poor, but I think that they are sufficient, given that they are for illustration purposes - not wall hangings).<P>Stretching. Believe that most everyone who is stretching today isn't doing it properly, or could certainly be doing it better. The author gets into active stretching, versus passive stretching. Very mind altering stuff... with a lot of facts to back up why this is the way to do it. I have not incorporated these stretches into my training yet, but will be doing shortly (takes a bit of work to alter what I have learned over the years). At a seminar that I attended, I asked a physiotherapist about active stretching, and why they still push static stretches... she says that while active stretches are better, it's too difficult to learn or do correctly. Doesn't look that tough, but I will soon see ;-)<P>Bottom line... for the price, I don't know that you can find a better book out there. So ends my two cents.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the book that the competition does not want you to find out about because it has the information you need to become a better competitive runner. The biomechanical aspects of the running stride is dissected and explained in terms that are useful for the layman. Once you understand what an efficient running stride consists of, you can begin to work on a more efficient way of running. <P>The chapter on barefoot running is a real eye-opener. It reveals the truth about the effects of shoes and how they may be the cause of many foot ailments; not to mention the weakening effects of wearing them.<P>Chapter 3 and 4 alone are worth the price of the book. This is a must-read for all competitive runners--the elites, weekend warriors, and dreamers. Read it but don't let the competion know about it.</span>
