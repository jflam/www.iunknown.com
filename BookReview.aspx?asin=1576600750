                <span id="Label1">Even if technology makes you weep, you'll laugh! Technology--friend or foe? That's a question the cartoonists of <I>The New Yorker</I> have been pondering with no little skepticism--and answering hilariously--for decades. From "portable phones" that were anything but to tiny cell phones, from room-sized computers to handheld wonders, from faxes to e-mails, the brilliant artists of <I>The New Yorker</I> have seen and drawn it all--the sublime, the ridiculous, and the existential. Bob Mankoff, cartoon editor of <I>The New Yorker</I>, has culled through thousands of drawings to select the best, the funniest, and the most illuminating cartoons on technology for this collection of 126 cartoons. Readers can also look forward to Mankoff's witty introductory essay. <B>As an added bonus, the book comes with a bound-in CD-ROM, so that readers can e-mail their favorite cartoons via their computers (PC or Macintosh).</B></span>

                    <span>I think this is the funniest collection of cartoons yet! It's nice to see the traditional style of The New Yorker cartoons up against modern technology. And, not to mention, it's been a great gift with all the gadget-freak men in my life!! My father has been bringing his to meetings and my boyfriend got one for his Computer Science teacher! Congrats to those who own one.</span>

                    <span>This book contains 110 cartoons that have appeared in The New Yorker relating to technology. Most have something to do with computers or the Internet, but faxes, cell phones, and biotechnology also make their appearances. As usual, the cartoons are selected by Robert Mankoff, The New Yorker's cartoon editor. <P>The book is one of the best collections I have seen of New Yorker cartoons. It also provides Mankoff's best introduction to any of these collections (he usually either doesn't write one, or does less than the minimum), as well as a CD of the cartoons in the book. <P>I was pleasantly surprised that this collection was done in such a way as to be consistent with technology. Perhaps it is because Mr. Mankoff is a self-confessed technophile. He defends that preference as being better than being a Francophile.<P>I am tempted to give you all 110 cartoons from the book, but I don't have that much space. Here are a few of my favorites:<P>Man in room filled with people working at computers talking on the telephone, looking glum -- "No, the computers are up. We're down."<P>Father to son -- "Go ask your search engine."<P>Couple on a camping trip holding cell phone -- "Who can we call?"<P>Couple at a cocktail party -- "You say you love me, but I'm not on your speed dial."<P>Two dogs operating a computer -- "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog."<P>Two men staring at a fax of a man with a tie pressed across his face -- "My God, there's been a terrible accident in our Chicago office."<P>"Already my computer is outmoded, but I try to tell myself my computer isn't me."<P>Deputies watching tracking dogs looking at laptop -- "First, they do an on-line search."<P>Woman to a small boy in a restaurant -- "I loved your E-mail, but I thought you'd be older."<P>Man talking to a microwave -- "No, I don't want to play chess. I just want to reheat the lasagna."<P>Man passing telephone booth holding cell phone -- The booth says "Talk in Private 25 Cents"<P>Man proposing -- "Marry me, Virginia. My genes are excellent and, as yet, unpatented."<P>Man in hammock -- "America Off-Line"<P>Couple in bed -- "Not tonight, hon. It'll just wreak havoc with the motion sensors again."<P>Wife during wedding ceremony -- "I'm delighted to love, honor, and obey, but I'm keeping my electronic rights."<P>Buffalo with cell phone -- "I love the convenience, but the roaming charges are killing me."<P>I think you will have a lot of fun with this book. As you can see, the cartoons take turns making fun of technology, those who are having a hard time with technology, and our fixation with technology. <P>After you finish having many good laughs, consider how many of these jokes are really insights into problems that need to be solved. For example, how can we know whether we can trust those we exchange e-mails with? Are they who they say they are? In many cases, they are not. Be careful!<P></span>
