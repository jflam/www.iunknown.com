                    <span>This is my favorite Baseball Encyclopedia. While others may have more information, new statistical measures and other technical features that the Neft reference lacks, this is the only encyclopedia that keeps the emphasis on the team-seasons rather than on individual players.
<br />
<br />Each "Chapter" in the book is devoted to a single season with about a half page of text describing the season, the pennant races and important individual players. The teams are then presented in finish order in sections for each league and division. Each team entry takes approximately 20-25% of the page, depending on the number of players used.
<br />
<br />Every player that appeared in a game for a team is listed in the team's roster and only those stats he acquired with that team are presented in his stat line. Players that appear on multiple teams are presented on each team with a number in indicating the order of progression from team to team. Players that miss time due to injury (or other reasons) are tagged with a code indicating the basic nature of their reason for their loss of playing time, such as "shoulder injury" or "left early to play pro football". In some cases significant players that miss an entire season are listed with their team's roster. Each season is punctuated with line scores for each post- season game and stats totals for each post-season series.
<br />
<br />Player career total statistics are listed in several sections dividing the history of the game into "eras" corresponding to major changes in the game's rules and/or structure: 1901-1919, 1920-1945, 1946-1960, 1961-1972 and 1973-present. A "Leaders and Features" section at the end lists all pennant winners, yearly leaders in each statistical category, single season record lists for each stat, a list of all no-hitters, all award winners, hall of fame members, team leaders, non-playing managers and active leaders.
<br />
<br />Each team entry contains the following stats: finish place, win-loss record, winning percentage, number of games behind the winner, the manager name(s) and individual manager records if more than one manager is used.
<br />
<br />Each position player entry on a team contains the following stats: Player name, number of games at each position, batting hand, age, G, AB, R, H, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, BB, SO, SB, Avg and Slg.
<br />
<br />Each pitcher entry on a team contains the following stats: pitcher name, throwing hand, Age, W, L, Win Pct, Saves, Games, Games Started, Complete Games, IP, H, BB, SO, Shutouts and ERA.
<br />
<br />League leading totals are indicated within the team rosters by bolding the relevant stat.
<br />
<br />One negative note about the 2005 edition is that there are some glaringly obvious errors in the 2004 season essay. Specifically, the Twins were referred to as the "Minneapolis Twins" and Giants Ace Jason Schmidt was referred to as "Jeff". I assume these will be rectified in later editions, but I'd like to see a bit better proofing of the text before initial publication.
<br />
<br />If your interest is seeing a list of all the single-season stat lines for an individual player, you want anything but this book. However, if your interest is in a single season or in viewing the course of a player's career IN CONTEXT, then there is nowhere to turn but to this reference.</span>

                    <span>As the back cover says, this is the All-Time Baseball Argument Settler. The book has a lot of pages (840), the pages are big (about 8 by 10.5 inches) and the type is small so you get a lot of data. 
<br />
<br />It's basically the history of every player, every team, in every season since play began. It's not filled with chit-chat, it's filled with data, page after page of data. To be sure, each season is described in a half page or so of text to give you the overall story of what happened, but then it goes to the data. 
<br />
<br />This is the 25th edition of this book. If you've bought earlier editions you know what to expect. If you're new, all I can say is that there are good reasons for a book to go through 25 editions. It is obviously putting the information that people want into their hands.</span>
