                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Paul Sheriff has taught Visual Basic long enough to know what beginning programmers want. This book is designed for programmers that have little or no Visual Basic or Windows programming experience. Students will learn the syntax of the Visual Basic language, event driven programming, and how to put together a complete Visual Basic application. The emphasis in this book is on good coding practices such as industry accepted naming standards, indentation and code reusability.  If you are a developer who needs to learn how to put together a Visual Basic application the right way, this book is for you.</HTML></span>

                    <span>This book fits exactly for someone like me - a recent graduate with two semesters in VB 5.0 who knows basic programming, yet still needs to learn a great deal more that is not written on a "dummies" level or that is way over my head. I have picked up a lot of little snippets that I did not previously know in the earlier chapters in addition to greatly expanding my VB knowledge in the later chapters. This book is extremely easy to read and explains everything very well. The price of this book is a good deal also, most computer books cost an arm and a leg and are nowhere near as good as this one.<P>Very good job Mr. Sheriff.</span>

                    <span>I have read many programming books, none have been even half as good as this one! I would usually get up to about Chapter 9 or 10, and then the book would become so advanced, I would have no idea what the author was talking about. Not the case here, I am almost done with the first part of the book, and about to get into more advanced topics, and it is still very understandable. The files that Paul is talking about can be found online at the website on page 762 in the Appendix, and the complete download took me no more than 2 minutes on a 56k modem. The files are then very helpful...instead of just reading about what a program is supposed to be doing, you can actually run it, and look at the exact code, even make changes if you want to. Overall, this is the best book for any beginner's, or anyone who has some VB experience, but is ready to reach a new level of understanding. Great job Paul!</span>

                    <span>This book is my Bible for Visual Basic. I used it to learn VB and continue to use it as a reference. I really like the author's style. Just the right amount of info for a real developer to write VB code. I highly recommend it. It's the only book I have for VB.</span>
