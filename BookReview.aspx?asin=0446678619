                    <span>This book is useful for the detail in starting your own business. The Australian version is customised for the unique requirements for setting up and running a business. It covers Employment issues, corporate formalities, trademarks, consumer laws,Trusts, and how to register an Australian company.
<br />
<br />The most useful part I found was the number of case stories, which helped illustrate the points.
<br />
<br />It's a complete guide and simple to understand.

                    <span>This is a good book.  It explores all the essentials of getting your business started and getting off the ground.  A good companion book is Stop Working by Rohan Hall.  Stop Working takes you to the next level by teaching you how to structure an Agile business to become wealthy and create unlimited cash flow.</span>

                    <span>I bought the pdf and am having a difficult time printing. I'd rather get my money back and by a hardcopy instead. The book is very useful for learning about the workings of corporations. But not being able to print makes it not worth the money to me.</span>

                    <span>Having a business without being incorporated is like driving a car without insurance. I was confused about corporations, which kind and didn't want to go to a "expert" untill I understood how the process works. This book did just that.</span>

                    <span>Easy to read.  I formed a C corporation with Mr. Sutton's firm after reading this book.  They took care of all that legal mumbo jumbo so I could focus on building my business.<p>I was trapped in big corporations for 20 years - this book helped me understand how to get started...and the "right way" to protect my assets as an entrepreneur.<p>I only have time to read 2-3 business books a year.  I'm glad this was one of them.</span>
