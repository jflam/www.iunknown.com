                    <span>I just had to add in my 2 cents. I too am teaching a course on Exchange from this book, and I wish that we had used another book. The organization is not good, for example, it discusses connecting Exch 2k3 in an Exch 5.5 environment as well as migration in chapters 4 & 5, and has not even addressed what Exch 2k3 is and does and how to configure it at that point. Ch 3, on Administrative and Routing groups is severely lacking (no diagrams at all and does not go into any length about connectors, the routing engine, etc...). Chapter 6, on clustering and NLB, again should have been placed near the end of the book so that you would have covered virtual servers before the chapter on clustering. Additionally, in chapter 9, when they finally do talk about virtual servers, they repeat information from chapter 6, and muddy the distinction between the virtual server that encompasses the clustered installation with the virtual servers (such as POP3, IMAP4, NNTP, etc..) that you need to configure to provide services. Chapter 9, on virtual servers, is extremely repetitive.. It looks basically like they cut and pasted the same material from POP3 to the IMAP4 and NNTP sections and just noted a few of the differences. Rather than bringing out the commonalities, and saying it once, and then pointing out the differences, they say it over and over and over.. I'll spare the zeros and ones on the rest of the book. I've already used my 2 cents worth and don't want to add any more. I just really wish that I had read the reviews before we decided to use this book for the class. </span>

                    <span>I used this book to teach a course on Exchange based on someone else's recommendation. I really should have read the reviews here first. That was a terrible idea. There are technical errors, the activities don't work, and there are lots of surprise requirements. The hardware and software requirements listed at the beginning of the book are not all you will need to complete the labs. What a major pain this course was for me to use. I am very sorry that I purchased 15 copies of this book. Don't be fooled by high sales numbers, this product is not worth it.</span>

                    <span>This is without doubt the worst MCSE book I've read. There were no reviews here when I bought it (worse luck!) but I wish there had been - I wouldn't have wasted a month of my life studying it.
<br />
<br />It is error strewn (major errors, not just typos, only some of which are mentioned in the errata web site), badly written, disorganised, unclear, full of redundant information and it will - as other reviewers have noted - force you to reinstall AD/Exchange every second chapter if you want to do the exercises.
<br />
<br />I postponed the 70-284 exam twice as I felt I didn't understand the material even after going through the book TWICE.
<br />
<br />In the end, believe me, the exam wasn't too difficult. Administering Exchange 2K3 isn't difficult either. This book won't convince you of that. </span>

                    <span>This is book is by far, the worst book that MSPress has ever produced. Generally the MSPress books are pretty good. I have only run into two titles that were poorly written/edited/proof-read. This is one of them, and interestingly enough, the other was also co-authored by Ian McLean. This book is so bad that I will never buy a book with his name on it again.</span>

                    <span>There is not a single diagram in this book!<br>Everything in this book is explained in text, which makes learning very, very time-consuming. So many times a little diagram could have been be very helpful in explaining how the various components of such a complex system work together. It's missing. These authors obviously have had the diagrams next to them, described it from top to bottom and from left to right, then leave it to the reader to reconstruct the diagram from the textual description. Frustrating. <br>The book also doesn't have a single table. Up to the reader to reconstruct the tables from the text. <br>The most surprising thing missing in this book are page numbers! I never realized I used page numbers so often.<br>It's very hard to go back and forth, searching in the TOC or the register takes a lot of time to bring you to the section you need. <p>Another sign of the speed with which this book has been written: so many typos that it's really annoying.<p>This book is totally unfit for what is was intended: studying Exchange 2003.</span>
