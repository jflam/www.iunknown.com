                <span id="Label1">"Has anyone really stood up against George Bush and his policies? Don't you think it's time somebody did?"<br><br>As the 2004 election shifts into primary overdrive, the one candidate who is getting the most ink and air time is former Vermont Governor Howard Dean. His fundraising has skyrocketed past his Democratic opponents and almost a quarter-million people from all fifty states have signed up to volunteer for his campaign.<br><br>To say Howard Dean is outspoken is something of an understatement. But what is Dean really saying? And why does the media -- and the other Democratic candidates as well as Republicans -- constantly try to paint Dean as an extreme liberal? <br><br><i>Howard Dean In His Own Words</i> clearly states the governor's opinions on over 100 issues, from the military to the environment to education. A valuable primer for the politically curious to the most ardent Dean blogger, <i>Howard Dean In His Own Words</i> captures the voice and intellect of one of America's most fascinating political figures.<br><br>Howard Dean on How to Win the Election:<br>"The way to beat this president is not to be like him. We have to stand up and give the 50 percent of Americans who don't vote a reason to vote."<br><br>Howard Dean on the Democratic Party:<br>"When I say that a lot of Democrats are more mad at the Democrats than at the Republicans, I get a lot of nods."<br><br>Howard Dean on Education:<br>"The single most important factor in how a child learns has less to do with the quality of the building, the computers or even the teachers. The most important predictor is the attitude in that child's home toward education. We must involve the parents again."<br><br>Howard Dean on Being Called a Liberal:<br>"I think it's pathetic that I'm considered the left-wing liberal. It shows just how far to the right this country has lurched."<br></span>

                    <span>How could I give this book a bad rating, but still act like I'm on the Democratic side....Ah-ha! I'll say I'm a Democrat myself, then I'll trash this book and then I'll suggest another Democratic Candidate that I know is Unelectable...like Joe or Al Sharpton...hehe, it's so good, so evil, it just might work! <P>People please beware of the Republican spin machine. That's all they have left. People are scared of Dean because he presents the best chance of taking the Bush Gang down. Dean raised 40 million in 2003 alone (and that's before he receives the Democratic Vote)! That is light years beyond any other Democrat in history. And that's important considering Bush will have 200 million to spend this election distorting and twisting the truth.<P>THE BOTTOM LINE<BR>This book is a good primer on Dean. It touches briefly on many hot topics and is also a good tool to use when influencing other Democrats to endorse Dean. I suggest true Democrats stick to what they feel in there heart and endorse the best opponent against Bush. And Republican's that post here stop your lies for once and say your Republican.</span>

                    <span>I spoke with Gov. Dean when he was in Charleston a few months back. I was impressed with his speech and asked if he had any books that collected his ideas. He mentioned this and "Winning Back America," and both had not yet been released at the time. I told him I'd look forward to reading them.<P>Essentially, this is just that. A collection of his ideas in quotes of varying lengths of varying issues of the day. Those who have heard Dean speak in person or who have heard him unedited on C-Span will recognize much of this as standards in Gov. Dean's speeches.<P>A few of Gov. Dean's best lines ("I'd rather be right and lose than wrong and win") are not present here, but enough of his standards are here to give you a good idea of what he's about-a man of ideas who bases his beliefs on his feelings and experiences as opposed to any political dogma.<P>In this book, Gov. Dean says that his major political influences were Jimmy Carter and Harry Truman. Judging from the times I've heard him in person and from this book, I would put him closer to Bobby Kennedy and Wendell Willkie as I think his ideas have more in common with the latter two.<P>In either case, it's a good basic way to make up your mind about how you feel about Gov. Dean. For further and indepth reading , check his "Winning Back America."</span>

                    <span>When my 20-year-old daughter shook Howard Dean's hand, he smiled and asked warmly for her vote. He didn't hesitate when he saw her eyebrow was pierced. He didn't talk down to a young woman approaching her first presidential election. He was kind and attentive and he won the vote he so politely requested. Lisa Rogak's book deftly captures this amazing leader through stylish and thoughtful quotes, as the title suggests, in his own words. It's a great, quick overview about Dr. Dean. It's a must for any good citizen committed to taking back the country for ALL Americans, not just the wealthy or hawkish.</span>

                    <span>This is Howard Dean in his own words. Not spin form political pundits or pseudo-intellectuals, but a collection of quotes from Dean himself. This way the reader can come to his or her own conclusions. This book is power-packed, concise and straight-forward - much like Howard Dean himself! I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning the truth about Dean's views on important issues in our country.</span>
