                <span id="Label1"><B>The classic account of the final offensive against Hitler's Third Reich -- newly in print for the 50th anniversary of VE Day.</B> <P> The Battle for Berlin was the culminating struggle of World War II in the European theater, the last offensive against Hitler's Third Reich, which devastated one of Europe's historic capitals and brought the Nazi leviathan to its downfall. It was also one of the war's bloodiest and most pivotal moments, whose outcome would play a part in determining the complexion of international politics for decades to come. <P> <I>The Last Battle</I> is the compelling account of this final battle, a story of brutal extremes, of stunning military triumph alongside the stark conditions that the civilians of Berlin experienced in the face of the Allied assault. As always, Ryan delves beneath the military and political forces that were dictating events to explore the more immediate questions of survival, where, as the author describes it, "to eat had become more important than to love, to burrow more dignified than to fight, to exist more militarily correct than to win." <P> <I>The Last Battle</I> is the story of ordinary people, both soldiers and civilians, caught up in the despair, frustration, and terror of defeat. It is history at its best, a masterful illumination of the effects of war on the lives of individuals, and one of the enduring works on World War II.</span>

                    <span>Few battles in history have been waged with greater ferocity, desperation, bravery, and atrocity than the battle for Berlin at the end of the Second World War. No one can tell a story better than Ryan, and he is at his very best here. In this book Cornelius Ryan brings his masterful powers of description and discerning eye for extraordinary detail to bear with force and elegance. This is a wonderful book, immensely informative, densely packed with facts and figures, and told in a compelling way by a best-selling author who can vividly recount seemingly countless tales of the most ordinary of individuals caught in the unforgiving and often deadly embrace of total war.<P>By this stage Hitler had begun to withdraw farther into the recesses of the fabled German Chancellery complex, while around and above him raged an endless barrage by Soviet artillery, British, American and Canadian bombs, and the clashes of German and Russian tanks and armor. This then, is the final epic struggle amid the ashes and ruins of a once proud and great metropolis, the chaotic and blood-curdling death throes of the Nazi regime. Fearing the terrible wrath and ritual rape and murder of rampaging Russians, German forces tended to withdraw from the western front in an attempt to either surrender outright to the Americans or British, or to let these more "civilized" western forces take Berlin before capitulating the hated Russians. Hitler had expressly forbidden any kind of surrender, intending this to be a fight to the death. Indeed, the stage was set for some of the most horrific excesses of the war.<P> This, then, is a riveting and well-told story told down to the final exciting detail of how this battle of titans was fought, with an amazing degree of description of the "on the ground, as it is happening" kind of story telling. Of course, Ryan excels at this, as proven with not only this book but by his other best sellers, as well. Written with compassion, it recognizes and empathizes with a sensitivity for the terrible ordeal faced by individual civilians who through bad luck and circumstance happened to be standing in the path of an oncoming maelstrom. The pages are filled with the struggle of all to survive, sometimes quite against the odds, and the pages gleam with example after example of single acts of defiance and courage, acts to help to save someone else, often at great personal risk. <P>The narrative of the book dramatizes the catastrophic and irreversible consequences of war, for both combatants and noncombatants alike, and helps the reader to appreciate the ways in which the events as they unfolded in the battle for Berlin, the stage of European and world history were both positively and negatively affected. This is a book all students of modern history should read, and one I highly recommend for your bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>The late Cornelius Ryan, author of the justifiably famous "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Longest Day", mastered the art of the historical narrative. Ryan combined the meticulous research of the historian, the nose for rooting out the story of a journalist, and the plot and pacing of a novelist into a package heretofore unequaled. <P>Having read both of the above works (and seen the movies, along with most of America), I prefer "The Last Battle." This account of the fall of Berlin shows Ryan at the top of his gain as he weaves together disparate tales of struggle amidst the ashes of the Thousand Year Reich into a sweeping narrative of survival. <P>Most of the work is told from the point of view of the encircled Germans, from the general charged with the impossible mission of defending the Nazi capitol with nothing more than teenagers and grit to the women who vowed to take cyanide rather than endure rape at the hands of the conquering Russians. <P>Through it all, Ryan succeeds in recreating the dense atmosphere of dread which descended over Berlin in the closing days of the war, making all the more poignant our realization of the terrible tidal wave of suffering unleashed by the Nazi madmen who initiated the conflict. <P>This is not merely a tale of good and evil, however, and the Allies do not come off very well. Aside from the plundering savages amidst the Soviet rank-and-file, readers may be surprised at the depiction of top American and British commanders' indifference to the fate of German civilians. (Although given the lingering shock at the Nazi atrocities uncovered mere weeks before at Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and other death camps, one should not be too surprised). <P>Particularly damning is Ryan's assertion that, despite all the talk of the Allies' planning the partition of Germany and Berlin at Yalta, there was no agreement to any line of partition between the Allies at the time of this battle. No one had given much thought to the shape of the postwar world in the West; millions of people were sacrificed to the Soviets as an afterthought. <P>If you prefer your military history at the trench level, drenched in blood and chromite, this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>I orginally bought all three of Ryan's books at the same time since his book "The Longest Day" was the basis of the movie "The Longest Day", and the reviews of all three books were very good. I decided to read "The Last Battle" first, since my strong interest in WWII is dealing with the Americans, British, & Germans; the Russians have held little interest to me. With that in mind, I figured this book would be the least interesting to me of the three books.<BR> Boy, was I in for a surprise! "The Last Battle" was a very interesting and very well written book about the battle for Berlin. The book takes turns telling the story from all sides; the Americans, the British, the Germans, & the Russians. The book is so very well written that it just keeps flowing, very smoothly. The book is hard to put down. Inaddition to telling the story of the military side, you also get the horrible stories of what it was like to live in Berlin as a civilian, during its final battle. <BR> If you read some other reviews for this book, they all say the same thing: this is a great book, very well written. You wiil not be disappointed!!</span>

                    <span>In The Last Battle, Cornelius Ryan presents the battle of Berlin in shocking, realistic detail. Rather than the usual broad stroked, glossed over version of history that we usually get in movies and textbooks. Rather Ryan shows the events unfold through the stories of individuals that were there. From civilians to foot soldier, politicians to high ranking command officers. All sides are presented to the reader. This the real nitty gritty of the events, not just history told from one point of view or perspective. A must have for any serious World War II reader and a highly recommended read for anyone else!</span>

                    <span>The Last Battle, the second book of Cornelius Ryan's World War II trilogy, is a vivid and haunting account of the last days of Hitler's Third Reich and the fall of Berlin. As in The Longest Day (1959) and A Bridge Too Far (1974), Ryan weaves his narrative tapestry with meticulous research and eyewitness accounts of military and civilians on all sides who were caught up in the cataclysmic events of that terrible spring of 1945.<P>It is April, 1945, and Germany is tottering at the edge of defeat. On the Western Front, General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied armies have crossed the Rhine, the Reich's last natural defense against invasion from the west. Now, sensing that victory is near, American, British, Canadian and other Allied divisions are racing for the Elbe River and beyond - with Berlin as the long expected prize.<P>In the East, millions of Soviet soldiers have swept into Germany from the Baltic states and Poland, storming into the Nazi heartland with blood and fire. Urged on by their thirst for revenge and the orders of Red dictator Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Army also races west toward the German capital. Here the dying Third Reich will stand or die in its last battle.<P>Ryan deals here not only with the fall of Berlin, but he also explores in detail the very complicated political and military issues behind Eisenhower's most controversial decision of the War: the Western Allies would not cross beyond the Elbe River to capture Hitler's capital. Though Ryan's tone is impartial and he delves deeply into the wrangling between President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill and Premier Stalin, the reader is still left with the impression that the plans dealing with Germany's postwar fate sowed the seeds of the Cold War which followed V-E Day.<P>The Last Battle, although longer and far more complex than The Longest Day, is a very human story that keeps the reader involved. One feels the suspense of the frantic Allied advance eastward, cheering the "Amis" (as the Germans nicknamed the Americans) on even though it will be the Red Army that gets to Berlin first. The German participants, military and civilian alike, are depicted fairly and without the expected "victor's triumphal" tone that would have painted all the Germans as Nazi villains. Indeed, one can feel sympathy for Berliners who - with the exception of Hitler and his most loyal followers - would rather be at the mercy of the British and Americans rather than fall to the feared Russians. It must be said, however, that although Ryan wrote this book during the Cold War, he is fair and balanced in his reporting of the Soviet advance to Berlin.</span>
