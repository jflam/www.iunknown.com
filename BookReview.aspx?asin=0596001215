                <span id="Label1">In this book, Steven Feuerstein, widely recognized as one of the world's experts on the Oracle PL/SQL language, distills his many years of programming, writing, and teaching about PL/SQL into a set of PL/SQL "best practices"--rules for writing code that is readable, maintainable, and efficient. <i>Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices</i> is a concise, easy-to-use summary of best practices in the program development process. It covers  coding style, writing SQL in PL/SQL, data structures,  control structures, exception handling, program and package construction, and built-in packages. Complementary code examples are available on the O'Reilly web site. Includes a pull-out quick-reference card.</span>

                    <span>This is not a text for learning PL/SQL programming.  Feuerstein's PL/SQL Programming text is much more suited for that.  What you have in this book is information that the author has distilled from his other works.  In a way it could be considered a summary as the title might suggest.  This book is a must have for the leader of an organization that is beginning to use PL/SQL.  You will find what you need for your programming standards here.<p>In addition to good standards suggestions, the author also gives a lot of resources that are available to PL/SQL developers.  One of the prime examples is utPLSQL, a unit testing tool for stored procedures and functions.  The author gives numerous other web sites and tool suggestions throughout the book.<p>Anyone looking to increase their PL/SQL productivity should pick up this book.</span>

                    <span>1. I do not follow every practice in this book.<br>2. Only some of those I don't follow do I think I should follow.<br>3. All of the practices strike me as at least arguable.<p>It does what it sets out to do. I believe that it will help the reader use PL/SQL more effectively. In the next edition, I'd like to see a section on unit testing, using the utPLSQL system that Feuerstein is managing the development of.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be an excellent (re-)introduction to good programming practices in PL/SQL.  After reading the first few pages a little defensively ("I don't make those sorts of mistakes do I?") I soon realised that there was much to learn in this book as well as much that I had forgotten.  <p>This book has lead to an instant improvement in the quality of my PL/SQL code.  I particularly like the Quick Reference card in the back of the book.</span>

                    <span>I've been feeling guilty for giving this book only one star, so here's a second try.<br>I was disappointed by this book because I was able to speed read most of it. In other words, it did not present much that I had not seen before.<br>Some parts of the book seem to be a direct (literal?) translation of OOP design methodology. It would have been interesting if the author had spent some effort examining the OOP language features which are lacking in PL/SQL, in order to adapt the methodology.<p>Ex.1: OOPL compilers can make small function calls `inline', meaning that they are expanded as if they were macros, to avoid the function call overhead. I do not believe this exists in PL/SQL. If it does, the author should mention it when he suggests using wrapper functions. If it doesn't, then he should make the reader aware of the performance cost, which in some cases might still be ok, anyway.<br>Ex.2: The methodology he proposes leads to a proliferation of methods and classes. OOPLs have language structures to make them manageable (e.g. namespaces in C++, packages in Java). PL/SQL has the further disadvantage that it does not allow you to re-group your logic inside executables, DLLs, component objects, or even inside directories.<br>Still, this book should be quite beneficial to someone who is new to structured programming. It also isn't very expensive.</span>
