                    <span>If you're a novice at wireless networks like me, you'll love this book. This book will give you all the important information and tasks you need to successfully set up a wireless netork.  You'll learn what you need to know from an maximum of visuals and a minimum of dense, techno-speak.

                    <span>Maybe a "Visual" format is really too much here.  Do we really need to see a picture of a computer with folders flying out of it?  The screen shots were great, but there were far too many pointless pictures.  This book also did not even mention channels!  C'mon...thats a pretty important concept I wanted to know more about.  the book also failed to mention wireless bridging hardware or even considerations when setting up a network with several possibly overlapping access points.  Too basic of a book, probably only suited for the home networker.</span>

                    <span>Of the hundreds of computer/math/science/engineering books I have, this has got to be one of the prettiest.  The screen shots are in full color and are very clear and legible; would that other computer books be so pleasant to read!  This book is a step-by-step guide for setting up your wireless network painlessly.  Get it, regardless of your level of computer skill; I run a systems engineering company, Transpower Corporation, in metropolitan Philadelphia--so I'm in the business, and even I learned a few new tricks.</span>

                    <span>I run an engineering home-based business and have bought several computers for my husband and children to use (to save mine for business).  I bought a wireless network for our laptop and two desktops and after the initial installation of the hardware, the network setup was very aggrevating.  My husband (the engineering PhD) struggled all day to get the computers to talk to one-another, to no avail.  I had him buy this book for me, and it helped me get network internet access, file sharing, and printer sharing completed in a matter of minutes!  <p>If you are the type who likes to flip through users guides, or use the glossary to find information to fit your needs, and you know enough about computers to be dangerously independent - this book is for you!  Everything is laid out in an "easy to find" manner, and the pictures make it easy to identify windows that you have seen on your screen.  I am keeping it handy so that I can hook up future equipment as well as secure our new network.</span>

                    <span>This book made it easy for me to set up a wireless home network--and I'm not a technically oriented person. Full color, step-by-step screen shots show how to execute each task. This is the book to get if you want to set up a Wi-Fi network without wading through a lot of text. Highly recommended.</span>
