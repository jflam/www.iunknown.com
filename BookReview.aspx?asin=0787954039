                <span id="Label1">Allegories and parables have long been effective ways to impart serious bits of knowledge and wisdom without getting too pedantic, and business readers seem increasingly receptive to sensible management theory that employs this lively age-old literary technique. <I>Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive</I>, a "leadership fable" by Patrick Lencioni, continues the trend with a solid prescription for organizational health--aiming for less politics, lower turnover, more productivity, and higher morale. Presented as a fictional tale of two technical consultants and their competing companies, the story is structured in a fashion that recalls his previous book (<I>The Five Temptations of a CEO</I>, whose main character and firm are even slipped into this narrative). Lencioni uses this hypothetical setting to show how his concepts might look and work in the real world. In this case, his "four disciplines at the heart of making any organization world class" are revealed and explained through the philosophy and behavior of Rich O'Connor of Telegraph Partners. Build and maintain a cohesive leadership team, create organizational clarity, communicate organizational clarity, and reinforce organizational clarity through human systems. Through his tale of Telegraph and its rival Greenwich Consulting, Lencioni illustrates how these principles can be beneficially employed--and how an organization can be stymied when they're missing. The story moves quickly and is followed by a comprehensive analytical summary, which includes self-assessment tools and suggestions for putting the ideas into practice. --<I>Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>This is a good book for people who like parables. The fable centers around an unfocused man swamped by rivalry, envy, manipulation and betrayal. He never sees that his most threatening rival, though not as flashy as he is, has the stick-to-it commitment of a carnival pony that would continue walking the same tight circle even if someone took off its harness. To succeed, you need that kind of persistence plus a few straightforward disciplines including internal unity, clear purpose, open communication and personnel policies that reflect your values. In short, if you pick key disciplines and stick to them, you'll go far. You've heard this sweet if shallow lesson before, in the fable of the tortoise and the hare. That fable endured for centuries because it puts a simple truth in a few words using a vivid analogy. That is the kind of veracity this book is aiming for and though it may achieve a shorter reach, its wrap-up analysis and work sheets extend its practicality. We recommend its bolstering message - if not its simplistic structure - to managers who like metaphors.</span>

                    <span>Lencioni communicates through storytelling.  Here, he unravels his four focuses of extraordinary executives by comparing two competitive CEO in consulting.<p>By reducing the difference in the two enterprises to the two differing, contrasting focus styles, the author makes a strong case for spending more time on the "organizational health."<p>This is where most will blow this vital area off.  There ego and temperament is drawn to other areas, technology, strategy, etc.  <p>These four of a healthy organization: cohesive leadership team, organizational clarity, communicate this clarity and reinforce such clarity through human systems.<p>Much to chew on, digest and see if it's worth trying.</span>

                    <span>A simple yet intriguing story that had me hooked from the beginning.  As I read with eagerness and anticipation the plights of Rich O'Conner and Vince Green I awaited to discover the "Four Obsessions".  Lencioni is a fabulous and effective story teller.  He uses story to help the reader experience the emotions of the scenario.  This is powerful because all too often leadership books focus on communicating with the head in isolation.  Lencioni beautifully captures both the head and heart of the reader.  I felt the anguish and aspirations experienced by the two main characters, while at the same time found myself in my head, problem solving, working out what I thought the issues were.<p>To my dismay, the revealing of the "Four Obsessions": 1. Build and maintain a cohesive leadership team; 2. Create organizational clarity; 3. Over-communicate organizational clarity; 4. Reinforce organizational clarity through human systems, fell short of expectations.  Simply yet profound, truth often falls short of our expectations because we expect deeply profound and complicated answers to issues of relational concern.<p>I believe this is an excellent tool to begin conversations of organizational health and wellbeing with leaders that may not be readily open to this.  I would recommend it to leaders at any level of an organization who are struggling with problems and are unaware the true nature of there issue begins with relationships.</span>
