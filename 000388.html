<h3 class="title">New Years Reflections</h3>

<p>Happy New Year! What a change this year has been for us! Here's a brief recap of what's happened in our family this year:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000228.html">Kobe</a> joined our family. In a way, Kobe was our "training baby" and he really helped us prepare for the larger changes that awaited us.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/matthew_new_year.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Matthew joined our family. It really is amazing to see the changes in him as the weeks go by. This week, we noticed that he's getting better at sitting up and looking around at the world. He's beginning to grasp and reach for objects that are close to him, and he's got a new favorite toy: froggy (or as Carolyn likes to say: Fwoggy).</p>

<p>We bought a new house to accommodate our growing family, and are counting down the days that we remain in our apartment. I've lived in the same apartment now for nearly 6 years. We've been very happy here - the views are fantastic, and the staff in the building is awesome. We're going to miss life here, but at the same time, we're really looking forward to having some more space.</p>

<p>All of these things forced me to grow up in ways that I hadn't really imagined. The first thing that I had to fix was my health: I decided that I was through with being a fat guy. So on June 6, I decided to change the way that I ate. Most of my inspiration was drawn from the book "Enter the Zone":</p>

<p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="120" height="240" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=iunknowncom-20&amp;p=8&amp;asins=0060391502&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank"><MAP NAME="boxmap-p8"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="14, 200, 103, 207" HREF="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1" ><AREA COORDS="0,0,10000,10000" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/iunknowncom-20" ></MAP><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x240.gif" width="120" height="240" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p8" alt="Shop at Amazon.com"></iframe></p>

<p>The key thing about this book was that it got you to count something other than calories. It also appealed to me intellectually since the book spends a lot of time explaining the biochemical responses that we have towards different food types. While his discussion on eicosanoids is somewhat suspect, the core message in the book: carbohydrates should be treated as a condiment, really resonated with me.</p>

<p>I'm happy to report that I'm back to within 2 pounds of my college weight - a total loss of 42 pounds since June. Most of that weight came off within the first 3 months or so, and I've been on maintenance for the past two months or so. The disappearance of my tummy has also helped during those times when you're trying to do work in a coach airplane seat and the guy in front decides to put his seat back :)</p>

<p>The second thing that starting a new family has made me think about is the state of our personal finances. We truly are very fortunate to have the income that we have, especially considering some of the dark clouds that hang over the software / IT industry at large. That said, however, I've really been ignorant of the state of our personal finances. </p>

<p>So, this holiday I decided to educate myself. My first steps were to read some books on personal financial management. The first book, The Millionaire Next Door, was a real eye-opener:</p>

<p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="120" height="240" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=iunknowncom-20&amp;p=8&amp;asins=0671015206&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank"><MAP NAME="boxmap-p8"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="14, 200, 103, 207" HREF="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1" ><AREA COORDS="0,0,10000,10000" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/iunknowncom-20" ></MAP><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x240.gif" width="120" height="240" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p8" alt="Shop at Amazon.com"></iframe>    <br />
         <br />
p. The take-home message in this book is to pay yourself first. Watch your expenses. And spend some time thinking about how you can / should invest the money that you paid yourself. Now, this formula is tried-and-true. Virtually every self-help personal finance book will tell you some variation on this theme. However, I really connected with the way that this book tells the story, particularly the way he groups individuals into the <span class="caps">UAW </span>(under accumulator of wealth) and the <span class="caps">PAW </span>(prodigious accumulator of wealth) categories. Hopefully, this year marks the beginning of my transition from the <span class="caps">UAW</span> to the <span class="caps">PAW</span> category. Note that this doesn't necessarily have anything to do with increasing income - just doing different things with the income that we already have.</p>

<p>Along the way, I tried out a few pieces of personal financial software. First, I went out and purchased a copy of Quicken XG since it's the market leader. I quickly became annoyed by the fact that I had to grant write privileges to the program's directory under \Program Files. Next, product activation got in the way when I wanted to run Quicken on my laptop instead of on my wife's desktop. </p>

<p>In frustration, I went out and bought a copy of Money 2004 Canadian Edition. So far I've been very happy. It does everything that I want, it runs fine under a non-privileged user account, it costs 1/3 of what Quicken XG does, and I can run it on whatever computer that I want. The only annoying thing is the fact that I have to save the .ofx file that my bank transmits to me to disk before importing it into Money. Under Quicken, this is a seamless operation (e.g. click on the Download button and the information shows up in Quicken - no manual import step). I look forward to the day when we can dispense with the download option entirely and simply use Web Services to retrieve the account information from the bank.</p>

<p>With the record keeping stuff out of the way, I'm now turning my attention towards taking an active role in managing our investment portfolio. One of the most interesting books that I've come across is the Intelligent Asset Allocator by William Bernstein:</p>

<p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="120" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=iunknowncom-20&amp;p=6&amp;asins=0071362363&amp;lt1=_blank"><MAP NAME="boxmap-p6"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="1, 140, 83, 150" HREF="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1" ><AREA COORDS="0,0,10000,10000" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/iunknowncom-20" ></MAP><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x150.gif" width="120" height="150" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p6" alt="Shop at Amazon.com"></iframe>    </p>

<p>The premise of his book is that the returns on an investment portfolio over the long term have more to do with the composition of the portfolio instead of the selection of the individual investments. This argues strongly for using index tracking funds to hold the investment categories, since they have much lower management fees than "managed" funds - particularly if you believe his assertion that stock picking is a random walk with no potential for long-term success. It's an interesting thesis, he makes a very good argument and backs it up with a large amount of data. Highly recommended if you want to take a hard look at the performance of your own investment portfolio.</p>

<p>I too use MS Money and love it.  The bit about importing the .ofx file depends upon the banks implementation.  With one bank I use, the import is seamless, with the other, I get a .ofx, but I don't have to save it, Money just asks about importing it.</p>

<p>Interesting ... so my guess is that the bank isn't setting the Content-Type HTTP header correctly for the ofx file. Just a guess though since this stuff is sent over HTTPS and the HTTP headers are encrypted ...</p>
