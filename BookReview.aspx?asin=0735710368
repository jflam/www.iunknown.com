                <span id="Label1">Adobe is trying to stay ahead of the technology curve by making sure  that Photoshop 6 has all of the features that a Web graphics designer needs, and  then some. In fact, the combination of Photoshop 6 and its sister application  ImageReady makes for a powerful Web-graphics design suite, and <I>Photoshop 6  Web Magic</I> shows how to get the most from it.<p>  A quick introduction leads into 21 tutorials for doing specific Web-oriented  tasks in Photoshop. In projects 3 through 5, for example, seamless tiles and  textures are created from scratch, and used as background elements on Web pages.  Other projects deal with creating elements that are designed to be animated,  such as rollovers, warping text, and pop-ups. Some projects are oriented toward  the newer Photoshop user, while others are more geared toward the Web designer,  but all offer useful tips and techniques.<p>  The sections on ImageReady and JavaScript include important, real-world  information about the various file formats--and the advantages and tradeoffs of  each--plus clear functional examples of common JavaScript code that every Web  developer should know. Handsomely produced, each page is in color and two-column  format, and the book lies flat on your desk. Graphics and screen shots accompany  every step of every project, and the author writes in a clear, concise style.  The accompanying CD-ROM includes all of the project files and related material,  as well as some bonus material: additional patterns, shapes, brushes, and  styles. There are also numerous JavaScript examples.<p>  <I>Photoshop 6 Web Magic</I> provides valuable examples and sparks countless  ideas. If you use or are planning on using Photoshop and ImageReady to create  Web graphics, the tutorials in this book are fun, educational, and inspiring.  <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>I picked up this title for a song - probably because it's old. But if I had to pay full retail it would still be worth every penny! I can't believe how easy it is to create these animations in Foster's book. I'm already making cool buttons and graphics for my web site based on the examples in this book. I suggest you get a copy and learn these easy animations and tricks taught in this great book. NOW!!</span>

                    <span>I wish to tell you that I have been using Photoshop 5.5 for a long time now and just updated to Photoshop 6.  I was so lost!  I love the three dimension styles that it has and this book shows me very well.  I also love the many animations and even more information about making the web graphics.  If you have just updated to Photoshop 6.0 and need to understand the features and tools, then I recommend this book to you!  (Sorry for my bad English!) ~ Sinclaire</span>

                    <span>This book is essentially a book on layer styles. 90% of the lessons are BASED almost entirely on slapping on a layer style. Rarely does the author show you how to make a style, most of the time you are instructed to use a default, or worse use one from the CD-ROM -this isn't learning!! <p>The book is well formatted and look's good on a coffee table. The cover is nice, the layout is nice. But they book's content is very shallow. The first 4-5 lessons were pretty good in my opinion but after that the book became very redundant. Every lesson starts with applying a style to slightly different shape, and ends with creating a SLIGHTLY different gif animation in Image Ready. Any half intelligent human would only need 1/4 of this examples. Do you really need someone to show you how to animate a blue sailboat across the screen, then follow that up with how to animate a green sailboat, then a yellow one. Hey Mr. Foster what happens if I'm ever am confronted with a purple sailboat, I won't know what to do?! There was no sailboat lesson really, but my point is the book teaches the same concepts over and over and over. 15 of the 21 lessons are slight variations of the exact same concept.<p>The quality of the end result in most cases is also fairly low. Gif animations are ugly and annoying enough usually, but if you use the authors examples... well, please don't. Examples include, the old text 'Sale' in an exploding star shape animated to fly at the viewer; animations of text dripping and twisting and bending and twirling (all different lessons of course), and looping over and over again. <p>There seem to be 2 types of Photoshop users, those who want to press a button and be immediately sastisfied with an instant 'magic' result, and those who want to understand how the program really works. I would like to think that users with experience (which is this book's target) would not fall into the instant result category, but based on the number of 5 star reviews of this book, this is not the case. I suspect some of these reviewers haven't finished the book, I liked the book when I was on chapter 4.<p>The book should be really be called 'PS 6 Style Application Gimmicktry'. This is not a 5 star book. There are so many great photoshop books available that it would be best to get another one with more insight and less gimmicks. Generally the magic books are a good series, but this one's an exception.</span>

                    <span>I am teaching a high school course in web programming. The course will cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web graphics. The ideal book on Photoshop for this class would: 1. be focused on Web graphics (Photoshop is not just a web tool, and other books spend a lot of time on other aspects). 2. be clear, with bite-sized examples and step by step instructions 3. include as topics creating background graphics, animation, and image map rollovers 4. be inexpensive Well, three out of four is not bad. Photoshop 6 Web Magic is too expensive to require students to buy it. Otherwise, it is what I was looking for. The price of the book probably is due to the high cost of color reproduction. If your idea of a book is large quantities of verbiage, then you will feel very cheated here. But for my needs, less is more. I can use the examples in this book to give students a sense of accomplishment. This should be better for them than a comprehensive treatise that is less accessible. Should you buy this book? My guess is that you will like it more to the extent that: --you prefer learning from examples to learning from theory --you prefer a book that is organized around particular problems or projects to one that is organized around the features of the software --you really want to focus on the Web aspects of Photoshop 6.0 I fit that profile, and I am pleased with the book.</span>

                    <span>Building on the success of Photoshop Web Magic, Jeff Foster opens the horizon to creating more interesting web pages through the use of integrated graphic programming in Photoshop 6 Web Magic. Each project is 3 to 10 pages in length and designed in a two-column format with step-by-step instructions on the left and corresponding graphics (or code) on the right. In addition, sidebars are used to provide additional tips and tricks. Any effect, technique, or tip can easily be customized to fit a your own design needs. Photoshop 6 Web Magic is ideal for anyone new to Photoshop and wanting to employ terrific ideas and graphics to their personal or professional website. 1 CD-ROM,  336 pp.</span>
