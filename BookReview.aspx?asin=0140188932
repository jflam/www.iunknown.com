                    <span>While the book isn't a true story, the characters are based on real people Primo Levi met during the holocaust.  It surprises, inspires and humbles the reader to know that humanity can exist in the midst of such horrible chaos.<p>I liked the fact that there is not happily ever after, that the characters must fight to produce their own future.  But, it is good to know that along their journey, they met many who would help them.<p>Primo Levi is a wonderful writer.  He stays true to character, winds the subplots into the main plot without jerky interruptions and allows the characters to be real, not stereotypes.</span>

                    <span>This fictional account of Jewish partisans fighting their way through war ravaged eastern Europe is incredibly moving. The characters are so realistically human in their reactions to the chaotic conditions that they encounter. The book explores a chapter of WWII history that is not very well known and does so from the perspectives of ordinary people caught up in the swirling events and joined together by a desire to survive as well as by a common hatred of the Nazis. There is an incredible life affirming wedding scene in the midst of countless grim episodes that demonstrates the human capacity of endurance. The translation is excellent and the narrative is crisp and fast moving. One of the best literary works dealing with the European war.Unforgettable!.</span>

                    <span>Primo Levi, from what I know was a very gifted and sensitive man.  Levi  never forgave himself for surviving the holocaust, he felt guilty because  his own life was spared, eventually he committed suicide.   A very little  known fact of World War II, was the work of the Jewish Resistance. Millions  of European Jews perished in the holocaust, some managed to get away, a few  managed to hide, and there also were the Jewish Partisans; those who  fought.     If not now .. when? is an absolutely beautiful story of those  souls who fought the oppression. This is not a graphic book of the  suffering of the holocaust; this is a great novel about a group of people  who in spite of all the suffering keep moving forward. They do hold it  together, they make friends, love, sing, and cry, celebrate and mourn. This  is not a war glory story, it is a people story, and how they changed and  adapted, how they kept going. Yes, the overused expression of "triumph  of the human spirit" so appropriately describes the theme of the book,  but not always; Levi was realistic enough to see to that.     I was  profoundly touched by this book and thoroughly enjoyed it as a non-Jew.  However, I never saw this book as a journey to Palestine, as suggested by  some. These were people rising up to fight injustice and to stay alive,  they largely moved aimlessly. To interpret this book as a part of the  Zionist ovement would in my opinion be wrong.    This is translated book,  it is excellent in English, and it must have been even better in Italian. I  wish I could read it in its original language.</span>

                    <span>I went through a period when I was choosing (who knows why) only thin books to read.  In my search I found To The Lighthouse and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.  I also found Periodic Table by Levi.  The book  was shatteringly good.  Who was this man?  Why hadn't I heard his name  mentioned before in the pantheon of Holocaust authors and literature?<p>If  Not Now, When? is classic Levi.  In his immutable style he weaves the tale  of Jewish partisans making their way across Eastern Europe into Italy in  the final 18 months of WWII.  Levi doesn't stretch, he doesn't aggrandize,  he doesn't use hyperbole.  His telling is straight and clean and true.   Many authors have grandly failed to described the chaos in the final months  of the war.  In his direct style, Levi accomphishes it amazingly.<p>It  seems authors and their works always find their place in the world.  But  Levi didn't in his lifetime and he hasn't yet in ours.  He deserves to be  read and acknowledged as one of the best.<p>(Please Note:  I, in principal,  believe that the rating of reviewers seriously affects the alturism of the  review process.
