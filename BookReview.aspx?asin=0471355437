                    <span>When I decided I wanted to learn more about commercial real estate investment, I bought a pile of books that claimed to be relevant and started working my way through them.  This one was the ONLY one that I feel was really worth the read.  It starts out by ascertaining whether the reader is truly ready to buy commercial real estate, taking a very prudent view of personal finances.  It lays out everything worthwhile that any of the books on this subject lay out, and does so in a very readable manner.  At the same time, it does not talk down to the reader or try to "dumb down" any of the material.  I would suggest starting with only this book, and then buying other books (or talking to experts) in a more focussed manner, based upon what you find here.  Incidentally, I haven't bought any commercial real estate yet, but I still intend to and I am trying to follow the advice of this book in preparing to do so.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book with lots of good information. The book is great for persons without any knowledge of commercial real estate and is a good reference book for persons with experience in commercial real estate.<p>It is worth noting, however, that the much of the author's experience with investment real estate seemed to be during the 1970's decade. During that period of time there was hyper inflation in the real estate market. Often values and prices paid for real estate did not make much sense.<p>Some of the examples in the book refer to properties indicated to be worth several million dollars - and not exactly what you would call a small investment property.<p>However, the financial scenarios in this book are based on reasonably sound financial and economic theory. And the reasoning for the mathematical financial calculations seem to be fairly sound.<p>The book is a good buy for the price.<...</span>
