                <span id="Label1">Grant Palmer's <I>Java Programmer's Reference</I> provides an efficiently organized guide to the most important Java classes and APIs. With a basic tutorial and a nicely organized listing of Java methods (grouped by specific packages), this text is a great resource to have on one's desktop and is suitable for anyone who programs with Java on a day-to-day basis.<p>  This small-format book (measuring 9 by 6 inches) will fit into a briefcase--despite having more than 1,200 pages of reference material. Organized by Java package, the book tours the most common Java APIs, centering on the "core" and user-interface classes in Java (for instance, AWT and Swing). Early sections explain the basics of Java, including data types, keywords, and language constructs. Sections on the newer Java 2 collection classes are notably useful and concise. The rule of thumb in this text is both to list all methods associated with a class and describe all arguments and return types. Most entries also contain sample code.<p>  <I>Java Programmer's Reference</I> successfully organizes information for quick searches. But this volume is much more than a listing of APIs. The explanations and the sample code will fill you in on newer Java 2 features, and let you review the language quickly. The focus on "core" Java instead of Enterprise APIs (like RMI, JNDI, or Jini) keeps this guide manageable and puts the classes used most for everyday tasks close at hand. Besides its general index, the book includes a separate listing of all included Java classes to let readers find what they need in a hurry.<p>  Java APIs continue to grow by leaps and bounds. Whether you are a new or experienced Java programmer, this truly handy reference helps you be more productive by putting the most important APIs at your fingertips quickly. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul> <li>Java 2/JDK 1.2 reference and tutorial <li>Overview of Java, Java variables and data types, arrays, and collection classes  <li>Java I/O classes including file I/O  <li>Java networking (sockets, URLs, and connections)  <li>AWT classes and methods  <li>Event objects and applets  <li>Basic Swing user-interface classes and methods <li>Swing borders, tables, and trees  <li>Java Bean support classes, additional Java packages, and sample code </ul></span>

                    <span>This book sits on my desk and I use it all the time. I looked at "Java in a Nutshell" but now you have to buy three books. This book covers JDK 1.3, the javax.swing package, and has hundreds of short examples. The java.io package examples are especially good. The book also has a very good chapter on Java Beans. The index is outstanding. It is 60 pages long and is divided into two parts, a general index and one for classes. Because its only one book, it doesn't cover everything in the J2SE JDK 1.3, but as a reference book that covers the core Java it's great</span>

                    <span>This is the best Java reference book on the market today. It's not perfect, but it's closer than any other Java reference out there. I like the way the information is presented in a structured manner. Classes and methods of a certain type are grouped and explained together. The book is very readable and gives a lot of helpful hints to avoid gotchas that aren't usually explained by reference books. The examples are great and there are lots of them. A lot of times when I'm stuck I won't even have to read the text. I can just look at the appropriate example and it tells me what I need to know. This book is not for neophyte Java programmer's. It doesn't spend a lot of time on object oriented theory or other real basic stuff, but for intermediate or advanced programmer's it's great.</span>

                    <span>I was very disappointed with this book. For someone quite experienced with Java it might serve as a good tool for jogging the memory. When you are in the process of discovery it is a very difficult book to use. The index and the table of contents center around classes, not topics. If you don't already know the classes count on wading endlessly back and forth through this book. For the programming I was doing the reference was very incomplete, even regarding the basics. I found references on the Internet to be much more helpful than this book.</span>

                    <span>This book by Grant Palmer is by far very VERY useful...i repeat...VERY useful if you can't figure out how to work with a specific class. The short examples give a good idea on how to implement something. It makes understanding things much easier since he has code and what the program will execute and what the output will be.<P>He goes through the very basics, such as access modifiers and variable sizes, etc. He moves from the standard packages and moves gradually to file IO, then towards the AWT/Swing packages.<P>The author isn't able to demonstrate ALL of the classes but by far, he covers close to 100% of what are mostly used in real-world applications. It is by far, one of the best reference manuals that I know of.<P>Keep in mind his title: Programmer's REFERENCE.<P>The way I see it, he fulfilled the book's purpose and definitley deserves those 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>The book could be used by a beginner too. I was forced to use Java to develop a simple network program and I was a total beginner (first time) to Java. With this book as my main reference, it helped me most of the way in my program. The examples for window programming javax.swing package were great. The book help me to understand Java too. I suggest that first time programmer to Java should have this book.</span>
