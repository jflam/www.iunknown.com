                <span id="Label1">Good programming--which is to say, programming that yields both efficient code and a profitable life for the programmer--depends on not reinventing the wheel. If someone else has solved the problem you're facing (and someone almost always has), you'd be foolish to waste your energy figuring out your own solution. <I>MySQL Cookbook</I> presents solutions to scores of problems related to the MySQL database server. Readers stand a good chance of finding a ready-made solution to problems such as querying databases, validating and formatting data, importing and exporting values, and using advanced features like session tracking and transactions. Paul DuBois has done a great job assembling efficient solutions to common database programming problems, and  teaches his readers a lot about MySQL and its attendant APIs in the process.<p>DuBois organizes his cookbook's recipes into sections on the problem, the solution stated simply, and the solution implemented in code and discussed. The implementation and discussion sections are the most valuable, as they contain the command sequences, code listings, and design explanations that can be transferred to outside projects. The main gripe readers will have about <I>MySQL Cookbook</I> is that the author, in his effort to cover the range of MySQL-friendly programming languages, uses different languages in his solutions to various problems. You'll see a Perl solution to one programming challenge (Perl, in fact, is the most frequently used language, followed by PHP), a Python fix for the next, and a Java sample after that. Readers have to hope that they find a solution in the language they're working with, or that they're able to transliterate the one DuBois has provided. It's usually not a big problem.  <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to make MySQL databases do your bidding--in terms of queries, table manipulation, data formatting, transactions, and Web  interfaces--through the database server's command line interfaces and (more importantly) through the MySQL APIs of Perl, PHP, Java, and Python. Particularly excellent coverage deals with formatting dates and times, management of null values, string manipulation, and import/export techniques.</span>

                    <span>I am an experienced web developer and recently started using Perl with MySQL to build database-driven CGI applications.<BR>MySQL Cookbook by Paul DuBois turned out to be a valuable reference resource.<P>While the title mentions only MySQL, the book provides a great deal of solutions (and code) for using MySQL with Perl, PHP, Python and Java. If you are familiar with any of these computer languages, this book and MySQL manual is all you need to start building applications with MySQL-compatible database backend.</span>

                    <span>There are many databases out there. MySQL is one of the better ones. It's a free (for personal use) database system which can be easily integrated into a web application on virtually any system. It has supports most of the standard feature found in most database system and has quiet a few features unique to MySQL. This particular book is a good reference for the experienced user as well as for new comers and as an added bonus even covers MySQL 4.0.<P>This is book was my first introduction to O'Reilly's cookbook series. It provides solutions to some of the most common challenged faced by the particular subject being covered (in this case MySQL). I thoroughly enjoyed it and was quiet impressed with it. Too many technical books simply introduce the concept without relating it to real world applications.<P>This particular book introduces all of the most basic concepts of database manipulation (table creation, data insertion, data deletion, data update). As well as writing simple and advanced SQL statements to retrieve data. It approaches database design using 4 of the most popular languages (Perl, PHP, Python and Java). These are only a few of the many possible languages which can be used to manipulate a MySQL database.<P>MySQL cookbook touches on a variety of different topics which I don't have the space or time to cover in detail, but here is a list of them:<P> * Handeling duplicates<BR> * MySQL on the Web<BR> * Processing Web input with MySQL<BR> * Using MySQL-based Web Session Management<P>One of my favorite topics covered in the book is the idea of storing binary data such as images within a database. Although not ideal for most cases (unless you need fast access to a vast array of images), just the idea of it has a certain kewlness effect.<P>Well, overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It needs to touch slightly more on the basic concepts of databases, and it can become the only book you'll ever need for MySQL.</span>

This book enabled me to quickly learn how to perform tasks in MySQL which are equivalent to what I would perform with Oracle.

                    <span>In this "MySQL Cookbook", Paul DuBois ensured that a wide range of topics were covered. In fact, most Unix and Mac OS X users would cherish the contents of this text. Comprehensive information were presented in a very uncomplicated way. The book did advanced analysis of all MySQL-based scripts which are applicable to Java, Perl, Python and PHP. The same story goes for MySQL-based web scripts under Apache and Tomcat. It gave readers sufficient guidance to codes, using time-saving illustrative examples. However, beginners who need to start from the scratch may not appreciate this advanced approach.<BR>In conclusion, this is a dependable text that both intermediate and advanced MySQL learners would appreciate.</span>
