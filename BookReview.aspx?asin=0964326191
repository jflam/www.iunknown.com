                    <span>Every book I've read up til now on spiritual growth seemed well within reach if one simply practiced some proven principles.  David Hawkins material is different.  This guy underwent some spiritual shockwave that left him with an entirely different view of reality.  That's why I caution the potential buyer.  This is not an easy read nor is it meant for people who simply want a more successful life.  This is about Hawkins realization that the "self" that we all think we are, is really just an illusion, an abstact cluster of disjointed thoughts, memories, emotions, reactions, etc. and that the belief that our bodies and minds are us, is the root cause of all our pain.  Again and again, he reiterates that our real "self" is actually a universal "Self" that is connected to everyone and everything.  He argues that the small individual self, the ego, fights like crazy to protect this illusion that it's the real thing.  It's really just an abstact.  Our true nature, according to Hawkins, it based in a benevolent unifying God force that is all encompassing.  It's everything and everywhere and only our ego based fears block our awareness of it.  Once we let go of the beliefs that we are our thoughts and opinions, or that we are bodies, then we begin to experience a deeper, truer sense of who we are.  This is accompanied by a profound sense of peace and a feeling of "coming home", as if this truth had been there the whole time and we are just remembering it.  He makes the analogy that the universal Self/God/Source is much like the sun, in that it continually shines and the only reason we don't feel it and see it, is because it gets blocked by something.  
<br />
<br />In addition to his own radical reawakening, the premise to much of  Hawkins work is based on kinesiology, the body's physical response to posed statements.  In testing, when a statement is true, the body (usually an outstretched arm) stays strong.  If not true, it dips and goes weak.  The amazing part is that it works even if the person being tested does not know the answer.  A toxic substance in a sealed envelop will make the person go "weak" even if they believe it to be something good inside.  That implies a "universal mind" or cosmic consciousness that supercedes the individuals own predispositons and opinions.  It's like we are being governed by a higher force but we are completely unaware of it.  By becoming more aware, we can become more conciously aligned with it and live in a more intuitive and less "mental" way.  Concisousness becomes our innate guide rather than mental logic.  
<br />
<br />Again, this is heavy lifting compared to other books I've read and it's not for everyone.  Hawkins is big on spirituality and not so hot on religion, which he believes has watered down a lot of the truth.  This read requires an open mind and the ability to suspend your entire belief system while you absorb the material.  I would recommend it to those who are looking to push the limits and go beyond the traditional confines of successful living.</span>

                    <span>I have been told that it's good to listen to those who are searching for truth and to avoid those who have found it. In the case of this book and its follow-up "I", I would say that these are a good example of such a saying. I read Power VS force, and enjoyed the thoughts it provoked. I love the effect of provocative literature as it expands my awareness, and widens the view of my subjective conscious world. The more convinced the author is of the matter at hand the better I like it. Although there are several yellow sticky flags poking out from the page edges of both "Eye" and "I", which will draw me again to a particular thoughtful point, my impression after reading these books is that Mr. Hawkins would rather not have been born a human. Do you remember how the Data character of Star trek and the Andrew character of The Millennium Man were an "android that would be man"? Then you will understand what I mean when I say that this author is a "man that would be android". It bothers me that he has something so strongly against being human. This makes me doubt his agenda toward me as a human. It also bothers me that he so completely surrenders his analytical abilities to an unseen entity. God's TRUTH, as read through the muscle spasms of only the most innocent among us--Ask a question, push against someone's outstretched arm, get the truth! I don't know about you, but this... making me doubt my own decision-making ability bothers me a whole lot. If Kinesiology becomes the next religion, I hope I'm not around when it happens. These unseen forces, if they're mostly malevolent, will have a field day tricking us with half-truths just as other religions do. Pass these two up, but enjoy Power VS Force as the real gem of this trilogy.</span>

                    <span>The Eye of the I is the book of all books. It spoke to my soul like no book/movie ever has. David Hawkins is a true avatar, and you can trust anything he has to say. This masterpiece has changed my view of life, and I will never be the same again- nor would I ever want to be. </span>

                    <span>The capacity for understanding rely's on our ability to comprehend information, via the intellect. Without reserve, I am grateful to have come to Dr. Hawkins teachings with all its brilliance, and I would surely recommend his writings to anyone in the common search for Truth. <br>In reaction to the comments which compared his teachings to the more simply guided teachings of Christ, Buddha, Krishna: let us remind ourselves of the obvious growth we (humans)have endured since the birth of Jesus, our last Avatar. Know from this...  Without using logic, it is easy to understand 'why' teachings from 2,000 years ago would be in a 'different'(more 'simple') format. Obviously, the world at that time, would not have been able to comprehend Teachings with their intellect being less evolved. Also, we could be grateful for the intense descriptiveness of Hawkin's teachings. The manor in which Hawkins presents the information is Terrific and Perfect for this day in age. It is no wonder he was a trained Psychiatrist in his earthly life. <br>To end, I must say, the level of gratitude I have for his influence on my life as a spirit/(human being), is only partial. Yet apparantly grateful, I know I cannot fully comprehend the tremendous gift it has been, and ever will be, to come into contact with Dr. Hawkins. The thankfullness deserved for this gift is beyond my mind!</span>

                    <span>This guy is the best and this book is a prelude to an even more informative book of David's called simply "I". Not for the Dogmatic spitutalist as it will blow their minds. If you choose not to wait forever (from amazon) for the book just go to veritaspub.com and buy it immediately from the author.</span>
