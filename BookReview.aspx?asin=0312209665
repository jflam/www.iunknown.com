                <span id="Label1">Bill Reynolds built his youth around sports.  As a boy in a blue-collar Rhode Island town, he spend his hours shooting hoops and dreaming of stardom.  From his adolescence to high school fame to a scholarship at Brown University, Reynolds enjoyed the perks of athletic glory.  But those days soon ended and the onetime star drifted between his past and an uncertain future.  Glory Days is a warm, touching, and funny book about what happens when jocks grow older --about getting a life without losing touch with your dreams.</span>

                    <span>This is the second Bill Reynolds book that I have read. Loved them both. I found his descriptions taking me back to high school and the playground. It brought back a lot of memories and also made me think about how I prioritized basketball for so many years. <P>Non basketball junkies may call Bill's live experiences crazy. I dream of some of his experiences. Great book!</span>

                    <span>Bill Reynolds is certainly one of America's finest sports journalists. "Glory Days" addsto that luster.While some may dismiss it as a purely personal account of one's growing up, it is a lot more. It is a book to be read and enjoyed by all former star athletes, high school or college, who realized at some subsequent point in their life that they had to move on but did not want to let go of the one thing that they had worked at while growing up A disclaimer: Bill was a fraternity brother of mine at Brown.</span>
