                    <span>This is a great book if you are preparing for the exam. Don't use if you are trying to learn Project Management, though. I passed the exam this month and I must say that this book was the biggest contributor in my success. Most of the questions at the end of each chapter are very similar to what you would have in the real exam, some are even tougher. And the tips throughout the book are very valuable.
<br />Initially I thought that it is over-priced, but after passing the exam, the only grouse I had with this book has now gone away.

                    <span>If you are preparing for your PMP Certification Exam, you should invest in this book.  Don't pay attention to any negative reviews.  This book was critical in helping me pass the exam - which I did easily (90%).  The book presents material which is most important on the exam and helps you to understand the dry PMBOK material very easily.  I found the activities to be very useful and the questions in the book will be very similar to the real exam. Good luck!</span>

                    <span>I just passed my PMP, but I cannot say it was due to this book. I bought this book and then a colleague let me use his Andy Crowe book...and this is the one that I will praise.
<br />
<br />Rita's book is too heavy on useless exercises, and as some people pointed out, she makes you feel stupid. Her questions are too convoluted and are not close to the actual exam questions. The actual exam was more like the final exam in Crowe's book.
<br />
<br />Although, I have to say that some questions I would not have been able to answer if it was not for this book, but it was a good complementary study for me.
<br />
<br />If you are choosing between this one and Andy's book - buy Crowe's, not Rita's.
<br />

                    <span>I read the Guide to the PMBOK two/more times. I completed the online course and reviewed the material two/more times. I read other project management books. These were all good for broad project management knowledge.
<br />
<br />But if you are serious about passing the exam, buy and study this book now! Good luck!</span>
