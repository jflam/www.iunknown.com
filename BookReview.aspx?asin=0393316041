                <span id="Label1">A series of anecdotes shouldn't by rights add up to an  autobiography, but that's just one of the many pieces of received  wisdom that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88)  cheerfully ignores in his engagingly eccentric book, a bestseller  ever since its initial publication in 1985. Fiercely independent (read  the chapter entitled "Judging Books by Their Covers"), intolerant of  stupidity even when it comes packaged as high intellectualism (check  out "Is Electricity Fire?"), unafraid to offend (see "You Just  <I>Ask</I> Them?"), Feynman informs by entertaining. It's possible to  enjoy <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</i> simply as a bunch of  hilarious yarns with the smart-alecky author as know-it-all hero. At  some point, however, attentive readers realize that underneath all the  merriment simmers a running commentary on what constitutes authentic  knowledge: learning by understanding, not by rote; refusal to give up  on seemingly insoluble problems; and total disrespect for fancy ideas  that have no grounding in the real world. Feynman himself had all  these qualities in spades, and they come through with vigor and verve  in his no-bull prose. No wonder his students--and readers around the  world--adored him. <I>--Wendy Smith</I></span>

                    <span>"Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!" is a collection of short stories in the form of a sort of autobiography by renowned physicist Richard Feynman, a developer of quantum electrodynamics who had a huge impact on modern science. The stories recount, as the subtitle states, "adventures of a curious character." Throughout the book, one is unsure whether to throw the book against the wall as punishment for Feynman being such a pompous chauvinist pig or to smile and appreciate the professor's ridiculousness. One thing is for sure, though, he certainly does have a lot to say. In that sense, the adventures themselves and the abundance of books written by Feynman about his own life reveal his subtly pretentious mindset. Richard Feynman was a genius, and he knew this, in spite of all his self-doubt. 
<br />	All the account provides an interesting look at a famous figure in different ways that one would have expected. The reader follows Feynman from a small town in New York fixing radios, to fooling his frat brothers at MIT, to working on the Manhattan Project, to playing the frigideira in a Brazilian samba band, to partying in Las Vegas, to a position as a "dignified" professor at first Cornell and later Cal Tech, and finally to heading the investigation of the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986. He comes across as an exceedingly intelligent individual, but also as a human being with weaknesses (often creating humorous situations) just like everyone else. Feynman attempts to bring warmth and feeling to what is stereotyped as a cold and indifferent profession, at the same time portraying himself in a positive light. Feynman's enchantment with the beauty and simplicity of nature and scientific understanding is overwhelmingly evident throughout the book. He discusses the influences of his father and mother and the "charmed life" he lead in Los Alamos during World War II. Feynman describes the "different box of tools," including the diagrams and integral paths, that made him so famous. 
<br />Feynman is a halfway decent writer for a math nerd, but it is the humor that keeps the reader interested. Although the book provides a window into the life of a very interesting and ingenious man, it is meant more for a good laugh than for scientific enlightenment.

                    <span>Dr. Feynman was a person who showed us that you could be trapped in an 8 x 10 room with nothing but your curiosity and imagination and amuse yourself your entire life. 
<br />In this book, he comes down hard on pseudointellectualism, fakery, hype, and  good old fashioned stupidity.
<br />He proves that scientists have more not less common sense than the rest of us. Read this book and change the way you think</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Richard Feynman's hilarious voice is very prevalent in this book, as he describes growing up fixing radio's, working in a hotel, life at MIT and Princeton and working for the military. He gives an ingenious and insightful reflection on society along with an interesting autobiography. I began reading this book afraid that I would have science concepts forced in my face, which did occur occasionally, but I was left with a feeling that I actually got to know Feynman's personality and that just a little bit of his genius rubbed off on me. Toward the end of the book I began to get a little lost by the concepts and equations while he was a professor but I do not think that was a problem in the writing, more of a lack of scientific concepts on my part. Feynman has a knack for the description and deciphering of peoples personalities, while oddly enough he complains of trouble with his social ability.  
<br />
<br />Overall I enjoyed the book, more because I enjoyed Feynman's success and personality, than because I enjoyed the science.

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book "Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman". This book is very interesting and it was very hard to put down. The many anecdotes kept me laughing and wanting more. Even though the events occurred before present day, many of the stories can still capture in intrigue of the youth of America today. This book is one of my new favorites even though the only reason I read it was for a physics project. I am happy to know that there are other books by Mr. Feynman such as "What do YOU care what other people think?". I have actually already purchased this book and cant wait to begin reading it. I enjoyed this book because not only is it science, but it is also fun science! I have never been a great admirer of the science world, but Mr. Feynman's book helped me change my entire outlook.</span>

                    <span>The novel, "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!", by Richard Feynman was very interesting I must say. The numerous stories of events during his life were very comical and entertaining. Feynman's humorous tales of his ideas and experiences made it hard to put down. Although the book is written by a physicist, it is not your typical science book. It tells about the things Mr. Feynman did from his childhood all the way up to his life as an adult. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an enjoyable biography about a wonderfully successful physicist. </span>
