                    </div>
                    <span>Author and Silicon Valley insider, Po Bronson, writes a very funny novel about four quirky guys with the right stuff who want to create something that matters in the realm of computers.  From cutting edge software and hardware development companies to Palo Alto think tanks, the plot follows the creation of a less than $300 computer from a list of low priority projects at the think tank level to the actual modeling of a prototype that gets one rival top dog engineer's undies in a knot.  The trials and tribulations that face the group compare to the highs and lows of an EKG with enough back-stabbing, personality manipulation and corporate espionage to keep the reading at a wonderous pace up until the last 20 or so pages.   The crafting of the dramatic persona, especially the four progtammer/hardware specialists hinges closely to the usual stereotypical portrayals of techno geeks seen in movies and television shows.  However this does not detract from the fun level of the story; indeed one gets the sense that these portrayal closely model reality.  What does detract is the rather abrupt ending which winds down what could have been an all out page-turning business adventure with a stop-on-a-dime conclusion that certainly did not satisfy me. <br><br>Perhaps having seen the rather burlesque film version of this novel, I naively was expecting more bells and whistles and a more thorough troncing of rival engineer and threat Benoit.  It never came, but perhaps that is due to the fact that I know nothing about the world of Silicon Valley where Bronson's could-be spoofs on the computer industry's behind the scenes star would lose their bite.  Happily, the novel does not force a romance between Caspar and his housemate as in the movie version; here the attraction is noted and the reader can use his imagination to determine the outcome. Thank you, Po.<br><br>All in all, I enjoyed the novel; I just wish it had a longer ending.</span>

                    <span>Bad characters, inane and obvious plot and zero writing style make this one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  If you have any  interest in the world of business or silicon valley and the computer industry you should find this book laughable.  And to make matters worse Po Bronson takes the kindergarten level theme and story so seriously it makes you doubt his credentials.<br>I actually thought this might be a fun read as I was going through a similar situation as the lead character but just found this to be insulting me on every single page.  I hope Amazon don't take it as a spoiler if I tell you the ending is unbelieveably stupid.  In a word: Avoid.</span>

                    <span>The moment I picked up this book I found it hard to put down.  Bronson does an excellent job of giving all the characters a deep background, and weaves them into a fantastic story about the inner working of the Silicon Valley.  It really made me realize how tough a start up is.  Nevertheless, the book abruptly ends and really left me disappointed.</span>

                    <span>'The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest' is the story of 4 geeks trying to get their start-up off the ground. The characters are funny, as are the situations they get theirselves into. I read this after reading another Po Bronson book, 'The Nudist on the Late Shift', which is non-fiction. I think 'The First $20 Million' is a good fictional companion to 'The Nudist'. Anyone who considers themselves related to the computer culture will find this book interesting. The book does seem a bit outdated now though, after the dot-com cycle.</span>
