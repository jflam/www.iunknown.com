                    <span>It is a very good book for anyone concerned about aging. We get more aware of our age at the time of retirement. Switching from a daily-work routine to a totally new idea of all-time-holidays is often not as pleasurable as we expected thirty or more years before. At that difficult time, it is very helpful to focus on the Four Pillars of Longevity as suggested by the authors of the book: 
<br />
<br />1. Six-times-a-week exercising. 2. Eating for nutrition, not for any other reason. Focusing on fruits and vegetables. 3. Avoiding boredom, developing your hobbies. 4. Connecting with many other people - creating a solid circle of friends. 
<br />
<br />The book provides some good medical background for these readers that like to understand why certain things are happening. 
<br />
<br />Another book well worth reading is "Can We Live 150 Years?" by M. Tombak. It is the Body Maintenance Handbook, as the subtitle states. I like the common sense approach that is prevalent throughout the pages. Some of Mr. Tombak ideas, for obvious reasons, are similar to the ones presented by Crovley and Lodge, but on the whole it is a totally different book. Many excerpts are available for reading at the publisher's website.

                    <span>Time is running out, but most of us aren't out running...or bicycling, or skiing, or lifting weights, or dozens of other things we can do to extend the quality years of our lives.  Aging should be the same as with food...about getting better, not getting old and rotten.  The authors provide a diagram (a blueprint can't be made to fit everybody) for improving the quality of your coming years, and for improving the possible quantity of those years as well.  Written with men in mind, it is true for both men and women.  As is sometimes said, "A must-read"!</span>

                    <span>"Younger Next Year" takes years to get to the essential points. My guess is that both Crowley and Lodge are so much younger than last year that they now have time on their hands. 
<br />
<br />Crowley and Lodge, I am sure, had fun writing this book (they said they did), but the first two thirds of the book was not fun to read. I felt like I was listening to two excited kids who forgot what they wanted to say. Crowley and Lodge get off tangent often and are extremely verbose. 
<br />
<br />Written in a conversational style, the first two thirds of this book are devoted to the well worn topics of exercise and diet. Those who are already modestly familiar with physical fitness will not find anything new here...exercise, exercise, and exercise. And those who are modestly familiar with eating habits will not find anything new here...eat the right stuff, eat the right stuff, and eat the right stuff. 
<br />
<br />The surprise, however, comes in the last third of the book which is devoted to emotional lifestyle issues - relationships, commitment to a purpose, and attitude. Crowley and Lodge correctly ascribe being younger next year not only to the usual, well written prescription of exercise and diet, but also, and importantly to one's emotional (and they hint at spiritual) state. 
<br />
<br />It is this last third that makes the book a good purchase, and a welcomed addition to the literary arsenal for those wondering how to live "the last third" in the most satisfying way.

                    <span>Maya Angelou said of Oprah's Book Club, 'I don't like all of the books she recommends (Winfrey) but at least she gets people out to read.'
<br />
<br />Sage advice. If it takes the glibness and sarcasm of Chris to get you off the couch, feeling sorry for yourself, riddled with extra pounds while you wheeze your excuses for not exercising, out the door and on the track, Good Lord man, that's OK.
<br />
<br />We don't all respond to the platitudes of wise Medical Practitioners citing stories of cholesterol and the C-6 C-10 Mambo. Hell. I'm still trying to figure out the good cholesterol and the baddies. But I do know this. If I do what they say (I've worked out all my life but have been doing it THEIR way for 3 months) I end up feeling awfully good. 
<br />
<br />Let me repeat that. I don't know if I'm holding back the tide, if I'm Horatio at the bridge or if I'm fooling my body into exchanging decay for more aerobic muscle. I just know that I feel good.
<br />
<br />I also appreciate the effort they direct towards our relationships. It's not mush. For men, we forget the axiom of 'dancing with the girl that brought us.' Have fun. Work on your relationship while you work on yourself. Like Chris says. Be a guy. Suck it up. Do it.
<br />
<br />I think it's a lifesaver. I bought two more copies for my brothers. Like Ms. Angelou says . . . well, you know what I mean. A great anthem to go into your 50's and 60's with. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury </span>

                    <span>This book is written for men who are ready to or already retired.  I didn't know this when I picked it up but I think it's advice applies to females as well.
<br />
<br />This book is coauthored by Dr. Henry Lodge, a board certified internist who regularly appears on the "Best Doctors in New York/America/World surveys" (so the book jacket says).  Dr. Lodge writes from the perspective of our evolutionary biology, evolutionary sociology and evolutionary psychology as he explains why we need to exercise, stay connected to community and do something meaningful with our lives.  The details of the evolutionary biology is the fresh meat served in this book and it is compellingly tied to those things we hear over and over again so that they finally make sense and motivate you.  
<br />
<br />If a spoonful of sugar can make the medicine go down, then the sugar is Chris Crowley, the coauthor and retired litigator.  He implements Dr. Lodge's beliefs into his life and tells us about it.  It reads like a wonderful memoir, complete with "laugh out loud" while you are reading it humor.  But while you are busy laughing, Chris Crowley, with the expertise of a great salesman, is persuading and motivating you to join him in taking charge of your body and life so you can live "like 50 until you're 80 and beyond."
