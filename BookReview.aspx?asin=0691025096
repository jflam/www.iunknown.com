                    <span>This book shows you how simple concepts when applied properly can lead to ingenious solutions. For example, the author's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem will leave you shocked by its amazing elegance. And, there are several of these throughout the book.<br>Read this book. It's money more than well spent.</span>

                    <span>To follow the book you don't need to be a matematician but  it helps to remember this and that about integrals and differentals.<p>However, the book is more than a guide to mathematical reasoning - you can look at it as a guide to problem solving orriented thinking. I work as a business consultant and I could resist constantly thinking about business decision-making in the context of the book. I strongly recommend it to anybody with interest in management decision-making.</span>

                    <span>One of the most beautiful books on scientific discovery. Read this book and then keep it at bedside for sheer amusement. Analogies are frequently the key to a discovery, but it is rare that this essential step receives credit. Here there is a collection of them: some of the most beautiful. Perhaps the most famous is Bernoulli's solution of the brachistochrone problem, based on an analogy with the path of light in the atmosphere. But there are many others, with comments and analysis by Polya, who spent a life thinking at these things. It's a pity he didn't include Riemann's "proof" of the theorem of conformal representation, based on an analogy with the physics of electrical currents on a surface. The reader can find it beautifully described in Richard Courant's "Dirichlet Principle".</span>
