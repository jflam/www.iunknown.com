                    <span>While I enjoy an afternoon at the game as much as anyone, I've never considered myself a baseball fan. I read this on the recommendation of a friend, however, and found it to be enjoyable on several levels. On one level, while it's quite clear where the NFL and NBA get their talent, the MBA's methods aren't quite as visible for the non-fan; Price's book shed some light on how pro hopefuls work their way into the big leagues. 
<br />
<br />But more importantly, "Baseball by the Beach," shows why baseball is truly America's favorite pasttime. While recent events involving pro players have soured our memories of what makes baseball so magical, the history of the Cape Cod league as presented by Price reminds us of a time when the game was pure -- and the accounts of the league's present-day incarnation give us hope that this sense of magic might yet make a comeback. It's enough to renew this fan's faith in the game.</span>

                    <span>I've read the book Baseball by The Beach by Christopher Price.  I found many inaccuracies and vital information omitted. <p>For instance, on page 50, Manny Robello was not the manager of Sagamore or umpire-in-chief.  The manager and umpire-in-chief was Manny Pena. On page 54, concerning a big meeting, that meeting was about Manny Pena bringing in college ballplayers. You see the managers at first did not want to bring any out-siders in to play for the League. When they finally agreeed they only limited each team to bring in 3 players per team. The Next year Manny brought in 6. Manny Pena also attended that meeting because he was the General Manager for Sagamore. On page 49, 3rd paragraph talks about Sagamore, without mention of Manny Pena. On page 87, last paragraph discusses the umpires and the major league. Manny Pena was the umpire-in-chief. And he was interviewed by the FBI about his umpires doing the games while they had the umpires strike. George Scott of the Boston Red Soxs was married to Lucky Pena. <p>I have tried to reach out to Chistoper Price but I have not yet been able to get in contact with him. I will be writing the publisher of the book in the very near future.</span>

                    <span>I think the book is great but, just too short. It took quite a while to find it, but I finally did.<br>I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the game of baseball, because it gives a great history of the best collegiate baseball league in the country.<br>I played 3 summers in the Cape League, Wareham 1975, and Harwich 1976 and 1977, and they were truly 3 of the best summers I have ever spent. The jobs weren't the greatest, but the baseball sure was. If any college player ever gets the opportunity to play in this league, they should jump at it.<br>Reading this book and seeing the names of ballplayers I was fortunate enough to play with, sure brought back a lot of memories.<br>When does the sequel come out?</span>

                    <span>My father was one of the Cape Cod Baseball Leagues prestigious umpires.  Curly Clement umpired in the Cape League for 35 years and the stories that he tells about the "kids" who played baseball during their  summers from school can be read within the covers of this book.  It is a  must book to read if you love the game of baseball.</span>
