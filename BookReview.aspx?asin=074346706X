                    <span>To all of you country fans out there who have not read this book (both of you!) go and buy it now!! It is the best piece of literature concerning a great artist ANYWHERE! It's fun, insightful and just cool! The pictures are very well done and the story of Tim's struggles to get to where he is today is both heartwarming and impressive! Go Tim!! By the way, to all of you Tim fans, I actually shook "his" hand at Cox Arena on May 14th, 2003 here in San Diego. (Tim, I was the tall guy in the black hat, off to your stage left!) My life is complete!! Yes, ladies.... it was good!!</span>

                    <span>I met Tim Mcgraw one time and that was the most special day in my life.  I even had my picture taken with him backstage at a route 66 concert in Springfield, Missouri. I would say on all the songs that i have heard him sing he puts his whole self into his songs and more. That is what the other singers need to do is take a couple of lessons from our man Tim here to get a little bit of them there pointers,everyone is so crazy about,but most of all he cares alot about his wife and family, but the band and the fans are important to.All I know is Tim is so great and the most awesome guy I have ever heard singing in person.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as a present to myself. I knew that it would be interesting. I just didn't know how interesting. What a great man. He takes care of what is important to him... his family and his closest friends. He is honest and doesn't care what anyone else thinks or what everyone else is doing. He is his own man. The stories were funny and real! Not like most super stars. Tim is very real. and I think that is why he wrote this book. He wanted his extended family to know a little more about him. That's only fair.<br>Great, easy, read...and cool pictures. Fun coffee table book.</span>
