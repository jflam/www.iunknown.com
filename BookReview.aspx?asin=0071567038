                <span id="Label1"><p>Ultralight canoes and small boats are things of beauty, their apparent delicacy concealing great strength. They are lapstrake-constructed from marine plywood planks, each plank overlapping the one below it in a gracefully curved hull. Epoxy glue along the laps gives the hull structural reinforcement, minimizing the need for framing and permitting an amazingly light structure. Round-bilged and elegant, they are built over jigs, but the method is straightforward and not time consuming. You can build a boat that will give you fun and satisfaction, one you can be proud of, in a winter of leisurely weekends. No fancy tools are needed, and care and patience will make up whatever you lack in woodworking skills. <p>All the information you need is here. Tom Hill, the chief proponent of ultralight boatbuilding and its leading practitioner, describes the method from start to finish using a skiff and canoe as examples. In the appendix is a gallery of ultralight designs, all but one of which you can build without lofting. If you want more flexibility, however, you can adapt almost any lapstrake small-boat design, traditional or modern, to the ultralight method. With some lofting (directions for which are given) you may then build a wide range of boats whose offsets are available. And you may adjust planking thickness and scantlings to give your boat extremely light weight with normal strength, or moderate weight with great strength. <p>Particularly if you lack an extensively equipped workshop and professional skills, <i>Ultralight Boatbuilding</i> will unlock exciting possibilities you considered out of reach.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book that teaches techniques in building glued lapstrake boats in a clear and accessible manor. There is also plenty of useful information on general woodworking techniques applied to boat building. I'm not sure where the term "ultralight" comes from, but I wish the title had been, "How to Build Wooden Boats Using the Glued Lapstrake Method."<P>This book has more helpful pictures than most others. Still, I wished there were more at times. However, in those cases I was able to get a mental picture from the author's exceptionally clear explanations.<P>I am using this book as a guide as I build my own glued lapstrake boat.<P>I also recommend "Clinker Plywood Boatbuilding Manual", by Iain Oughtred. That book also has some great diagrams and pictures. Also get "Building Small Boats", by Greg Rossel, but if you are new to boatbuilding, you might want to read this book and Oughtred's first since they are slightly more accessible.<P>By the way, if you want to build the skiff discussed in the book, Redmond Designs is easily found on the internet by searching for "Steve Redmond Boatbuilding".</span>

                    <span>I bought this book with the misconception that I would be able to build the canoe shown prominently on the cover.<BR>The boat shown on the cover is only mentioned as a set of plans offered for sale by the author. There are no plans included with the book, although several sets of plans (for sale) are mentioned. The book appears to be primarily an advertisement for the Author's boat plans, which are not included and nothing can actually be constructed from the information in the book.<BR>Thumbs down on this one.

                    <span>After reading many of the 'classics' on building small boats, I relied on Hill's Ultralight Boatbuiling extensively to construct my first boat--a Chamberlain Dory Skiff in Gardner's Classic Small Craft. Hill helped resolve many of the mysteries of how to achieve tight lapstrake construction with entry-level woodworking skills and a little patience. The result was very rewarding. I created a light, seaworthy, beautiful craft that proved very durable. I used it for many years before selling it. Now I'm considering another project, but can't find my copy of Hill's book, so I'm back for another.<P>One caveat: the designs Hill uses in his book to illustrate his techniques are beautiful, but you'll probably need more complete plans for your first project.</span>

                    <span>If you're an intermediate to advanced wood worker Tom Hill speaks your language. His description of plywood lap strake construction truly does sound the lightest and strongest of the small boat buliding methods. If you don't like the idea of sloppy joints held together with fiberglass tape and you love the sound of a finely tuned plane you'll love this book. The section on lofting is simple, understandable and not at all scary. The tips for tool usage are inovative and fairly sure-fire. I came away knowing I could build a great boat with the plywood lap strake design described here. It is frustrating that the plans for the boats described are not included, (the plans are available from the designer who's address is listed) but anyone dabbling in just the basics of lofting could design their own boat from what is in this book. The method is challenging but not intimidating. It'll get you excited about building a boat.</span>
