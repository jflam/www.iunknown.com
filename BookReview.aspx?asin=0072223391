                    <span>What I paid for this is all that it's worth. The page layout is hardly inspiring and i would hesitate to call this write/author a graphic designer or artist. For those of you who prefer Mac visuals and OSX screenshots, this ain't for you. Nothing but Windoze. I would recommend "Exploring Illustrator CS" by Annesa Hartman instead, a very much more complete training manual. </span>

                    <span>I recently purchased Illustrator 10 and an another $100.00 in related books.  I set out to master the beast by going through each book, a page at a time, attempting to accomplish on my computer what the books commonly referred to as "Simply do this or Simply do that!".  What a struggle. Most of the books I purchased seem to assume I have a working knowledge of Illustrator 10 (which I didn't) except for one book called Virtual Classrom by David Karlins.<p>In frustration I put in the CD that comes with the Virtual Classrom book and Bada Bing, Bada Bang, Bada Boom! ... I had a soft spoken fella showing and telling me how to do some of the things I had spent hours trying to figure out. I should have  opened his book first, but noooooo.<p>I would recommend this book, hands down, to anyone looking to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator 10. The book and supporting CD is an easy to understand learning tool that compliments many other so called instruction books on the same subject.<p>As I understand, David Karlins has penned another book which is soon to be available. I know I'll be getting it as soon as I'm able.<p>Keep up the great work ... a new loyal customer.<p>GM</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed everything about this book -- from the cover design to the layout of the lessons to the friendly, easy-to-follow instructions for working with each of the tools. Illustrator can be a very complex program to figure out, and Mr. Karlins gives his readers a painless path to mastery of all its essential functions.<p>And if you'd rather see how something is done than read about it, you'll love the CD that accompanies the book. It's nice to "meet" the man behind the words you've been reading, and a very pleasant fellow he is. Each lesson on the CD corresponds to a chapter of the book, and Mr. Karlins is an engaging teacher who covers the written material and then some, all the while delivering a solid foundation in the working of one set of tools before adding the next set to your repertoire.<p>If you're a user experienced with Illustrator 9.0 and are just upgrading to Illustrator 10, this book might be too basic for you -- although if you're not a regular user, you'd enjoy it as a reviewing tool and guide to the new features.<p>But if you're just coming to Adobe Illustrator with this new version 10, then you can't go wrong having this friendly, well-written book /CD combo to set you on the path to confident control of all the tools you'll need to create your own beautifully-executed illustrations.</span>

                    <span>Author Karlins has written a concise guide to Illustrator.  He has extrapolated from his mastery of the application so that even a novice can read and understand the techniques he explains.  The CD-ROM tutorials offer an opportunity for an interactive experience which are of value in conjunction with the text.  As a first time student of Illustrator, this book was invaluable in helping me overcome my fear of the pen tool!  There is a great deal of content in the book - it is a reference to which I will continue to refer as my skills develop and questions arise as to how to perform specific tasks and create certain effects in Illustrator.</span>
