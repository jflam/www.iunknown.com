                <span id="Label1">London, 1936. Gordon Comstock has declared war on the money god; and  Gordon is losing the war. Nearly 30 and "rather moth-eaten already," a poet  whose one small book of verse has fallen "flatter than any pancake," Gordon  has given up a "good" job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former  salary. Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and  cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because (or so he believes), "If you have  no money ... women won't love you."  On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby  rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner  of the sort of "mingy, lower-middle-class decency" he is fleeing in his  downward flight.  In <i>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</i>, George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate  satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass, or by the need  to make it, will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls  "the money-world" in unflinching detail, but the satire has a second edge,  too, and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures, we  become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is  no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has  become something of a monster himself.  Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a "happy" ending that  poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour,  but constantly fresh and frequently funny, is the result of Orwell's steady, unsentimental  attention to the telling detail; his dry, quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies  and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts  of any easy answer. <I>--Daniel Hintzsche</I></span>

                    <span>In my opinion, this is Orwell's best work by far. It was the last of his books that I read but also the most enjoyable. It pits the main character in the book (Gordon Comstock) against the capitalist society in which he lives and which is begging him to become a part of it. Although he is talented, he is fighting to get the recognition that he deserves while those around him are making lots of money from their blatantly obvious lack of talent. This book could have been written in any year since and would still accurately portray the times in which we live. Throughout the book I found myself pleading with Gordon not to sell out. But can he afford not to? You'll have to read it to see!</span>

                    <span>Of all his novels, this was Orwell's least favorite. 

It tells the story of one man's war against money and the middle-class values and ideals of 1930s London. The "money=bad" message is about as subtle as a brick over the head, and you probably will get tired of the somewhat preachy rantings of the book's anti-hero, Gordon Comstock. 
 Yet the deptiction of post-WWI London is quite good and can provide some important insight into Orwell's better novels.
 
 As for the "upbeat" ending, it is nothing of the sort. Orwell does not sell out Gordon by leaving him set up in a "good" job, living happily in wedded bliss with his beloved Rosemary. Rather, he turns a conventional denouement (marriage and birth) on its ear. The irony that runs throughout the novel (and which is particularly acute in its ending) makes "Keep the Aspidistra Flying" worth a read, even for those who are not Orwell fans.</span>

                    <span>It being the 100th anniversary of George Orwell I decided to read one of his books that I hadn't gotten around to yet that was recommend to me a while ago, Keep The Aspidistra Flying. It is a novel about a poet who is trying to live outside the capitalistic system with abysmal results. He vividly describes the tedium and sordidness of middle class poverty, which differs from the equally demoralizing squalid poverty of the common classes.</span>

                    <span>George Comstock, living in 1930s London, wants to gain the benefits of a good life without working hard for them. So, with his own peculiar philosophies and ideas in his head, he rebels from the conditions of life he finds himself in, tries to pursue an easier life, becomes lazy whilst perceiving himself clever doing so, finds himself falling, broke each week, having to count his pennies, his life deteriorating; and eventually comes round - full circle - to accept the limitations that modern life generally forces onto most of us, whether we like the nature of the concrete jungles we live in or not...<P>This is an excellent book about life and the forces in life we are subject to - the fact that most of us have to be compliant cogs in a huge wheel of industry of some sort if we want to get on in life, whether we want to be or not, and if we try to step off the treadmill and leave the rat-race, it doesn't work well and we won't like where it puts us. <P>The book is a very good read, and well worth reading. It should be handed to any child who wants to be a rebel and thinks he can get by without working hard, to make him understand better some of the things that modern life involves and requires of us.</span>

                    <span>One of the most underrated, least-known masterpieces I have ever read. I could not put it down! The Orwell brilliance that finally became better known in Animal Farm and 1984 shines forth peek-a-boo style in this book, easily the best of his earlier works. The most human book he ever wrote. Quite charming, quite ridiculously idealistic, in it's positive ending it is unlike the darkness he would write about later--though shades of it are there throughout. Oh but I love this book. One of my all-time favorites. Orwell was the best author of the 20th century, in my book.</span>
