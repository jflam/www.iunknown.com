                    <span>I have a whole bunch of animation books, but I found that the majority of them were just pictures. I found it a huge relief to have a book that can actualy explain the animation proccess at an above 5th grade level.</span>

                    <span>Well, after waiting so long for this book to come back into print it turned out to be an overall disappointment. I found "Timing..." to be remedial and overpriced. True, timing itself is crucial to animation as with all acting, however this book offers nothing I didn't already learn from "Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life" or Preston Blair's How-To books, which I cut my teeth on.<BR>If you are an animator who already owns every other book on the subject and you have 30 bucks burning a hole in your pocket then this book is for you. However, if you don't own the 50 other great animation books by Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Richard Williams, Eadweard Muybridge, John Canemaker, Brian LeMay, Jeff Kurtti, Preston Blair, Chuck Jones, Tony White, Culhane, Finch, Schneider, Adamson, Rebello, Green, and Hart to name a few; then please go buy one of theirs. <BR>This one is going back for a refund. Sometimes you just have to say "The Emperor is Naked."</span>

                    <span>In this book, you will get concentrated doses of animation rules and laws as it applies to timing. Very simple explanations, tricks of the trade, formulas, and vital do's and dont's is what seperates this book from the rest. In animation, it's all about the timing.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased a copy of Harold and John's book, and find it to be well-written and easy to follow; were it not for the recent publication of Richard Williams' book 'The Animator's Survival Kit,' I would label 'Timing for Animation' a critical purchase for an animator's arsenal. Wait. I take that back. It IS a critical purchase, but 'The Animator's Survival Kit' also covers this material exceptionally well, too, plus it has SO much more... Bottom line: This book is worth having.</span>

                    <span>Although I don't own a copy of this book, I've read most of it. Just as the title says, this book focuses on one of the most important aspects of animation: timing. It's well written and full of exercises and techniques that will help you improve your timing. I've heard that some animation schools use it as a textbook. If you're thinking about a career in the animation industry, this book is a must buy. However, it's pretty hard to find since it's out of print. I think that it's worth the extra effort to own a copy.</span>
