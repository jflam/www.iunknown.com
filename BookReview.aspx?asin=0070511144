                    <span>I read SPIN Selling and became a fan.<P>Then I bought this. Its so-so. The author did not really have material enough for a complete book so he borrows from SPIN Selling (which is to be expected, I guess), but he repeats himself too much.<P>There is a point that is made, then some anecdotes, some common sense, then the point is repeated, almost word by word, and at the end of the chapter the summary covers the point again.<P>A little disappointing actually. Maybe 3 stars is too much.</span>

                    <span>Unlike most developers of major account sales strategy, Neil Rackham methodically backs up his analysis of the buyer circle with in-depth research. To develop his major account sales strategy, Rackham has observed and analyzed a large number of high dollar value sales made around the world. Rackham convincingly shows that effective selling strategy is built on a thorough understanding of customers and the concerns they can have at each phase of a sale. Mastering that strategy, of course, requires, a lot of hard work and practice from salespersons determined to make the difference at the end of the day. Rackham successively reviews these phases that he has identified as: account entry strategy, recognition of needs, evaluation of options, resolution of concerns, sales negotiation, as well as implementation and account development. <P>1. In analyzing "Account Entry Strategy", Rackham successively explores the focus of receptivity, the focus of dissatisfaction, and the focus of power as well as the pitfalls associated with them. Because coaching, in our culture, has a positive connotation, few professionals will turn down the chance to demonstrate to a fellow professional their expertise and the usefulness of their connections. For that reason, successful salespeople identify, nurture, and leverage their sponsor(s) to ultimately get access to the different buying influences. Because of possible shifts in the account on the buyer side, Rackham rightly recommends that no salesperson rely on only one individual to penetrate an account. Rackham also reminds his audience about the critical importance of uncovering implied needs to turn them into expressed needs. Successful salespeople make their contact(s) at the level of dissatisfaction aware of the urgency and severity of the problem(s) to be addressed so that these contact(s) eventually feel obliged to help them get access to the leverages of power. <P>2. In looking at "Recognition of Needs" and "Evaluation of Options", Rackham first briefly explores his SPIN questioning strategy that is explained in a luxury of details in his other book "SPIN Selling." Basically, successful salespeople usually first ask the buyer situation questions, secondly problem questions, thirdly implication questions, and finally need-payoff questions to uncover implied needs for turning them into expressed needs that require action. Rackham also reminds his audience that successful salespeople prepare their sponsor(s) to help these sponsor(s) sell the sellers' solution in their own words if they are denied access to the focus of power. Furthermore, successful salespeople not only help the buyer identify needs but also influence him/her in the definition of the differentiation factors and their perceived importance to sort out the different options being offered to him/her. Rackham urges his audience to keep a broad definition of competition in mind. Finally, Rackham explores the three strategies that can help salespeople overcome their vulnerabilities and the dangers associated with these strategies: 1. Change the decision criteria (overtaking, trading-off, redefining, or creating alternative solutions), 2. Increase their strength through correction of misunderstanding or negotiation, and 3. Diminish the competition directly or indirectly. <P>3. In examining "Resolution of Concerns", Rackham reviews the hidden and expressed concerns that can push buyers to get "cold feet" in the decision-making process leading to an eventual purchase order down the road. As Rackham pertinently observes, price is often a convenient excuse that the buyer uses to hide his/her other, real concerns from the salesperson. Successful salespeople need to leverage their relationship with the buyer for uncovering the eventual areas of concerns, clarifying these concerns, and helping the buyer resolve them. Finally, Rackham warns salespeople about the three deadly sins of handling concerns: 1. Minimizing 2. Prescribing and 3. Pressuring.<P>4. In investigating "Sales Negotiation", Rackham first reminds his audience about the importance of making a clear difference between selling that tends to focus on buyers' perception of problems and negotiating that tends to concentrate on the cost of the solution. Addressing concerns about the solution with discounts will only weaken the position of the salesperson when the time of negotiation comes. As mentioned above, price is often used as a smokescreen. Rackham then reminds his audience that the only things successful salespersons negotiate during the Recognition of Needs or the Evaluation of Options phases of the sale are the needs or requirements of the buyer that they cannot meet in order to minimize the probability that they are out of the sale. Rackham finally observes that successful negotiators focus on areas of maximum leverage instead of over-concentration on price reduction, establish and narrow ranges, plan and use questions, separate understanding from agreement, and rigorously test for misunderstanding.<P>5. In dissecting "Implementation and Account Development", Rackham rightly reminds his audience that successful salespeople do not rest on their laurels after getting the order. They are deeply involved in the implementation of the solution adopted to increase the probability that the buyer successfully overcomes the motivation dip reflecting his/her evolving enthusiasm about that solution over time. Furthermore, Rackham pertinently stresses the importance of account development instead of account maintenance. Finally, Rackham also observes that successful salespeople document their successes, generate leads and references, reassess their understanding of customer needs, and influence future decision criteria.<P>Rackham wraps up his analysis of major account sales strategy with a case study built on his research to put the concepts mentioned above into practice for the benefit of his audience. <P>As a side note, a good strategic complement to the "Major Account Sales Strategy" is "The New Strategic Selling" by Stephen E. Heiman, Diane Sanchez, and Tad Tuleja. Like the former, the latter focuses on the strategy towards high dollar value sales.</span>

                    <span>If a selling effort is a long and dangerous "journey" lasting many months, with a rough sea full of small rocky islands and seductive Sirens, then you have to steer holding this book as an invaluable coach and an experienced navigator.<P>This book from Huthwaite's author Neil Rackhman is a paramount proof that account strategy is not an impressive set of selling jargon. Instead of demonstrating his strategic insight, the author systematically develops:<P>1. The customer decision process, and how important it is for you to fully comprehend and finally exploit.<BR>2. The appropriate strategic behaviour you must adopt according to the selling phase, as seen from the customer's perspective.<BR>3. The skills you need to deploy in order to successfully survive (it is a war, you know!)<BR>4. The pitfalls you must avoid, either obvious or hidden.<P>One of the most impressive aspects of Rackhman's books is that he utilizes his company's experimental findings about selling process. Nevertheless his conclusions are backed up by theoretical explications one can trust.<P>The book is full of interesting real life case studies, which evidently reveal how theory interprets practice. The entire last chapter is devoted to an artificial case, which demonstrates how all the book's ideas meet the real - cruel - world. A very interesting chapter is devoted to sales negotiations. The reader will find very helpful advice regarding this difficult phase of a sales process.<P>The language of the book is simple and clear. Nowhere in the text the reader will have the feeling that this page could be omitted.<P>During the reading there is an intangible feeling that what is being read is great advice for whatever major account selling strategy could mean, but after the last page what is left is a tangible anxiety about how all these will be applied. There is no need for a profound analysis to prove that even the best theory is worthless if it can't be put into practice. The hardest part of the entire effort is the time when the reader must practise what he/she read and organise himself so that he successfully implements the all-important strategic tools mentioned throughout the book.<P>No author, however ingenious strategist or sales trainer he/she may be, is able to improve your strategic selling skills without a substantial effort from you. That's the bad news, but I believe you already know it. The good news is that you aren't alone in this hazardous journey. This book is more than a faithful navigator.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book. It is a very useful guide for all people involved with major sales (managing or selling). Unlike many books regarding sales it can help improvement in the following areas : 1. Organise concepts regarding sales 2. Avoid Critical mistakes 3. Adapt pattern of bahavior to a most positive one (with regards to major sales) 4. Better understand buyers 5. Understand the difference between major - small value sales. I strongly recommend it.</span>
