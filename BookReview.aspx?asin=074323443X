                    <span>I assigned this book to college freshmen and sophs.... in US History.  <p>I did not like how it portrayed Abigail as "long suffering," yet strong.  The two did not mesh well.</span>

                    <span>During the history of the United States there have been many women who have sacrificed just as much or more for their country than did Abigail Adams, but not many.  Thanks to the voluminous correspondence of Mrs. Adams this book was made possible and should stand as a monument to all of these women.  <p>In recent years the life of John Adams has been reexamined and his role in American history has again come to the forefront.  Without Abigail, Mr. Adams could never have accomplished what he did.  For unlike many of the other leaders of the Revolution, Adams was not a man of means.  When he was away, someone had to look after the family's domestic concerns.  That someone was Abigail.  John became so accustomed to having Abigail to take care of home and hearth that when he did have time to see to such matters he seldom did.  <p>This book details the work Abigail did behind the scenes to allow John to make his vital contributions to American independence.  We see a strong woman who is more than willing to take charge of a given situation and make a decision.  We also see however a wife who misses her husband.  Abigail and John Adams are one of the true love stories of history.  Their complete devotion to each other is amazing, especially in that the longer they were together the more in love they became.  In the end becoming almost one soul in two bodies.  Abigail's worst hardships didn't involve the work she did but the separations from John.  Separations that lasted months and then years at a time.  <p>Abigail is also shown in this book as a woman of strong conviction but also a woman of great contradiction.  She and her husband helped make the American Revolution but she detested revolution as a threat to the social order.  She believed strongly in a good education for women but still thought a woman's place was in the home.  She believed the election of a Republican President would destroy the republic, but eventually became a Republican herself.  Mrs. Adams was also probably a better politician than her husband was and while she had much influence on her husband, there were times when he paid no attention to her and ended up wishing he had.  For example, it was Abigail who first saw the danger posed by Alexander Hamilton and it was Hamilton who in the end cost John the Presidency.  <p>An excellent book but not complete.  A much larger volume would be required to do this great lady justice. Still, it is wonderful that there is such a book at all for the women of that era are often forgotten.  Abigail once advised John to not forget the ladies.  Advise we should remember in the 21st century.</span>

                    <span>While in college I took an American History class because I wanted to, not because I had to.  In the process of writing a paper on the role of women in the American Revolution, I found so many references to Abigail Adams, that I knew at some point in the future I would have to read her biography.  Well, I just completed this book and I can't recommend it more highly!<p>With so many books regarding the Founding Fathers being touted at the bookstores recently, it's wonderful to read the story of one of the Women behind one of the Men.  Though not traditionally educated Abigail's knowledge of politics, curiousity about everything, and affection for family and friends is well-documented through excerpts from her numerous letters.  The sacrifices both she and her husband made for the fledgling America are a sober reminder of the courage and bravery required of our ancestors.<p>In a time when woman were subservient to men, she stood head and shoulders above other members of her gender.  Her husband wisely depended on her counsel, love and care.  <p>This is a wonderful biography that takes the reader back in time and place so vividly as to feel present at the birth of a nation and a voyeur into the unfolding political career of the second President of the United States and the woman who loved him.<p>I, too, wish American History had been presented this richly in my grammar and high school years.</span>

                    <span>This is a beautifully written tale of an extraordinary 18th century woman. She was the wife and âdearest friendâ of one US President and the mother of another. Her husband depended on her political acumen, and trusted her judgment. She was sometimes referred to as the âold ladyâ in the politics. She corresponded on business and politics with many men including Thomas Jefferson. Perhaps our first American feminist, Abigail Adams was full of contradictions. <p>As a staunch revolutionary, she foresaw the need for independence from England perhaps even before her husband, John. She advocated education and political freedom for women long before it was respectable to do so.  <p>As practical homemaker, she worked the farm, raised the children, and handled the family finances including investments. Abigail liked investing in securities; John preferred land. They made investments in both.  Her dependability in these matters secured the home front. This allowed her husband to attend the Continental Congress, sign the Declaration of Independence, serve as minister to France and then England, as well as serve as the first vice president, and then 2nd President of the fledgling USA.  Without her shepherding the family finances, either the family would have been ruined; or the United States would have lost one of its great founding fathers. <p>As a post-revolution political conservative, she hated the republicanism of Jefferson, although she respected him as an honorable man. She foresaw the problems with the French Revolution before Jefferson and his Republican cohorts. She did not understand the criticism of the free press. She strongly advocated the Alien and Sedition Act, passed by congress during her husbandâs presidency. It addressed the two of what she thought were the serious threats to the security of the USAâ¦ that of foreigners and criticism of the government by the press. <p>The paradox of Abigail Adams is that she âhad always established her identity through her husbandâs achievements.â  The author tells us that âProbably Abigail would have been astonished to find herself transformed into something of a celebrity one hundred fifty years after her death.â âYet surely she would have approved of the reasons for her fame: the interest of a later age in the history of family and domestic life, as well as the history of politics, and above all its interest in the emancipation of women and the discovery of women in the past who spoke out on behalf of their sex.â<p>The beauty of this book is that Lynne Withey presents Abigail Adams as a real human being, not an icon.  It is easy to understand why Abigail was Johnâs Dearest Friend. <p>I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I'll keep it short. I only wish that when I was in school history had been taught using tools like this book. It paints such a realistic view of life when our country was young.  I felt as if I were there and knew (and liked) these people. They came more and more alive with every page.  What an extraordinary woman with, despite the hardships, a relationship with her husband to be envied.  I'm so glad it has been re-released.  My present copy is second hand - there were no new copies to be had a few years ago.  I recommend it without reservation!</span>
