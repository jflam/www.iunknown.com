                    <span>I am now reading the book for the second time. The author does a very good job at getting you to do the exercises. You are very inspired by this book and truely believe that you can become a better worker. <P>I bought this book to help me stop procrastinating and wasting valuable time worrying about things and just putting other things before my work. <P>I still have a little trouble applying the last two sections in the book but I am gonna keep reading and going over the information until I got it stuck as a habit.<P>Self-Discipline is something you can learn. It just takes some work.</span>

                    <span>Self-Discipline in 10 Days: How to Go From Thinking to Doing by Theodore Bryant is one of the best books on the market dealing with self-discipline. It's a shame that this book did not get more publicity. I really should. It's more like a workbook than a paperback, and it's well worth my 25 dollars. I really like this book.<P>Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated</span>

                    <span>This is my first review, and the only reason I am writing it is because I feel this book deserves it. Like the reviews before me said this book has an incredible step by step guide, on how to get your life in motion. Also it tells you exactly what you need to hear to stay motivated and not to fall victim to your bad habits. I highly recommend it!!!</span>

                    <span>Self-Discipline in 10 Days is brief and to the point -- no endless case histories about how people used the techniques to brighten their lives. You actually can get some results in 10 days but, for significant results, it takes longer, 10 weeks, 10 months. This is a book to read -- and then review many times over. There's too much to learn all at once.</span>

                    <span>I have lots of ideas and projects, but most of them were not getting done. I read the book, one chapter per day and did the exercises like a good little student. It has been extremely helpful. I've built the shelves I wanted to build, cleaned up the terrible messes around the house, started projects and making so much progress on them that I actually amaze myself. I've read other books from the so called "success" literature to help, but this one is the most practical, and easy to read. I almost don't feel like writing a review because I'd be giving away such a useful tool. <P>The book is essentially split in two big sections. The first section deals with fears that people have. According to the author these fears subconsciously interfere with your ability to get things done. Through the exercises you gain insight into what fears you have and to what extent they influence you. I found the exercises useful, but a friend didn't agree that these were the most important fears. <P>The second section has four or five chapters. Each chapter deals with a particular attitude that is an obstacle (such as perfectionism), and provides a tool to help the self discipline process. Some tools are a bit wishy-washy, like "visualization", and "Mr Hyde" but after an initial "what is this BS?" I tried the concepts and I find them very useful.<P>All in all, a very useful and practical book. I recommend that you read one chapter per day, and when you start a new chapter quickly skim over the preceeding one.</span>
