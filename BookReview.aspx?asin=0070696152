                    <span>I am a corporate entertainer - comedy magician - and have found this to be one of the best business books I have ever read.  From selling, to marketing, to establishing fees, to finding your ideal client this book is terrific.  I recomend it to anyone that is in a business that has anything to do with getting up in front of an audience; magician, comedian, musician, singer, speaker, trainer, consultant...I have just purchased "Million Dollar Consulting" and am enjoying that as much.</span>

                    <span>Alan Weiss doesn't pull any punches. "Money Talks" is loaded with solid, specific advice you won't find elsewhere. From platform skills to marketing to leveraging your knowledge to create passive income and make yourself a star, he covers what you need to know to make it as a professional speaker.<p>The only thing lacking in this book is information about marketing yourself on the Internet. I'm hoping that if there is a second edition there will be a chapter included on the Internet. Even without it, this book belongs in the library of every speaker.<p>The best time to get this book is when you are just thinking about launching a speaking career, but it will benefit anyone who speaks professionally or hopes to one day.</span>

                    <span>Read this book first. Then, read it a second and third time. Over the past three years I have read approximately twenty books on both public and paid speaking. None have been as clear, focused, interesting, truthful, funny, encouraging, and helpful as Money Talks. My goal has been to build a consistent, high paying professional speaking business, but I have had trouble finding a clear direction. That is no longer the case. The authors down to earth, no nonsense business approach that focuses on customer outcomes instead of speakers egos makes it possible for most anyone with a sincere desire to succeed in the world of paid speaking. As a result of reading this book I have "tweaked" several aspects of my business. This has led to more effective speeches, more bookings, developing relationships with current and future buyers, and more enjoyment for myself and my customers. If results are what you are after, read Money talks!! A good companion book on structuring a speech is, "Powerspeak", by Dorothy Leeds.</span>

                    <span>As a new speaker a lot of my time has been spent learning the business.  Not until reading Money Talks have I felt that I could work and make a living in this field without changing, drastically, who I am and how I like to do business.  Money Talks takes the power out the hands of others and puts it squarely in mine.  Thank you for that.</span>
