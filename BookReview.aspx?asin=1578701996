                <span id="Label1">Under the hood, how does Windows 2000 <I>really</I> work? <I>Windows NT/2000 Native API Reference</I> provides a thorough listing of all available internal or "native" API calls, many of them undocumented. For any advanced C/C++ programmer who writes Win32 device drivers or system utilities, this is an indispensable resource to some truly impossible-to-find information.<p> The book first explains what native APIs are and what they are good for. Native APIs (which all begin with the "Nt" or "Zw" prefixes) run closer to the operating system (in kernel mode), so they are perfect for those who write device drivers, debuggers, profilers, or other system utilities. <p> This book lists several hundred native APIs, the C structures they use, and the Win32 calls that invoke them. As a reference, this text is a model of clarity, with each function clearly documented and explained. APIs are grouped by functionality, from finding system information to processes and threads, memory management, file I/O, and other categories. One standout here is the sample code that polls the system for low-level information, which mimics developer utilities that let you view process and thread information. Other short examples include techniques for accessing debugging, profiling, and exception information.<p> For programmers who write device drivers, this title also includes the plug-and-play and power management APIs used by today's Windows. Interesting appendices include a guide to the way the Win32 NTFS file system organizes data on disks, along with sample code to access--and even decompress--this information.<p> Whether you want to write device drivers or system utilities, or you just want to learn more about the operating system, this comprehensive guide takes the lid off Windows 2000 and looks inside at its internal functions. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Native API overview, native API vs. Win32 API, system information and control, APIs for objects, object directories and symbolic links, virtual memory, sections for memory-mapped files, threads, processes, building ToolHelp utilities with native APIs, Windows 2000 API for jobs, tokens, working with synchronization objects, execution profiling, ports and local procedure calls (LPCs), debugging support with LPCs, opening, reading and writing files, NTFS disk structures, Registry keys, security and auditing, plug-and-play and power management, miscellaneous native APIs, exception and debugging.</span>

                    <span>This book is essential material for someone interested in knowing how NT really works. I discovered it a few years ago, and it immediately freed me from having to peer through a kernel debugger, darkly, trying to figure out interfaces.
<br />
<br />To my mind, the amount of information is right. I don't need tutorial information. I don't need a repeat of what is in, say, 'Inside Windows 2000'. This book is refreshing in that it tacitly assumes the existence of the intelligent reader.
<br />
<br />Though this book does not focus on kernel programming, quite likely you're going to be a kernel weenie if you're even interested in the material. 
<br />
<br />I don't even find the book physically too small. It's a lot easier to read, physically, than those 'inside secrets of the gurus in 21 days' tombstones.</span>

                    <span>Ok, usually I do not write reviews on books that I get, because I just don't care to. This time I have to. Not too long ago I received this book, and too my suprise it was TINY. I wasn't looking for a beginners book, but at the same time I was looking for a good reference book. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a complete reference, this isn't the book for you. Here is my break down on different categories,I feel are important to me.<p>Content Layout: 5 stars<br>Amount of Content: 1 star<p>Value for the Money I Spent: 1 Star<br>Readability: 3 Stars<p>If this book was priced at $20.00 then I would give it a rating of 4 stars, because then the content would be worth the money spent. At $50.00 dollars, this book is the biggest rip off. Alot of the W32 function calls are not even in this book. About 95% of them. I think they could have added a whole lot more into the book. Now unfortunately, I have the pleasure of having to find another API reference book, after I have already spent $50.00 on this one. If you are a programmer looking to perform special tasks with the api, don't waste your time with this one.</span>

                    <span>This book is the first and only reference of its type. It delves deep into the harsh and uncompromizing world of NT internals. No other book documents these APIs as clearly or acurately (Not even Microsoft's own documentation such as it is). This is suprizingly refreshing especially given that much of this information ISN'T DOCUMENTED AT ALL _ANYWHERE ELSE_!!! Thus even a mediocre reference would have been a welcome reprieve. However, there is nothing mediocre about this rendition. <p>It is important to note what this book is not. It is not a beginners reference to win32. It will not teach you the how and why of windows programming, and it is not a good starting point for learning about NT internals (However, it is essential once you have understood the basic material and want to do more).<p>For developers wanting to learn about basic windows programming I recommend "Win32 System Programming" by Johnson M. Hart (ISBN 0-201-70310-6). For those interested in the how and why of 2000 internals I suggest chapter eleven of "Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, 2nd ed. (ISBN 0-13-031358-0). Chapter 11, pp. 763-851, is a case study explaining how the concepts of OS theory as described in the rest of the chapters apply to Windows 2000.</span>

                    <span>This is not a regular text book about the Undocumented Windows NT. It does not tell anything about the system components or even how does the system works. I do not think this was by any means the target of the writer. It is clear to me that the writer spent lots of his time reverse engineering the NT native system APIs and in his book he is providing us with the outcomes of his work.<br>If you are looking for a book about NT internals then you need to look for some other books. However, if you are a system engineer who spends most of his time doing kernel debugging using SoftIce or Microsoft Kernel Debugger then this book is definitely for you. If you know how to break at each NT native API using SoftIce (or Microsoft KD) and dump the parameters passed to the function then this book is an invaluable help to you. Otherwise, this book is not for you.<br>Finally, this is the only available text book to the public that has published the prototype of most of NT native APIs. If you need to know those APIs then this book is for you. However, you need to consider the fact that maybe there are some mistakes so you need to verify each API prototype yourself.</span>

                    <span>This is an extremely useful and well written reference book. It's not for the faint of heart or the newbie, though. For the experienced programmer wanting to learn more about what's under the hood, and experienced driver programmer, it's an invaluable companion.  I strongly recommend it if you fit the above criteria.</span>
