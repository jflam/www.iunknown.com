                <span id="Label1">In the late 1980s, a female baby elephant was born on the plains of Southern Africa.  In a "cull," her family was slaughtered. Only the newborn female's life was spared. Terrified and bewildered the young elephant was transported to America to be sold. <br><br>Bob Norris is a cowboy with an enormous empathy for animals. Handsome as a movie star, he was the Marlboro Man, with his face appearing on billboards around the world. But something was missing. When the hurt, vulnerable little elephant, Amy, came into his life, an incredible bond between the most unlikely of friends was forged.<br><br>Bob adopted Amy and through close observation, gentle training, humor, and endless perseverance, this accomplished horseman gradually coaxed Amy into overcoming her mistrust of humans, and her fear of the world. Amy became a beloved member of the Norris family, and partner to the ranch hands, but Bob knew from the start that the ultimate goal was for Amy to regain her confidence <i>and</i> her independence - even, if it were possible, to go back to the savannahs of Africa.<br> <br>Amy may have left the cowboy's life, but she never left his heart. This is a story of mutual friendship, of genuine love and compassion, and foremost, this is an American story with roots that run deep in the values and traditions of the American West.<br></span>

                    <span>Since I was a child I have always gravitated to books and true stories of animals and their encounters with man. This book is so well written that as a reader I felt I had truly gotten to know Amy. Though this story is not as exciting and eventful as "Modoc," it is better written. I'm going to buy several copies now and get my Christmas shopping out of the way in July!</span>

                    <span>This book was such a remarkable book. It is appropriate for all ages. It is the story about a beautiful baby elephant ripped apart from her family and everything else she knew and loved.Her mother as well as the rest of the pact were slaughtered. Through her journey to survive she is taken on by a man named Bob Norris. You might have seen him before as the "Marlbro Man". <BR> Through the whole story you are strolling on an emotional rollercoaster. The bond between Bob and the elephant named Amy. He loved this animal like it was his own daughter. Trouble comes along for these two best friends. If you love books with awesome endings this is a perfect book for you. This book has one of the best endings I have ever read. To find out what happens, read "The Cowboy and his Elephant"</span>

                    <span>The Cowboy and his elephant is an exellent book for any reader. No matter what kind of book you like to read this book will satisfy your interest. This book is about a cowboy (the Marlboro Man) that owns a ranch. A transporter from africa comes and asks to store some animals. Bob (the cowboy) instantly falls in love with a special elephant. They have an interesting relationship that can only be described in the words of author Malcom MacPhearson. Sadly the fun must end the elephant ,that bob names Amy, gets too big for Bob's ranch. She finds happiness at another place though, when she starts to work in a circus. If you are looking for a book to read this is definately the one.</span>

                    <span>The Cowboy and His Elephant is a very touching and funny book. It tells a true story about the Marbolo Man. He adopts a baby elephant that was captured from the plains of Africa. The baby elephants colony was killed by poachers one night. A man that runs a nature reserve in africa takes the baby elephant in and help keep her alive for a while then she is shipped of to the U.S. The man who owns the five need to borrow some stalls to hold the elephants in. Well the man who he borrows the stalls off of is the Marbolo Man. The five elephants are all very little. The runt named Amy is alwaysed being picked on by the other four elephants. The Marbolo man takes Amy under his wing and takes care of her as best as he can. He decides to buy Amy. All of his horse hands loved Amy, the animals also liked amy. The billygoat liked Amy alot. Amy was getting very big. So the Marbolo man had to make a very hard decision but I will leave that to you to find out. If I could rate this book higher than a Five I would give it a 100.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the sweetest and saddest animal stories I've ever read. I reviewed it when it first came out and found it fantastic. The only thing the paperback edition lacks is an update on what has happened to Amy. Norris was one of the Marlboro cowboy models, a true working cowboy, and he has a Colorado ranch. One day a fellow came along who wanted to board a few elephants. Norris didn't run a boarding stable and told the man so, but was persuaded to provide a place for a small group of baby elephants, freshly wrenched from their African herds. All sold to various places except the youngest and saddest, Amy, whose name was written on her crate. Norris couldn't see her leave the property after putting in a lot of time to keep her alive, so he bought her. Amy had the run of the property because she could open her stall door at will. She learned to help train cutting horses, although she scared the dickens out of the colts at first. She could lead a colt by the lead rope or reins. <BR>One day a colt that was checked up in bridle reins, learning to accept the bit, entered Amy's paddock through the open gate. Amy didn't like seeing him in there trying to eat her hay, although he couldn't reach it due to the reins holding him back. She came after him, firmly led him back into the arena and closed the gate to keep him out of her pen. THEN she took a trunkful of hay and fed him "by hand" so that he could eat. <BR>Little elephants become big elephants, and eventually the idyllic ranch life of being a monstrous pet nuisance had to end. Amy did learn discipline and an array of tricks including playing a toy piano in the horse trailer as he hauled her between their Colorado and Arizona properties. Ultimately Amy outgrew her life on the ranch and went to the Big Apple Circus. Of course elephants never forget, and when Norris and his wife went to watch Amy perform, she stampeded out of the ring...and knelt as close to him as she could get, sobbing in elephant. The crowd started to panic, then realized they were watching a reunion and not a killer on the loose. <BR>You'll love Amy and Mr. Norris. Have your kleenex handy.</span>
