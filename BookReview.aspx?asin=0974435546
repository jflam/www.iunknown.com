Oracle DBAs who are charged with configuring and implementing a RAC clusters database will benefit from this complete guide to the installation as well as configuration and design of Oracle Real Application Clusters. Information is supplied on expert internals of shared disk technology, raw devices and RAID with RAC, the internal concurrency, resource coordination, and the locking mechanism within RAC. Also explained are Transparent Application Failover (TAF) and monitoring and tuning Oracle10g RAC applications.<br></div></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a theory book and little more than a recapitulation of the Oracle documentation and HOWTO documents provided on metalink. There are some helpful sections on RAC performance and tuning which add some value but there is simply too much filler, including the first five chapters, that contains little more than the ABCs of Oracle and fundamental OS principles.
<br />
<br />There are a number of exciting and provocative areas for RAC research which are occurring in SUN, HP, and LINUX laboratories, focused on scalability with topspin infiniband and scaling the cluster above 4 nodes. Some of this research is coming into view with the new TCP-H numbers. Little mention of this in the text. How to scale RAC clusters by expanding the number of interconnects is not addresses or quantitized. Use of network storage and NetApps with NFS over IP or with iSCSI is not addressed. Although it is mentioned that Oracle packages its own clusterware and file sharing tools, there is no in-depth analysis of why other tools such as SunCluster, Veritas Storage Foundation suite or RehHat clustered file system might not have superior methods for data protection, performance, or usability. None of the problem areas for installation or configuration are addressed( there are many problem areas ) beyond the simple textbook installation. No mention of the new Opteron systems using Red Hat 3, 64 bit operating systems with 64 bit versions of Oracle 10g are explored. This is an important new area which SUN, HP and other vendors are providing cost/performance effective, scalable architectures when married with infiniband.
<br />
<br />In all fairness to Mr Ault, RAC is a complex animal with adjunct 3rd party hardware and software components which are changing all the time and keeping up with the new technologies is daunting. Still, the author adds no substantial value to those who want to go beyond simple hand-waving into implementation. This is where the the text falls down.</span>

                    <span>The book is not technical enough. It really tries to sell Oracle's new, thing, calling itself "grid" ready. Firstly, a database cannot use grid computing with any good scalability and performance. If Real Application Clusters doesnt scale well beyond 4 nodes and you DO have to partition your data to get good performance, how can one expext using even more distributed and non dedicated resources to scale? Oracle is known for using these marketing "approaches". Providing some unified view of enterprise resources is a good thing however it is not grid computing. My critisizim of the book is that it contains a lot of stuff that is just that, a repetition of marketing litrature. It is not critical enough and could have been more technical. The book is good for a marketing or business person. And what is up with the dedication "glory of my god" ?</span>

                    <span>I've worked with RAC (9i and 10g) for quite some time, yet I still founds lots of great stuff in this book. It combines background information about grid and utility computing along with real examples to help you install, configure and tune Oracle 10g RAC. 
<br />
<br />People new to RAC should definitely check out the chapters on architecture and migration topics.
<br />
<br />This book is a must for anyone using, or thinking of using, Oracle 10g RAC.</span>

                    <span>As the editor I was privileged to see the authors develop the content for this book and I was very happy to finally see a comprehensive book on Oracle10g Grid technology.
<br />
<br />Oracle promotes Grid as cutting-edge, and this book makes it very clear how powerful, sophisticated (and complex) Grid is to install and configure.
<br />
<br />The book has complete instructions for installing and configuring Oracle Grid and exceptional descriptions of the Enterprise Manager Grid control features.
<br />
<br />Finally, a real-deal Oracle10g Grid book.
