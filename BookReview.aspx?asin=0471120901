                    <span>The book is well-written and thought out overall; it delivers a great balance between covering key topics, while giving relevant, real-world examples. The first 5 chapters cover the basics of asp.net, very easy to understand even for a novice programmer, while the latter 5 get into more advanced topics such as building an e-commerce site, web services, and debugging and does require a deeper grasp of other programming concepts, such as OOP and database design. It's not an asp.net bible, but it's a great addition to any asp.net libary.</span>

                    <span>I bought and downloaded this pdf version of the book on my work computer, but I can't download it or copy it and bring it up on my home computer. Since I'm trying to learn this stuff at home and use it at work, this limits it's usefulness to me. Is this the future of what computing has in store for us, especially with Microsoft's next operating system having this kind of encryption built in? You buy software or other media and it only works on that particular machine?<P>Well this is the first and last ebook I buy. I use more than 1 computer in my life and to be restricted where I can use the software or media I buy is way too restrictive.</span>

                    <span>I knew Java and ASP for several months, and I had to do ASP.NET with C# at work. This is my first and only DOT NET book so far. This slim book got me into working on ASP.NET in few days. This is NOT for the BEGINNING Programmers. If you have experience in OOP like JAVA and Serverside Web scripting like ASP, you would find this book get you to ASP.NET developing fast. It has real world example and explains core essential things. Just what you need to know to get on the job quickly. You don't spend time on what you already know. It doesn't teach you C# but since I knew Java, it was perfectly ok. For more detailed stuff where I needed, I went to MSDN library. To learn more and deep in certain sections, I'll buy some other books. I am giving 5 stars because it's the only book I read and it did good job for my purpose. Thank you very much!</span>
