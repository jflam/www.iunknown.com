                <span id="Label1"><div>Hibernate practically exploded on the Java scene. Why is this open-source tool so popular?  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.<br><br>Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.<br><br><i>Hibernate in Action</i> carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.<br><br>The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day&#8211;they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.<br><br><i>What&#185;s Inside</i><br>- ORM concepts<br>- Getting started<br>- Many real-world tasks<br>- The Hibernate application development process<br></div></span>

                    <span>Hibernate is very well documented online and gives verbose and specific error messages when you do something wrong. Combine that with Spring's Hibernate utility methods and classes and it may be hard to justify paying for a whole book. It's actually very straight forward to set up your object model to mirror your database and just let Hibernate do it's thing without thinking too hard about what you are really doing and if you could be doing it better.
<br />
<br />This book is the solution to that aproach. It goes into detail where the online docs don't, even giving general database refresher courses when needed. The example app is excellent, too. Instead of the usual over-simplified examples in many technical books, you get a nice, complex relational model which includes every kind of relationship, including one that's recursive. That's great when you are trying to apply Hibernate to the real world, where things get more complicated then "Hello World". 
<br />
<br />You can be like me and hold off on buying this thing for a couple weeks. In the end, however, you'll crave all those little details that the online documentation just doesn't go into and end up buying it anyway, wondering why you didn't just do it sooner and save yourself the head scratching.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that Hibernate 3 is now out, rendering some things in this book depreciated. I quick glace at the new Criteria online docs (some GREAT improvements there, not to be missed) as well as the stored procedure support and the slight changes in the mapping DTDs should take care of that, however.</span>

                    <span>In full and fair disclosure, I know the authors, so my review may have little weight for many. But for what it's worth, I found this book to a very well written technical book. Part philosophical, part how-to, it's afforded me a great introduction to persistence. I hope the die-hard users out there get much more out of it than I have. The book covered a lot of ground including mapping persistent classes; using transactions, concurrency, and caching; and ; working with persistent objects; even something as advanced tools as Middlegen. Overall, a great intro to a really useful open source tool.
<br />
<br />I'd also like to iterate Frank Kalish's comment below (thank you): I hope the Dean Hillers and Andles of Perth, Australia (one and the same?) would be more careful with their comments. I did not find Andles' comment suggesting the Gavin and Christian are on Amazon pumping up the reviews particularly enlightening. If you know either of them, you'd know neither has the time to be fussy over how well their book is doing on Amazon. How did Hibernate become so successful? Because Gavin spent three years of his life carrying on a full-time job and working on Hibernate in his spare time. As a friend, I'm just sticking up for him against groundless accusations that other Amazon customers may take seriously.</span>

                    <span>Hibernate is arguably one of the most interesting and useful Open Source projects around. If you develop enterprise Java applications that have to do with a relational database (and which one doesn't?), then you should seriously consider using an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM for short) tool as an alternative to straight JDBC, in particular if you have a rich domain model and you'd like to exploit the object-oriented features of the language, like polymorphism, and core libraries like the Collections API.
<br />
<br />This book comes straight from the source. Gavin is actually the founder of the project and Christian is one of the most prominent developers. It is not surprising, therefore, that the book explains some of the design decisions that have shaped Hibernate into what it is now, like using runtime bytecode generation in preference to source code generation or post-compilation bytecode manipulation.
<br />
<br />Hibernate is not easy to learn and use proficiently if you're not prepared to study it thouroughly and this book does a good job of explaining tricky subjects like the persistent objects' lifecycle, exotic mappings, transactions and so on. However, it would be quite hard to use it as a single reference source while working with Hibernate. You should be prepared to refer constantly to the reference documentation, the API docs and the huge knowledge base available through the online forums.
<br />
<br />At a little more than 400 pages, it is not a particularly thin book, yet I would have appreciated a more systematic treatment of the APIs and the different types of mappings, with more code samples. As it is, you'll find it a very useful and interesting book if you're about to start a new project and want to know whether Hibernate is the right solution to your persistence problems. If you're a developer interested in using Hibernate, I suggest giving it as a present to your technical mamanger or team leader. In this case, I'd give it five stars
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you're already experienced with Hibernate, it is much less useful but nonetheless very iteresting and well-written, so I'd give it four stars.</span>

                    <span>As a previous reviewer mentioned the first 3 chapters of the book are great. My primary complaint with this book is that the authors didn't focus on what was important. The sections on the actual mapping of the objects to the database are not very good, and mapping isn't even really discussed at all until chapter 6. Instead the authors chose to use chapter 5 for a windy discourse on caching and ACID. Two topics that you really can't give a damn about if you can't map your objects. To me having a chapter about that stuff before you even deal with mapping is absolutely backwards.
<br />
<br />On a side note:
<br />
<br />The authors do a good job of explaining why one-to-one relationships are still mapped as many-to-one relationships (just with a unique constraint). Unfortunately, XDoclet does not recognize what you are trying to do when this occurs and insists on creating a property element for the method anyway. If you are following good design principles and returning interfaces from your methods instead of classes, XDoclet generates the unwanted property element with the CLASS ATTRIBUTE SET TO THE INTERFACE! This of course is not right and causes Hibernate to throw MappingExceptions at configuration time. 
<br />
<br />So XDoclet is useless for generating one-to-one relationships, making it completely useless for generating Hibernate mappings. Fortunately editing files by hand is a lot easier with Hibernate than with CMP and XDoclet won't overwrite a file that was edited by hand.</span>

                    <span>I felt I should balance out the 2 star rating left by Dean Hiller, who really liked the book but gave it 2 stars because, to paraphrase in his own words, "he is anal".  People look seriously at reviews, and the number of stars given is important. I see 4 or less, I probabably don't buy the book.  If you don't want to help people in their decision making, then keep your mouth shut.  You should rate book with respect to alternatives, not according to your own bizarre personal psychology.</span>
