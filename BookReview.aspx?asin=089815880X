                    <span>This book is great for people of all ages! It really helps you find your niche in life by doing a little soul searching. I was able to identify my strengths and use them to get a job I love! This book should be a part of all high school and college graduates itinerary before going into the 'real' world.  Thank you Mr. Bolles!!</span>

                    <span>Bolle's book is still timeless for job seekers of all kinds. I feel that his book updated each year to meet the current trends in society is critical. He needs to address those issues, like the web, downturn in the economy and the like.<p>The most critical part of the book is the self evaluation section. This is a very structured process that can be used intutitively as well. Bolles asks you to write a few stories about yourself, then, what did you like and dislike about those stories? What did you do well, where did you fail or feel challenged beyond your abilities? These are the critical areas of the book that take time to get through, yet you can evaluate yourself and understand what you like, it is what you do best, usually.<p>We excel what we are good at, according to Bolles, this method will help us discover what we are best at.<p>I have recommended this book to many over the years, and still do. Whether someone is in college, or someone is going through a long term transition after being in a job for a long time or moms returning to the work place, this book will be very instructive for you.<p>One of his processes is very simple asking you to compare who you would most like to talk with or groups of people you would rather relate with. This is a standard set of tests for some very expensive career consulting, he gives it to you for the price of his book and the time to self evaluate yourself. Then, he breaks down the possible job areas and skill sets related to these groups.<p>Again, a worthwhile journey for anyone not wanting to wander any longer in the world of work.<p>JOE SLEVIN<br>Job Coach</span>

                    <span>Yesterday, I nervously dialed the phone number to my job interviewer. It was Tuesday and he had promised he'd let me know about the job by last Friday.<p>I had followed the book, "What Color Is My Parachute," to the letter. I had a perfect resume and cover letter. I dressed up for the interview, prepared my list of questions to ask during the interview, memorized all the tips, and most importantly, emailed a thank you note afterwards.<p>Despite all this, I was still nervous about getting the job. I haven't even graduated with my undergraduate degree yet, meaning I have no experience. If I got the job, it was going to be my first job after college.<p>To my surprise, he said, "I emailed you about the job. Can you start May 11th?"<p>"That," I replied, "would be awesome."<p>Based on that experience, I heartily recommend the book on the interviewing techniques alone. However, that's not all I got from this book. I got a great system that determines what job I'd like to be in. Not only does the book ask about career interests, but on the part of the country I want to live in and the working conditions I prefer, which are two categories I never even considered. I recommend this book to everyone who needs to get a job these days and wants an edge on the competition. Because of this book, I am happily on the start of a long career.</span>

                    <span>This book is fine for the commoner who accounts for 80% of the population.  The other 20% will find this a total waste of time.  Of course, the 20% of the population with brains would never even pick up this book.  Every counselor I ever knew would tell me to read this book back when I was unsure of my future toward the end of my college career 15 years ago.  I didn't have the money for the book, so I basically read through it at B. Dalton Booksellers in Denton, TX.  What an incredible waste this book is.  Instead, stop lining the pockets of this preacher and say no to this book.  Anything that is a best seller in the United States must be flawed, because like I said before, 80% of the population are idiots.  People need to start thinking for themselves and stop buying this garbage.  If you are in the 80% idiot group, you will disagree with this review and probably buy it out of spite.  Well, go ahead moron.  The other 20% will know where I'm coming from, but most of you would never be enough of a loser to be reading a review on this book and even contemplating buying it.  The only reason I've spent the time on this is to possibly persuade one person that this book is a scam and maybe they'll spread the word and this book will eventually go away.</span>
