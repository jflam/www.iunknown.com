                <span id="Label1">Today's architecting must handle systems of types unknown until very recently. New domains, including personal computers, intersatellite networks, health services, and joint service command and control are calling for new architectures-and for architects specializing in those domains. Since the original publication, of this bestselling text, these new and emerging fields have contributed architectural concepts and tools of their own to the relatively new formalism-and evolving profession-called Systems Architecting.The Art of Systems Architecting, Second Edition restates and extends into the future the classical architecting paradigm, incorporating the most broadly applicable of these contributions. It remains the most innovative, insightful treatment available to the discipline, providing both the academic and the industrial communities with the up-to-date tools, concepts, and techniques needed to conceive and build complex systems.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book because my company has been given a task to review another company's system architecture of a large warfare system and was looking for some structured and mainstream guidance for the team to establish "goodness" of an architecture.<br>Unfortunately, being in a bit of a hurry, this book frustrated me with its lack of practical criteria for evaluating architecture to make real corrections and decisions.  <br>It has a lot of thought provoking heuristics that might make you a hit making speeches or at INCOSE cocktail parties but won't help you actually complete or evaluate an architecture.<br>As a Systems Engineer with 20 years in the business doing large scale defense systems, I am still in awe of the lack of defined guidance in how to transcend from the requirements to the architecture.  That is where the magic happens in product development.  The magic that ultimately determines if your product is technically a winner or a loser.  This book doesn't get you any closer to that magic.</span>

                    <span>This book is probably the most abstract one on my Software Architecture bookshelf right now. Each page in this book takes twice as long to read as a page from any of my other, more technical architecture books. Another book might say "Use UML, everyone else does"; while this book says "Given a particular model set and language, it will be easy to describe some types of systems and awkward to describe others [...]".<p>Time spent reading this book is a good investment in my opinion, but only if you read it at a moderate pace and reflect. The listing and discussion of heuristics is especially valuable. For example, "The greatest leverage in architecting is at the interfaces" is a good heuristic and the book has an appendix full of them. Not only that, this book offers good discussions of what each heuristic means and why it applies.</span>

                    <span>Review: This is a great overview of the subject of systems architecture. It is already highly regarded in the systems engineering community. It is rich in useful detail. It gives a comprehensive historical view of the discipline. I found a large number of specific insights about the nature of architecture as opposed to engineering. The collection of over 180 heuristics is an interesting framework for the text. I can highly recommend it as a study to both novices and seasoned professionals. The guest chapters on political process and systems architecting (Brenda Forman), and The Professionalization of Systems Architecting (Elliot Axelbrand) are both valuable additions to the immense vocabulary of the authors. <br> If I have one quibble it is that the book correctly insists on quantification of performance attributes as the only proper basis for architecture, certification, and engineering. But it so often denies the measurability of so called `soft' values - and remarkably includes things like `safety', and `environmental impact' in that category. I fear that setting too high a standard for quantification leaves us with mere ambiguous words. This of course is a widespread problem. I disagree, and will take up the discussion with the authors and the community - as I already have done. In addition I find a complete lack of examples, or discussion, about how `multiple performance and cost attributes' can be used by the architectural level to understand the architectural problem. There are far too many non-quantified models, and far too little insight as to how a systems architect would deal with the quantified attribute requirements of a system. Maybe in the 3rd Edition? <br>Tom@Gilb.com,  August 24 2002.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book. It has some brilliant insights.  It also has some mundane material.  It's the only book on SYSTEMS architecture and should be read by all architects as well as systems engineers.  Software engineers could learn from it too.<p> As a start on describing systems architecture (as opposed to technical or business architectures such as software, hardware, security, information, network, etc.) it does a superb job.  What I would like to see is more.  I sense from the books footnotes that some material from the first edition has been elided.  A third edition should include recent journal articles viewpoints and any material the editor cut from the first edition.  <p>There are many useful insights and a good overview of systems architecture.  The definition of systems architecture was good. <p>I found no significant errors although some of the material included was not as relevant as some that was omitted.  Newer material that has been published in journals needs to be included. <p>I would like to see a better relationship drawn with systems engineering, business strategy, six sigma techniques, etc.  Some of the material included may have some architectural significance but that was lost in describing systems engineering and quality approaches rather than contrasting and comparing them with SA.  Perhaps a systems engineering companion book to be read first could handle this sort of material.<p>The heuristics were excellent but incomplete.  This is not a fault of the author but the fact that the field is new and just being documented. <p>The examples used were those available.  I would like to see others but many people will not let that information out for use. Certainly an example of business as a system and noting how systems architecture relates to business strategy would be a useful addition.<p>Some minor glitches such as not defining acronyms before use were annoying but did not impede learning.  <p>I would  like to see appendices with summaries of the standards referenced.  I would like to know a lot more about the schools, curricula, and courses relating to SA that were mentioned. <p>The research seems incomplete.  The sources used were used well but there are others that did not get used.  Some used did not seem to be as pertinent.  I wonder if the editor gave the authors a deadline so they could publish the second edition.<p>This is a good book.  It can be better.  Hopefully a third edition will fill in and extend the coverage, provide additional examples and more subject matter for reference in the appendices. <p>If you have any interest in systems you should read this book.   It would be 5 stars except that it could be improved.  Since there is no other competing book it is infinitely better than the alternatives.  Other books drop down an implementation level and do technical or business architectures even though they label the book as systems architecture.  Those would make good follow on reading for domain and discipline engineers but all engineers should read this book.</span>

                    <span>I am a professional software and systems architect.  Also, I have designed, built, and teach an industrial course on architecting distributed object systems.  Being a very active reader of the literature on software  architecture, design patterns, and software development process, I can say:  there is, in my opinion, no better book on the subject of the process of  architecting and the realities of life as an architect.  Herein lies  wisdom.  Grasp it.</span>
