                <span id="Label1"><I>Programming Microsoft Visual C++</I> reveals the structures and systems that make Windows programs work. If you know C well and are at all familiar with C++, this latest version of a classic text is an excellent springboard into programming for Microsoft Windows.<p> This book is sure to reveal new information to those with Windows programming experience--most of which has to do with the new tools available to Windows programmers. The authors explain COM and Active Template Library (ATL). In learning about those things, you absorb information about ActiveX technologies, database programming, and Microsoft's Internet facilities. Additionally, this guide is still the best around for those who want to put well-behaved windows on the screen, fill them with controls, and have them perform useful functions. Illumination of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) has traditionally been this book's strong point, and the coverage of MFC 6 in this edition upholds the tradition.<p> Throughout, illustrative code translates well to real-world projects (particularly since it all appears on a companion CD-ROM). Each example tackles a particular task, such as how to use a persistent frame window class or how to refer to the contents of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>A professional programmer is one who knows not just how to do things, but also why. In this regard, Visual C++ Programming is an excellent choice due to its comprehensive coverage of all aspects related to Windows programming. It discusses in detail the underlying mechanism of Win API and MFC providing invaluable tips and insights for true professionals. However, it's not confined to theoretical concepts exclusively but also explains how to use the debugger, class wizard, AppWizard, resource editor - all of which are integral parts of the Visual C++ environment. New features offered by Visual C++ 6.0 such as IntelliSense, edit and continue, and auto complete are described as well. <P>The book is not targeted at a particular level of expertise. It can serve as an excellent guidebook for both novices and accomplished programmers, who would like to broaden their knowledge and skills in Windows-based programming with Visual C++. Mind, however, that prior knowledge in C++ is a prerequisite.<P>Visual C++ Programming is your ultimate companion for working with Visual C++ 6.0. It is unquestionably a five-star winner.</span>

                    <span>Not for the beginner or the weak-at-heart, this book is an EXCELLENT book to have once you've gone through your "Visual C++ in 21 Days" book and know the basics of C++, the VC++ environment, and Windows programming in general.<P>The organization of the book is a bit surprising, covering topics in a slightly different order than you may have seen in other books, but it's all layed out in a logical manner, and the information-density in the book is amazing. There's a bit of everything in this book, and where the material isn't there, he tells you what other book int the series does cover the material. (And, for the FIRST TIME, I've found a book that at least tries to explain the guts of help files! - although this piece could be a little more detailed for my tastes).<P>All this, and at the time of this writing, I'm just past half-way through the book (remaining chapters deal with COM, OLE, ATL, and Database Access). Topics such as ActiveX controls, DLL's, the Document/View architecture are very clear, and a fair amount of background information is given to help you undertand why things work the way they do.<P>This 5th edition still has a lot of references like "Win98 wasn't available at the time this went to press" and "WinCE support was not available in VC++ 6.0", so I can guess that any 6th edition of this book would be even better when these areas are cleared up and expanded.</span>

                    <span>after several detailed reading the book , I am completely disappointed! I began to learn MFC about three years ago, using this book for my first step. after I finished the book, yeah, I can write some codes, but I really didn't know how the codes run<BR>under the hood! this book just tells you ,click appwizard, click this or that button, click classwizard, then click classwizard again and again! then you finish your program. <BR> the part about COM,OLE is absolutely rubbish! when I first learned COM and OLE using the book, I was completely confused!<BR>I have struggled with COM for three months , the only thing I got from Kruglinski is confusion and angry. until I turned to jeff. prosise's great book:"Programming windows with MFC"( 2nd)<BR>I found myself in MFC programming.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book to learn how to code in MFC. The biggest drawback of this book is that it does not mention the MFC application architecture in the begining at all. So the reader is immediately starts coding whithout knowing what the MFc is actually doing for him. I have very strong experience in developing windows applications under the Win32 SDK and I believe that this book should have discussed the MFC message maping and application architecture before writing any code (at least). Overall, i think the book is okay. Personnely, I like "Professional MFC With Visual C++ 6<BR>by Mike Blaszczak" better.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of examples and this book has plenty of them. Also all examples are shown how to develop using the Class Wizard which is what most programmers will be using these days. I use this book 10 times more than all of my C++ books. This is a must have for your typical programmer.</span>
