                <span id="Label1">Introduction  MY MOTHER WAS FORTY the day the photographer came to our house on Cherry Court and lined us kids up behind my parents, who were sitting shoulder to shoulder on the piano bench. I&#146;ve never forgotten how she looked. She was in her mint-green knit suit. Her brooch and earrings were the same gold tone as the buttons on her closed jacket. Her soft strawberry-blond hair was in tamed curls framing her bespectacled, confident face.  I was a teenager looking through a different lens that day, but what I captured was just as permanent an image as the portrait that hung for years on our dining room wall. While the photographer was setting up his tripod, I was looking into the future. In that moment, watching my mom settle onto the piano bench, I saw how profound it was to be a woman at forty. Forty meant freedom. When you were forty, you could be yourself, you didn&#146;t have to live up to other&#146;s expectations. Forty meant you could wear whatever you wanted to, because by then you were your full, radiant self, not a copy of someone else. I could hardly wait to be just like my mom, an original, in her mint-green suit on that fall day in North Dakota.  Now, twenty-some years later, it could be me sitting on that piano bench with my teenaged daughters and my son posing behind me. I&#146;ve grown up. Not only am I in my forties myself, but it&#146;s also my good fortune to be working every day with women in their forties, dressing them to look their beautiful selves.  I wonder if it really was easier back then, or did my mom just make it look easy? Life seems so complicated today. Women have been crazy busy. Look around. We&#146;ve climbed the corporate ladder, survived a divorce or two or three, been to therapy. If you&#146;re forty, you may have earned a black belt in juggling careers and family. I know you. While you&#146;re making time to mentor a coworker, you&#146;re also closely following the basketball or soccer seasons of your kids, consoling one friend through a breakup, or helping another one plan her wedding. Chances are you&#146;re the most likely one to be neglected. While you&#146;re chasing life down the fast lane, you&#146;re not sure how to dress yourself anymore. Your wardrobe&#146;s been slogging along in the slow lane for a decade or maybe two.  Where does a real woman go for relevant advice on style and clothes?   Fashion magazines? They&#146;re filled with pages of twenty-year-olds weighing less than a hundred pounds. Do you take the advice of your teenaged daughter&#151;in orange hair and skimpy T-shirt, with a pierced tongue and belly-button ring? No. When you manage to grab a minute to shop for yourself, what do you find on the racks? Retro fashions in Day-Glo colors, showing up again like a bad dream. Aaaugh! This is hard work! Everything&#146;s stopped making sense.  To confuse the issue even more, you&#146;re living in a different body. Your shape is changing, and your hair and attitudes are too. Where do you fit in? I&#146;ve heard the lamenting. If you could make it all go away, you would. You may be older and wiser, but opening your closet door still brings you to your knees. You could have written the Roy Lichtenstein caption on the T-shirt that says, &#147;I feel like such a failure! I&#146;ve been shopping for over twenty years, and I still don&#146;t have anything to wear!&#148; Should you just give up?  Hold everything! Amidst the world&#146;s clatter, it&#146;s time to do the unthinkable&#151;to slow down, turn the focus on yourself, and do a major check-in. Who are you right now? Get current. Take a good long look, discover yourself anew. It&#146;s the right time to take a look in the mirror and make peace with this body, these arms, these thighs, these gorgeous lips, and this hair flecked with gray. This precious body of yours has made it through one million comparisons and has defied the look of the Kate Moss print ads on the sides of city buses.  It&#146;s time to invite a new love affair into your life&#151;a love affair with your every line, every tooth, every toenail, every facial expression, every whim and desire. Passionate, wild, crazy, frivolous, impulsive&#151;make it a love affair with yourself.  You&#146;ve earned it. There are no more excuses. There&#146;s no time to waste, nothing&#146;s more important. You have collected half a lifetime of laughs, wisdom, accomplishments, mistakes, integrity, and experience. You&#146;ve kept getting better and better. Now it&#146;s time to express that on the outside&#151;confidently, boldly.  There is freedom at forty, the freedom I saw in my mother&#146;s eyes, in her sure smile. With a little excavating and renovating of attitudes, you&#146;ll be wearing that freedom too. It&#146;s under the surface, waiting to reveal itself. You&#146;ll find it in these forty chapters of fashion advice. You&#146;ll learn how to combine looks, passion, personality, and preferences into the perfect recipe for wearing clothes and accessories&#151;while having delicious fun.  Forget about problem areas! Go somewhere else to hear about camouflage tricks. You&#146;ll be too busy falling in love with yourself when you put the focus on what works (a great smile, pretty skin, shapely calves). Other body parts will quiet down and assume their proper proportion. You&#146;ll find the correlation between your personality and preferences and discover how to wear them proudly. You&#146;ll learn how to shop for a bathing suit with dignity and courage, what to wear while going through a divorce, what to do instead of (or until) plastic surgery, and how to walk away from clothing with &#147;potential&#148; and only buy what works.  I won&#146;t ask you to do anything I haven&#146;t already done in my forties. I&#146;ve been the mom who frantically shopped for school lunch ingredients at 7 A.M. in my accessorized jammies. Following my own advice on dressing for a high school reunion, I snagged a sweetheart at mine. I&#146;ve given in to friends who insisted I&#146;d lost ten pounds when all I&#146;d really done was lift up my bra straps and loosen my belt. It&#146;s all doable. My clients in my style and wardrobe consulting business prove it to me every single day.  I invite you to zero in on the ordinary thing that you do everyday&#151; <P>getting dressed&#151;  and turn it into an opportunity <P>for personal expression, peace, and joy <P>beyond words.  After you&#146;ve done your homework, it&#146;ll be so much easier to turn off the screaming consumer ads, ignore questionable advice from teenaged daughters or well-meaning friends, and trust yourself. You can and will love how you look in clothes. Come on, I&#146;m going to show you how.</span>

                    <span>I LOVED this book. As an art major, a lot of the advice was common sense/second nature, but the underlying theme of the book (to me)was PAMPER yourself. If you have a closet FULL of shoddy bargains, thrift store has beens, hasn't fit in 10 years knits and poor gift choices from sis/hubby/kids-you have NOTHING to wear and you truly are NOT taking care of yourself. There is a very wise emphasis on buying one or two items you adore, and building around them. The book does not preach shop 'til you drop, or only buy designer things-it says love yourself. You can build a wardrobe around really well made pieces. Most of us readers have spent 40+ years taking care of/looking after others. Now the focus is doing unto ourselves. It will be hard for a lot of readers to embrace ("I don't deserve this expensive-fill in the blank")-but the author gently convinces us WE CAN. We've earned it, and the pay off is more than just pandering to vanity. It's going with a stylish sense of entitlement into the second (better) half of life!</span>

                    <span>I hate to shop! I have to look good (on occasion) and I am definitely over 40.<P>This book is really great. For example, I spend far less on clothes now that I took the advice of creating a working a wardrobe around just a few good pieces. I don't throw away or give away so many failed pieces. I use the accessories to change the core outfits and I think I look a lot better.<P>If you go to the mall, it's plain that clothes are geared to younger women who shop often, wear somethink a short while and then move on to the next fad. These kinds of clothes don't work for me, don't fit me and cost plenty. You can save a lot of time and money by figuring out what is right for you and then building a working wardrobe around it. About time someone wrote a fashion book "for the rest of us."</span>

                    <span>This book is fabulous especially for someone who hated to go shopping for herself. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it because I quickly learned my clothing/shopping mistakes and thought the author knew me personally. I read only half the book so far and decided to stop and do the exercises she requested. I will now make sure clothes fit me properly before I purchase, add some "fun" items to my wardrobe and make sure my outfits are complete. Got to go and finish reading and learning from Brenda. I am recommending this book to all the women I know.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book a year ago. In my 40s, I was having tough time finding appropriate things to wear. I was too young to shop at the old ladies' department at Robinson's May, yet I felt too old to shop at Junior department or some boutiques likes of Express or Gap. The author taught me so much, and the learning process was truly enjoyable, because some sections of this book were very funny. I followed her advise and got lid of bags after bags of matronly looking clothes. Now I know exactly what I like to wear and what I look good in, and best of all, I feel very good about myself.</span>
