                <span id="Label1">Basketball legend Bob Knight is fond of saying that he has never gotten over West Point. In Same Knight, Different Channel, Jack Isenhour takes him at his word. A player on Knight&#146;s first West Point team, Isenhour shows how the controversial coach has changed little from his early days at the academy, temper tantrums and all. Knight made up his mind there to "win-gotta win" and follows that philosophy to this day.  <P>Knight&#146;s sentiment was in step with the core value of "there is no substitute for victory" at West Point, where soldiers were being trained to fight and win the next war. So it came as little surprise following Knight&#146;s 18-8 record in his inaugural 1965-66 season-a season in which the twenty-five-year-old hot-headed coach berated officials, totaled chairs, and got into his first shouting match with an athletic director-that West Point chose to keep the young Coach Knight on. What&#146;s a tantrum or two in the name of winning? With that, "Bobby T" was born. Knight&#146;s bad-boy persona-the hair-trigger temper, the acting out, and the defiance-was codified as at least tolerable, if not acceptable, behavior.   <P>Relying on firsthand experiences and interviews with teammates, administrators, and Knight himself, Isenhour traces the pattern of misbehavior established during Knight&#146;s inaugural year at West Point, during his last days at Indiana, and to his reemergence at Texas Tech. The result is the most even-handed portrait of Knight to date. In a narrative both lively and irreverent, Same Knight, Different Channel demonstrates who Knight is today and shows how he was shaped by his experiences at West Point, ending with a thought-provoking discussion of just what it takes to play, coach, and win in the high-pressure world of college basketball.</span>

                    <span>This book gives an objective account of coach Knight at the beginning of his remarkable and continuing career. Isenhour's book is based on firsthand accounts and grounded in actual experiences and not best guesses. Knight is an extraordinry role model in perseverance and integrity despite the constant barrage of media critics. Coach Knight is a remarkable coach, demanding what more parents should demand -- academic excellence and personal excellence.</span>

                    <span>I've heard of Coach Bob Knight, but I am not a basketball fan. I got a strong recommendation of this book from a friend and I can't say that I'm disappointed that I read it. <P>Isenhour (or "Ike," as Knight apparently called him) writes in an extremely lucid, conversational style. Facts, historical quotes, and dates come off as something remembered over a cold beer rather than information recorded and then regurgitated for the purpose of writing a book. Honestly, I could care less about the history of basketball, but this is a very interesting book, and it kept me reading to the end.<P>If I had to pick something to complain about, it would be the fact that for much of the book, Isenhour seems to be extremely preoccupied by the culture of West Point itself. Of course having read (and then re-read) some of his astounding accounts of this institution, had I been raked over those coals, I'd probably be preoccupied with it, too. Don't get me wrong, the material is fascinating, it's just not about Bob Knight. Still, I'll accept the emphasis given to The Point since it offers the reader one of many explanations as to how Bob Knight came to be the way he is. <P>Note that I said "explanations" and not "excuses."</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Just the fact that this book is written tends to hold Bob Knight up as a role model, unfortunately. It needs to be said, he is not a role model for anyone, nonetheless for West Point. While it is nice to have known someone who has become a celeb (infamous celeb, concerning all that West Point is supposed to stand for), West Point is not about celebs. For the good of West Point and West Pointers, past, present, and future, I think the Bob Knight connection should in no way be advertised and promoted.</span>

                    <span>I have read alot of books on Knight, this book was great, Isenhour being a player for Knight in the early years gave the book an inside angle that no other author could, Isenhour tells it like it is, the good the bad and the ugly. It is a great read.</span>

                    <span>Just like the back cover says, this isn't a love song to Bob Knight, and it's not a cheap shot to the chops. This is a fair and accurate portrayal of the fiery Coach by a player underneath him when Knight first started out.<P>The fact that this player will criticize Knight speaks volumes about his integrity -- and the fact that he defends him speaks volumes about his fairness. He looks at the situation without pigeonholing things into what he calls a "Bob Knight moment" that most media paint things as.<P>He talks about Knight's early years in coaching. He goes into more detail on Knight's firing -- and more evenhandedly than I've ever seen -- and talks about Knight at Texas Tech too. The level of access he got is astounding, and the personal touch makes the book golden.<P>Such a quick read too. The author had a great, conversational writing style that makes it a fun read.<P>Definitely five stars, the best Bob Knight book out there and the fairest one ever.</span>
