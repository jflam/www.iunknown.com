                <span id="Label1">When static HTML pages no longer cut it, you need to step up to dynamic, database-driven sites that represent the future of the Web. In <B>PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide</B>, the author of best-selling guides to both the database program (MySQL) and the scripting language (PHP) returns to cover the winning pair in tandem&#8212;the way users work with them today to build dynamic sites using Open Source tools. Using step-by-step instructions, clearly written scripts, and expert tips to ease the way, author <B>Larry Ullman</B> discusses PHP and MySQL separately before going on to cover security, sessions and cookies, and using additional Web tools, with several sections devoted to creating sample applications. A companion Web site includes source code and demonstrations of techniques used in the volume. If you're already at home with HTML, you'll find this volume the perfect launching pad to creating dynamic sites with PHP and MySQL.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book. This book teaches what it claims to teach amazingly well. Well done Mr. Larry.<P>And u know what? Larry Ullman also answers all your questions on the book's website. If u get stuck even on your first PHP script, Larry will personally help you in the forums. Now this is not what we normally get. A great book and FREE support on the website by the AUTHOR himself!!! WOW!!<P>Amazon should give him Book of the Year award along with Julie Meloni's "PHP Essentials".<P>If you are completely new to programming and you only know HTML and CSS and want to learn PHP (along with MySQL), "PHP Essentials" by Julie Meloni is the best book.<P>If you have some basic programming experience like JavaScript or C or any similar language, then Larry's "PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide" IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!!.<P>This book does not teaches you the very basics of programming so if you are inexperienced in programming, get Julie's book... If u know a little programming, get Larry's book.<P>Just excellent book.</span>

                    <span>I have a read a few books on PHP prior to purchasing this one. Although I have used them to successfully cut and paste my way to a dynamic website, they didn't actually teach me PHP. They were more of a "write this to do this" type of book. However, after reading this book I now feel that I have a true understanding of PHP & mySQL. When I began reading this book I was relatively new to programming. I was enrolled in a JavaScript class so I had some experience under my belt but you could very easily learn from this book with no experience at all (except knowledge of HTML/XHTML is needed). The lessons are written well and I never felt lost or overwhelmed with information. I have a few of the Visual Quickstart series books (HTML by E. Castro, Photoshop 7, CSS and DHTML) and I find them all very well written and an easy way to learn. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn PHP. A Great Book! An incredible value!</span>

                    <span>I just got this book and want to say that it nicely steps you through programming in php/mysql but doesn't treat you like an idiot. If your a "learn by doing" person like me, this book is great.</span>

                    <span>I noticed that there is a new edition that covers PHP 5 so you might want to check for the most recent edition.<P>I liked the book for the clear explainations of the code presented and tips that go along with each section. While experienced programmers might enjoy just seeing code, I appreciate the explainations that accompany the examples. Coming in with no knowledge, a reader will be able to learn a good foundation of skills.</span>
