                    <span>This is a terrific book. Why? 
<br /> 1) Because it is scientifically based unlike many fad diet books
<br /> 2) Because it does not appear that Mr Kurzweil is simply going for a fast buck with a nonsense diet like so many book in the market those days
<br /> 3) The writing style makes for easy, pleasant and persuasive reading
<br /> 4) This book will in all likelihood DRAMATICALLY improve the health of many of its readers
<br /> 
<br /> There is at least one point that I think should be improved for the next edition. It is the country by country fat consumption vs heart disease risk, "linear" chart. The problem here is that as presented the data do not entirely justify the conclusion. Indeed one can easily see that virtually all high-fat countries are also the most industrialised countries (USA, Germany, etc) and all the ultra-low fat countries (Thailand, Chiana, etc) are developping. Why is this important? This is because has a group the less developped have typically a life-expectancy lower by about 10 years (typically due to increased infections and accidents) than the higher developped countries. Therefore it is EXPECTED that these countries should have a lower rate of heart disease than higher developped countries with higher life-expectancies, regardless of eating habits. This is because heart disease hits hardest the higher age group (60+), a group that is numerously less important in developping countries. Furthermore, in developping countries, it is not clear that medical care is sufficiently developped so that proper death cause are recorded. Perhaps they use categories such as "old age" for cause of death while we use more precise cause due to better availability of diagnostic tests. I think Mr Kurzweill should try to remove that bias from those charts (it should be relatively easy to adjust for the first problem: the different baseline life expectancy between countries, by using heart disease at different age and life tables).
<br /> I don't think that the corrected results would lead to entirely different results (although there is a very slight possibility it could) mainly because there are different other corroborative studies (autopsy study on young men, reversal of atherosclerosis following a ultra-low fat intake) in favor of ultra-low fat regimes. Still, this would strenghtened Mr Kurzweill valiant review, at least in rigorous scientific circles.
<br /> Congratulation Mr Kurzweill. You should be given an honorific medical degree. You earned it more than many of us for the improvement of individual and population health.

                    <span>This book is a wonderfully easy-to-read "How to" guide to living in a healthy way.  Ray Kurzweil does an excellent job in pooling together so much well-substantiated research data regarding what truly makes a healthy diet.  His focus is on HEALTH and LONGEVITY rather than weight loss.  He is concise, motivating and right on target.  I encourage my patients to read his book if they are truly serious about getting/staying healthy!</span>
