                <span id="Label1">The introduction of .NET has blurred the lines between previously distinct programming disciplines. With so much functionality encapsulated by the .NET Framework class library, some very diverse tasks have gained a common programming interface that makes moving from one to another seem much less daunting. One area in which this change is particularly striking is web development: where ASP was the realm of script programmers, ASP.NET is implemented by a set of classes that enable you to create Internet applications using the same languages that you'd use for Windows desktop programs.  <P>In Visual Studio .NET, Microsoft has taken this idea a stage further: not only does the code look similar, but the GUI looks similar too. Visual Basic .NET's familiar form-based interface is used for the development of web applications as well as for desktop programs. If you want to, you can create a web application without ever seeing a line of HTML code, and you can do so with all the facilities for testing and debugging that Visual Studio .NET provides to programmers of all types.  <P>In this book, we'll take what you already know about creating desktop applications using Visual Basic .NET, and show you how to apply it to the Web. We'll teach you about the different thinking that you have to employ when writing web applications, and also tell you about some of the technologies that can help in the creation of compelling web content. In particular, we'll explore:  <P>- How the Web works: the Internet, HTTP, and the client-server architecture  <P>- Creating dynamic web pages with web forms and web server controls  <P>- Acquiring and displaying data using ADO.NET and Visual Studio .NET components  <P>- Debugging and error handling in ASP.NET applications  <P>- The importance of XML, and particularly its role in web services  <P>- Setting up your web server efficiently and securely  <P>- Assessing the performance of your application, and preparing it for release  <P>Along the way, we'll be building a case study that demonstrates the use of these technologies in practice. That example, like all of the others in the book, is presented in Wrox's tried-and-tested Try It Out format.</span>

                    <span>I have bought at least a dozen Web Development Books and this book has provided more practical development techniques than all the other books combined. As a previous evaluator has written, this book is the "Glue" the brings everything together. No book on this complex subject can do it all, but this book comes the closest of any I have read.</span>

                    <span>Truely this is not a beginner's book but rather a foundational book. <BR>I've been studying the .Net Framework for just over a year now. During my studies, I've learned many sophisticated techniques; however, I have not be able to show what I know because I did know how to put it all together. It was like having all the pieces to the puzzle and not having a picture to guide the construction. Consequently, I've been looking for the Picture and this book is it.... a step-by-step guidance on how to integrates all the technologies into one project. This is the "Glue"! <P>If you're looking for guidance on how to implement the many .Net techniques in a Web Application than this is a Great book! If you are a real beginner please look else where and then come to this book. You will be glad that you did ---> I am!<P>Bottom Line - The book should be titled Foundational instead of Beginning. If it were, I am sure it reviews would be much higher.</span>

                    <span>First off, I was glad to read other reviews confirming what I had already been experiencing with this book and that Alzheimer's has not set in. This is no beginner's book, Senator. Title perhaps should have been: "Accelerated Web-Programming, Seatbelts Required." What's more is that the text begins to dissipate in consistency and accuracy as it progresses. Go to the book's errata page and it's got errata itself. (Every chapter is listed as 0.) Even code samples do not always work. Need a specific? Try to run the last exercise in Chapter 6 from Wrox's download. No way, Jose. I guess they forgot about the chapter called application testing. The front page has six different authors displayed on it. I think this is part of the book's problem. It's a hodge podge. It's got the how-many-many-geeks-does-it-take-to-screw-up-a-tutorial syndrome. In all fairness, I should say that the book did help me to keep my feet wet with dot Net coding using Visual Studio. Mighty slippery surface, though.</span>

                    <span>A word of caution here, this is not a beginners book. More like an advanced or an intermediate book. If this is a beginner's book, then I would hate to see an advanced book. The first 2 chapters were okay, but starting with Chapter 3 it is a real lu-lu! It goes on and on about web controls and custom controls and dynamic control and customized templates and cascading style sheets. I think it would have been best if some of that advanced material had been left out and kept more simple for chapter 3 and concentrated on developing an application that didn't have to rely on all kinds of custom controls and style sheets and all other kinds of stuff. Keep it simple stupid would have been more the order of the day when it came to writing this book.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a good foundation but I took less and less out of it as it progressed. I like the chapters covering header controls and base classes and also the instruction on tables and datasets. The strength of the book is that one can follow along with the clearly written 'Try this out' sections, although these were not without the usual scattering of errors. Ultimately the authors seem to lose interest in the application we are supposed to be writing in this book.<P>The longest chapter was on XML frankly left me baffled. I've read more comprehensible stuff elsewhere since. All I could do was follow along without really learning. It seemed a complex exercise for a beginners book!<P>In summary, I learnt some good things from this book but ultimately I found it disappointing.</span>
