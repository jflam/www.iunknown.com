                    <span>I watched this when it first aired on television. It was interesting enough that I went out and bought the book. After Reading "Into Thin Air" three times, I will say the book is a more captivating attention getter.</span>

                    <span>This is a fair version of the Jon Krakauer book on the Everest disaster of 1996. The characters of the climbers are much richer in the book than this film. Of course, that's often true of any film. However, it's the people who experienced this climb that really make the story vibrate and live. The film takes about two steps back and puts the mountain and conditions first.<P>It's not a terrible film and a viewer who hasn't read "Into Thin Air" or "The Climb" may find it superficially enjoyable. But why take the time to watch this when you can see a much better view of Everest around the very time this disaster happened by viewing the IMAX film (or its video) and live the experience through one of the two books.<P>David Breashears, one of the creators of the IMAX film has an excellent book that uses his experience with the climb and the film to study the '96 disaster. This film takes a back seat to his book, too.<P>Don't plan on reading any of the books? This film is a fair alternative. But the viewer won't understand the complexities and drama of the event through this point of view.</span>

                    <span>I first saw this movie in Global Studies, and even then Mr. Bockelman (my teacher) jumped right in to where Jon Krakauer is struggling to reach the summit of Mount Everest. We didn't even finish the whole film. Then, this weekend, I checked out Mr. Krakauer's book, "Into Thin Air", and found that from what I had seen, the director of the film stayed remarkably close to the book and to the horrific events that happened on Everest in 1996. Overall, I thought that the movie showed many people what happened on May 10, 1996, and of what climbing Everest is really like. Awesome, but chilling.</span>

                    <span>I have seen many movies and stories about climbing but I have to say that this DVD so far has been one of the best stories ever carried out comercially. Although the screening, acting, technical parameters of the filming were not that impressive, the crude reality of a tough mountain, altitude sickness and the necesity of team work are expressed at most. Cristopher McDonald's performance wasn't bad at all and check out the khumbu ice fall and Hillary pass scenification; come on, you can't have better than that. Please don't mention Vertical Limit wich I consider a looney toon story compared to this movie or some cliffhanger nickaround wich gives you nothing but a waste of time.<BR>Perhaps, producers should put on a side Mount Everest and think about making a REAL!! movie about K2 wich I consider the toughest mountain ever to climb (what a shame vertical limit became the greatest insult to the K2 mountain). Although there is a fine movie about it (starring Michael Biehn and Matt Craven) I'm still waiting for a movie that can bring us the real shot to mountanier live: extreme danger, 90Â° rock walls, deadly avalanches and many nature-against situations that put human lives in a thin line.<P>I personally recomend Into thin air, death on everest.<P>Juan M.

                    <span>Into Thin Air:Death On Everest~1997<BR>I'm afraid to say that this is a very poor movie based on a true story. If you want something along the similiar lines of this read Jon Krakauer's book or watch Vertical Limit anyway I will tell you the plot:<BR>In May 1996, writer Jon Krakauer joined a party of experienced and amatuer climbers-lead by Everest veterans Scott Fisher and New Zealander Rob Hall-who attempted to reach the world's highest and most infamous mountain. Krakauer was one of the lucky ones, he made it back alive- 12 people didn't.</span>
