                    <span>After having read volumes I & II, I felt compelled to read volume III in spite of other customer reviews here.  Having just finished this one, I'm inclined to agree with the other reviewers - interesting, but not as earth-shattering as the first two.  The first half of the book covers, in volume-II style detail, an implementation of T/TCP for BSD; although this is interesting, it's not very practical, since T/TCP never caught on in the real world.  The next part of the book covers HTTP & NNTP, but doesn't go into much detail; if you know what HTTP & NTTP are, you probably already know all the material covered in this book.  Finally, the book ends by examining the BSD implementation of the Unix domain sockets.  This last bit was the most relevant part of the book, but don't even think about trying to read this if you haven't completed volume II (and have it handy - the text refers back to specific pages and diagrams from Volume II).  If you've read the other two books (Volume II in particular), you'll want to read this one to round out the experience, but don't expect to be blown away like you were with the others.</span>

                    <span>If you are planning on writing any software for the web, this is one of the books you need. This book covers T/TCP, HTTP, NNTP, and more including UD Protocols and some good info in the appendix.<p>W. Richard Stevens has never let me down with any of his books, and this one is no diffrent. Its too bad hes not around to write books any more, alot of people will be missing out on great books from a great author.<p>This is a must have!!</span>

                    <span>This book covers a need distinct from the first two volumes - the first two covered the core protocols' internals, while this one covers the application level protocols - a subject hardly covered by any other book.<p>I've found this book very useful for understanding T/TCP, a subject  my teacher did not explain well and was obscure for me.<p>The NNTP &  HTTP cover was useful, especially as I was doing a lab on HTTP, but I must  admit that as far as HTTP goes the RFCs were sufficient.</span>

                    <span>Like the other two volumes, this book is the definite bible if you are interested in HTTP, T/TCP and UDP. As time passes, these protocols will be used more widely and one will see more people interseted in the book.  Similar protocols just start to emerge in areas such as wireless....</span>
