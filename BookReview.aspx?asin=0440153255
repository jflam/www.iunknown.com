                    <span>OK, first of all, anyone who has anything bad to say about this book should be taught a lesson in fair criticism. This is a GREAT read! I couldn't put it down the first time I read it back around 1996, and I couldn't put it down any of the other times, either! It is simply that good! Everything in it, I believe to be true (and if it isn't, at least I am open enough to accept it as partially true, or good fun even if I know it is false), and the reasons why are simple. First, many of it's juicy tales were published before, during, and are still being revived to this day; meaning it is a consistency that proves the book to be at least partially true. Second, this is from a man who wined and dined with some of these people. Why shouldn't he have some factual tales to tell about the trashes of Tinseltown?<BR>The entries in this sordid and scandalous soiree into Hollywood's elite past are genuinely juicy and intriguing to read. Who doesn't love to read about Hollywood sin? Included are some facts about the murder of director William Desmond Taylor, which followed closely behind the Fatty Arbuckle scandal. Also, you can learn about some suicides of silent stars when sound entered the picture, those stars (female) who died as a result of their drug addictions, and an immense amount of sex scandals, from older men and younger gals, to homosexuality. And, if that isn't enough, it is packed with many eye-opening photographs. I am telling you this is a WONDERFUL and powerfully charged book that every film buff should own. I love it so much that I would be buried with it (just as Bela Lugosi was buried with his Dracula cape, which is true)when I die! So if you are interested in classic film, or even more, in film stars of yesteryear, then this is definitely a book that you MUST read at least once (although reading it more than once is also very rewarding!). Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>

                    <span>Like any newspaper article, events are turned into "stories." These "stories", like any silver screen biography, tells the dramatic tale of a life in turmoil. Kenneth Anger's book, "Hollywood Babylon" takes the angle of a tabloid and digs up some old dirt of famous celebrity lives and puts it into a full collection of grime, grease and oil. This collection takes a chronological look at Hollywood's finest at the time beginning in the early twenties with such big names as Fatty Arbuckle whose drinking problem got out of hand at one of his big parties after signing a lucrative deal. Moving through time to the 30's, 40's, right up to the Sharon Tate murder, which Anger recognized it was no longer "Old Hollywood." <P>	The book reads like a gossip column mixed with sleazy tabloid journalism, yet with the wit and humor of a prankster. It's an exploitation of exploited lives. To mimic tabloids further, the pages appear with large and sometimes disturbing photos of stars at their most inopportune moments. <P>While much of the material has already had its heyday in newspapers of the times, it has a new life today where many of these actors and actresses are virtually unheard of by the general public and rekindled new interest in their films. Just as watching and old O. J. Simpson football game may have the same appeal as watching Lana Turner in her debut "They Won't Forget." <P>	The title to me is entirely fitting, as Hollywood is the "Babylon" of our society, one in which everyone has all their wants at their disposal. A place where hedonism is the religion and tragedy is only the end of a scene, for we know by the end of the movie everything will be all right. My only disappointment in the book is its cursory glance at such stars as Marylyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and many other stars that became almost a tally only to be put under a heading of how they died. "Hollywood Babylon" still fits the bill, however, as an enticing and racy read of the darker seedy side of that strange and secret society.</span>

                    <span>Hollywood is a place i have always dreamed about and have NEVER wanted to visit, and this book only solidifies my conviction.<BR>what's great about it is that all of our present day sandals-- OJ, Michael Jackson, J-Lo, the list goes on-- seem like small potatoes compared to the movers and shakers of the Golden Age of Cinema. Drug overdoeses, sex, violence, police corruption, and hintings of the underworld ran rampant and Anger's prose in the style of a tabloid is so engaging i couldn't put this book down!<P>and i'm not ashamed to admit that the pictures (which were helpful in stories regarding actors i had never heard of before) add to the narrative in surreal and funny ways *** check out the picture of Jayne Mansfield's dead dog at the end!<P>a fun and quick read for the summer!</span>

                    <span>Kenneth Anger, once a child actor himself, unvales and points both barrels at Hollywood and its subculture of excess and outrageousness. Anger tells many stories of Hollywood's greats and not so great throughout the early history of films to the more recent personalities of the golden era of movies (1920s to 1950s). The book is writen in a gossipy National Enquire tone and is entertaining. However, after reading through the book, it seems that the author has a vendetta against Hollywood and is quick to shine the spotlight to uncover the weaknesses and shortcomings of the stars. One cannot help but feel that Anger, (an interesting last name for the author), may have had his own dreams broken by Hollywood and writes to salve his own bitterness about his encounters with Tinsel Town. If not for this edge to the writing, it would have gotten a higher rating. Just the same, if you are interested in Hollywood, in all its foibles, this may be a good read for you.</span>

                    <span>This book is questionable as far as accuracy. For example, I have read several recent books on Judy Garland. Anger states that she committed suicide and he seems to enjoy pointing out that she looked "old..old..." and he inserts a very bad picture of Ms. Garland, then almost makes fun of her "suicide attempt" and how she appeared when she was found. He is very insensitive and trashy in his approach. He seems to list his "facts" with the glee of someone who is bitter after his own failed efforts in Hollywood. I felt embarrassed for him. I also felt that he really does not cover many personalities.<BR>I recommend reading "Too Much Too Soon" about Diana Barrymore, which was very beautifully written and was co-authored by Gerold Frank. I also recommend Gerold Frank's book on Judy Garland.</span>
