<h3 class="title">Misconceptions on Pollution and causes of Cancer</h3>

<p>During graduate school in the early 90's, I spent a lot of time reading scientific literature. One paper that has strongly influenced me since those days was <a href="http://www.bruceames.org/about.php">Bruce Ames'</a> paper on <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/106586708/ABSTRACT">Misconceptions on pollution and the causes of Cancer</a>. If you are curious at all about the impact of pesticides and pollution on the food that we eat, you should definitely read this paper (and be prepared to re-examine your assumptions). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, you will most likely have to visit your local university library to gain access to the article.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dstone">David Stone</a> for finding an updated version of the paper here: <a href="http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s214.html">http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s214.html</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">NUnitAsp</h3>

<p>I had a fun time talking about <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net/">NUnitAsp</a> and unit testing / automation in general at <a href="http://butrain.bu.edu/windev/default.asp">WinDev</a>. Here's a <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/WinDev.zip">link to the sample code</a> that I wrote for the talk. Comments / feedback would be appreciated.</p>

<p>At some point during the talk, I began ranting about the angle-bracket tax that you must pay when working with tools like NAnt. <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp">Ted Neward</a> who was lurking in the back of the room told me afterwards about <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/sk/auto/">Pragmatic Project Automation</a> where Mike Clark also rants about the angle-bracket tax. I'm looking forward to reading my copy.</p>

<h3 class="title">SQL Service Broker</h3>

<p>I sat in on <a href="http://www.winnetmag.com/Article/ArticleID/42169/42169.html">Dan Sullivan's</a> talk on user-defined types in <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server 2005 yesterday. Dan gave a lucid description of what a <em>scalar</em> type is; it's one of those things that you take for granted, but it's amazing how much a clear and concise definition can help your understanding. Dan's also an old friend from our time together at DevelopMentor. </p>

<p>We had a great discussion about photography afterwards - Dan's an old-school film guy who lost his way and has finally turned the corner and discovered digital (he's the proud owner of a Canon 10D). I had a lot of fun discussing photography and its relationship to software with Dan. </p>

<p>Dan's also infected with the <span class="caps">SQL </span>Service Broker bug (Niels Berglund and him wrote the <span class="caps">SQL </span>Service Broker chapter in the most excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321180593/qid=1098975080/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-4259393-0713530?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">A First Look at <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server 2005 for Developers</a>. Service broker gives us reliable async messaging between <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server instances. The coolest thing about it is that <span class="caps">SQL </span>Server Express (aka the free implementation) ships with service broker!</p>

<h3 class="title">Fun time at WinDev</h3>

<p>I so miss hanging out with the other speakers at WinDev. The 48 hours that I'm spending down here is way too brief. </p>

<p>After hanging out with <a href="http://staff.develop.com/bobb/weblog/">Bob Beauchemin</a>, my faith that the <span class="caps">SQL </span>Service Broker feature is the coolest feature in Yukon is reaffirmed. It truly is <span class="caps">MSMQ</span> done right, and I'm really looking forward to spending some quality time with it.</p>

<p>After chatting with <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/mike.aspx">Mike Woodring</a> over dinner the other night (and in a totally unrelated conversation), I had a blinding revelation about why the <code>System.CodeDom</code> classes shell out to <code>csc.exe</code> to <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000502.html">compile code</a>. AppDomains cannot unload code, so all of the <em>referenced</em> assemblies loaded by the C# compiler cannot be unloaded.</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.neocranium.com/jasonw/">Jason Whittington</a> regaled us with numerous stories that all began with "when I was teaching at Guerrilla .NET ...". Folks would be amazed at the hijinks that go on in those classes :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">Chris Anderson</a> did some twisting around of my mind regarding measurement-based pricing models for services. He talked about how it's important to use measurement to encourage certain types of behavior. The example he used is that third-party customer satisfaction metrics determine a large part of a Microsoft VP's compensation package.</p>

<p>All in all a very fun time. </p>

<h3 class="title">Distributed computing economics</h3>

<p>Following up on some of the ideas on <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000507.html">massive scalability</a>, here's a paper from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray</a> that talks about the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?tr_id=655">economics of distributed computing</a>. It's interesting that this paper describes the Amazon scalability architecture via one of its conclusions: </p>

<blockquote><p>There are many techniques for doing this, but fundamentally it dovetails with the notion that each data source is a web service with a high-level object-oriented interface.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="title">AspectJ makes me want to write Java code again</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/">Gregor Kiczales</a> is a <em>master</em> at teaching. He gave the final keynote at <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/middleware2004/">Middleware 2004</a>, and oh what a keynote it was. Anyone who teaches for a living should study how Gregor delivers a lecture. He motivates <span class="caps">AOP</span> in a way that nobody else can. He motivates <span class="caps">AOP</span> better than Don Box can motivate <span class="caps">COM. </span>And that's saying a lot.</p>

<p>In the past, I had largely derided <span class="caps">AOP</span> as "programming by side effect". Recently, however, I'm not that sure anymore. <a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</a> does such an excellent job at capturing cross-cutting concerns that I defy anyone to propose a better solution to <em>those</em> problems than <span class="caps">AOP. </span>It's true that it introduces a certain degree of ambiguity into the model - but the really nice thing about <span class="caps">AOP</span> is that it makes it really easy to <em>remove</em> the ambiguity after I've introduced it. That alone is worth the price of admission - the ability to quickly experiment with an existing code base. The AspectJ integration into the Eclipse <span class="caps">IDE</span> looks excellent <span class="caps">BTW.</span></p>

<h3 class="title">Idea convergence</h3>

<p>I really love it when I can see existing ideas in a new light. Several ideas converged at Middleware 2004. Most of these ideas had come across my radar recently as a result of trying to expand my horizons. In no particular order, here's a few cool things that happened:</p>

<p>I met <a href="http://www.iona.com/hyplan/vinoski/">Steve Vinoski</a> when we played the role of "industry" in a panel titled <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000518.html">Is Middleware Dead?</a>. Steve's an old-school <span class="caps">CORBA</span> guy recast as a web services guy. Later on, we discovered that we were on the same languages trajectory over the past few months. Both Steve and I had largely derided dynamically typed languages before falling in love with them in the past few months. There was lots of "dude! that's exactly the way I feel!" comments as we recounted our personal experiences.</p>

<p>During Werner Vogel's keynote, I ran across another concept that had particularly resonated with me just a week ago. <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2004_10_03_seanmcgrath_archive.html#109697987226478494">Sean McGrath</a> had talked about massive parallelization of <span class="caps">XML</span> transformations. The core idea was that you should emphasize ease of construction / maintenance over <em>per-node</em> performance if you could perform transformations in parallel. This idea was one of the concepts that Werner discussed in the Amazon architecture. Amazon doesn't particularly care how quickly a process runs <em>per-node</em>. It only matters whether they can run it in parallel. And since Moore's Law is rapidly driving the cost of computing to zero, it makes sense to leverage compute cycles over human cycles which don't benefit from Moore's Law scaling.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I attended the <a href="http://www.engcorp.com/pygta/wiki/NextMeeting">Python user group</a> meeting here in Toronto. There, I learned about a company called <a href="http://www.givex.com">Givex</a>, and how they used Postgres database replication to add inexpensive fault-tolerence to their e-commerce application. At the Middleware conference, I met <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/">Bettina Kemme</a> when she appeared on the opposite side of the panel that Steve and I were on. Bettina's research group is working on an implementation of Postgres replication in the database engine itself. I had previously never thought about using replication because of the lack of hard consistency guarantees. However, I'm now realizing that there are some very interesting projects going on in both academia and industry in this area, and that there's lots of opportunities to learn new things and grow.</p>

<p>That was easily one of the best $700 that I've spent in my career. Thanks to everyone who made it such a memorable event!</p>

<h3 class="title">Middleware 2004 and Amazon.com</h3>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/">Werner Vogels</a> gave an excellent keynote to open <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/middleware2004/">Middleware 2004</a>. There was a lot of good keynote stuff in there- a great blend of motivation, information and insight. Werner recently accepted the position as Director of Systems Research at Amazon. Werner&#8217;s also looking for a few good people as well to work at Amazon. </p>

<p>He outlined the vision of Amazon.com, and what an ambitious vision it is. Amazon.com is implemented as a set of autonomous services. You know the sales rank for a book that takes up one tiny part of an Amazon page? That&#8217;s implemented as a separate cluster within an Amazon data center! Amazon.com has created a platform for experimenting with (and making money from) services. The Amazon platform is used by other companies already, including <a href="http://www.nordstrom.com">Nordstrom</a> and <a href="http://www.target.com">Target</a> department stores.</p>

<p>Amazon has problems moving to massive scale that other companies just don&#8217;t encounter. For example, some of Amazon&#8217;s data centers are only half-full. You know why? It&#8217;s because they simply cannot get any more <span class="caps">POWER</span> to those data centers. As a result, they are forced to move data between data centers which adds to complexity (and cost) of the system. </p>

<p><strong>Update (to reflect the fact that eBay does this stuff and not Amazon):</strong> He also mentioned some interesting problems that eBay is having. They&#8217;re also pushing databases beyond what they are capable of. eBay does not maintain integrity constraints in the database &#8211; they&#8217;re maintained at the application layer. They don&#8217;t maintain indexes in the databases; instead lookups are done in Berkeley DB indices since lookup speeds are an order of magnitude faster there than on a relational database. Effectively, eBay is using their expensive database system as a transactional file system!</p>

<p>I decided to write a simplified version of Jeff Keys' most excellent <a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/">Snippet Compiler</a> to facilitate some experiments that I've been working on today. I absolutely love how easy it is to compile in-memory assemblies using <code>System.CodeDom</code> and friends:</p>

<pre><code>
private CompilerResults Compile()
{
  CodeDomProvider provider = new CSharpCodeProvider();
  ICodeCompiler compiler = provider.CreateCompiler();
  CompilerParameters parameters = new CompilerParameters();
  parameters.WarningLevel = 4;
  parameters.GenerateInMemory = true;
  parameters.GenerateExecutable = false;
  parameters.ReferencedAssemblies.Add(&quot;System.Web.Services.dll&quot;);
  parameters.ReferencedAssemblies.Add(&quot;System.Xml.dll&quot;);
  parameters.ReferencedAssemblies.Add(&quot;System.dll&quot;);
  return compiler.CompileAssemblyFromSource(parameters, textBoxSource.Text);
}

<h3 class="title">Some interesting reading</h3>

<p>I've been reading a lot of mind-expanding stuff recently from around the web. Here's some pointers to stuff in case folks out there are interested in some of those items:</p>

<p>Sean McGrath's presentations at <span class="caps">XML </span>Open 2004. His <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2004_10_03_seanmcgrath_archive.html#109697987226478494"><span class="caps">XML </span>Pipelines talk</a> is excellent, as is his <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2004_10_03_seanmcgrath_archive.html#109696615608191782">closing keynote</a> that discusses the power of symbols and the importance of simplicity. It's a very <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray-ish</a> style of talk.</p>

<p>Richard Gabriel's classic essay on Lisp: <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/NewFiles/LispGoodNewsBadNews.pdf">Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</a> (aka Worse is Better)</p>

<p>I've just started reading Paul Graham's classic book <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> which you can download from his web site.</p>

<p>Sean McGrath's tutorial on <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorialPart1.html">writing Java servlets using Jython</a>. It's a funny and well thought out tutorial - and I learned a couple of things about interactive debugging in Python as well. Well worth the read.</p>

<h3 class="title">Social Computing</h3>

<p>I believe that digital images are one of the key aspects of social computing. Recently, I saw <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=06ff2206-27a3-4d55-81d8-bbee37073d6d">Dare Obasanjo</a> write about his social software epiphany. It looks like Google has a leg up on Microsoft in this area. Their recent acquisition of my favorite photo gallery software company, <a href="http://www.picasa.com/picasa">Picasa</a>, is further evidence of this.</p>

<p>One of the really exciting things that will appear soon is peer-to-peer photo sharing. The Microsoft Research Wallop project is one possible approach. <span class="caps">MSR</span> recently published an article called <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=605">The Life of a Digital Photo</a> which collects together some really interesting scenarios, including Wallop.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced that we need a new operating system to enable a richer user experience with digital photos. The eye candy will help, but I really believe that most if not all of the technologies for making this happen already exist today. We just need some clever software that will make this happen (and I have no doubt that there's lots of companies operating in "stealth" mode today on just this problem).</p>

<h3 class="title">Richard Gabriel on Art in Programming</h3>

<p>I spent some time reading some of <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/">Richard Gabriel's</a> writings this evening. Much like <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham's</a> writing's that draw parallels between painting and programming, Richard Gabriel's writings draw parallels between poetry and programming.</p>

<p>One idea that caught my attention was the role that <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Feyerabend/Extravagaria.html">ambiguity plays in programming</a>. He highlights the tension between being the desire to be <em>well-defined</em> and the desire for <em>expressiveness</em>. He uses polymorphism in object-oriented programming languages as an example:</p>

<blockquote><p>However, polymorphism in object-oriented languages&#8212;especially those with extensive dynamic method-dispatch support&#8212;is an example of the use of (seemingly) ill-defined expressions for great expressive power. One could argue that a method-call is really quite well defined because, after all, only one class or object is chosen to respond, but the programmer in writing the method call cannot tell which piece of code that will be, so that it is sensible to think of the programmer as using ambiguity at code-writing time to gain clarity at code-execution time. In this sense, the artistic notion of ambiguity has at least inspired a breakthrough in programming language design.</p></blockquote>

<p>He mentions aspect-oriented programming in passing as well. I wonder if my (current) bias against <span class="caps">AOP</span> is the result of my preference for well-defined behavior over expressiveness. I wonder if my current infatuation with Python might lead me down some new roads of thought as well ...</p>

My external <span class="caps">USB</span> hard drive is a Fujitsu 5400rpm drive that is rated at 0.55mA. Apparently the power limit on the Intel <span class="caps">USB</span> hub on my Inspiron 8600 is 0.5mA. So, after a few minutes of operation, it detects a surge on the port and <strong>shuts down the device</strong>. </p>

<p>If you use an external <span class="caps">HDD</span> to run Virtual PC instances, this can um ... cause undesirable effects :) So what you need to do is disable <span class="caps">USB</span> error notifications via Device Manager. </p>

<p>As I said before, I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or not; I'm hoping that the 0.05mA difference in power rating between my drive and the <span class="caps">USB</span> hub limit doesn't do anything bad. This is another reason why you should not put 7200 rpm drives into external <span class="caps">USB 2.0</span> enclosures. The Hitachi drives that I looked at all drew &gt; 1A of current, which is probably asking for trouble :)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To properly workaround this problem, I bought a powered external <span class="caps">USB 2.0</span> hub to provide power for my external <span class="caps">HDD.</span></p>

<p>I see that Gordon Weakliem took me up on my dare and <a href="http://www.eighty-twenty.net/blog/urn:www-eighty-twenty-net:1301.html">wrote a Scheme implementation</a> of my birthday present for my son Matthew's first birthday. </p>

<p>While not as short as my <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000483.html">Python implementation</a> it does a great job at illustrating the power of dynamic code generation in Scheme. The syntax of <code>parser-tools</code> leaves a bit to be desired, but it's still nice to be able to define the grammar inline with the rest of the application code.</p>

<h3 class="title">Lightweight Code Generation and Python</h3>

<p>Recently on the <a href="http://www.ironpython.com">IronPython</a> mailing list, there has been discussion about the new Lightweight Code Generation (LCG) feature in <span class="caps">V2.0</span> of the <span class="caps">CLR. </span>This feature is implemented by <code>System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod</code>. </p>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/joelpob/archive/2004/03/31/105282.aspx">Joel Pobar</a> wrote an entry some time ago (March 21, 2004) that describes how to write "Hello, World" using <code>DynamicMethod</code>. I recall reading this entry and saying to myself: "so what?". At the time, I didn't care much about dynamically typed languages that support <code>eval</code>-style programming. So I missed the significance of one bullet point:</p>

<p>Generated methods are able to be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Whoa. This changes everything for dynamically typed languages such as Python on the <span class="caps">CLR. </span>It is highly unlikely that future versions of the <span class="caps">CLR</span> will support unloading of assemblies from an existing AppDomain. This means that long-running programs that generate code via <code>eval</code> will eventually run out of memory since none of the generated code can be reclaimed by the <span class="caps">GC. </span>With <span class="caps">LCG,</span> however, dynamically generated methods <em>can</em> be reclaimed by the GC which is a big win for dynamic typing on the <span class="caps">CLR.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/">Jim Hugunin</a> the creator of IronPython and a recent hire at Microsoft wrote the following in a recent post:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="caps">LCG</span> is the right way to fix this problem in the near term.  Once again, I'll send you off to one of my co-worker's blogs for a concrete example: http://blogs.msdn.com/joelpob/archive/2004/03/31/105282.aspx</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It should be a trivial matter to support this form of generation as an option in IronPython that is used only on systems that support DynamicMethod.  This would mean that 1.1 systems would have an interactive interpreter with a memory leak, but that on 2.0 that same interactive interpreter would stop leaking making it viable in a greater range of circumstances.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jim's got <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=6391a54a-bfd7-4384-b18f-cecb0acf86e0">an open position</a> for an <span class="caps">SDE</span> if you're interested in working on the future of dynamic typing at Microsoft.</p>

<h3 class="title">Hard links and the GAC</h3>

<p>While I was at Microsoft this week, Andrew Grealy put an interesting idea in my head: using <span class="caps">NTFS</span> hard links to emulate some of the functionality of the <span class="caps">GAC. </span>The scenario that I had in mind was to create <span class="caps">NTFS</span> hard links to duplicate private assemblies so that I could update the "shared" private assembly simply by replacing a single file on the user's hard drive. </p>

<p>On the plane ride home, I wrote a simple Python script to do just that. It looks for duplicate files on your hard disk, and moves a single copy of that file to a special place that we call the <span class="caps">YAC </span>(Yet Another Cache). It then replaces all copies of that file with a hard link that points to the <span class="caps">YAC</span> entry for that file.</p>

<p>It calculates <span class="caps">MD5</span> hashes to ensure that duplicate files are in fact duplicates, and uses the Python Win32 extensions to call the Windows <code>CreateHardLink</code> <span class="caps">API. </span></p>

<p>I absolutely love the use of Python Generators in the <code>GetFiles</code> method. This is such a low-friction language!</p>

<pre><code>
import os
import shutil
import md5
import win32file

class HardLink:
    BLOCKSIZE   = 1024
    YAC         = r'c:\dev\python\yac'
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.files = dict()
        
    def GetFiles(self, path):
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
            for file in files:
                yield root + '\\' + file

    def CalculateHash(self, path):
        f = file(path,'rb')
        m = md5.new()
        readBytes = HardLink.BLOCKSIZE
        while (readBytes):
            readString = f.read(readBytes)
            m.update(readString)
            readBytes = len(readString)
        f.close();
        return m.hexdigest()

    def GetYacPath(self, path):
        (dir, filename) = os.path.split(path)
        return HardLink.YAC + '\\' + filename

    def CreateFirstFileHardLink(self, path):
        yacPath = self.GetYacPath(path)
        shutil.move(path, yacPath)
        win32file.CreateHardLink(path, yacPath)

    def CreateNthFileHardLink(self, path):
        yacPath = self.GetYacPath(path)
        os.remove(path)
        win32file.CreateHardLink(path, yacPath)
        
    def Run(self, path):
        for path in self.GetFiles(path):
            hash = self.CalculateHash(path)
            if self.files.has_key(hash):
                (firstPath, flag) = self.files[hash]
                if not flag:
                    self.files[hash] = (None, True)
                    self.CreateFirstFileHardLink(firstPath)
                self.CreateNthFileHardLink(path)
            else:
                self.files[hash] = (path, False)

h = HardLink()
h.Run(r'c:\test')
</code></pre>

<h3 class="title">Mount Rainier</h3>

<p>I had a fun time this weekend at Mount Rainier. The conditions were almost perfect - warm temperatures, clear blue skies and no wind. I shot this photo from Reflection Lake on Sunday </p>

<p><img src="Images/rainier.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was hanging out at Reflection Lake with another photographer (also named John) who was also shooting the lake with his view camera. The District Ranger for the park also showed up and the three of us had a fun conversation about National Parks and some of the shenanigans that can go on at the park. Ed regaled us with stories about bears, and coyotes and people from his years of service with the National Park Service.</p>

<p>If you're at Mt. Ranier, you should defintely check out the Lakes Trail that begins from Reflection Lake. It's a much nicer place to begin a hike than Paradise, which is usually far busier. </p>
