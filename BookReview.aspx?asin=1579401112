                    <span>Alright, I admit it. I'm a card carrying member of the Nation. In fact, I'm damn proud of that fact. Being born in Ma, my first words were "Yankees suck." However, before somebody (ahem, Yankees fans) wire my ignition to an explosive, let me say that I found the book, though obviously skewed in the BoSox favor, is an interesting look at the rivarly none the less. A great read, even if you are a Yankees whore... I'm sorry, I meant fan.</span>

                    <span>There are people, although I can't imagine why, that would claim that this book is one sided. These are probably people who simply don't realize that damnyankee is one word. They probably don't even realize that this is a battle between the forces of good and the dark side of the force. They might, just might, you understand, even be people who say that this is only a game. I'm told that there are even people who said that who became President was more important, but I clearly don't belie that this is true, there just couldn't be such people. 
<br />
<br />Well, that's the tone of the book. If you're a Yankee fan (I guess there are still a few out there), you can expect to get your bowels in an uproar by reading this book. If you're a Red Sox fan, well, the book is only simple Gospel fact, with a bit of humor thrown in.</span>

                    <span>Whether you are a Red Sox fan or not (and why not?) this book is fun, ingenious and lots of information for baseball diehards.    Bill Nowlin and Jim Prime obviously enjoyed putting this book together and it shows with lots of humor and poking fun throughout.  I loved the quotes at the beginning of each chapter..they just made me giggle!!  Good work!  Thanks for sheer pleasure and delight!!</span>

                    <span>There seem to be a million new books on the Red Sox this year.  It's probably more like 25.  Most are self-congratulatory books that just celebrate the win, and maybe try to cash in on it.  I see four or five that focus on the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry.  This is one of the best.  It seems to do two things at the same time.  One, it digs a little deeper than most of the other books, going way back in history and not just the last few years.  Two, it's a lot of fun!  The authors take it seriously but also have a lot of fun.  There are also a lot of interesting features, like ones that look at the trades between the teams and ones that present the stats of players who were both Red Sox and Yankees.
<br />
<br />Another good book about this rivalry, though it just features on the last two years, is called A TALE OF TWO CITIES.  But BLOOD FEUD is my favorite because it packs in so much information and has a lot of fun doing it.

                    <span>This book is a rarity: a comprehensive history of two of baseball's greatest teams that is actually FUN to read. It has a slight Red Sox bias in tone, but is scrupulously fair to both teams. You will laugh out loud at some of the commentary, and true Yankee fans will laugh loudest - the way they do everything else!
