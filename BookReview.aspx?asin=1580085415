                    <span>This is pretty good.  I received it as a gift from a friend.  Unfortunately, it is a bit unrealistic toward the reasons most people seek jobs -- they need to pay their bills.  
<br />
<br />Paying the bills is the priority; finding your dream job is not.  This job isn't going to work if you don't have a job, and need to take on whatever you can find to pay the bills (i.e., a temp job, or a Walmart job, or whatever).  
<br />
<br />A book like this only works if you have a job and can afford to take the time to plan ahead so you can quit your job for a better one.  It is a good planning resource, but would be better if it was more realistic.</span>

                    <span>Better than all the rest.  This is an annually updated guide to finding your next job.  Your next career.  Your next passion.
<br />
<br />Read the book completely once. Then block off a day or two of your life and do the exercises.  
<br />
<br />If you don't understand who you are, and what you have to offer, how can you find the right vocation ?</span>

                    <span>As one of those people who never did figure out what I should do after highschool, I ended up getting a master's degree in a field I disliked and worked for years at a job that drove me crazy.  I stopped working after I had my child and felt a relief you can't imagine.  As my son got older, I felt it time to hit the workforce again - but was none the wiser about what to do.  A friend suggested this book and I have to say - I am amazed at what this book has done for me.  While the process is long - you have to work through many exercises - the end result is a better knowledge of yourself, your interests and skills.   
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who isn't sure what career path to choose, anyone who is unhappy in their current job, or people just looking for a positive change in their lives.
<br />
<br />I didn't give this 5 stars as I periodically felt the exercises took too much time and I just wanted to "get the answer".  Patience isn't really my strong suit and there is alot of work involved.  Having said that - the end result is worth the effort!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a professional resume writer and author of "51 Ways to Find a Job Fast -- Guaranteed," I've given this book my highest possible recommendation to 3,000+ clients since 1996.
<br />
<br />It's critical that you keep in mind that you'll never be hired by a computer -- you'll have to go belly-to-belly with a live human at some point in your job search. So the more time you spend meeting and talking to people about your search, the better. 
<br />
<br />Tip: if you're at all average, you know 250 people by name. And each of those people knows 250 more. Multiply the two and you find out that you're only one or two phone calls away from 62,500 people. 
<br />
<br />This book will help you get clear on the message you want to send to others.
<br />
<br />With fun brainstorming exercises, useful anecdotes and a ton of job search tips that really work, there's something for everyone here.

                    <span>I think after 30 years of being in print this book is starting to get a bit dated. While I found many of the exercises to be very beneficial, I also found the book to be extremely time consuming and not as practical for today's fast paced world.
<br />
<br />A small workbook that I found to be much more beneficial was "10 Insider Secrets: Career Transition Workshop" by Todd Bermont. That book really helped me net it out to figure out what I wanted to do and it also helped me with putting together a game plan to get the job.
<br />
<br />As for Parachute, my recommendation is to skip to the Flower Exercise as I found that to be the most useful part of the book. If you do that exercise there is not much need to read hundreds of pages of dated material.</span>
