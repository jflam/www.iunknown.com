                <span id="Label1">According to Jim Rogers, "commodities get no respect." Here are a few reasons why he thinks they should: they are easier to comprehend and study than stocks and behave more rationally since they are subject to the basic laws of supply and demand; they have outperformed many other investment options in recent years; it is foolish to ignore an entire sector of the marketplace; and a bull market is currently under way in commodities--a trend that Rogers expects to last for a least a decade longer. Further, Rogers believes that you cannot be a successful investor in stocks, bonds, or currencies without an understanding of commodities. <I>Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World's Best Market</I> is designed to introduce the novice to the basics of investing in commodities as well as explain what they are and why they are important. In doing so, he shatters some myths about the relative risks of commodities, explains the relationship between the stock and commodities markets, and provides a succinct analysis and history of the global oil, gold, lead, sugar, and coffee markets. <p>  Rogers also offers practical advice and information for beginners, including the best resources, how to read the commodities reports in the newspaper or on television, the various ways to open an account, information on index funds (such as Rogers' own index fund that he started in 1998), mechanisms, terminology, and other vital details people must know before investing. Clearly written and entertaining, <I>Hot Commodities</I> offers a solid introduction to investments that many people, including financial advisors, fail to give the proper respect. <I>--Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>I think Jim Rogers is a very interesting person..  When I saw him on Bloomberg News I was compelled to buy this book..  When I got to the book store I was a little distressed after not being able to find the Barnes & Noble book store I called in the phone book..  
<br />
<br />When I finally found Hot Commodities on the book shelf I was at first unimpressed and started to put it back on the shelf.. Looking around there wasn't a lot of books on the subject so I decided I better get the book.  Immediatly you'll notice it doesn't have a lot of pictures and is written in black & white.. If your like me you want a little color particularly in the form of pictures & diagrams.  There are some diagrams but it basically all literature.  
<br />
<br />A picture paints a thousand words...  Well in this case Jim has a lot more to say about commodities than can be summed up in a picture.  Needless to say I liked the book and it's worth buying..  I read from cover to cover in 2 days and liked nearly every prospective that was presented.  I was supprised to find that he gained his knowledge not just by reading but by actually going to differnt countries and learning the societies that influence commodities.  
<br />
<br />This is not a book on technical analysis it's a book about commodities from a supply & demand perspective and secular trends of.</span>

                    <span>Rogers is a very nice guy, and a real success. I have talked to him and read his books - wish I had his life! 
<br />
<br />Beware of jealous reviewers on Amazon - like one of the ones above (e.g. how can he have a pseudo-bike when there are photos of him with it all around the world. Also,  a website detailing his latest adventure driving around the world - people who have been to the places he went to see the authenticity in his comments on the places - and of course the photos).
<br />
<br />The book gives you a great background on commodities trading, and is well written. It cant give you trading signals as the markets change daily, though it is a great primer.
<br />
<br />So what if he isnt as rich as Soros (who he started with)! He is more successful in many areas of life than 99.99999% of people, and a great guy.

                    <span>i share with one of the reviewers' frustration that the book i bought has no contents page and the page header does not show which chapter u are reading, it seems the book came out in a rush to sell his index fund, 
<br />
<br />nevertheless it is a good introduction to the fundamentals of commodity trading - but one glaring omission is any analysis on silver, one of the most heavily traded, yet least researched commodity, perhaps he assumed that it just dances together with gold, but that's a big mistake, silver is (unlike gold) as much an industrial metal as a precious metal, interested readers could search "butler research" to find out</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an engaging introduction to a topic that even many experienced investors find intimidating. In what may be a seminal report on the subject from the Yale School of Management's Center for International Finance, "Facts and Fantasies About Commodity Futures" [Gorton, Rouwenhorst: 2004] academia gives support to Jim Rogers' real world experience as a commodities investor. The conclusions: Returns on commodities have often been better on a risk adjusted basis than stocks and bonds. Commodities have historically done well when these more traditional investments have suffered and so offer investors seeking to diversify their portfolios a solid alternative. The greatest returns come from investing in commodity futures rather than stocks of companies that produce those same commodities. Notably, commodities have performed well during periods of inflation.
<br />
<br />Rogers believes the current bull market in commodities began in 1998 and based on precedent should run 17-18 years until 2015. At the heart of the commodity cycle is a supply-demand dynamic that impacts many natural assets differently. Rogers gives readers an introduction to the pricing drivers for oil, gold, sugar, lead and coffee.
<br />
<br />Chapter 5 deals with the voracious demand for commodities coming out of China. Chapter 6 "Goodbye, Cheap Oil" looks at the world supply of oil and alternative sources of energy. Both chapters have the potential to alter the reader's investment perspective.
<br />
<br />Some takeaway nuggets: China is consuming half the world's cement. No major oil field has been discovered in thirty-five years. The U.S. foreign trade imbalance is growing by a trillion dollars every two years. Asians save almost 40 percent of their income (versus 2 percent in the U.S.).
<br />
<br />Readers of HOT COMMODITIES will not likely gain the confidence needed to invest in sugar futures, etc. They will have a better appreciation for including commodities in a well diversified portfolio. Unfortunately there are few mutual funds that focus on commodities. What is still needed in this reader's opinion is an ETF (exchange traded fund) that tracks a broad-based commodity index.</span>

                    <span>Who says that intelligence is equated with market success? Rogers was a junior partner of George Soros close to 27 years ago. At that time, soros managed a relatively small amount of funds versus what he has accumulated in the past 2 decades. Rogers has been living off of this assumed reputation since then. What did he leave with--$15 million? That pales when measured against the trading legends. Rogers has fared better marketing himself rather than the bottom line success of market performance. I dare say he lives off of his book revenues. I would not be surprised to learn that the extent of his profits is no larger than that pretentious bow tie that he chooses to wear. I would be surprised that he could even find a helmet to wear to cover his oversized head when he drives that psuedo motorcycle he claims he drove around the world. Give this fool a 'D' grade for marketing and a resounding 'F' for true trading performance. </span>
