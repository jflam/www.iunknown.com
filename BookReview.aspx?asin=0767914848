                <span id="Label1"><P>Isadora Tattlin was accustomed to relocating often for her husband&#8217;s work. But when he accepted a post in Cuba in the early 1990s, she resolved to keep a detailed diary of her time there, recording her daily experiences as a wife, mother, and foreigner in a land of contraband. The result is a striking, rare glimpse into a tiny country of enormous splendor and squalor. Though the Tattlins are provided with a well-staffed Havana mansion, the store shelves are bare. On the streets, beggars plead for soap, not coins. A vet with few real medical supplies operates on a carved mahogany coffee table in a Louis XIV&#8211;style drawing room. The people adore festivity, but Christmas trees are banned. And when Isadora hosts a dinner party whose guest list includes Fidel Castro himself, she observes the ultimate contradiction at the very heart of Cuba. Vividly capturing Cuba&#8217;s simultaneously appalling and enchanting essence, <i>Cuba Diaries</i> casts an irresistible spell and lifts the enigma of an island that is trapped in time, but not in spirit.</p></span>

                    <span>The American wife of a European energy consultant, Tattlin (a pseudonym) has lived all over the world, and her four-year sojourn in Cuba is an eye opener. There's the poverty, of course, but she knew about that. The average salary is $10 a month and Tattlin's packing list covers two pages and includes such things as 216 bars of soap and 48 liters of olive oil.<P>Partly Tattlin's fascination with Cuba is the feeling of being frozen in time; an industrial society stuck in the 1950s where cars and appliances slowly grind to a halt through rust and lack of parts and buildings crumble for want of maintenance. Partly it's the ingenuity of the Cuban people, bartering, scrounging, repairing and, of course, making the most of foreign tourists and residents. Workers in the tourist industry can earn two to three times the fixed government salaries of doctors, lawyers and professors. Partly it's the surreal feel of Castro's regime, liberalized during the mid-to-late '90s, but rife with uncertainty. A private, home-based restaurant, legal today, might be closed up tomorrow.<P>Tattlin lives in relative splendor, in a big house with plenty of servants. Her book takes its shape from the notes she took - short, often funny, often poignant, vignettes of daily living, from obtaining decent food (not at the state-run market), to Spanish lessons for the family and dancing lessons for her daughter and the servants' unwillingness to discipline her son or even tell her of infractions, like urinating in the library wastebasket. She describes the pleasures and hazards of travel in Cuba, hosting dinner parties for generals who know where the bodies are buried and, once, for Fidel - a frenzy of paranoid government prep with a curiously flat finale. <P>Most absorbing are Tattlin's connections with local people. She becomes involved in the lives of her servants, though she's near the end of her stay before she sees where several of them live. Slowly bits of their lives emerge - a stint as political prisoner or government spy, a sick wife, a knack for practical solutions. Tattlin befriends her children's teachers, area artists and intellectuals; ex-revolutionaries. She describes film festivals, spontaneous generation of long lines for rare items, back alley purchases, Santeria rites Over the years, some of the people she befriends disappear to America.<P>Her family appears only in glimpses, though Tattlin is free with her own feelings about things, from the complex categorization of skin color to a request for visa sponsorship to the discovery of a minor theft. Tattlin is funny, frank and warm. She doesn't want to be taken advantage of, though she quite understands why it's inevitable. Her anecdotal view of Cuba shows a witty and canny observer and her book should interest anyone curious about that shuttered island.</span>

                    <span>Cuba Diaries, a new book by Isadora Tattlan, is a good read and deserves attention. Several of the anecdotes regarding the "periodo especial" in Cuba are insightful and reflect the daily realties faced by the victims of this 40 year-old totalitarian state. However, the author unnecessarily creates an ubiquitous veil, shrouding the identity of her husband, his business role and country of origin, i.e. Nick is from X----- or his X----ian language, and nullifying their interactions with government personnel and business associates. The book does not offer a true description of their personal situation or a root cause analysis of the surrounding economic crisis. Despite these failings, I recommend the book as a good source of anecdotal reference material for those people interested in studying this "periodo especial" and its effects on an American housewife in Cuba.

                    <span>I believe this may be the second best book I have ever read and possibly one of the most insightful travel logs ever written. <P>Composed of almost-daily entries and organized by school year, Cuba Diaries is the journal of an American housewife living in Havana during the mid-90s. Solely concerned with feeding, entertaining and educating her children while sustaining her marriage, Isadora Tattlin details what sounds like a mundane life. Yet, because it is all happening in beautiful, wacky Cuba, the author's every day chores take on a rip-rollicking feel that will easily have you laughing out-loud.<P>Because Cuba is the "forbidden island" just 90 miles south of Florida, there is a natural curiosity about it for any American who has ever thought about Fidel Castro and the country he has ruled since 1959. <P>While Cuba Diaries feeds that curiosity, the author does something smart with it, too. Rather than editorialize her position on Castro or Cuba, Tattlin avoids politics altogether and instead recites bizarre facts, one right after another: <P> "In the Diplo a seventeen-dollar cabbage" was all she wrote on entry 68 of the second school year. <P>While other reviewers may detect a snooty, privileged attitude on the author's part or a disrespect for Cuban people in general, I never found any of Tattlin's witty observations to be remotely critical of the resourceful people who have learned to live on this island with so little for so long.<P>On the contrary, the reader is lead to feel enormous empathy, undying respect and sheer admiration for Cubans. And though the author never pushes the reader toward any conclusions about Castro, but simply typing up the events of her four years in Cuba, Tattlin leaves you with two burning wishes: 1. that somehow Castro will somehow disappear and; 2. that you can hop on the next plane to Havana and join the fun.</span>

                    <span>This story has substance but lacks passion and details. I am Cuban and read anything and everything Cuban,thus why I read this book. To compare to a vibrant,passionate book, check out a little Spanish/English all-Cuban book (Cuban characters,Cuban author, Cuban illustrator, Cuban story, set in Little Havana's Cuban Calle Ocho Festival) titled,DRUM,CHAVI, DRUM!/TOCA,CHAVI,TOCA! If you have children or if you're a book collector,like myself, you will note a significant difference in passion even when comparing a picturebook to DIARIES...<P>I do recommend this book for its contents and I thank the author for bringing it to our attention.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book because I enjoy all books on Cuba. But it seems to have been written by a Martha Stewart-type who constantly calls the employees in her home "the help". She doesn't seem to have a happy marriage, seems like she married for money, and didn't have much to say about her children. My overall impression was of a very rich person who found "the help" and most everything else in Cuba not up to her standards. I wouldn't read anything else by her, but since the book was about Cuba I read it to the end. I also would have preferred not to know how many boxes of tampons and panty-liners she needed.</span>
