                <span id="Label1">While there is a plethora of books available that provide tips on Web design, most authors leave a significant gap between the theory and practice--a gap that is left up to the reader to fill. <I>Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed</I> boldly steps into that gap with specific observations and suggestions backed with solid quantitative analysis. This book focuses only on home page design as the most important point of presence for any Web site.<p>  This definitive work is coauthored by Jakob Nielsen--the accepted industry expert in Web usability--and Marie Tahir, an expert in user profiling. Their collaboration has produced a guide of such rare practical benefit that Web designers will likely wear out their first copy scouring the pages to savor every last morsel of wisdom.<p>  The book begins with a chapter of precise guidelines that serve as a checklist of the features and functionality to include on your home page. The specifics found in categories such as "revealing content through examples" and "graphic design" will quickly hook you and whet your appetite for more. These guidelines are followed up with hard statistics and an examination of the ominous Jakob's Law: "Users spend most of their time on other sites than your site." Here you'll find some interesting statistics about how various conventions like search, privacy policies, and logos are used.<p>  All this leads up to the showcase element of the book--a systematic deconstruction of 50 of the most popular home pages on the Web. The authors painstakingly pick apart each in an uncompromising autopsy of usability. Each site is graphically analyzed for its use of real estate and summarized with the frankness only found from true experts. Then each section of the home page is bulleted and analyzed for potential improvements.  <p>  It's a bold move to offer a critique of industry-standard Web sites such as Yahoo, CNET, and eBay, but the authors have done such a fine job that the designers of those sites will surely make reading this book a high priority. For the rest of us, this work will serve as an invaluable gospel. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Design guidelines, convention usage, screen real estate, navigation, content presentation, search facilities, links, graphics and animation, advertising, news, customization, and customer feedback.</span>

                    <span>I saw Jakob once at a usability conference and all I can say is "What a friggin' ego." The whole beginning of his presenation was a series of slides showing what magazines he's been featured in. It totally eroded any semblance of scholarship I may have once thought he posessed. 
<br />And if you don't think ego is involved, check out his rates on the neilson/norman consulting site.

                    <span>It's worth the first 53 pages. I don't think anybody cares about if a specific site do or doesn't do something rigth unless it is in a specific example. I found three usability problems in the book itself. 
<br />First, the printed format is odd and hard to handle. 
<br />Second, when he make the breakdown of the hompage sould have some kind of rating for each point, like Good, Bad or Regular. In this case if your are looking to see what is good or bad in a homepage you don't have to read all of them. 
<br />Third, the appendix. Completely useless. It doesn't give you a hint of the meaning in the real state breakdown. If you want to see the logo of one of the company in the book just go to the review of that company or go to their hompage. The search features doesn't say anything about it, it is a collection of different search boxes. The other collection in the appendix are not worthy comment them out.
<br />If you want to take read the book, I recommend going to a public library or to a boookstore and red it there, not worth spend your money, save it for a bouquet to your spouse (or boy/girl-friend).</span>

<br />
<br />I would not buy his books, nor listen to any of his advise.  At best he can offer tips for designing handicapped accesible sites, but that's about it.

                    <span>This is an excellent book about the design of homepages that could have benefited from paying attention to some of the authors' own points about design.
<br />
<br />Nielsen and Tahir are consultants who advise their clients about the design of homepages on web sites.  The book is a collection of screen shots of fifty different homepages with a description of the purpose of each web site and a chart showing the allocation of screen real estate amongst topics like navigation, content and advertising.  Most of the authors' real estate is used for number-coded comments about each homepage.  In addition, based on their analysis of what does and does not work on the sites, the authors provide a list of guidelines for homepage designers.
<br />
<br />This useful book calls attention to common mistakes that have been made in the design of homepages by major companies, many of them in the Fortune 500, like Microsoft and Ford.  Indeed, one complaint I had is that none of the web sites analyzed were sites for individuals and small companies.  Given that, after seeing half the pages, one already has a pretty big dose of knowledge about large company mistakes, it might have been pleasant and useful to look at how to improve the web sites of small timers.
<br />
<br />One of the things that the authors urge is consistency in the design of homepages so that users will be able to find their way around homepages more easily.  For example they urge that any search box be placed in the upper right or left hand corner.  They also weigh in against animation on a homepage.  One of the dangers of hewing to the authors' consensus rules is that homepages may develop such a sameness that users won't differentiate between them.
<br />
<br />One problem with the book is that although the authors are concerned about easing the way around the homepage for users, they haven't eased the reader's way around their comments.  The numbered circles keyed to the comments are organized right to left and top to bottom on the page.  But readers will look at one area and then another on the page with the screen shot and will have a hard time coordinating the instincts of their eyes with the numbered comments.
<br />
<br />There are also some curious appendixes.  I suppose it might be useful for comparison to have all of the logos laid out on a two page spread, but what is one to make of an appendix called "Smiling Ladies" with a selection of graphics from the homepages, not all of which are smiling ladies.
<br />
<br />This is a good reference book for professional designers of big web sites.  The homegrown webmaster will probably find something like "The Non-Designer's Web Book" by Robin Williams, (the third edition of which is planned to be published in February of 2005) more useful.</span>
