                <span id="Label1"><I>Kartography</I> is Kamila Shamsie's impressive third novel. At its heart is a traditional love story-cum-family saga. Karim and Raheen are anagram-swapping "fated friends." Until the age of 13, when Karim moved to London, they were virtually raised as brother and sister. Their parents had once been engaged to each other. The unravelling of quite why this matrimonial square dance occurred is juxtaposed with Karim and Raheen's own, and decidedly more protracted, romance. <p>  As the title suggests, mapping--geographical, political and emotional--is central to the book. The "comic" spelling is a wry allusion to its setting: the troubled Pakistani city of Karachi, a place that, as Karim observes, worships "at the altar of K." Karim, Raheen and their friends Sonia and Zia all belong to the privileged Karachi elite. Born on the right "side of the Clifton Bridge" they seem immune from Karachi's endemic corruption, violence, and religious and ethnic intolerance but they and their families, like the rest of the city's inhabitants, have all been horrifically scarred by events of the 1971 civil war.<p>  Like Austen, or perhaps more accurately Forster, Shamsie is wonderfully adept at capturing the petty rivalries and social games of Pakistan's highly stratified bourgeoisie society--Zia's house is sagely described as "always full of people worth cultivating, rather than people worth having in your home." There are a few (well-acknowledged) nods to Italo Calvino's <I>Invisible Cities</I> and even Homer's <I>Odyssey</I> gets a look in but Shamsie wears her learning lightly. She manages to make Karim and Raheen's journey to toward engagement, both with the realities of Karachi and with each other, into a profound meditation on the nature of love, storytelling and politics. <I>--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk</I></span>

It was such an enjoyable read. And towards the end She really messed it up like in the beginning where it's all about tying loose end. I had to read the parental generation story twice or thrice before I understood the gist of what happened. Karim and Raheen once grown up , was the wonderful part to read. All those child - age realizations didn't really impress me. Worth a read, once wish there was more of spice. more of a tale, and really there were more personal rants, with the story being narrated in backdrops.. specially the partition scene made a comeback for a very brief period of time. .. But I guess it could have been edited a lot more, most of those adolescent scenes could have been dropped in order to make way for an impressive romance between Karim and Raheen. I kept waiting for more, and more.. and well.. it was disappointing..</span>

                    <span>Kamila Shamsie's third novel, "Kartography" is an engaging, witty, yet strangely endearing story. <BR>Raheen and Karim, members of Karachis elite privileged class, are soul mates from birth, but after Karims move abroad they somehow drift apart, yet hold onto memories forever. On his return, Raheen seeks to understand what possibly could have caused the divide between their hearts; Karim seems accusatory, speaks in a language she cannot understand, and is trying to tell her something that she does not know of. In between their complicated love and friendship, there are haunts of an earlier relationshop; Karims and Raheens parents were once engaged to each other, until "the music changed". Why this happened, and how it affected their childrens lives, Raheen asks and explores, until she is told the truth and her world and literally everything she stood for, collapses.<P>In the larger political and social backdrop is the Civil war between East and West Pakistan that divided the nation into two. This story, set in the later 80's and early 90s sees Karachi, their beloved city, torn apart by strife and violence. Should this affect their relationship? Raheen chooses to accept it while Karim feels the pain and demands Raheen to understand it in context. <P>Kamila Shamsie's writing is extremely engaging and humorous, with a shrewd understanding of society and people, at times; although she can be confusing and rewuire readers to read over to fully understand the meaning. Conversations don't always seem real; the characters speak in drawn out sentences and in a literary, philosophical manner, which can be annoying at times (nobody speaks in words like "palimpsest"). The book refers only to a very very minute selection of Karachi society, the extreme elite who live outside the circles that define mainstream Karachi. <BR>However, despite the confusion and constant energy and action that can be taxing to your understanding of the plot and following of the story, Kartography is extremely enjoyable, overall very well written and astute. While not particularly deep, as novels go, its definitely worth its price.</span>

                    <span>Children of destiny, Karim and Raheen grow up in the shadow of their parent's convoluted relationship. The parents have switched fiancés at the last minute, a fact that becomes part of family mythology. However, the swap has more serious implications, occurring during a period of civil unrest in Pakistan in the 1970's, where the upper class citizens of Karachi cannot escape the reach of the troubles. A decade later, still affected by the civil chaos that threatens the city, Karim's parents leave Karachi for London, where they eventually get divorced. Raheen loses her alter ego and best friend, writing only sporadically over the years.<P>Later, when Karim returns to Karachi, the two meet again, but their once easy relationship has become complicated by distance and family secrets. Neither can unravel the emotional knots created during the years they were separated. Raheen's nature is to cling desperately to her childhood memories, savoring the closeness she enjoyed with her best friend, although she is definitely in love with him. Karim has evolved into a principled man, a cartographer, whose world is defined in black and white, in absolutes.<P>Karim has long known the family secret; because of this, he judges Raheen for her complicity, although she has no knowledge of the event that occurred before they were born. In the bright idealism of youth, Karim's judgment comes easily, albeit flawed by his ignorance. Karim and Raheen have difficulty managing the complications of love, friendship and polarizing politics, their emotions as entangled as the love of their parents; only when they embrace the decisions faced by their parents can the young couple overcome their lack of communication.<P>This upper class Pakistani slice-of-life is set against a background of recurring civil war, beautifully illustrating the unbreakable bonds of love and friendship, made more durable by friendship. Shamsie's engaging prose evokes the warmth and acceptance of family, as the author connects politics with the everyday lives of the citizens of Karachi. Eventually, affluence is insufficient protection from the random violence of war and personal possessions cannot isolate these families from tragedy. <P>This is indeed a love story between a boy and a girl, but also an inter-generational one, where compassion defines the quality of family relationships. The extraordinary friendship of the parents, even with its inherent problems, teaches their children about the fragility of the human heart and the catharsis of forgiveness.

                    <span>Karim and Raheen have been the closest of friends since they shared a crib as infants. Growing up together in a wealthy Karachi neighborhood during the 1980s, they finish each other's sentences, speak in anagrams, dream each other's dreams and are true soulmates. The two are sure of the fact that, "If I wasn't me, you wouldn't be you." "Can angels lie spine to spine?" Raheen wonders to herself. "If not, how they must envy us humans."<P>Raheen's and Karim's parents were once engaged to each other: her father to his mother, his father to her mother. There is a long buried secret, a family mystery, behind the fiancee swap - one that threatens to sever the magical bond that unites these young people as they become adults. <P>Filled with wry humor and wit, this is a novel about a friendship predestined to turn into love. The metaphor of maps and identity is embodied by the character of Karim, who wants to be a mapmaker, obsessed with finding the roots and meaning of geographical belonging. However, the author Kamila Shamsie also writes about Pakistan, political violence, and growing up rich and comfortable in a land that is always on the edge of riot and despair.<P>Ms. Shamsie writes a lyrical, impassioned narrative, lush with detail. Her novel is a love song, of sorts, to Karachi. Set against the backdrop of Pakistan's bloody civil war, it is a story of a country at war and of hearts at war, where the intricacies of love and intimacy are deftly explored. A superb novel!<BR>JANA</span>
