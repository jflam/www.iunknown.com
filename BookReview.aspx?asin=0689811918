                <span id="Label1">Yum! This delicious counting book offers much more than the numbers one to ten. Each page is a feast of sweet, sugary treats--coconut kisses, peanut-butter cookies, Linzer hearts, and more are carefully concocted and counted by mouse chefs. The tempting desserts are made all the more delectable by Robert Sabuda's brilliant pop-up constructions that leap from the pages, practically into your salivating mouth. Aesthetes will swoon at the magical beauty of this exquisite book, and the engineers in the crowd will wonder, "How did he <I>do</I> that?" Sabuda's astounding creations may be too delicate for excessive youthful probing, but the sing-song rhyme, counting exercises, and joyous paper explosions of confectionery delights make this a wondrous read-aloud for the sweet-toothed of all ages. <I>(Ages 3 and up)</I></span>

                    <span>We got this book as a Christmas gift last year. This pop-up book is like no other that I have seen. The children learn to count as they watch the paper come alive. The rhymes are easy to learn and my 3 year old daughter loves to say them as she turns the pages. Note: She is a very careful child, many children would tear the book as it is kind of delicate. She also counts the cookies and the hiding mice on each page. The colors are explosive and even I like reading this book over and over. I cannot even imagine how he gets paper to do the things that they do... cookies rotate, pinwheels rise out of the page and twirl, and a life sized gingerbread house magically climbs out of the book. I would highly recommend this book as long as they will not handle the book roughly. Better yet, read it with them and teach them to be gentle.</span>

                    <span>This is an amazing pop-up! It isn't for little fingers though. Lots of tantalizing papers to pull! However, seated on your lap, your child will adore the book. Mr. Sabuda has fabulous books, they are fantastic to look at. I have his butterly book also, and it is just as engaging.<BR>You will love to count cookies with your little one!</span>

                    <span>Toddler's love pop-up books so you cannot really go wrong with this book. Sometimes, however, the theatrics detract from a book's goal -- in this case to teach little guys and gals to count. Two other excellent books that I'd also like to recommend are "One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish" by Dr. Seuss and "One, Two, Three: This Book's for Me" by Stuart Samuel.</span>
