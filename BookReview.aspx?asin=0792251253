                <span id="Label1">Joseph Lemasolai Lekuton gives American kids a firsthand look at growing up in Kenya as a member of a tribe of nomads whose livelihood centers around the raising and grazing of cattle. Readers share Lekuton's first encounter with a lion, the epitome of bravery in the warrior tradition. They follow his mischievous antics as a young Maasai cattle herder, coming-of-age initiation, boarding school escapades, soccer success, and journey to America for college (where he was so worried about not eating with "proper" American manners that he went without food for four days). Lekuton's riveting text combines exotic details of nomadic life with the universal experiences and emotions of a growing boy. A full-color photo insert draws young readers deeper into this vibrant but rapidly disappearing culture.</span>

                    <span>Facing the Lion is a terrific read. For those that have dreamed of African success stories, this story tops them all. Mr. Lekuton has worked his way from the desert near Marsabit, Kenya to Langley School near Washington D.C. He is still a product of the environment he grew up in, but conversant with people in the top level of government in Kenya and the U.S. His story is an inspiration to all that worked in Africa for the Peace Corps or Non Governmental Organizations (NGO's) because it proves that out there in Africa there is much hope waiting to be found. I have a strong visual image of Joseph sitting across from Moi High School trying to figure out how he could get in, even with the entrance letter amoung his things. He is now a hero to all those secondary school children at Moi, a true African role model.<BR>In a time of uncertainty and despair, this book shines as a true<BR>beacon of the good things that can come from Africa. My hat is off to this Maasai and Harvard warrior.<P>Andy Hanson<BR>Aspen, Colo.</span>

                    <span>This book describes what it was like for Mr. Lekuton growing up as a nomad in Northern Kenya. In his world, the lions he faced were real animals! However, the book is applicable to American kids also, because the lion is really a metaphor for the challenges we all face in life. It is an inspiring, well-written book that lets everyone know that obstacles in life can be overcome! Mr. Lekuton grew up in a dung hut and ended up with a Master's degree from Harvard--that's an inspiration to all of us.</span>

                    <span>Until 3 years ago, Joseph Lekuton was the only person from my village to ever go to college. Today a small number of us whom he helped all through high school both financially and as a sole role model in the villages have something to smile on. Facing the Lion is a constant inspiration to me , it gives me the strength to take on every challenge. When College life becomes a lion to me, I reach for Facing The Lion ! Lekuton's journey is every nomadic child's journey the difference is that he had no one to look to but my agemates and I have a big picture in Joseph Lekuton and Facing the Lion is a living testimony that whatever you do today seeds the future .</span>

                    <span>As Trustee of a private foundation that supports projects in countries like Kenya in the developing world, I was particularly moved by Joseph's story. I have been to his part of the world. He truly represents that "Point of Light" we always hope will emerge. Joseph's message is a universal one. Success is measured by the quality of the person you become not how much you acquire in a material sense. You must look for opportunities, develop strong values, work hard and believe in yourself. With great humor and a flair for story telling, Joseph captures your imagination as you follow him through his adventurous rites of passage. It's a real page turner! I feel this book is destined to become a classic for all ages.</span>
