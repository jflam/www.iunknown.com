                <span id="Label1">   Advice about starting a business never sounded like this!  Beginning with "must be crazy," serial entrepreneur and angel investor Barry Moltz offers the true insider's scoop on new business start-ups.  With doses of irreverence and humor, the return-to-basics guide focuses on what comes before the bottom line.  Addressing passion-the ultimate  entrepreneurial fuel-relationships, failure, and authenticity, Moltz incorporates stories from his entrepreneurial colleagues and shows what it takes to integrate personal and professional life to achieve the highest satisfaction. <P>    Moltz describes the ups and downs and emotional trials of running a start-up business and invites readers to let go of the myths and expectations that can hamstring them emoitionally while getting their businesses up and running.  In a helpful, heartfelt, and often humorous way, Moltz reassures entrepreneurs that they are not alone-whatever their form of craziness-and that they can retain self-worth and sanity as they ride the start-up roller coaster.  <P>    Showcasing the varieties of new venture craziness, entrepreneurs at all ages and stages in their business-building processes will realize they too can succeed. Jolts of passionate entrepreneurial wisdom energize these anecdotes, with such ideas as: <BR> *  People-not capital-are the true currency. <BR> *  Passion keeps everything going. <BR> *  Relationships and authenticity are the drivers in           this business climate. <BR> *  There is no perfect idea and no magic bullet. <BR> *  Don't expect your path to be a straight line. <P>    Incorporating lessons from the boom and bust 1990s, the realignment of business and personal values in the wake of terrorism, and proven ways to nurture the human dimension  in business, these are voices to help all business owners find and trust their own entrepreneurial passions.  After all, says the author, "The worst they can do is eat you!"</span>

                    <span>For any one who is already an entrepreneur, this book will definitely be a trip down memory lane. For all budding entrepreneurs, this book should be a must read. 
<br />
<br />I only have a slight feel for entrepreneurship. I, along with a friend of mine, run a very small website, www.gmatclub.com for aspiring MBA students. I am nowhere close to the experiences of Barry and other reviewers, but i would still like to share my review with you.
<br />
<br />Central Idea: You need to be a little crazy to be an entreprenuer. note: not a successful entreprenuer, just an entreprenuer.
<br />
<br />What i learnt:  capital, passion, a great team , great leadership do not guarantee success, they just ensure that you have your best shot. Luck and timing are the two things that matter most for success. There couldnt be a better title for the book. If luck and timing are going to define your success, you indeed have to be a little crazy to start and most importantly succeed as an entrepreneur. It was a very humbling experience to read Mr. Barry Moltz's book. I am sure every entrepreneur goes through similar challenges and thats why have I have a lot of respect for what they do. Failure after failure after failure and you have to still come coming back. 
<br />
<br />He touches on simple yet important topics that no one else would probably care to talk about. I like the way he uses examples of other entrepreneurs. At the end of every chapter, he describes a true tale of an entrepreneur that serves to drive home the point he tries to make in the chapter.   
<br />
<br />It reminds me of the classic "grass greener on the other side" thing. Almost everyone i know has a should've/ could've/will thing about entrepreneurship. Its the ultimate dream. Do what you want to. hope that you go public or get acquired and rake in the millions. Uh-uh.. doesnt happen to everyone everytime. Its not a question of if you will fail, its a question of when you will fail. How you deal with failure will determine your future. Its moving to read about his experience and the trials that he goes through and thats where the title of the book starts to make sense. Putting yourself on the line and your family for fulfilling a dream that may or may not happen has to border on insanity. But then thats where your resolve and your courage is tested. He talks about how luck and timing has played a role and emphasizes the impact this can have on your start up and your day to day business. 
<br />
<br />Two things clearly make the job even more difficult
<br />
<br />1. Universal Truth #1 - Luck
<br />2. Universal Truth #2 - Timing 
<br />
<br />Barry emphasizes the importance of these two factors in the success of a startup. Suddenly all our ideals of passion, ethics and hardwork seem suspect and the playing field seems unfair. 
<br />
<br />Barry also talks about knowing when to give up. I am sure this is the toughest decision any person will take. Its not that winners dont quit, they know when to quit and how to quit. Very interesting. Barry, i loved the title : Forget Vince Lombardi, do you know when to quit. 
<br />
<br />The book is engrossing and is a wonderful read over and over again. </span>

                    <span>This book is one of the very few books out there that tells what it is really like to be an entrepreneur. It is well organized, full of pracitcal advice, and completely honest. Other books tend to focus on academic issues and treat the whole start up process as if you have lots of capital or assumed that you have an entire marketing team doing research for you. The reality is of course entirely different and this book tells you that very reality. This book is ideal for those who need someone to point out a lot of the risks involved in starting a business.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After reading so many glowing reviews here an Amazon, I bought this book. I began reading and quickly found myself wondering when the introductory comments would end and the book itself would begin. Then it dawned on me... the entire book is written as a relatively loose collection of thoughts. Ugh!
<br />
<br />I pressed on, hoping that some enlightenment might be found among all these scattered thoughts. On and on I went, far past the point of pain. I found myself reading with an oddly-placed determination that this book MUST have something more to it in order for it to have been so universally praised.
<br />
<br />Well, I've made it through roughly half of the pages, and that is more than enough for me. Reading this book is like sitting down to lunch with your manic-depressive uncle during his manic phase. Worse, he's just had his second latte' and can't seem to focus on a single topic for more than a couple of sentences. There appears to be little thought given to structure or construct, and the result is a hyperactive jog through the author's mind. Unfortunately, you quickly start to recognize the scenery as you are led in various ways through the same small plot, and ultimately you are led nowhere.
<br />
<br />To top it off, his experience actually seems quite narrow and brief. Thankfully, he relates the stories of a dozen other entrepreneurs, but these are too broad and anecdotal to provide much insight. The net result is a book of brief, common-sense admonishments.
<br />
<br />I've rarely been so disappointed in a book. How it has received so many good reviews is beyond me.</span>

                    <span>Barry Moltz, founder of three start-up companies, shares what he's learned about being an entrepreneur in "You Need To Be A Little Bit Crazy: The Truth About Starting And Growing Your Business."
<br />
<br />Moltz writes: "The reader should make no mistake; it is easier and in the long run more profitable to get a job than to start your own business. If you want to have your own business for the money, then forget it: go get a job. That motivation will never sustain you through the ups and downs of starting and building your business."
<br />
<br />Moltz describes himself as an entrepreneurholic and says entrepreneurship is a disease, a curse even. He also says the natural business world is indifferent to your success or failure. He says high-tech entrepreneurs need to forget the 1990's and need to learn how to "right-size" their dreams.
<br />
<br />Moltz writes: "Not every business that an entrepreneur starts must have $100 million in sales and go public. These are the unrealistic dreams that we artificially pumped into the veins of the start-up entrepreneurs in the 1990s....Plenty of wonderful companies never get beyond a few million dollars in sales. The owners of these businesses can live very financially successful and happy lives....Our dreams should be downsized to match what will make us happily successful. How do you right-size your dream? What will it take for you to feel like you have succeeded with your business? These individual benchmarks are important for you to find fulfillment in running your own business."
<br />
<br />"You Need To Be A Little Bit Crazy: The Truth About Starting And Growing Your Business" is realistic about the psychological ups and downs of running a business and the issues entrepreneurs face.
<br />
<br />Some of my favorite observations include:
<br />
<br />* "Your network is your life." While Moltz says that the business world is indifferent to your plight, your team members-family, friends, mentors-do care. So, you're not completely alone! Moltz says you should review your contact list every few months and contact people you haven't been in touch with for awhile. He says you need to meet face-to-face to cement relationships and that you must be proactive and take the initiative to get what you want from a relationship.
<br />
<br />* Work with people who you can trust and who you've worked with successfully in the past. Moltz says, "I could sell chairs if I were doing it with people I respected...who you are in business with is more important than what business you are in."
<br />
<br />* Don't look for the next big thing, whether it's the Internet, wireless technology, or nanotechnology. Moltz says, "Go out and find pain points for prospective customers that they will pay money to fix."
<br />
<br />* You don't know whether or not you'll be successful until you try to sell your idea to customers. Moltz says, "Primarily, I tell entrepreneurs to think for a short period of time, make a decision, and then do. The market will teach you more than you can ever learn from planning."
<br />
<br />"You Need To Be A Little Bit Crazy: The Truth About Starting And Growing Your Business" is a great read for entrepreneurs who are starting a business or who already own one.

                    <span>Set and manage your expectations with Barry Moltz's book.  
<br />
<br />If you have not started your business, just started out, or need a new approach to energize a struggling business, read "You Need To Be A Little Crazy".
<br />
<br />Barry shares his insights and experiences to help entrepreneurs navigate the crazy, perilous, rewarding journey of starting a small business.
<br />
<br />This book resonated with me at my core.  While confirming my "craziness" as a serial entrepreneur, Barry's work also reaffirmed and strengthened my driving passions.
<br />
<br />I plan to share many passages from this book with friends and family in the hopes that Barry's words will help them better understand who I am and why I do what I do.
<br />
<br />Thanks Barry!</span>
