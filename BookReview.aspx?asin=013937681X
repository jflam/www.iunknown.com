                    <span>This was my first book on UNIX in general, and I was extremely pleased with it. Kernighan and Pike provide a great introduction to UNIX. Topics covered include pipes, input/output redirection, sed & awk, UNIX system calls, lex and yacc, and much more. I reiterate: "Fantastic!"</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the cornerstones of the Unix philosophy.  "There's a philosophy?" I hear you ask. Ohhh yessss.  Unix gives you the tools to build whatever you want and asks only that you behave nicely, reading standard input and writing to stdout.  Problem is, the tools sometimes seem too small to get anything useful done.  What can you do with tiddlers like ls, cp and diff after all?<p>This book answers those concerns by a series of examples.  My favorite is the version control system implemented in diff.  Yes, it's dated, but the quality still shows.  I prefer to think of it as "old-school"; it shows just how much can be accomplished with talent and an understanding of the Unix Way.</span>

                    <span>This is the book I wish I had as an undergrad. I only purchased the book out of curiosity but was delighted with its content. If you are new to *nix programming then this book is a must! If this book demonstrates anything it reveals the true strength of Unix -- timeless. After all, the book was published in 1984. I always judge a technical book by its cover and this book is no exception (the less flashy the cover, the better the content). Eventually you'll need this book so you might as well buy it now.</span>

                    <span>Dated, yes. But that's the only weakness of this excellent book, which covers the philosophy and structure of userland in Unix, and it's not an important one -- nroff is still necessary for man pages, and life on the command line is something anyone dealing with a Unix box should get used to, whether the user is using a shell account on their local freenet or a cutting edge Athlon64 Linux PC or PowerMac G5. (Or even SCO, if you must.)<p>The tools covered are timeless ones -- make, lex, yacc, and others that are still important for software development some twenty-five to thirty years after they were first written. There's no networking, no Perl, and the shell language is ancient, but what's in there still works, with only minor changes to accomodate ANSI C (if you're using GCC, even that can be dispensed with using a compiler flag). The book also serves as an education in programming language design, working out a full programmable calculator system called hoc, and an introduction to the concept of toolsmithing. <p>This book and Kernighan's book Software Tools (coauthored with P.J. Plauger) provide a great education in how to build a computer system; there's a very good reason both books are still in print after many, many years when most computer books turn over editions every year or two. Whatever your Unix is -- Mac, Linux, Solaris, BSD, whatever -- take this book with you when you start hacking around on the command line. It's not everything you'll ever need to know, but it's one of the best to get you started.</span>

                    <span>In addition to providing a broad, albeit detailed introduction to UNIX, this book contains some of the most well-written and documented C code for students of the language. One chapter illustrates the construction of a simple calculator which gradually evolves into a stack-based virtual machine with a lex/yacc-based instruction set interpreter. The reader is guided through both the theory and practice of software design by demonstrating the almost "organic" growth of a complex software system out of a simpler one. <p>A definite must read.</span>
