                    <span>I've read all the previous reviews before writing my own, trying to provide a different view. 
<br />First, the story is interesting. For a change, it's the story of a dot-com that became a success. It provides some inside information about how paypal started. 
<br />However the book is in my opinion, not very well written - the author uses the same expressions over and over, which gets annoying.
<br />Something to know before buying this book is that the author is not a techie. This is important depending on the buyer's profile. As a software programmer, I know I would have been way more interested in the point of views of someone in the IT department.
<br />I'm sorry I'm not providing a deep book analysis but this has been done already by the previous reviewers, and I just wanted to  mention these things.</span>

                    <span>This inspiring story of a scrappy startup and its crack team is a must-read for entrepreneurs, business owners, and even PayPal's upper management of today.  Even as PayPal grew into a sizable company post-IPO, its irreverent and open culture kept innovation alive and overhead at a minimum, allowing its product development group to get features onto the site with as little notice as a couple weeks.  In the two years since the acqusition, eBay's corporate heavy-handedness has systematically ground down the innovative and spirited drive that kept PayPal one step of eBay through the war described in this book.  Product lifecycles are lengthening, defect rates grow as technology management short-sightedly cuts QA schedules (see their recent site outages), and strategy is micromanaged by uninformed executives instead of being delegated to those who know the marketplace and the technology.  The empowerment of their staff by Peter Thiel, David Sacks, and Max Levchin touted so often in this book is completely gone.  If the current trend continues, the eBay community can expect the same oblivious, clumsy decisions made by eBay during the PayPal wars (SYI, Checkout) to be made by the "new" PayPal, instead of real product innovations to help real people.
<br />
<br />Make no mistake - while PayPal and eBay's services are highly complementary, their cultures are very different.  This book shows how a vibrant, innovative, and merit-based culture emerged in PayPal through a trial by fire.  In contrast, eBay's market success was assured nearly from the beginning, making its executive staff lazy and complacent.  An inevitable network effect made eBay's expansion so easy that its management could rely on hamfisted corporate tactics to beat competitors - buying out Half.com, raising prices in response to Yahoo Auction's entrance into the arena - and developed a plodding, centrally-controlled product development process that made it utterly unable to compete with PayPal.  It's no surprise that PayPal's empowered team of intense, talented individuals beat them off time and time again.
<br />
<br />PayPal was once envisioned as great global currency liberator, but having been taking over by eBay, it is being shoehorned into just another mediocre business unit used to serve the auction giant's needs.</span>

                    <span>The ultimate Silicon Valley insider's look at a fascinating time in business, mostly between the end of the 'dot-com boom' and the advent of the New War. Should be must-reading at business school entrepreneurship classes and for startup executives. Slickly gripping the reader through plans for world domination and revolutionizing banking and financial institutions, "The PayPal Wars" is a captivating and entertaining read.

                    <span>Having read many newspaper and financial press accounts over the past several years about PayPal's challenges in the business world, I knew there had to be some interesting "inside  stories". I was  curious enough to buy  a copy of The Pay Pal Wars, fully expecting the book to read like a case study.    Boy, was I wrong.  I felt like I was reading an Indiana Jones novel!  There was adventure, excitement, intrigue, fast cars (thanks for properly referring to the Jag as an E-type!), and romance.  Every time a problem was solved, or an enemy neutralized, you could  sense an even greater challenge at the next turn.  Great writing style!!!
<br />
<br />Does it get any better than that?  It does, because of the content. While being entertained, you are hearing, from an inside source, the story of very successful dot-com company, from inception, to an established profitable company. One could not imagine the scope of challenges that this organization faced.   That's an exceptional story in itself.  Definitely a Five Star endeavor.

                    <span>This book revives the Internet era pandemonium of which everybody wanted a piece, and the book fondly brought me back to those exciting times.  An easy and interesting read providing an insider perspective of the real trials and tribulations of a company that went from start-up to mammoth.  For a person like myself who only observed the Internet boom and did not actively participate, PayPal Wars was intriguing from start to finish.  I would recommend it to any reader.</span>
