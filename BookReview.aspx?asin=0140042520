                <span id="Label1">One of the best and most popular of Kerouac's autobiographical novels, <i>The Dharma Bums</i> is based on experiences the writer had during the mid-1950s while living in California, after he'd become interested in Buddhism's spiritual mode of understanding. One of the book's main characters, Japhy Ryder, is based on the real poet Gary Snyder, who was a close friend and whose interest in Buddhism influenced Kerouac. This book is a must-read for any serious Kerouac fan.</span>

                    <span>     The Dharma Bums, by Jack Kerouac, follows Ray Smith, a character based on Kerouac himself, through an amazing physical and spiritual journey. In the story, Smith meets Japhy Ryder, an eccentric mountaineer who is fascinated by Eastern literature and religion. Japhy inspires Smith to begin his career as a meditating, rucksack-wielding `Zen Lunatic'. Smith is led to a deeper understanding of his Buddhist faith through scaling mountains, sleeping in silent deserts, and meditating for hours on end deep in the woods. He travels all over the United States, meeting innumerable different characters as he goes and learning more and more about the truths of existence itself.
<br />	What shines through in The Dharma Bums isn't so much the plot of the story, but the way in which the story is told. Jack Kerouac has a knack for making the ordinary seem extraordinary, and impressing upon the reader how something seemingly mundane could impact him in a profound way. The narrative has a wide-eyed romance about it, making every experience Ray Smith has seem new and fresh. People, places, and events in the book are described with a prose that is practically poetry, painting a vivid picture in the reader's mind. In reading The Dharma Bums, I wasn't concerned as much with what happened as I was with how it happened.
<br />	The Dharma Bums isn't a book that everyone would enjoy. Some would find it pointless or long-winded, or difficult to read. For someone who likes a lot of description and feeling in a book, however, I strongly recommend it. This book is also a necessity for any enthusiast of Beat literature, and even those interested in Buddhism would appreciate it as a serious philosophical work. To anyone else, The Dharma Bums is bound to add inspiration, excitement, and a new perspective to any open mind.

<br />Man, I don't know where to start. "The Dharma Bums" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year.
<br />
<br />Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature.
<br />
<br />Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem "Wail", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of "Howl", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic. 
<br />
<br />While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. "The Dharma Bums" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again.

                    <span>I think that The Dharma Bums is probably Kerouac's best novel. It has all the exitement and electricity of On the Road, plus a lot of Buddhist instrospection and meditation. This is Kerouac at his best. He had mastered his craft, and had yet to slip into alcoholism and self destruction. In fact Kerouac does have a sweetness and innocence and a love of life, of nature, of dharma; and it makes me sad to think of what became of him later. One might get the wrong idea about Buddhism. Kerouac and his buddies spend a lot of time drinking wine and smoking tea which really doesn't go very well with Buddhist practice. But they were truly pioneers as there were very few Buddhist teachers and no Buddhist practice centers in the US. They either had to invent their own form of Buddhism (as Kerouac did) or go to Asia. One thing this book has in common with On the Road is that it does involve a lot of travel. He journeys northward from southern California to San Francisco in a boxcar. Then travels across country to stay with his sister in North Carolina where he meditates and prays in the woods. And the book closes with a journey north to Washington state instead of south the Mexico as On The Road does. Instead of Neal Cassady we have Gary Snyder as Kerouac's friend. Finally, after a series of adventures in the bay area and on a back packing trip with a character whom I believe is based on Kerouac's friend Philip Whalen, Snyder departs for a zen monestary in Japan (he wouldn't return from Asia until the mid sixties and the two friends never saw each other again). Its a bit ironic that Allen Ginsburg (Goldberg in the novel) was initially skeptical of the Buddhist teachings but later became more devoted to it than Kerouac, becoming a diciple of the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa. Whalen became a zen priest and lived for years at the San Francisco Zen Center. But this was Kerouac at his peak. His most blissful and holy. His golden dream of life in the Buddhalands.</span>

                    <span>  Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his youthful days as an ebullient Zen Buddhist and rucksack hitchhiker in the 60's. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in a shack in Berkley, CA with his good friend Alvah Goldbook. Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the wilderness of Central California where they recite poetry, drink wine, meditate, make haikus about every natural object, while trying to find themselves and seek the true meaning of life as beatniks. Ray Smith also criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to Berkeley. While at home he wanders through forest time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, meditating there through the cold months like a real Buddhist Monk.
<br />
<br />  I was surely impressed by this book. I even jotted down many meaningful Buddhist passages and quotes that Kerouac mentioned in the novel This work of literature by Kerouac is less "experimental" in literary terms compared to something like "Satori in Paris" by Kerouac. For those of you who have not had any past experience with Kerouac's writing style this will not be of any difficulty. The language is simple, the prose is right to the point, and there is hardly a bit of surrealism. Many of the sections are quite humorous because of the quirkiness and new ideas on Buddhism that are slipped in between the sentences, along with predictable scenes of the beatnik life hood (drug use and slang). Ray Smith purely goes about making light comments about life without being the author's speaker. This is a positive and heart fulfilling youthful adventure that displays immense compassion.</span>

                    <span>Jack Kerouac is every wanderers' fantasy author. A man who spent many years traversing the country back and forth, living virtually hand to mouth most of the time...sleeping under the stars, practicing yoga in the woods on a winter's night...there isn't much in his works to not set afire the heart of a drifter.
<br />
<br />Though this novel has a lesser 'landscape' than On The Road, Dharma Bums is every bit as much of a journey for the author. At a time when one of his close friends had influenced his interest in Buddhism, Kerouac criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to California.  While home, he wanders to the woods time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, and stays on through the cold months. 
<br />
<br />Eventually, the thought of his friends and free-wheeling existence in California draw him back, where he finds some changes to the people he left there, but ever the chameleon, Ray Smith (Kerouac) assimilates himself back into the hive of Beats he holds dear.
<br />
<br />Kerouac's writings especially appeal to the 'adventurer boy' I left behind when adulthood called. Though some might call Kerouac's existence rootless and irresponsible...there is something magnetic (to me) about the way he lived, at least how it is detailed in his body of autobiographical literature. And though I know his own personal demons are only partially displayed in his books....I still want to be Jack Kerouac when I grow up.
<br />
<br />Dharma Bums is highly recommended as either an introduction or a continuation of reading this exceptional author.</span>
