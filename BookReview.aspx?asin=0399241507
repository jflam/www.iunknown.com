<br />
<br />      He knew he was small but that didn't stop Danny Walker in the book Travel Team by Mike Lupica.  I would suggest this book to all basketball fans.  Travel Team takes place in Middletown with Danny having trouble with two travel teams.  One will accept him and the other one will not let him because of his height.  The coach of his team is his dad, Richie, some of his friends on his team are Ty Ross and Will and Mr. Ross, the coach of the other team.
<br />      Mike Lupica in addition wrote Red Zone and Wild Pitch.  The Theme is height doesn't matter at all.  The weak point is the Email on the Internet, it gets confusing after awhile.  On the other hand the strong point is about the Email on the Internet because it tells you information about what's going on in the book and key events.  I would encourage my friends to read this because most of my friends like basketball.  Do you wonder if Mr. Ross learned his lesson that size and height doesn't matter and everybody's big in one place?

                    <span>I got this book around Christmas with a gift certificate.  The teaser made it sound worth while, but I never expected what I got.  I started reading it and started learning around Danny, a seventh grader who doesn't make the city's travel team because he's too short.  I started getting mezmorized by this book and got addicted.  I started reading chapters at a time, and learned about other charachters and storylines.  This is a great book full of many twists and turns!!!</span>

<br />Size doesn't matter, at least not to Danny Walker. He is the son of Richie Walker, a former NBA star. Richie washed the NBA out of his life after a car accident. Danny is the main character in Travel Team by Mike Lupica. Danny remembers when the "clipboard dads" would ask if he was in the right age group because he was so short. Danny knows one thing the coaches don't: you can't measure heart.
<br />
<br />	Danny from Middletown, NY tried out for the school basketball travel team. Later he found out he didn't make the team because he was too short.
<br />Richie Walker decided to make a basketball team with the kids who got cut for the wrong reasons. At tryouts only 8 kids showed up. The first practice was horrible. They lost a few of their games. Do you think they will successfully make it on ESPN like Richie did to his team as a kid?
<br />
<br />	One game against the school team the Vikings, Danny was blocking a kid named Teddy Moran. Danny accidentally bumped into Teddy. Then Teddy bumped into Danny's friend Ty. Ty fell to the floor and broke his wrist. Ty couldn't play any more. Danny felt guilty because he hit Teddy who hit Ty.
<br />
<br />	My grandma got this book for me for Christmas because she was watching Imas in the Morning and they were talking about it. The part that hooked me in was the summary of the inside flap. What Mike was saying about Danny just was amazing.
<br />
<br />	I especially recommend this book to people who like basketball
<br />or like reading about basketball. I also recommend this to anyone who's been in his situation because you might understand the book a little better.

                    <span>The book Travel Team hasn't won an award, but in my opinion it should have! Travel Team, by Mike Lupica, is a fiction book, but many people including myself, can relate to it very well. It is a basketball story that has a bit of drama and a touch of suspense. Those two things and many more writing abilities makes this one superb book!
<br />
<br />Danny is in 7th grade and has a huge roll to play. His father was the star point guard on the 7th grade travel team when he was younger. He also played college ball at Syracuse, but injured his hip early in his N.B.A. career. Now, Danny, who is very short, is expected to take after his dad. He does just about that up until the night after tryouts for the 7th grade travel team. He gets a phone call from the coach saying that he didn't make the team because of his size. After hearing Danny say that he's quitting basketball for life, Danny's dad, Richy, decides to start a second travel team. The only problem is that Danny is the only decent player!
<br />
<br />Mike Lupica does a pretty good job of using his writing skills. His sentences flow wonderfully which makes this an easy book to read aloud. Mike Lupica doesn't use many describing words, but each sentence is unique and powerful. As you read the book, you can tell that Lupica really knows the life of a twelve year boy. 
<br />
<br />Travel Team is easy to read and follow, but I would recommend it to 5th to 7th graders, and some adults, because of some mild language. If you enjoy basketball,  this is the book for you! If you enjoy this book than you might like the books by Matt Christopher, they are fiction sport books, too. This book is awesome and I defiantly recommend it to you!</span>
