                    <span>This film encyclopedia is great for looking up people. I keep it next to the TV. When "The Deadly Mantis" (1957) ASIN: 6302763916 came on I looked up William Alland. I knew he also produced "It Came From Outer Space" (1953) ASIN: 6303046436. What I did not know was that he was a stage manager for Orson Welles's Mercury Theater.<P>This book is like "Connections." You can follow the producers and actors.<P>What you can not do is follow the films. The title on this book is misleading It should be "The Actor and Producer Encyclopedia." You still need Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide ISBN: 0452281237 to find the person to look up in this book. sorry for the four stars but there is not even an index.</span>

                    <span>Since its original publication, I have used this book both as a movie lover and as a writer. As a movie lover, it's a never-failing source of obscure information. Can't remember the name of the movie, and only remember its star? You'll find the answer here. Want to know what a grip does? Looking to discover how many films were made by Howard Hawks or Howard Hughes? What's a dolly? What's a key light? The answers to some of the most obscure questions about moviemaking reside in this brilliant compilation of facts about films and the people who make them--everyone from the best boy to the stars. As a research resource, it's invaluable. To satisfy that nagging question about some film you saw with James Cagney, get the Film Encyclopedia. Next to the Cinebooks Library, this is the single most important book to own. Nothing before it and nothing after it will ever contain a similar wealth of information. This is a must-have volume.</span>

                    <span>Good book if you like classic movies. If part of your interests are focused from the 80's up to the present, forget about it. The writer died years ago, and nobody updated the book.</span>

                    <span>I wish it were possible to give this book more than five stars.<P>For precise, copious, detailed information on actors, film makers, and general technical questions this is the place to go. For the most part, this is a biographical dictionary. However, in addition to the 6700 biographies of actors, directors, producers, screenwriters, cameramen, etc., there are also about 1000 articles devoted to technical aspects of film making as well as to short histories of the various national cinemas. Each biographical article also includes, in almost all cases, a complete list of the feature films and shorts to which that individual contributed. Those cases where the list is not complete are usually for actors and film makers from the days of silent films, when accurate and complete recordkeeping was not common. Most silent films, sadly, have been lost anyway. <P>The articles in this book, in contrast to those in the not recommended "Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies," are long and detailed. It would be hard to ask for more. I sometimes spend hours pouring over this book. <P>This is the book that should be on the shelf of every serious cinephile. For quick looks, "Leonard Maltin's Encyclopedia of the Movies" is valuable as well, though it needs to be brought up to date. And for a different point of view on almost everyone associated with film, David Thomson's "New Biographical Dictionary of Film" is a pure delight. But if you must have one book on film, Katz is it.</span>
