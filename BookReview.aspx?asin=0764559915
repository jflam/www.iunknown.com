                    <span>I originally thought about entitling this review "Don't Buy This Book1". Why? Because the last thing I need is more organized competition on eBay. This book takes you from the beginner's level to the pro level by giving you tips that would take you years to learn on your own. I know, you think that eBay is only a hobby. But do you like throwing away money? If you do get out of the business. Ebay is a business and you are in business to make money and this book shows you how to make money. No this isn't a "Get Rich Quick" book. It is comprised of over 60 timesaving tips that will do nothing more then save you time and make your bottom line much better. What more can you ask for from a book?
<br />
<br />Just don't tell too many of your "competitors" about this book. After all, why should they benefit from your being smart enough to buy this book.</span>

                    <span>man, i been on the ebay since 1998 buying , selling. i though i knew it all , i was wrong. i keep getting back chapter by chapter hoping to see if i miss something .the book is full of highlight and note on it now, you can't read my book if you are going to see it, it full of hightlight and note everywhere. this book is full of knowledge and practical advise from someone who dedicated on ebay subject ,specially advance e-bayer.
<br />I enjoy it and not planning to put in the shelves after i read, it will be my bible on e-bay, the book will be a guide for me just like a Coach walking side by side with me.

                    <span>BEING A TITANIUM POWERSELLER SINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED ON EBAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, I WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I READ THIS. BOOKS ABOUT EBAY NORMALLY DON'T BEAR SUCH AN AMOUNT OF DEDICATED AND PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH, AND THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT OF MUCH INTEREST TO ADVANCED EBAY SELLERS. THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT: I FOUND HINTS, TRICKS AND ADVICE COMPLETELY NEW TO ME. AND I HAVE BEEN SELLING ON EBAY FOR SEVEN YEARS!</span>

                    <span>I have bought quite a few books and have read the discussion boards. I even attended eBay University. Everything I have done has provided me with a few tidbits to help me be a more savy seller but Marsha's book has so far been the biggest help to me so far! The price is well worth it, think of it as an investment for your business. Her writing style keeps you reading and the tips and bullets are filled with great pieces of information. There is no true formula for selling, it is a volatile market, Marsha's book helps you keep that in perspective but she does give you many of the tools you will need to tap into the buyer's wallets! </span>

                    <span>I'm very impressed with this book. I've been selling on eBay for five years and thought I knew everything there was to know about selling on eBay. I stumbled across the book at Border's and said to myself, "there can't be anything in here I don't already know about...".<p>Wrong.<p>What an incredible resource. I've already used more than just a few of these tips. Not only is my business more efficient, I'm taking advantage of new things on eBay I didn't know about, and I have more time for myself!<p>While I don't consider myself a "Dummy", I sure learned a lot. I really like the detailed Table of Contents, the plentiful illustrations and clearly written and friendly style of the text. It reads very well, not like your usual "how to" or reference guide.<p>Two Thumbs Up.</span>
