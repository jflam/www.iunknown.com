                    <span>Not a great book, but a very important one. I first read _Betrayers_ in graduate school, when I was still innocent and naive, believing that no scientist would ever compromise her reputation by any form of intellectual  dishonesty.  Further, I believed that anyone who did would inevitably be  found out--that's how the scientific method works, right?  Reading this  book has made me much more skeptical of claims that seem to be  revolutionary, a change in my attitude toward science that has proven  valuable more than once.  This is a book that should be required reading  for graduate students (and possibly undergraduates) in science fields.   Every scientist has been tempted to write things down the way they should  be instead of the way they really are, to "fudge" data or present  results in the best light. The pressure of a professor, granting agency or  tenure committee breathing down your neck may make the temptation to  produce results at any cost much worse.  Knowing the stories presented in  _Betrayers of the Truth_ has made it easier for me to be scrupulously  honest in my records of my work and to avoid even the most innocent forms  of scientific dishonesty.<p>I'd like to see a new edition of this, with  coherent beginning-to-end coverage of some of the high-profile cases that  have surfaced in the years since its original publication.  Younger  scientists may have a hard time piecing together a complete story from the  fragments of coverage in the news and in trade magazines.</span>

                    <span>One of the best references showing controversies concerning the analysis and presentation of scientific data. From Pilttown man to Millikan case a wide variety of topics related to scientific fraud and deceit. The best  introductory survey on the subject of scientific dishonesty.The main point  is that we need more precise descriptions of the moral failings involved in  cases of fabrication and falsification if we are to understand the causes  of these defections and betrayals. The book is carefully researched and  contains a wealth of material about fraud and deceit in science.</span>
