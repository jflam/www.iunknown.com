                <span id="Label1">Newbery Medal-winning author Jerry Spinelli (<I>Maniac McGee</I>, <I>Stargirl</I>) paints a vivid picture of the streets of the Nazi-occupied Warsaw during World War II, as seen through the eyes of a curious, kind, heartbreakingly na&#239;ve orphan with many names. His name is Stopthief when people shout "Stop! Thief!" as he flees with stolen bread. Or it's Jew, "filthy son of Abraham," depending on who's talking to him. Or, maybe he's a Gypsy, because his eyes are black, his skin is dark, and he wears a mysterious yellow stone around his neck. His new friend and protector Uri forces him to take the name Misha Pilsudski and to memorize a made-up story about his Gypsy background so that no one will mistake him for a Jew and kill him. Misha, a very young boy, is slow to understand what's happening around him. When he sees people running, he thinks it's a race. Nazis (Jackboots, as the children call them) marching through the streets appear to him as a delightful parade of magnificent boots. He wants to be a Jackboot! (Uri smacks him for saying this.) He compares bombs to sauerkraut kettles, machine guns to praying mantises, and tanks to "colossal gray long-snouted beetles." The story of Misha and his band of orphans trying to survive on their own would have a deliciously Dickensian quality, if it weren't for the devastation around them--people hurrying to dig trenches to stop Nazi tanks, shops exploding in flames, the wailing of sirens, buzzing airplanes, bombs, and human torture. Spinelli has written a powerfully moving story of survival--readers will love Misha the dreamer and his wonderfully poetic observations of the world around him, his instinct to befriend a Jewish girl and her family, his impulse to steal food for a local orphanage and his friends in the ghetto, and his ability to delight in small things even surrounded by the horror of the Holocaust. A remarkable achievement. (Ages 11 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>Jerry Spinelli has once again written a powerfully moving story in his latest book, Milkweed. This story about a young, slightly stupid, Jew is well written (even though it's in Dick and Jane style) and powerful. The main character, a boy called Misha, is niave to the destruction and persecution the Holocaust is causing, and doesn't even know his name. I think this story is like Aladin in some ways, because of the poverty and problems, and like the Diary of Anne Frank because of the horrible way they treat the Jews. I reccomend this novel to people who like a good read.</span>

                    <span>Hi, I am in 7th grade, and Milkweed was one of the best books I have ever read! Misha, who is the main character of the book, befriends another boy named Uri, and together they survive in the streets of Warsaw, Poland. Their life would have been fine, but the Holocaust had begun and Misha was forced into a ghetto, where he was crowded together with other orphans, Jews, and gypsies. While in the ghetto many people starved and died. Misha and his friends go through many hardships and injustices, but in the end Misha survives the Holocaust, and at an old age finally finds a true home. <BR> I thought this book was really good, although very sad, and I felt the ending was a little rushed, but all in all I thought that it was a well- written book, and I enjoyed it a great deal. Jerry Spinelli put in enough gruesome, and saddening details about the Holocaust to make you feel sad, but unlike some other Holocaust books they do not make you feel nauseous and queasy. It is definitely the type of book you can't put down, this is probably because of the main character, Misha. Misha is not a very smart boy, and he makes you want to scream in his ear and tell him what to do. As Misha learns about the world around him, you, the reader, also learn about the Holocaust and its cruelties. Because you only learn what Misha learns, you sometimes feel a little held back, but this only makes you want to keep reading even more. Jerry Spinelli also writes the book in an interesting format. He has lots of short, and strange- sized sentences. These, I believe, help give you the real image and feel of the book, although sometimes they do seem a little out of place. Milkweed was a fantastic book, and I recommend it to people of all ages!</span>

                    <span>Milkweed is about Misha, an orphan living on the streets of Nazi-occupied Warsaw. The whole story is through his humble eyes as he steals, befriends a group of boys and gets a family. How he always escapes the fearful Flops and Jackboots. How he gets his ear shot. How every night, he enters homes and shops and innocently steals food. How he is sadly separated from his "sister" finally one day. This enchanting story weaves to what happens after the holocaust as well. <P>Milkweed has fascinating details from the Holocaust and Misha's life is described brilliantly. You feel as though you are right there, next to Misha, running beside him as he escapes from the Jackboots, crawling behind him through the two-brick hole in the wall, from beginning to end. The characterizing is done very vividly; you can visualize every character instantly! The style of writing is also so unique and captivating! Once you start this book, it's just too hard to put it down! Milkweed is another classic from the great author of Crash, Loser, Maniac Magee and Stargirl. Two thumbs up!</span>

                    <span>My teacher assigned us 2 books relating to the Holocaust to read, and I couldn't be happier that I got Milkweed.Milkweed is a wonderfully dramatic novel that's unique writing style makes it an astounding addition to realm of Holocaust literature. Through the eyes of a young naive boy we see a child's perspective of reality in this horrific time. Jerry Spinelli creates a sense of realism within the book with a bold cast of characters that really get you hooked. The beginning is strong; superbly enthralling, as is the entire book. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone interested in a different view of the Holocaust. ;)</span>

                    <span>I thought it was a good book because it is an interesting story of a boy who does not know anything about himself during the period of the WWII holocaust. Misha the main character.has no idea where he came from or what his name is. He is befriended by a group of Jewish orphans who steal food for a living. After a while he meets a little Jewish girl, named Janina. When her family is forced to move to the ghetto, Misha goes to live with them. Just as everyone is starving, there are deportations (to the concentration camps but the Jews don't know where they are going) Janina is taken to the concentration camps, but Misha escapes to America, to tell his story. <BR>I liked this novel very much, because it told a story that is still in some existence today, racism. The Holocaust is no longer a problem for Jews and gypsies today, but they still face some discrimination. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with strong characters. Several emotions I experienced are, anger, sadness, happiness, excitement and relief. This is a very well written novel because the novel is written because it is told in the perspective of a little boy who is clueless to what is happening in the time period.</span>
