                    <span>Just retired and this book answered alot of questions.  I always felt that I could manage my investments by myself in retirement.  This book makes me realize that I may eventually have to go to a financial planner for help.</span>

                    <span>As a financial advisor, I've personally purchased over 100 books to give to my retired clients as gifts.  They love it.  This book is an excellent guide to retirement finance.  It covers almost every concern known to any  retiree, for example--how much of your portfolio should be used for income?   Their logic and reasoning makes it simple for anyone to understand the  economics of living off your portfolio during retirement.  The case studies  are great--real life examples of life changing financial decisions.  Thank  you Ron and Murray for such a wonderful gift of your knowledge.</span>

                    <span>Once I started reading this book I realized how much thought has to go into the retirement proccess. This book starts you off in the right place and takes you through the proccess in exactly the right order. I found the  book very easy to comprehend and the charts were very helpfull to  illustrate the points that were being made. I have read other books on the  subject of retirement and I found that this book is very comprehensive and  easy to follow.</span>
