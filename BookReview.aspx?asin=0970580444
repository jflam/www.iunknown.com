                    <span>Good book. Could be better. Growing up in Philly as a die hard baseball fan I am dissapointed with the lack of information on the Athletics. Whether they left town 50 years ago or not, they are the city's most successful sports franchise. Period. </span>

                    <span>As a life long Eagles, Flyers, Phillies, and Sixers fan I felt this book was a must read, and if you too are a lifelong Philadelphia everything fan you too should read it.  The only thing that I found dissapointing was the complete and total pessimism, which I should expect considering at least one of the authors worked for WIP.  I understand that Philly fans are tired of losing, but sometimes (just as they do on the radio) they make it seem like Philadelphia is doomed when in fact the teams just never seem to be quite good enough.  I'll stop giving my opinions on Philly sports now and let you know that if you are a Philly fan, you absolutely have to read this book.  I'm 23, so i remember some of the stories such as the 93 phils, the Buddy Ryan era, and more recently the Sixers Eastern Conference Championship run.  Some of the older stories were interesting for me to read as well, especially the chapter on the Broad Street Bullies.</span>

                    <span>No book has ever dared to delve so deep into the unyielding heart of a Philadelphia sports fan than The Great Philadelphia Fan Book.  Anthony Gargano and Glen MacNow, staples of Philadelphia's sports radio WIP and the city's sports scene itself took on the task and produced a gritty work of art.
<br />I loved the book's humor, it's intensity, and its unflinching look at what it means to be a sports fan in Philadelphia. What it means to be a sports fan period.
<br />From Buddy Ryan to Rich Kotite; from the Broad Street Bullies to the overblown snowballing of Santa Claus incident (Which I read over and over again and laugh aloud each time), this book covers it all.
<br />This book is a Must-Have for anyone who has ever screamed their hearts out for their team.
<br />
<br />This book has it all.

                    <span>I live in the Philadelphia area, but am not a native to Philadelphia.   I grew up in New York and when I moved south, I adopted Philadelphia as my "home metropolitian area".   I have really come to appreciate and love Philadelphia as a city.   There are two things I love about Philadelphia:  1) No city in America is as entrenched deep in its traditions as Philadelphia;  2) When you love the City, it will love you back twofold.   When it comes to Sports, the tradition and love of the city is there among the fans.  When I saw this book, I said to myself - here is the first book that explains tradition and love of the city and explains it well.<p>The book is written by two of the most knowledgable Sports journalists in the Philadelphia region - Glen Macnow and Anthony Gargano.  For several years these authors were co-hosts of a lunchtime radio show on the local sports radio station.  Macnow and Gargano come from completely opposite backgrounds, but they have an incredible chemistry together.   Glen Macnow is from Buffalo, NY and is a transplant to the Philadelphia region.  He lives in the suburbs and sometimes has the nickname "The Professor" for his studius approach to Sports.   Anthony Gargano is a native Philadelphian.  He was born in South Philadelphia, moved out of town to cover Sports in Chicago and New York, then came back to Center City.   Gargano is nicknamed "The Cuz" and is Philadelphia through and through.   He has a less studius approach to sports and is much more from the fan perspective.   The styles and backgrounds of Macnow and Gargano meshed beautifully on the radio and in this book the mesh just as well.<p>So this book attempts to explain a lot of those traditions that exist in Philadelphia as well as chronicle the Philadelphia fans' highs and lows.   What is nice about this book is it is broken down into chapters that each read like a feature article.  Therefore you can pick up this book and read it at your leisure.  Each chapter is devoted to a topic related to Philadelphia sports.   You don't have to read the chapters in order.  It also is the kind of book where you might find a topic you like and wouldn't mind reading the chapter over again.  It also can even serve as a quasi-reference book for Philadelphia sports.<p>There should be a topic for everyone in this book.  Here are some of the highlights of what is covered:<br>-Origin of the Philadelphia "Boobirds"<br>-The real story behind Santa Claus getting pelted with snowballs<br>-The Broad Street Bullies - The Philadelphia Flyers<br>-Kate Smith - the celebrated vocalist who sang "God Bless America" at Flyers Games<br>-The rivalry of Philadelphia and the Dallas Cowboys<br>-A chapter of lists of such as "Tough Guys", "Classy Guys", "Ugly Guys", Famous Brothers who played here, etc<br>-The Love/Hate Relationship of Buddy Ryan<br>-The Origins behind "Wing Bowl" - a Philadelphia tradition<br>-Julius Erving<br>-Players who Philadelphia fans loved to hate<p>-Mike Schmidt<br>-An interesting chapter on the Eric Lindros, Charles Barkley, and Randall Cunningham era<br>-1993 Phillies<br>-Embarrassing Moments in Philadelphia Sports (includes a bit on Rich Kotite's laminated playsheet getting wet)<br>-Veterans Stadium<br>-The Great Announcers of Philadelphia<br>-Ed Rendell (Former Mayor of Philadelphia and Current Governor of Pennsylvania) - huge sports fan<br>-Several Chapters on Great Philadelphia Sports Moments<p>There is lots more in this book, but I would use up my limit for this review.  Many of the stories of the folklore of Philadelphia sports are also embedded in these chapters and can easily be found in the index.<p>I would have liked to have seen whole chapters dedicated to things such as the USPRO Cycling Championships (a huge Philadelphia tradition that is omitted), something on the Philadelphia phantoms (minor league hockey), and the love to hate relationship with Howard Eskin (not even mentioned).  I would have liked to see chapters on Wilt Chamberlain and Joe Frazier, but these were before the author's time.  In general Boxing isn't really covered much in the book, and I would have liked to see something on the 'Rocky' films.  Despite these missing items, it doesn't hurt the book.<p>This book is a winner.  Whether you are a native Philadelphian,  transplanted Philadelphian, adopted Philadelphian, or non Philadelphian - this book will offer something for everybody.  I enjoy having it on my shelf and never get tired of reading it.</span>
