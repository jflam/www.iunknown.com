                <span id="Label1">Francie Nolan, avid reader, penny-candy connoisseur, and adroit  observer of human nature, has much to ponder in colorful, turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. She grows up with a sweet, tragic father, a severely realistic mother, and an aunt who gives her love too freely--to men, and to a brother who will always be the favored child. Francie learns early the meaning of hunger and the value of a penny. She is her father's child--romantic and hungry for beauty. But she is her mother's child, too--deeply practical and in constant need of truth. Like the Tree of Heaven that grows out of cement or through cellar gratings, resourceful Francie struggles against all odds to survive and thrive. Betty Smith's poignant, honest novel created a big stir when it was first published over 50 years ago. Her frank writing about life's squalor was alarming to some of the more genteel society, but the book's humor and pathos ensured its place in the realm of classics--and in the hearts of readers, young and old. (Ages 10 and older) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>I first read this book about five years ago while I was still in high school and I still find myself loving it just as much today. This is a great example of a coming of age book. Its a short read which makes it great for younger readers. But just because its short doesnt mean that there are not so many messages to take from this book. You see Francie grow from a nieve child to an educated adult. You sit with her as she suffers the heart ache that often hits us all at some point in life and show that life must go on. With so many books becoming a staple in high school education I find myself wondering how this book is not one of them. Showing that we all have it inside us to make it even under the worst of circumstances. A prime example of how the smallest seed can still manage to bloom into one of the greatest flowers.</span>

                    <span>I read this book when I was barely a teen, and now 7 years later, I'm still loving this book.  Brings to life the world of a family growing in the 1910s.  The novel provides a critical view of class relations, without moralizing the actions of the main characters.  The novel, one might say, claims only to paint a portrait of a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn before WWI.  While I cannot attest to the novel's authenticity in representation of the lifestyle of people in that neighborhood during that time period, I would argue that Smith opens a window to another world, and leaves the reader emotionally attached to Francie and her story.  I must admit this novel caused a tear to fall down my cheek more than once.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.  It is a wonderful bildungsroman (coming of age story) about a girl growing up in the city.  Her father is a loving drunk but her mother is a hard working woman who encourages her children to work at everything they do.  I really enjoy this book and read it every couple of years.  Definetly worth the time it takes to read it--- wonderful story.</span>

                    <span>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my "to read" list since girlhood, but I never got around to it, until this week, at age 29.  Now I almost cannot believe I lived so long without reading it.  Smith's novel is a written masterpiece of storytelling, characterization, and narration.  Never have I so longed to be back in college with a professor and fellow English majors, to be sure I hadn't overlooked a single morsel of a book.  Though Smith writes in the third person, it IS "Francie's book" and the narrator describes the world beautifully through her eyes.  Over and over, a single, simple sentence expressing a fleeting, naive thought by young Francie manages to make more of a poignant and sometimes humorous social commentary than what other authors might take entire chapters to describe.  As Francie grows, so does the narration-- becoming more direct, less naive, and more self-aware.  Francie is one of the most lovingly drawn and memorable characters I've ever encountered-- she is a timeless picture of every curious young girl who has ever grown up in a poor family, dreaming of more, working hard in school and writing her way to a better life.  A century later, I know that I was that girl, and thousands of other women over time have been "that girl," yet Francie manages at the same time to be both every-girl and a unique little jewel all her own.  Smith's book not only provides an intriguing description of life of the American urban poor at the turn of the century, but also grapples with social issues still existing in modern America.  This is a book to be read over and over; even while reading it, I was aware of how much I was missing by not pausing to relish and deconstruct particular passages.  However, it is also a novel so well-written and so packed with life that it deserves to be savored between readings.  So, as I finished the book, I had to stop myself from turning back to page 1 and starting again-- at least for a while.  </span>

                    <span>I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!</span>
