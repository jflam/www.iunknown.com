                    <span>This book is an anthology of some (though not all) of the columns the late Hunter S. Thompson wrote for ESPN's website. In theory, these were supposed to be sports columns. In practice, these are about gambling, drinking, and politics - exactly what we really want from HST. While usually lauded as an example of "New Journalism" or dismissed as liberal propaganda, HST was really a bitingly funny satrical essayist with strong libertarian leanings. He roasts Al Gore without mercy and damns Bill Clinton with faint praise - hardly the sort of activities that a diehard liberal would engage in. He even softens his stance against Nixon.
<br />
<br />Parts of this book had me laughing out loud, while other parts were chillingly clear, and yet other sections are forgettable and even subpar. Since each column is little over 2 pages long, no sooner does Dr Gonzo find his rhythm than his song is unfortunately ended. I got the sense while reading this book that HST was growing more and more uncomfortable with the 21st Century, and I also felt this was a quickly thrown-together package meant to squeeze some last bucks out of HST's legacy. I was surprised to learn it was published before HST's suicide as it positively reeks of slapped-together "tribute". </span>

                    <span>This was an interesting series of articles and I wish I realized that HST had been writing a column for ESPN.com while he was still doing it.  The sports and gambling anecdotes were very cool, but the best parts of this book were the George W. bashing sections.  I continuosly wondered if sportsfans of a different political ilk would be open-minded enough to read HST's column.  Or if they would understand them.  Thanks and RIP.</span>

                    <span>It was like being socked in the gut when I read that the doctor is dead. Hunter S. Thompson was--pound for pound and word for word--the most talented author of the Twentieth Century. Here was a man who could start from anywhere, write about anything, and have you completely sucked into his world be the end of the first paragraph.
<br />
<br />And this is the least of the reasons he will be missed.
<br />
<br />The doctor wrote in eulogy of his friend George Plimpton a little over a year ago: "He lived his life like a work of fine art." 
<br />
<br />If Plimpton was a piece by Michaelangelo, Hunter S. Thompson was the biggest, boldest Kandinsky ever to stalk the canvas. 
<br />
<br />Of my three favorite Twentieth Century authors (the other two being Thomas Merton--who reached upward, ever searching the silences, and Jack Kerouac--who was always reaching inward, bravely facing what he saw as the void) Hunter S. Thompson was my favorite. His writings reached out. They slapped one hell of a bear hug on the world he knew.
<br />
<br />There is something to be said for letting it ride.
<br />
<br />I read most of the columns in this book as they were published on ESPN.com. I recently reread them this past December when I checked Hey Rube out of the library. If you don't know the doctor, you might as well start here with his last work. 
<br />
<br />It's like everything else he ever wrote: damn good. My God, you made one heck of a writer when you made this guy. What a journey he had. 
<br />
<br />Now, to my great regret, I don't know where the good doctor has gone. I am truly saddened by the loss--the world is just smaller without him. Yet I am thankful all the same for having known him, if only through his works. 
<br />
<br />We all tip our hats and send up a good word.
<br />
<br />Mahalo Doc...fare thee well.
<br />
<br />May you make half the show of the second act that you did of the first.</span>

                    <span>Anything Hunter wrote was acerbic and psychedelic, but somehow hopeful and downright hilarious.. I suggest you read all of it, including this collection of ESPN articles.. Read especially Hunters article on the last election:
<br />
<br />Some samples, 
<br />
<br />...Republicans have never approved of democracy, and they never will. It goes back to pre-industrial America, when only white male property owners could vote... 
<br />
<br />...Did you see Bush on TV, trying to debate? Jesus, he talked like a donkey with no brains at all...
<br />
<br />Hunters Fear and Loathing of Bush and the Republicans since the 60s shot to the heart of political commentary.. Not bad for a Sports Writer..
<br />
<br />I wonder what the future holds when the Weird start checking out.. Hunter will be missed by anyone with a heart and mind.</span>
