                    <span>Gerald Astor has assembled many wonderful stories written by the men who are best suited to tell the story of the Mighty Eighth Air Force. This book was difficult to put down for two reasons: 1. The story it tells is extremely exciting and tragic at the same time and 2. The stories as told by the men who were there impart a quality and feeling that can be hard to find in more traditional histories. I definitely recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>The bold US Air Corps policy of daylight strategic bombing deep into Nazi territory proved deadly, unfortunately it was deadly on both sides. <P>Bold is too tame a word to describe the incredible devotion to duty exhibited on almost every mission of the Mighty Eighth bomber force. For maximum results, bombing accuracy was exchanged for planes and lives. They bombed during broad daylight, they took no evasive action on a bomb run and not until late in the air campaign would there be pursuit escorts over enemy territory. The bombers became sitting ducks for flak and easy pickings for enemy fighters. <P>I had two uncles, both dead now, who were gunners on bombers in the Mighty Eighth. I never could get them to tell me much about it, but now we have this book to give us details of what fliers endured. I learned a lot from this book and plan to read it again soon. The personal oral history format exposes you to several different viewpoints, often on the same incident. <P>Coming to England in the nick of time to bolster the battered and exhausted R.A.F., these fliers were not all the stereotypical egomaniacs I had seen portrayed in countless films. In this book I met salesmen, farmers, college students, high school ROTC Cadets, engineers and mechanics who all loved their country and loved to fly. Certainly there were some hotshots in the mix, but most fliers just wanted to kill all the Germans they could. Shooting down a ME190 with a waist mounted .50 caliber machine gun after dropping a full load of bombs on a Nazi synthetic fuel refinery suited them just fine. I learned that just simply finding your home field in the fog could be as big a gamble as flying through a German flak barrage surrounding your primary target. <P>This is a great companion piece to "Band of Brothers" and both of those "The Greatest Generation" books. All these books give you first person accounts weaved into the author's narrative. In this book though, the weave is almost seamless making this a thoroughly enjoyable yet enlightening read chapter after chapter. A superb job of editing with just the right amount of historical perspective. Now if we can only focus Mr. Astor's attention on the Pacific!</span>

                    <span>Out of all the World War Two books that I've read, this one is by far the greatest of them all. Gerald Astor takes you into the cockpit of a P-51 Mustang, the pilot's seat of a B-17 and the cold prison camps of Nazi Germany. I could not put this book down. This is a book written from the experiences of the men who were actually there. The men of the 8th Air Force are indeed heroes, and this is their story. Thank God for these men. BUY THIS BOOK!!!</span>

                    <span>Astor has done an incredible job with this book. His sources are sound and it's incredibly readable as well. The best part of this book is the fact that Astor uses so many incidents and details from the members of the 8th AF themselves. He really makes the reader care about the people he writes about and the entire 8th AF as a whole. Unlike other books he also brings the horror of even the air war to life. A reader vividly gets the feel that while the war on the ground was worse, the air war was no picinic either.</span>
