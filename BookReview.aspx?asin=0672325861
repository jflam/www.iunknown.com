                <span id="Label1"><P><I>Programming in Objective-C</I> is a concise, carefully written tutorial on the basics of Objective-C and object-oriented programming. The book makes no assumption about prior experience with object-oriented programming languages or with the C language (upon which Objective-C is based). And because of this, both novice and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C. Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying procedural language (C). This approach, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes it ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study. Growth is expected in this language. At the January 2003 MacWorld, it was announced that there are 5 million Mac OS X users and each of their boxes ships with Objective-C built in.</P></span>

                    <span>I suggest reading this book as a prelude to a book on programming using Cocoa and objective C. I think an especially good match is to read this book (or even the 1st half of it) and then start in with Hillegass' book, then possibly supplement that with "Cocoa Programming" by Anguish, et al. The main strength of Kochan's book is that he teaches Objective C, just Objective C, and that the only tool you need to confront is the commandline. This is much simpler than cranking up Xcode and Interface builder to tackle full-blown Mac Cocoa applications.<P>My only gripe with this book is the use of "free" rather than retain/release for memory management. This is completely foreign to how things work in Cocoa, and I think it was a mistake to do it this, since you'll just learn to do it differently once you move on to Cocoa, and the point of this book, for me at least, was to get an Objective C grounding for Cocoa. SInce the logical role for this book is to get beginners ready for Cocoa, I think the memory management should have followed standard Cocoa procedures.<P>Despite this gripe, this is a very useful book for starting in with Objective C and a very reasonable introduction to object oriented programming.</span>

                    <span>While I am a veteran C programmer and trainer, I had never had the time to investigate Objective-C. Even though I had encountered many references to it over the years, and had a few people tell me I needed to check it out, I just never got around to looking at it. Part of the reason was that I never was able to find a book that I really wanted to read, until now. <BR> This book takes you from the start, but wastes little time in stepping through the fundamentals of the language. If you do not know C, it will bring you up to speed quickly. If you are experienced in C, but not in object-oriented programming, then you can easily skim through the introductory material to extract the points of interest. For those who have a higher level of experience, there is an extensive treatment of some of the foundation framework set classes. A small set of exercises is at the end of each chapter, so it could be used as a textbook.<BR> A good solid introduction to a version of C that is object-oriented and that has some syntactical features different from standard K & R C, this book will serve you well if your interest is either self-education or using it as a textbook.</span>

                    <span>Finally!!!Finally a book that teaches how to write Objective-C programs without knowing C or having to learn Cocoa. I've been waiting for a book like this for a long time. Kochan explains all of the concepts of Objective-C and OOP so clearly using lots of examples. The second part of the book, which covers the Foundation Framework justifies the price of the book alone. I particularly liked the chapter on memory management, which clearly explains the autorelease pool and how it works. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn how to write programs in Objective-C, even if you already know C. Now I'm ready to learn how to write Cocoa programs!</span>
