                <span id="Label1">In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War.<br><br>The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal.<br><br>But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists.<br><br>For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts&#8212;gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away&#8212;were ready to test their terrible power against each other.<br><br>Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men.<br><br>When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to &#8220;seize the trident&#8221; by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire.<br><br>Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry.<br><br><i>Castles of Steel</i> is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K. Massie&#8217;s special and widely hailed literary mastery.</span>

                    <span>Robert Massie has done it again -- another "Massive" tome on a topic that doesn't initially seem fascinating, but turns out to be a spellbinding narrative of central importance. Before reading "Dreadnought", this book's predecessor, my understanding of the Anglo-German naval race was limited to a dry few paragraphs in general histories of World War I. Massie put the drama and all its personalities at center stage and showed how crucial Kaiser Willhelm II's vanity fleet was in provoking Britain's turn toward the Entente, an alignment which proved fatal to the Second Reich. <P>"Castles of Steel" picks up the story with the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914. It is much more of a military history than its political/diplomatic precedessor, with detailed and often gripping descriptions of naval battles and pursuits. Massie neglects to offer a basic tutorial on the ships of the day, so it's up to the reader to learn on the job about the differences between battleships and battle cruisers, twelve inch guns and eight inch guns, coal and oil power, etc. But it can be done. Massie is at his best in describing the action of surface fleets. Each naval engagement of the war, from minor skirmishes and raids to epic battles like Jutland, are given microsopic treatment. Such a detailed narrative allows Massie to draw insights that might be invisible from a simplified overview. Events in war cause subtle chain reactions. One British admiral's caution in interpreting Winston Churchill's muddled orders lets a German ship escape and leads to his court martial; a few months later, on the other side of the world, one of his colleagues charges into a fatal and pointless battle to avoid the same fate. The escaped German ship is decisive in swinging Turkey into the war; within a year Churchill's career--and perhaps the war itself--is on the line in the daring and hapless Gallipoli operation to knock Turkey out. And so on. <P>Castles of Steel will thoroughly dispell the notion that the two great fleets were largely passive throughout the war (excluding Jutland) and that the naval war was a bit of a sideshow to the real action on land. He shows how decisive even an indecisive result at sea could be--as long as Britain could maintain its blockade on Germany while avoiding strangulation of its commerce by the U-boat campaign. Massie is also strong on showing how Jutland--whatever its tactical outcome--must have been a strategic defeat for the High Seas Fleet, since it left the U-boats as Germany's only offensive option at sea. That in turn led to America's entry and Germany's certain defeat on land. Massie is not as interested in the details of the U-boat war. Although his chapter on the subject is able and informative, he does not attack it with the same passion and detail as he does the surface ships. In that he resembles his hero in this book, Admiral Jellicoe, a master of surface warfare who respects and fears these new weapons, but does not really make them his own. <P>Like most military histories, this book could have used about ten times the maps the editors saw fit to include. Massie's narrative is masterful, but visual aids will always help to track the complex movements of hundreds of ships. <P>I also wish that Massie had spent as much time getting inside the heads of the German commanders and sailors as he did their English counterparts. There is an inexplicable gap, for example, between the professional, courageous and highly capable High Seas Fleet at Jutland in 1916 and the demoralized, mutinous ships that failed to stir themselves from port eighteen months later to seek a final confrontation with the British. What happened to these men who had once been eager for a fight, and who claimed never to have been defeated? Massie gives us a few clues--the effects of the blockade, the deterioration of Germany's position on land, the (mostly) universal reluctance to engage in suicide missions. But this is one of the rare points on which the reader wishes for more detail.<P>Still, Castles of Steel is a marvelous effort, and I am willing to pick up whatever Mr. Massie cares to write next and carry it straight to the cash register--that is, if I can lift it.</span>

                    <span>Robert Massie is a master of compelling popular history. Castles of Steel is a masterpiece. It is a retelling of the sea war during WWI, particularly from the British point of view. The sea war has always taken a back seat to horrific ground war--the astounding losses in single ground battles made the sea war seem insignificant in comparison. <P>And so it is. But Massie has uncovered a fascinating story, in particular the standoff between the British and German fleets in the North Sea. His recounting of the Battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland make for compelling reading, as are his description the two great South American battles (the defeat of the British at Coronel and the British revenge at the Falkland Islands). <P>He tells his story crisply. His prose is clear and exciting. And he goes below the mechanics of ship movements to introduce us to some wonderful characters: the doomed Admiral Craddock, the victorious but ultimately ill-fated Admiral Spee. Likewise the two great British admirals, the impetuous Beatty and the beloved Jellicoe. <P>I read the book in giant gulps late into the night. <P>Highly recommended to any lover of popular history.</span>

                    <span>It's hard to imagine a 900 page book is incomplete - but it is. The narrative is well written and very engaging, but I found myself using other resources such as an Atlas with better charts and the Internet during my reading to better understand what was happening in the battles. The book could have been improved by more and better maps [especially of Jutland - showing Jellicoe's turn, the German turnabouts and the German escape through the British wake]. A few tables incorporating sinkings and outcomes, and comparing ship types would have helped. What is the difference between an armored cruiser and a battle cruiser? Finally, a short epilogue indicating the ultimate ends of the the main characters [Jellicoe, Fisher, Beatty, the German admirals] would have tied things up nicely. It would have been nice to see Jellicoe's 1914 'tactics' letter in an appendix [I found it on the 'Net], etc. Excellent writing, but a few things like this would have topped it off.....</span>

                    <span>Even a reasonably serious general reader of World War I histories is likely to be far better acquainted with the war on land than the war at sea. After all, what else is there to know besides the Battle of Jutland, the sinking of the Lusitania, the German U-boat offensive and the reactive convoy system? OK, some may have heard of Dogger Bank and recognize that Gallipoli was originally an entirely naval operation until practical difficulties turned it into the disastrous land offensive which has become synonymous with misadventures of the kind. That's it, right? Actually, no, not by a long shot. And if you want to know the "rest" of the WWI story, and perhaps come to agree with the view shared by Author Massie and many other historians that British sea power was the war's ultimate determinant, then this is the book for you. <P>Another reviewer points out that the book appears to have been largely derived from secondary sources, and that may well be true. But Massie's masterful amalgamation, if you will, nonetheless produces a stunning panorama that if not entirely original in its sources, is surely an example of the very finest scholarship of the kind and an "original" in both its sweep and its marvelous presentation in terms of language and story-telling.<P>I made the same "secondary source" comment about Winston Groom's 2002 book on the fighting in the Ypres salient, "A Storm in Flanders," but there is between the two works a distinction with a considerable difference. The Ypres story has been written about with sufficient frequency over the last 90 years that any new telling runs the risk of being downright familiar to serious WWI readers, and so it is with "Storm"; I could have sworn that I had in hand only a slight variation of the several works on the subject I have read. Thus, my conclusion that Groom's book amounted to little more than a nicely turned out rehash. Not at all worthless, just of limited value to the serious WWI reader.<P>Such is not the case with "Castles". The book undertakes nothing less than a thorough account of the entire war at sea and succeeds like nothing else I have ever encountered. Secondary the sources might have been, but the result is indisputably first-rate. Take our "five-star" word for it: you will not only enjoy the read, but will forever after be comfortable that you understand and appreciate the significance of the "forgotten" side of the war.</span>
