                    <span>This book boasts a number of great qualities that make it a very helpful book for students (of postmodernism, evangelism, or whatever), pastors and academics. 
<br /> 
<br /> First, it is very readable. Kallenberg has a knack for clear communication to both his modern and postmodern readers. Second, this book will especially help pastors who are struggling to understand the conrours of postmodernism as it is incarnated in the typical 18-20-something churchgoer. Kallenberg boils down some essential tenets of "anglo-american postmodernity" (see Nancey Murphy's book that bears this title for more in-depth treatment of these themes)in a way that is very understandable and clear. This is very helpful for the pastor who doesn't have the time or energy to tackle works by Murphy, Vanhoozer, Grenz or other key theologians that have written on postmodenism.
<br /> 
<br /> Second, this book is happily focused on ministry in a postmodern context rather than simply on theological method or focal motiffs (as necessary as these topics are). This gives the book a practicality that makes dealing with postmodernism more than simply a philosophical puzzle to be solved by academics.
<br /> 
<br /> Third, while this book is focused on ministry, it does not fall into the common shallowness and consumerism that characterizes many books on the "how-to's" of ministry (e.g. Rick Warren and other "seeker-sensitive" and "church growth" type authors). This book is very honest and has a depth to it that is clearly grounded in actual ministry experience as well as philosophical and theological acumen.
<br /> 
<br /> In sum, I highly recommend this book. It represents the best of the so-called emerging church while avoiding some of the crucial weak points that some of its exponents betray. This book will doubtless be very helpful to Christians in all walks of life and vocation that take the church's witness seriously.</span>

                    <span>This however, is not for the faint of heart.  It is a book whereby the author proposes to look at postmodern philosophy as a background to understand how to evangelize postmoderns.  He is heavy on theory in the beginning of the book and for some folks that's a trip they'd rather not make.  However, it is a necessary one.<p>The author emphasizes the importance of narrative and participation in the evangelism process - and for the author, it is a process.  He would agree with Calvin that we were saved, we are being saved and we will be saved.<p>The only concern I have about the book is it's treatment of implicit faith, which the reformers have rejected.  An example of implicit faith is the story of the paralytic man lowered through the roof where Jesus states that because of the faith of his friends, the man's sin was forgiven (Mark 2:5 NAS).  It is something that I haven't thought about, but something I will consider.<p>Otherwise, great book!</span>
