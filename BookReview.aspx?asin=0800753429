<br />
<br />One of my unchurched friends and staunch atheists insists that life is about answering questions before you die.  The Bondage of The Will is the answer to all of Erasmus' and his life's questions.  And it is not like a box of chocolates. 
<br />
<br />1) There is predestination.
<br />2) There is begging the question.
<br />3) There is being predestined to beg the question.

                    <span>Luther's emphasis on the veracity of God's word and insistance upon interpreting and applying the text plainly is a breath of fresh air in this age of twisted "scholarly" understandings.  Luther cuts down Erasmus' arguments for the freedom of Man's will in salvation with the two-edged sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  The power, sincerity, and passion of Luther's writing is matched only by the prophets, apostles and our Lord Himself.  <p>No believer should be able to read this book and come away still believing in the total freedom of Man's will.  Luther wisely handles the most difficult objections in the same manner as the apostle Paul, answering naysayers with the challenge "who are you to answer back to God?" (Romans 9:20).  <p>The only downfall of the book is that Erasmus' arguments are so weak.  Because of this, Luther spends much time refuting the foolish musings of reason and philosophy and therefore has less time to devote to the scripturally-based questions concerning this doctrine of the bondage of the will.  Luther proves truly that "the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God" (1 Cor. 1:18).</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best and most important books ever written.  In this book Luther explodes the myth of human freedom, and shows from scripture that our wills our bound to our fallen nature until our hearts are changed by God's work in our lives.  <p>This book is important and Informative both as a theological work, and as a part of the history of the Reformation.</span>

                    <span>Luther wrote extensively about every possible issue facing the church, from theology proper to how to teach children to read so they can use the Bible.  But of all his works, this one was the book he hoped would be read by subsequent generations.  The message of the book really boils down to this - who saves whom.  For Luther, salvation was all about what God did to save sinners who can not even prepare themselves to receive saving grace.  In this work Luther is interacting with Erasmus, a Roman Catholic Humanist (in the good sense of that word) who also wanted reformation of the church.  However, while Luther's reformation focused on the gospel and how a sinner is saved, Erasmus' view was more about moral improvement and abuses in the church.  To the modern reader, Luther might sound harsh and mean spirited.  However, he was writing in a tone that was part of that day.  So don't get turned-off by the language and look to the argument.  There is much for us to learn today by this great master of the past!  Sola Fide!!</span>

                    <span>I have viewed a few dissenting voices in some of the reviews of the this work. It amazed me to see how many yearn to defend this mythical beast called "free-will". I too was onced bitten by this monster and wallowed in it's lairs of Arminianism and Pelagianism. However, the Lord, in all of His Divine Grace and Wisdom pulled me out kicking and screaming. How arrogant I was to believe that I was anything and now I rejoice and praise with Nebuchadneezer (Daniel 4:34-36). I have to rejoice in my Liberty in my slavery. Yet, as I mentioned before, this wasn't always so.<p>Oh, how I hated and despised those of the reformed view and ignorantly so! How I loved to sing Amazing Grace and Rock of Ages and despised the Theology of those who wrote it. How I despised the Doctrine of Predestination and yet, never realized that this is the very Doctrine that inspired those like the Puritans and Pilgrims to begin building this great Nation. No, I loved my "free-will". When I was being abused as a child, I cried, "free-will!", when I was homeless, I cried, "free-will"! When I sat behind bars in 30x30 ft cage, I cried "free-will"! When I got sick, I cried, "free-will"! Yet, when I realized that it took the selfless sacrifice of Christ to remove my sin, I had to ask, why couldn't I have just used my "free-will"? At this point I started to notice things, scary things, and the Spirit took this BLINDED sinner who believed he had a "free-will" and began to open his eyes. I saw that nobody could tell me at what point I obtained this "free-will". I realized that as a infant, it took the will of the parent to sustain me. Place an infant in field all by himself and he dies. Why? He has no will to sutain his life. Just like an infant in Christ,maybe? Then, someone suggested that you obtained it when you reached the age of 12 (age of accountability). Of course, when I pointed out that infants less than 12 were judged and killed for thier wickedness in the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah and of course the Amalekite infants (1 Sam 15:1-3), I received a blank stare. When I pointed out that a male child was cast out of the covenant for not being circusmied, I asked, why the child and not the parents? Again, blank. I have recieved many blank stares to many questions regarding Salvation and "free-will" over the past decade.<p>After that,I moved onto creation, the scriptures teach that God created all things and I believe it true. If I believed that God created all things, then time is His creation. If time (part of ALL things)is made up of past, present and future. Then, where does my "free-will" fit into the scheme of time? This has provoked alot of head scratching in numerous discussions. Nobody I have met in the realm of Orthodox Christianity has came up with a non-contradictive answer to that one. <p>I then moved onto the question of Salvation. Well, I won't labor you with the questions I found there. All I can say is that the rest of you can enjoy being the "Free-willer" in Christ and I'll happily remain a slave. By the way, did anyone ever notice Christ never asked Paul to become a Christian? Come to think of it, Christ never asked any of his Apostle or offered them Salvation. Huh? By the way can anyone show me an example of a "sinners prayer"? I thought the Lord's ears were closed to the unrighteous?! <p>Know what I've been thinking about lately? Did you ever wonder why the Lord spoke in Parables? You Armenian and Pelagian types may want to cover your eyes:<p>Mark 4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.<br>11. And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:<br>12. That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.<p>I now ask. Why didn't he want them to percieve or understand or better yet, be converted and thier sins forgiven? HMMMMMM? Why did he chose those around him and not the others to reveal the meanings of the parables? It sure puts Romans 9 in perspective, doesn't it? <p>Hard to imagine, that the Lord used Bondage of the Will to get the old mental Hampsters in me to start turning the old thought wheels! <p>Well, goodbye for now. I have to get back to some free-will experiments I have been working on like becoming totally free of all Federal, State, local and natural laws or flapping my arms and flying or head-butting an oncoming Semi-Truck (I'll let you know how this one works out) and there's the oldie but a goodie, trying to catch a fart with my hands and painting it red! <p>(Here's a little free-will news update (3-14-04). I recently had a young man rob me at gunpoint. As he pressed the gun in my face, a little part of me actaully wondered, where is my "free-will" at this point.What is so free about a will when the options are do or die? Since then, I have meditated even further upon the subject. I stand even more convinced of the selfish attitude that drives people to defend this concept of "free-will". How can they defend an attribute that not even God himself can claim! For the scriptures teach that not even God can do anything contrary to his greatest attribute,HIS HOLINESS! So, if God's decisions are regulated by His own Holiness, how much more are we regulated by our sinfulness? Remember Paul,<p>Romans 7:18 For I know that in me (that is in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.<br>7:19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil I would not, that I do.<p>Paul then goes on to refer to himself as a wretched man and then asks who would deliver him "from the body of this death." The answer is obvious to those who think like Paul, Luther and Calvin, the answer is Christ ALONE!  <p>Think about it! Because the next person with a gun in his face could be you, at that point there will be no debate! If my will had been truly free, I would have never CHOSEN this experience! A divine once stated, "on the deathbed, there are very few free-willers!" Death is inevitable and many will scream "free-will" right into the dirt!<p>One more thing, if you really believe in this "free-will" myth and you are Christian. Try never sinning again! Go ahead! Try it! READ THIS BOOK!!!!!! )<p>Soli Deo Gloria! <br>Nikki</span>
