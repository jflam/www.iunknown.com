                    <span>This book was a real disappointment. I doesn't cover all the features of CVS and lacks detailed examples. I've found better (and free) documentation on the web. Also, with the release of CVS 1.11, this book is slightly out of date. The authors spend more time covering topics like Open Source development and why you should design for portability instead of showing how you can use CVS to manage a really large software project. While they discuss the mechanics of branching, they don't cover things like branching strategies.</span>

                    <span>This "Open Source Development with CVS" is a straightforward book, with emphasis on how to use the open-resource Concurrent Versions System (or CVS). It did a good job in explaining the sequences of network-transparent version control system: including how multiple developers could view and edit codes simultaneously.<BR>The book also provided detailed information on how client-server funtions allow continous operation over the internet. Even how CVS maintains a copy of the source code, (together with the record of who initiated the changes) were clearly explained.<BR>The author of this book essentially wrote it for beginners and intermediate CVS users. Its theme is such that anybody who knows the dynamics of 'Mac OS X', or any of the UNIX-based platforms, will feel at home in it. Advanced CVS users, however, would find in it too elementary. It lacked some of the instructive examples, which any non-beginner would be interested in. Still, its overall outlook remains positive.</span>

                    <span>The book looks to be well written with lots of details, but I feel the first few introductory pages are insufficiently detailed which prevented me from setting things up. Specifically:<P>* The examples don't say whether your supposed to be in or above the working directory for various cvs commands. The reader is supposed to assume that current directory for this example is the same place as the current directory at the end of the previous example, but nothing says that. (it's obvious once you know). <P>* The overview chapter only talks about importing a whole directory tree. It's not clear how to add a directory or a file to an already imported directory tree. Actually, it's explained 20 pages later, but I didn't find that for a while.<P>* I made a mistake and imported a working dir subdirectory as a top level directory in the central cvs repository. There's no quick overview commands for removing setup mistakes. (Actually, that's shown about 30 pages after the overview). The book doesn't say that importing a subdirectory if you're in the subdirectory, makes it a top level directory in the CVS repository.<P>I'm sure once I understand what's going on, it'll be obvious. But to do my basic directory setup, and cleanup from a mistake, I had to wade through all sorts of "once it's working" text to find what I wanted. <P>Also, in the Removing Directories section, he keeps referring to directories without saying whether he's referring to directories in the user tree or under the CVS repository tree.</span>

                    <span>I've used cvs for a couple of years, but have never really needed tagging or branching until I became a developer on the www.mycibavision.com project. Then, we needed it. Tagging and branching were difficult to grasp for me. This book was critical in helping me to understand what tagging and branching were and how to do use those features.<BR>Aside from that, the main reason I like this book so much is that _everything_ has example code to go with it. Even better is that the output from every command is displayed as well. I found myself executing the commands and then comparing the output. I would highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I cannot over-emphasize how useful this book was to me while setting up my cvs repository on Linux. All the examples were germane and were correct, and the gotcha-s were highlighted. I go back to this book all the time. I cannot make any comment regarding the worthiness of this book for folks trying to install cvs on NT, as I blithely skipped over any NT commentary, but as far as Linux/UNIX installation, the book was vital. I fully agree with the high rating this book has enjoyed.</span>
