                    <span>This was an excellent book! It was everything I'd hoped it would be - and more! This book is for any beginner to intermediate VBA programmer to build their skills. It will take you from recording macros to custom designing your own userforms and making everyone in the office give 'ooohh''s! The examples are complete, editing is superb, flow and design are both very commendable. Mr. Jelen and Mrs. Syrstad have done a very fine job on this book. I would recommend this to ANYBODY who wanted to learn or who was fairly proficient in VBA. It's packed full of useful, and efficient, methods that will save HOURS of work! When done reading, it will make a great reference for anybody in the office who uses Excel!</span>

                    <span>This book has helped us so many times with difficult VBA problems. The author doesn't baby you with the easy problems. If you need help with the basics I would recommend VBA for dummies. With this book we have been able to find solutions for the most difficult problems for the most demanding projects. Great book deserves 6 stars Trust Me, buy this book.

                    <span>As a VBA programmer wanting to better my skills, I picked up this book. That was a big mistake.
<br />
<br />It didn't take me long before I found the first error. Of course at first, I thought it might be the only one. I noted it down to send to the author later.
<br />
<br />Then I found another, and another. Finally the list got too long to send. And some of them were quite substantial, in my opinion!
<br />
<br />Some of these so-called "tips" will only work if you have a particular version of Excel running a particular version of Windows. They won't work for everyone. That will frustrate many readers.
<br />
<br />Other tips are written in such an awkward way that the reader is sure to do them wrong.
<br />
<br />Didn't anybody proofread this book before printing??
<br />
<br />The only reason I can see for buying it is to line your birdcage. Don't waste your money.</span>

                    <span>I have never been able to grasp the concepts of VBA. I believe in VBA and its ability to supercharge Office applications, but could never seem to learn even Excel VBA, which is supposed to be the easiest. This is the first book I've read (yes, I've read the Romans and the Walkenbachs) that made any sense to me at all. Too many books approach VBA as if you have already learned how to code in other programs. I came to VBA from the Office user side of things. I don't have that *programming* brain required to pick up VBA easily. So this book has been a godsend. While I've only read about half the book so far, so many things that escaped me are finally falling into place. Thanks very much to Bill and Tracy for a terrific VBA resource!</span>

                    <span>I've read many books on Excel - or at least have attempted to. "VBA and Macros for Microsoft Excel" has kept my attention and has brought forth some great techniques and information.
<br /> There are a few really cool features of the book:
<br /> I greatly appreciate that there are multiple contributors; this - I think - was a great idea! The flow is smooth, topics are backed up with abundant visuals AND I really like the 'Case Studies' feature.
<br /> 
<br /> We all know that many businesses have moved to (and continue to move to) the internet. No matter the data that you require, the information on Querying Web Data alone is more than worth the retail cost of this book!
<br /> If you're considering purchasing a comprehensive book as your daily compendium to MS Excel and you would like to employ the use of Visual Basic for Applications then this is the one book you want to have when you get to the check out counter.</span>
