                <span id="Label1">With its multicultural orientation and dazzling maps, photos, and artworks, the DK Atlas of World History is the first truly global chronicle of humankind's experience on Earth. Remote-sensed data and digital cartography provide the most accurate mapping ever used in a historical atlas. Every map is enhanced by photographs, artworks, diagrams, timelines, and expertly researched and clearly written annotations and text. Produced in consultation with a team of over 30 academic historians, geographers, and cartographers, the atlas uses a two-tier approach:  Part One-the Eras of World History-presents a global overview of the last 60,000 years, while Part Two-Regional Histories-focuses on specific geocultural areas, including coverage of places and peoples often ignored by more traditional atlases. All these elements combine to create a historical atlas that is a joy to explore, easy to use, and unmatched in its breadth and depth of information.</span>

                    <span>As a reader I like to have quick reference books at my finger tips including a new version of the Oxford English Dictionary about 3500 pages long - that I use almost daily. So I decided to add a "history atlas". In the process of doing my research I read the other amazon.com reviewers and then made three trips to two large book stores to actually look at the books and get a better feel for which was the best. I ended up buying the Oxford Atlas of World History. Here are my picks and rankings.<P>Listed by My ranking, #1 is the best, #2 is a creative alternative but no substitute.<P>1.Atlas of World History, Oxford University Press 2002, 368 pages, $57.80, 13.5" x 10.3" x 1.62" ranked 46,632 on Amazon.com. Hands down winner - professional - good text descriptions, outstanding maps and drawings, covers most things from the cave man forward. Negatives: Big and heavy. If you want to save a few dollars buy the "concise" version. <BR> <BR>2.Creative alternative: The Penguin Atlas of World History, Penguin Books 2004, $11.20, just a paperback sized, just published, 304 pages. Surprisingly impressive, lots of text and pictures mixed together and it is easy to carry around. A nice quick alternative but it will be printed in two volumes.<BR>. <BR>3.Timelines of World History, DK Publishing 2002, 666 pages, $27.20. 10.0" x 1.6" ranked 25,800 on Amazon.com. Second with lots of value but in some ways not as comprehensive.<P>4. National Geographic Almanac of World History, National Geographic 2003, 384 pages, $28.00, 9.6" x 7.8" x 1.17" ranked 24,426 on Amazon.com. Similar to but less impressive than Oxford books. More text, narrower coverage, fewer maps and drawings.<P>5.DK Atlas of World History, DK Publishing, 352 pages, $35.00, 10.96" x 14.66" x 1.28" ranked 10,716 on Amazon.com. My 4th or 5th place book seems like a giant comic book. I love the DK travel books but this seems like one step beyond DK's area of expertise. Superficially it is similar to the Oxford book and it is cheaper to buy, and some might like it but it tries to be politically correct and fails.<BR> <BR>6.Oxford Dictionary of World History, Oxford University Press, 704 pages, $7,66, pocketbook sized, sales rank 330,000. Mainly terms, people, and dates but has a few maps also. Limited use but an alternative. I prefer the new Penguin book but this is the best history dictionary to buy.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>The DK Atlas of World History: Mapping the Human Journey is a huge top shelf book. It is divided into two parts: the first gives the reader a global view of history divided into different eras(e.g.the advent of agriculture, trade and first cities, the age of the crusades,etc.), the second describes regional history (North America, South America, Africa, Europe,West Asia, South and South East Asia, Noth and East Asia, Oceania, the Arctic and Antarctica).In both parts you will find numerous time lines with the important dates, small color illustrations and short paragraphs about the events covered.At the end of the book there is a subject index and glossary and an index with all the place names shown on the maps.Finally there is a two page bibliography.<P>There is no question that this is a very beautiful book with pleasant pastel colors, pleasant, glossy paper and maps of different sizes and seen under different angles, which avoids monotony. <P>Having said that, it is also clear for an attentive reader that the editor has been at pains to be absolutely politically correct, which means:<BR>-ostentatious use of BCE and CE instead of AD and BC<BR>-gross neglect of Christianity: whereas the spread of Islam is worth a double page with big maps in both sections of the Atlas, there is not a single chapter or map about the spread or history of Christianity, which is amazing, considering its importance for the "human journey". In the index, Jesus is nonchalantly called "the inspiration of the Christian religion" (is it an abstract character, one wonders), crucified as a "troublemaker in 29 CE". Strangely enough, Buddha and Muhammad are called "founders" of their respective religions, which is quite true but why deny the title to Christ?<BR>The entry for "Christianity" is also enlightening: here we are told that the early Christian faith, which is decribed as an "offshoot of Judaism", split from the very beginning into "many sects". Never mind the same happened to Islam, there is no mention of any heresies or infighting inside that religion at the corresponding entry.<BR>I also could not find a single time line showing the birth or death of Jesus and other great Christians like Paul and Peter.<BR>-neglect of European history: although European history is the best documented, in this atlas it is treated on the same level as Africa or Australia, which means that at least a dozen chapters and scores of maps are missing for the serious student of history.<BR><P>Being anti-Christian and anti-European are, as some have rightly said, the last acceptable prejudices.</span>

                    <span>Ok...I've owned both The Hammond Atlas of World History and The DK Atlas of World History for a few years now. I've always felt like I needed to retain the Hammond because of it's "scholarly" reputation. But the DK Atlas is just more fun! I spent an hour just perusing all the information presented concerning Napoleon's empire and retreat from Russia (yes, this atlas does have depth). The setup makes much more sense: Part I is a global view of the rise and fall of empires over the centuries, while Part II gives you close up of regions of the world, which are also easy to follow. The encyclopedic glossary of 20,000 entires gets an A+. Last but not least, if you're buying a historical atlas for maps, the DK has no equal. My only recommendation is if you buy this atlas, pick up a copy of the late JM Roberts "Short History of the World". They complement each other very nicely when former names of regions come into play you can plainly see where they were located with the DK.</span>

                    <span>DK hits another home run. Measuring 15 x 11 inches, his is one of the most beautiful Atlas books ever printed. DK, of course, produces books that are beautiful to look at, and read, and enjoy over and over again. This Atlas is no exception. It is academically correct, with beautiful photos, maps, and drawings, and makes the "dull study of human history" come alive in a fun and relatively easy way. If students in schools had this book, it would enliven their minds and make them understand world development and history. It would help them connect to the world as it is today, and help them understand why it got this way. It is too bad most students will not have access to this book, thereby making school another dull place to sit around and get bored with. This book is worth buying, no matter what grade, or age bracket, you are in. DK does it again with a great book for all of us.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the most beautifully laid out and graphically designed of the big 5 or 6 atlases out there. I had a few miscellaneous comments to make, and then I thought I would compare it with the Hammond Atlas, which is the other "big gun" out there.<P>First, a few minor nitpicks. In the article on prehistoric man, they don't mention the age of Lucy of 3.6 million years. They do mention the species name, Australopithecus afarensis, but then although they mention the first genus homo was H. erectus in the main article, you have to read the other smaller print articles around the page to get the age figure. Also, there is no mention of ardipithecus ramidus, the oldest known pre-Homonid fossil, at 4.5 million years, or that we know of two different Australopithecines, africanus and robustus, representing a gracile versus a more robust species.<P>One characteristic of the DK atlas is it is more topically oriented than some of the others. In the ancient history section, for example (my main interest), it has essays on "Growth of the City," "Trade and the First Cities," and the "Earliest Writing, Counting, and Calendars."<P>But the biggest difference between the DK and the others is that it's divided up into two main sections--Eras of History, and the Regional Histories. The eras section contains essays such as "The World 1250-750 BCE" or "The World in 250-500 CE."<P>The regional history section has the histories of the main geographic areas of the world, such as Europe, West Asia, North Asia, East Asia, Africa, South America, Australasia, North America, and so on. Within those sections you'll find specific articles such as "Europe After the Fall of Rome," or "Early Empires of West Asia, or "North America, 1865-1920."<P>The DK atlas has 470 maps, 420 timelines, over 1000 photos, and a 20,000 entry index/gazetteer which is much more than an index since the entries include capsule biographies and histories of important events--a unique feature of all the atlases, and similarly there is a subject/index glossary that does the same thing.<P>The Hammond atlas is the other major offering in this area. Compared to the DK, the Hammond reads more like a typical history book, with articles that go on for several parallel columns of unequal depth and accompanied by maps and various illustrations. The DK text is much more broken up into smaller paragraphs with different sizes of type, often relating to a photo or smaller map or other graphic. Although visually more striking than the Hammond, its approach is more disjointed as a result and I think harder to use and learn from. The articles also are somewhat more superficial as a result compared to the the competing atlases, especially the Atlas of World History by John Haywood and the Hammond and Oxford historical atlases.<P>The DK has nicer, glossier paper than the others, which makes their maps and photos more attractive. Also the map colors of the DK are aften more pastel-like, whereas the Hammond often uses the traditional four-color map color scheme with bright red, green, blue, and yellow, which, after the DK, is a little garish and hard on eye, although they also have many maps with more subtle color schemes, so it's not a hard-and-fast distinction.<P>One other nice feature of the Hammond is that it has a separate timeline at the beginning of book of 11 pages.<P>Finally, the Hammond atlas is 373 pages and the DK is 352, including indexes, so they're pretty close in terms of length, and their overall dimensions are almost the same, so they're pretty equivalent there.<P>Finally, one major advantage of the DK atlas, however, is that it has the most coverage of all the other areas of the world, besides Europe. The others are all more Eurocentric.<P>The bottom line is I would say the Hammond atlas is the more informative and scholarly of the two, but the DK is more fun just to browse and page through. Depending on what you're looking for and how you like to use them, you might prefer one over the other.<P>One last thing I'd like to mention is that the John Haywood atlas, although not as large and as comprehensive as the Hammond and DK, is also well worth considering. It's also excellent and only a fraction of the price of these two big volumes, and I think it does the best job of integrating the text with the maps and graphics.<P>Hope my little comparison review helps. Happy atlas shopping, buying, and reading!</span>
