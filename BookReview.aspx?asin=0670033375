                <span id="Label1">Jared Diamond's <I>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</I> is the glass-half-empty follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I>. While <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I> explained the geographic and environmental reasons why some human populations have flourished, <I>Collapse</I> uses the same factors to examine why ancient societies, including the Anasazi of the American Southwest and the Viking colonies of Greenland, as well as modern ones such as Rwanda, have fallen apart. Not every collapse has an environmental origin, but an eco-meltdown is often the main catalyst, he argues, particularly when combined with society's response to (or disregard for) the coming disaster. Still, right from the outset of <I>Collapse</I>, the author makes clear that this is not a mere environmentalist's diatribe. He begins by setting the book's main question in the small communities of present-day Montana as they face a decline in living standards and a depletion of natural resources. Once-vital mines now leak toxins into the soil, while prion diseases infect some deer and elk and older hydroelectric dams have become decrepit. On all these issues, and particularly with the hot-button topic of logging and wildfires, Diamond writes with equanimity.  <p>   Because he's addressing such significant issues within a vast span of time, Diamond can occasionally speak too briefly and assume too much, and at times his shorthand remarks may cause careful readers to raise an eyebrow. But in general, Diamond provides fine and well-reasoned historical examples, making the case that many times, economic and environmental concerns are one and the same. With <I>Collapse</I>, Diamond hopes to jog our collective memory to keep us from falling for false analogies or forgetting prior experiences, and thereby save us from potential devastations to come. While it might seem a stretch to use medieval Greenland and the Maya to convince a skeptic about the seriousness of global warming, it's exactly this type of cross-referencing that makes <I>Collapse</I> so compelling. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Diamond initially focuses on how environmental abuse caused the collapse of several societies - eg. those on Easter Island, the Norse in Greenland, and Chaco Canyon settlements in New Mexico, and the Mayas in South America made choices that seriously affected their environment and subsequently limited their ability to survive.  He then goes on to cover Rwanda (severe economic pressures from overpopulation providing a climate that encourages civil war), and China - where an enormous population, combined with efforts to dramatically improve living standards, is creating the risk of future environmental catastrophe.
<br />
<br />Diamond, however, does not offer concrete solutions, nor project the outcome of current U.S. policies, perhaps because doing so would have become overly controversial to cover adequately in a 500+ page book.   
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, Americans need to rethink our impact on the environment.  In particular, we need to replace our lack of effective action on reducing illegal immigration, fuel consumption, and carbon-dioxide emissions.  Significant improvements in these areas would reduce our serious trade deficit, funding of volatile groups in the Mid-East, unemployment and declining real wages, crowding and demands on dwindling natural resources, and poor image in other areas of the world.  It would also encourage or force Mexico etc. to more effectively resolve their own problems.
<br />
<br />A number of years ago The Club of Rome tried to raise awareness of the need for substantially improved environmental sensitivity.  It largely failed - hopefully Diamond will be more successful.</span>

                    <span>This book was the most disappointing that I have read in years. I was a huge fan of Guns, Germs and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee but this book was definitely not up to the standard set by Diamond with those two. <p>While the book is clearly very well researched, and thoroughly explores issues brought forward, it gets lost in Diamond's rhetoric and preaching about environmental measures that must be taken. At times I was sure that I was reading a book by Naomi Klein. <p>Unfortunately, this book does not live up to previous titles by Diamond.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most brilliantly competent books I've ever read, a historical and geographical tour de force of detail and synthesis. One would be hard-pressed to overpraise Diamond's books, this latest being at least as impressive as his Guns, Germs and Steel. From the ancient Mayans and Easter Islanders to brilliant analyses of today's industrial-environmental problems, I can't think of a more recommendable book for anyone with any amount of intelligent concern for the future of humanity on planet earth. When Diamond makes a case, rebuttal is almost unthinkable. Please read this book.</span>

I'll give the book the benefit of doubt and two stars instead of one.</span>
