                <span id="Label1">Some people make their living with a camera, and for these people the maturation of digital photo technology means a significant shift in their trade. <I>The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers</I> is for people who are already adept with a camera, and pretty much up to speed on the peculiarities of digital photography, too. The book teaches these people how to use Adobe Photoshop, the standard photo-editing software package. More accurately, the book explains how to use Photoshop for the kinds of work professional photographers do. <p>  Case in point: The removal from photographs of what are politely called skin blemishes. Author Scott Kelby (the editor of <I>Photoshop User</I> offers two strategies: One you can use to remove all traces of a mark but which requires a fair amount of time, and another procedure that delivers "pretty good" results and which can be done on many pictures (such as a set of class portraits) rapidly. Kelby teaches by means of heavily illustrated procedures, each between five and 20 steps long and spanning several pages. A good way to use this book is by scanning the table of contents for a procedure that interests you (say, "Fixing Underexposed Photos," or "Pro Wrinkle Removal"). This will enable you to spot Photoshop techniques you hadn't considered. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use Adobe Photoshop if, for you, the program is one tool out of many in a photographic kit. Tricks teach you how to recolor hair, whiten teeth and eyes, modify unflattering body contours, dodge and burn, apply filters for effect, assemble panoramas, and do a score of other slick photo jobs.</span>

                    <span>Just received this incredible book. From the wonderful acknowledgement page I knew this was going to be different. This is what all digital photographer's who use Photoshop have been waiting for. Scott's witty style of pacing you through the steps makes it so easy. Well written, well conceived. Covers all the issues that a digital photographer new or seasoned to the game could ask for. Scott Kelby has the style that makes you go WOW.... that was easy enough. Plenty of tips for the pros. Covers all the best of Photoshop 7 plus the new Adobe's Camera RAW plug-in. From organizing your work to photo touch-up to preparing your work for presentation to special effects this book has it all. Scott Kelby has written so many great books on Photoshop and to me this tops the list. This book will be well worn in no time. Thank you Scott for sharing your knowledge to all of us who enjoy Photoshop.</span>

                    <span>I read a review that said this book is written for professional photographers and hi-end serious amateurs. While that may be true, I found all of the explanations in the book to be very simple and step-by-step, so that advanced beginners or intermediate users should be able to follow along easily.<P>Author Scott Kelby, Photoshop User magazine editor, shows you the Photoshop pros' techniques for managing, correcting, retouching and outputting your photos to produce brilliant results. This book is great for traditional photographers who are making the jump to digital photography. Reading it should empower you to experiment with your photos. <P>The full color book is packed with graphics and tutorials that will show you how to re-size your images with the proper resolution without losing image quality, deal with High ISO noise, blue channel noise, and other common digital camera problems. There's good info on color correcting photos for output on everything from inkjet printers to printing presses, and how to get perfect fleshtones. I love the "digital plastic surgery" and facial retouching techniques using Photoshop 7.0's new tools. <P>Plus, some great exercises in masking, digital dodging and burning tricks, colorizing hair and replacing a portion of a pic (such as a sky).</span>

                    <span>I have bought a number of photoshop books, and this is one of my favorites. It basically shows you how to do some specific tasks, such as color correction and other retouching techniques. The book takes you step by step through the process. People looking for books more akin to manuals will not like this book. I picked up a number of tips and am still working to incorporate his suggestions.</span>

                    <span>Ignore all earlier comments about the book being too basic. These guys don't know what they're talking about. This is the best book on Photoshop I have ever read. It gives you real world settings instead of publishing pages of useless Phd-thesis-type(basic) information on specific features, e.g., USM, WITHOUT recommended settings. These real world settings require a pre-requisite knowledge of the features; WHICH is why the book is considered an intermediate-to-advanced book. Photographers looking for detailed explanations of each and every feature should just read through the HELP document or basic texts published by Adobe.</span>

                    <span>The moment I leafed through this book I was impressed. I picked up several useful tips in the first few minutes perusing it. This never happens - usually I look through a PS book looking for things that I don't know already.<P>Scott Kelby doesn't waste time telling you how to take a photograph, but rather gets to the meat and potatoes of digital post processing. This is great for me, as I need to make the most of my time and this book has helped me to do that.<P>Also, I really enjoy Mr. Kelby's writing style, and am oh-so glad that he came out with this book - it's the best thing to come along for digital photographers like myself, who have a working knowledge of PS but need to squeeze as much as possible out of the program.<P>My sincere thanks Mr. Kelby! :-) I love this book!</span>
