                <span id="Label1">A disturbing share of technological disasters are caused by  incompatibilities between the way things are designed and the way  people actually perceive, think, and act.  Structurally sound aircraft  plummet to the earth, supertankers run aground in calm weather, and the  machines of medical science maim unsuspecting patients - - all because  designers sometimes fail to reflect the characteristics of the user in  their designs.  <p>Designers and the public alike are realizing that  many human' errors are more aptly named designed-induced' errors.  Most  consumers experience the frustration of using many new products;  amusing stories about programming a VCR, operating a personal computer,  or finding the headlight switch on a rental car are heard in everyday  conversation.  The problems consumers experience with modern everyday  things are shared by the users of large-scale technologies where the  consequences of design can go well beyond simple matters of  inconvenience or amusement.  <p>In the new second edition of Set  Phasers on Stun' and Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human  Error, noted designer and author Steven Casey has assembled 20 factual  and arresting stories about people and their attempts to use modern  technological creations.  Although the operator or pilot usually gets  blamed for a big disaster, the root cause can frequently be found in  subtle characteristics of the device's human interface.' Technological  disasters can often be traced directly to the interplay between people  and the design of a device - - be it an airliner cockpit, the controls  in an industrial plant, a spacecraft's instruments, a medical system, a  nuclear reactor, or even a commercial dishwashing machine.  <p>The most  effective way to convey the consequences of design-induced human error  is with a good story and just the right level of technical detail, and  this is what Casey has done in his new book.  As stated by Alphonse  Chapanis, one of the founders of the human factors engineering  discipline, Set Phasers on Stun is A tour de force.  A collection of  gripping and often alarming true stories meticulously documented and  skillfully told about design-induced human errors.  It should be  required reading for all engineers and designers, and everyone else  concerned about the ways our modern technological creations can affect  our everyday lives. Skylab-4 astronaut Gerald Carr agrees: The book is  ...an engrossing tour through the world of human susceptibility to  subtle variations in environment and in design.</span>

                    <span>Steve Casey has provided a valuable service to engineers, designers, and human factors professionals with his true tales of design-induced human error. These engaging stories range from disasters at sea and failures of space systems, to casualties caused by inappropriate procedures and the packaging of consumer items. The lesson from each story is different, but there is a single theme: the incidents could have been avoided if proper attention had been paid to the user during the design of the item or system. I have given copies of Set Phasers on Stun to several people to illustrate the importance of considering human limitations, as well as capabilities, when designing systems for human use. The book is an entertaining read for anyone. I highly recommend Set Phasers on Stun.</span>

                    <span>A perfect 6.0 on technical merit and artistic interpretation! 'Set Phasers on Stun' is a fascinating series of 20 true stories about human factors, user interface design, and design-induced human error. Like a well-told fable used to enforce a useful truth, each story cleverly teaches you something interesting and instructive about the importance of the user interface in modern technology. Casey tells each story from the perspective of the user of the thing or system, so you can really see how people get sucked into a particular situation and understand the unfortunate consequences of the designer's decisions. There is a good blending of technical detail, emotion, and great writing. Addressed are, among other things, a crash in the Airbus computerized cockpit, a Soviet space fatality, assorted medical errors ('Set Phasers on Stun' - - the title story about a patient being zapped during a radiation treatment), the launching of a rocket inside a building in Sweden, a diving accident, the Bhopal disaster, and the supertanker Torrey Canyon. I was originally introduced to this book in an engineering class, and it really "turned on the light" as the saying goes.</span>

                    <span>I had great expectations for this book, and on one it did deliver: the expectation that I wouldn't be able to put it down. I didn't, and 2-3 hours later I was basically horrified and afraid to do anything. That's because it is a catalog of horrible disasters that does make for gripping reading, but it left me vaguely unsatisfied and apprehensive that something was about to go wrong. I would have liked at least a little discussion after each episode. Instead it just stopped cold after each story, which I guess is an effective way to just let the reader reflect and draw his own conclusions, but left me with a cold, unsatisfied feeling. It also doesn't help that you pretty much know how each story is going to end. But if you are looking for a catalog of the anatomy of disasters, it excels at that, due to the very clear and readable writing. The title is very clever and well-considered - it kept me from forgetting it once I heard it.</span>

                    <span>Casey compiles short descriptions of technological, engineering, and every day disasters. Although each story is very interesting, it leaves with reader with unanswered questions and a desire for deeper explantions. If you are looking for something light and entertaining, its an enjoyable book. If you are interested in understanding and preventing the tragedies discussed, look elsewhere.</span>
