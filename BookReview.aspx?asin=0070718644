                    <span>After reading the book Effective Coaching, by Marshall  J. Cook, I now have some helpful insights about the role of coaching.  I initially wanted to see how closely the role of coach and mentor was, and decided to see if  this could help make that distinction. As I soon discovered the many hats  that coaches wear, I began to see that all the "hats" started to  look very similar. Coaching and mentoring are similarly focused  disciplines.<p>Coaching is not about control; it is empowerment, and  leading by example.  The role of coach is very dynamic.  Many good  intentions drive a coach to reach the learner, and depending on what  situations are presented, the coach must be prepared and skilled to handle  it. This book illustrates effective coaching techniques through the use of  various scenarios. <p>The chapters are organized into sub groups of the  different roles a coach can be.  "As a coach, you must be problem  solver, trainer, teacher, mentor and corrector." Some of the skills  covered are good questioning, being a good listener, problem solving,  addressing change, overcoming obstacles, and valuable communication  strategies. Plus bonus principles for good coaching and good living.   All  chapters have smart management tips that incorporate these skills to help  you avoid potential real-life roadblocks and to put you into the Coach's  and learner's perspectives.<p>Throughout the book, the margins have helpful  keys to the terms and the author has flavored each chapter with cases that  relate to the chapter's theme.  I enjoyed the voice the author used to  express himself in each chapter.  You find yourself quickly acknowledging  the main points that are introduced. Each chapter concludes with a  coach's  checklist where all the pertinent points are restated.  This is a book that  I have underlined and highlighted for future reference.</span>
