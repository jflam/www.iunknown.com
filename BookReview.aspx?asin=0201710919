                <span id="Label1">The Extreme Programming (XP) paradigm has developers doing things like  programming in pairs, writing tests to verify all code, and continuously  refactoring designs for improved performance. Written by two of its inventors,  <I>Planning Extreme Programming</I> shows you how to implement XP by using a  simple, effective process. This remarkably short (yet remarkably useful) title  will give any XP manager or programmer a perspective on delivering software that  meets the needs of customers better.<p>  Simplicity is the watchword of the XP software process. This book is virtually  devoid of traditional software-engineering jargon and design diagrams, and yet  does a good job of laying the foundation of how to perform XP--which is all  about working with a customer to deliver features incrementally.<p>  The terminology in the book is commonsensical. (In the terms of XP, each  iteration adds certain new features, or stories. It's up to the customer to  decide what functionality is more important and will be delivered first. By  never letting a working build get out of sight, the XP process virtually ensures  that software will be close to what the customer wants.)<p>  Early chapters borrow analogies from everyday experience--like planning a trip  or driving a car--to set the stage for XP process planning. The book has plenty  of advice for dealing with the stakeholders (customers) of a project. Because of  confidentiality agreements, however, we don't get many details from the real  world, although the discussion is anchored by a hypothetical project for  planning the Web site of the future for travel, with some specifics.<p>  There is plenty of advice for planning projects, based on individual and team  "velocity" (a measure of productivity) and the like--practical suggestions for  running daily, short status meetings (in which all of the participants stand up,  to keep them short). Clearly, there's a culture that surrounds many XP teams,  and this text does a good job of conveying some of this to the reader.<p>  At fewer than 150 pages, <I>Planning Extreme Programming</I> is notably concise,  and that's probably the whole point. Most shops today work on Internet time,  which doesn't wait for extensive project analysis and design documents. In XP,  you create working software from the very start. This book is an essential guide  to anyone who's working in XP shops or who might be interested in what this  innovative, iterative software process can offer. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><ul><li>Introduction to planning <li>Risk management in  software <li>"Driving" as a metaphor for software development <li>Roles for  software development: business vs. technical people <li>Four variables for  project planning: cost, quality, time, and scope <li>Predicting future  programmer productivity, based on past performance <li>Project scope and  estimation <li>The XP process: software releases, iterations, stories,  collecting, and writing stories (features) <li>Hints for ordering features  <li>Tips on planning and status meetings <li>Using visual graphs to monitor  project progress <li>Tracking and fixing bugs <li>Project red flags</ul></span>

                    <span>Kent Beck and Martin Fowler have to be something of a "dream team" for a computer book. Not only was this book informative and interesting, but I actually enjoyed reading it. The book crackles with ideas and sparkles with a subtle wit. <p>The content of the book covers all aspects of planning, managing and tracking progress on an XP (Extreme Programming) project and is a worthy companion to Kent Beck's anthemic XP Explained. Hard stuff missed out from the earlier work such as how to estimate how long things will take, how to write user stories and how to organize the details of iterations and releases is explained in a straightforward way. It also introduces a few new key XP concepts, showing that this radical methodology didn't spring fully formed into the mind of Beck, but is still evolving. One such key is "Yesterdays Weather", the idea that you can't go far wrong by using past performance as an initial guess for future results. <p>If you are at all intrigued by the new "agile" methodologies, read XP Explained and then this one. Then buy a few more copies for your management.</span>

                    <span>This book is very valuable if you already started to practice Extreme Programming. It contains a very encouraging foreword by Tom DeMarco. The first nine chapters are introductory, and you may skip them if you read the XP Manifesto "Extreme Programming Explained" by Kent Beck. Chapters from ten to twenty three contain valuable information not found in any other XP-related book. <p> - How exactly to plan releases? What if frequent releases aren't appropriate and marketing demands to release once a year?<p> - How exactly to write user stories, and how to handle them? Although the reader may find some sample stories in "Extreme Programming Installed" by Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson and Chet Hendrickson, the stories in the "Planning Extreme Programming" are used as core elements in the whole planning process, shown as example.<p> - How exactly to build the iteration plan and the release plan? How to track an iteration?<p>I would also like to recommend "Extreme Programming Applied: Playing to Win" by Ken Auer, Roy Miller, Ward Cunningham. I think this is the most practical book on XP ever written. <p>I would also like to recommend the titles about individual XP aspects:<br>- Design Improvement: "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code " by Martin Fowler;<br>- Test-Driven Development: "Test Driven Development: By Example " by Kent Beck;<br>- Sustainable Pace: "Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency" by Tom DeMarco;<br>- Pair Programming: "Pair Programming Illuminated" by Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler;<br>- Whole Team: "Agile Software Development" by Alistair Cockburn;<br>- Planning Game: "Planning Extreme Programming" by Kent Beck, Martin Fowler;<br>- Small Releases: "Software Project Survival Guide" by Steve C McConnell.</span>

This book is for everyone who figured out that project planning in a software project is a nightmare. Let these authors talk some common sense in you. Let's do it the way we understand things work. Let's get real.<p>Get this book in startup phases of XP projects, when you need to figure out what to do in what order. Get this book if you want to be entertained. Don't get this book if you are in love with MSProject.</span>

                    <span>Didnt I just read all of this in some of the other books in the series?<p>Extreme Programming Installed is the best of the lot.  The others just repeat the same information in different ways.  No need to read the others in the series.  The initial book, ExtremeProgramming Explained is ok.  It explains the philosophy.  But XP Installed gives actual examples.</span>
