                    <span>The National Geographic Photography Field Guide is a well written, easily accessible guide that is a great beginners guide and reference for experienced photographers. The first half of the book covers the basics of photography including cameras, film, lenses and light. Each of the chapters is concise and contains handy tables and charts. For example, the chapter on filters has handy charts to help you determine when to use certain filter types.<P>The second half of the book contains chapters devoted to various subjects. Some examples are landscapes, weather and people. In between some of the chapters are small sections on National Geographic photographers that give a short bio and their options on photographing the subject being discussed. While these sections don't provide much in the way of additional information, they make for interesting reading and add character to the book.<P>Beyond the written content, the book itself is a work of art. It is filled with beautiful pictures that are great examples of the topic being discussed. Also, it is printed on glossy paper that adds that extra touch of professionalism. All in all, a highly recommended guide.</span>

                    <span>...this book contains almost every topic (although I never understood why a photography How-to needs to tell me how to load a film, since every camera comes with a manual).<BR>It starts very basic (e.g. aperture vs. exposure time reciprocity), explains films and even covers specific problems (such as shutter speed for depicting falling snown etc.). <BR>It's a book for beginners (although the essays about and from famous photographers and their tips are whorth reading for everyone). After purchasing this book you definetely don't need to look around for any other introduction. It serves well as continuous reference for upcoming questions (e.g. "How long should I expose the moon without blurring it?"). <BR>After reading this book (or if you already stepped beyond this stage in photography) you'll only need to look for advanced books. Including inside covers as Greycards is simply clever and very handy.<BR>I rated this book "only" with 4 stars for I was already looking for some advanced advice or "insider tips" as given in John "Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide".<BR>PS: I puchased its two companions "Landscape" and "People and Portraits" as well. Though both books are nice they only include little that's not already mentioned in this valuable guide!</span>

                    <span>Probably every photographer, whether amateur or professional, has dreamed of being a photographer for NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. Robert Caputo, a photographer who has had work published in the magazine, and Peter Burian offer suggestions for taking photographs like those found in the magazine in their book THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC PHOTOGRAPHY FIELD GUIDE. Though the book has some information on digital photography, it is intended primarily for film users. It has some basic information about photography basics: camera, film, lenses, composition, film, exposure, flash, etc. The information presented in this section is probably better for review for photographers who know the basics rather than those who are new to using the camera. Perhaps the book's greatest strength would be the suggestions for taking action shots, nature shots, and people shots. Examples of work from highly regarded photographers are used to demonstrate the suggestions offered. The book may not be as complete as other books on the subject, bit its compact size and excellent organization makes it a perfect guide to use in the field when a quick question arises.</span>

For a photographer with basic skills and understanding of the roles of aperature and exposure time, this book will open many new doors of creativity. Through the experiences of National Geographic staff photographers, we learn what techniques contribute to successful travel, candid, landscape and other photographic genre.<P>The book contains useful chapters on equipment, film selection, film formats and digital photography. All around, the Handbook is an indispensable addition to anyone's photography library.</span>

                    <span>This book in concise, well-written, and inspirational. Don't think this is only a book for beginners, though it would be my number one choice as a gift for someone interested in starting a serious approach to photography. It's full of clear explanations of what are often misunderstood concepts (e.g., perspective), useful tips, and, best of all, the wonderfully interesting and inspirational "World of Subjects" section where we learn about some NG photographers. They vary widely in style, subject, and equipment choice, but every one is worth reading about and their tips alone are worth the price of this book.<P>Highly recommended for both beginners and experienced photographers. This is a book I return to again and again.</span>
