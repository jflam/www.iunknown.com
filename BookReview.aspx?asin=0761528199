                    <span>The author's heart seeems in the right place and many people will enjoy this book. While I loved the look of the book and the author's playful writing style, I didn't find the actual info as helpul as the info in other better books. For me, the books "Speed Cleaning," and also the book "Simplify Your Life" were more effective. Also, I enjoyed "Speed Cleaning 101," and "Sink Reflections." This author is a good writer, but for the price I found it was not worth the money spent. You may like it though, and I can see where the book would make a fun gift. I hate to write reviews that are anything less than stellar, but there you have it.</span>

Just a rehash of ideas and lists and schedules that have been presented thousands of times before and in much better and more enjoyable style. Not a complete waste but close to it.<BR>By the way, I work as a freelance housekeeper so I do have some experience on the subject.</span>

                    <span>This book is a lifesaver for me. Growing up, my family did the picking up and putting away around the house on a daily basis, and I washed dishes daily, but a housekeeper came in once a week to do the heavy cleaning. My mother ran a successful business, and didn't do much cooking or cleaning at home. Therefore, I didn't learn the way most women do - watching their mothers. Fast forward to my first apartment - hovering over my very own toilet, I wasn't exactly sure how to clean it. Joni Hilton works the house from top to bottom, room by room, explaining exactly what kind of dirt can build up in which places and how to most efficiently get rid of it. She even tells you her favorite cleaing products. Other housekeeping books are such boring Martha Stewart manuals that not only are they a drag to read, but they leave you feeling completely incapable of ever having a clean house. Joni Hilton's book is a quick, funny, light read, and her clean house is very attainable.</span>

                    <span>This book is great. She gets right to the point and lets you know exactly what constitutes a "clean" home. If you want a good housekeeping reference book, this would be a good purchase.</span>
