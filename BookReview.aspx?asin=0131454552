                    <span>The text covers the topic with ample examples and diagrams, plus cases short and long.  The level of detail is appropriate for a graduate level course.  The book is too ...  The authors could eliminate the chapter on the office environment. They should condense the chapters on questionnaires and system presentation.  Another solution: put the lengthy end-of-chapter case material on a CD; it is doubtful that all of it is used in any course.  Perhaps the authors have too much clout to be edited.</span>

                    <span>The Kendalls have definitely created a comprehensive book on systems analysis. Virtually every aspect is covered here, and in plenty of detail. There are plenty of review questions and problems, hypothetical consulting situations, an ongoing case-study, and even an associated web-based case study.<p>While being well written, I feel that this text may be a bit overdone. Most sections are longer than neccessary, over-explaining fairly obvious concepts. So although the reader can never complain about being short-changed, I would be amazed if any reader needed ALL of the explanations to understand what was being discussed. <p>I have also noticed a few cases of dated information creeping through from previous editions. One example is a discussion on groupware that talks about features of Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT, and mentions the 'upcoming' Chicago release. Chicago was the working name for Windows 95, which was hardly 'upcoming' for a text published in 1999.<p>It feels as if the Kendalls have been adding new information to their revised editions, but not revising thoroughly enough to remove old or out of date references. If a really good job of revision was done here, I think this text could be reduced by at least a hundred pages or so without any real loss of useful content.<p>Since it emphasises practice more than theory, it may not appeal to all types, but for anyone who needs to know HOW to be a systems analyst, this is probably the book to read.</span>

                    <span>I used this book in my systems analysis and design course.  First off, it is over priced.  I understand that college books are expensive, but this one was too overpriced.<p>Second, it is not helpful.  It spends chapters talking about how to get information from users.  Did I really need several  chapters to tell me to interview them, send out surveys, and observe them?   That is kind of obvious information.<p>Following this course, I took a  software development course.  The two classes are in series.  Techniques  learned from this book did not help me.  When it came time to write  documents (project proposals, documents for external design and internal  design phases, etc.) this book was no help.  There were no examples of what  should be in them.<p>Not helpful unless you are clueless as to where to  begin.  Even then it's not a tremendous help.</span>

                    <span>I am Tran Ngoc Thuan An, student of Department of Information Technology, Hochiminh City University of Technology.<p>I read the book "System Analysis and Design" through my lecturer's instruction. His name is  Nguyen Manh Tho, teaching the subject : System Analysis and Design.<p>I  found in this book the full teachnique, examples,  illustrations,demotrations and exercises with real applications. <p>I hope  after finish the course, I could work as the System analysist or System  Designer.<p>To me, this book just have 1 drawback. That's some chapter is  still too theorical (e.g chapter 12,14,20,21). It's will better if the  author give more exercise on these chapters.</span>
