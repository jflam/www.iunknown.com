                    <span>This book is down to earth stupid! Through out the text, haviland insults Western countries by saying that they are all uncivilized and their way of life is far inferior when compared w/ other indegineous cultures. If he has a Ph.D., he should know better that insulting any culture is the trait of a narrow-minded person - not a guy who holds a ph.d. He also mocks religion constantly and the book repeats the same thing in several chapters...its like after a while you'll say "dude, we get the point, move on!". Don't buy it, unless u are a college student and your teacher requires it (I don't know y they would).</span>

                    <span>This is among the most frustratingly uninteresting textbooks I've ever read. Every chapter takes the same dull, sensationalistic view of its subject, citing a limitless number of redundant examples of life in lesser-known cultures while condemning every aspect of modern, industrial cultures. Each unit restates the same cliches ad nauseam, and reading this material does nothing to enhance one's appreciation for humanity or for science. It is a terrible and tiresome introduction to anthropology.</span>

                    <span>The editors' review would lead you to believe this is an unbiased, thorough and scholarly examination of cultural anthropology. It is not. There is subtle age, gender, cultural and religious bias. Although it is a thorough look at various cultures, it is by no means comprehensive or accurate. It is inaccurate in highlighted descriptions of minor aspects of Native American culture, especially of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation. It seems to imply Western European cultures and various organized religions are the greatest evil on the planet. The portrayal of some cultures, such as the Malaysian, Pacific Island, and a few of the African Bushmen cultures, are very nice but that is the only redeeming quality of this text. Real scholars should avoid this text at all costs!</span>

                    <span>This text explores human nature in a completely systematic, dry, and cliched manner. It conveys none of the reality of human experience, but merely tells of the customs and practices followed by some societies in a distorted and often sensationalized manner. For example, it portrays Christianity as a religion of snake handling and declares that Christians believe that they eat the body of God in the communion WATER! The text communicates that there is no meaning or reason to human existence, and picks apart each aspect of humanity until there is nothing left but the absurdity of all human thought and belief. If you wish to understand man throughout history, get a firsthand look at what he has written, built, believed, and striven for throughout the ages. Don't go to this book to have your questions answered.</span>
