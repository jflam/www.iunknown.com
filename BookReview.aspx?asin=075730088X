                <span id="Label1"><p>The relationship between a mother and daughter is one of the most profound bonds in life. A mother feels her daughter's first kick during pregnancy, labors to bring her daughter into the world and watches as she takes her first breath of life. Similarly, a daughter opens up a new world and range of emotions to her mother, allowing her to feel an unconditional love she didn't know she possessed.</p> <p>For new moms in awe of their daughter's first step, veteran moms in a panic as their daughter leaves for her first prom, or seasoned moms who have just caught themselves saying "Because I said so!", each will be touched and inspired by these heartwarming stories that share the life-defining moments of the mother/daughter relationship.</p> <p>Celebrity contributions include stories by Jacquelyn Mitchard and Joan Borysenko. Chapters include A Mother's Love; A Daughter's Love; Memories; Challenges; Lessons; Like Mother, Like Daughter; Loss and Healing and Timeless Wisdom. </p> <p>This is the perfect book for all the special women in our lives for Mother's Day, a birthday, or any day.</p></span>

                    <span>This is a beautiful book of short stories about the laughter & tears experienced between mother and daughter and, in some instances, 3 generations of mothers & daughters. There were a few stories that I really didn't see the point in and didn't understand why there were included, but all-in-all, the stories made me laugh and cry. I purchased the book as a mother's day gift for my mom, but had to read it myself first!<P>It's a great gift for yourself or mother/daughter. It's an enjoyable and sometimes tear-jerking read and sometimes a mirror of a relationship you have/had or would like to have.</span>
