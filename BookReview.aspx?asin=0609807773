                    <span>In hindsight, the author's advice seems like obvious common sense tips.  But that's the way all great ideas work: once discovered, you can't imagine how you didn't think of that before.<p>I've loaned the book out to several co-workers and friends, but none of them have opened up the book, so their lives remain chaotic.  Buy the book.  And read it.  You'll be glad you did.<p>Prior to reading this book I had stacks of paper and files scattered around my office, and dozens of to-do items scribbled in three different notebooks and on scraps of paper.  I work hard but I never felt productive because I was aware of all of those action items around me that I wasn't finding the time or energy to get to.<p>After reading the book, my desk is clean, my floor is clear of stacks of "stuff", and there's a set of trays on my desk that gets cleaned out in a methodical manner.  When I'm not at work, I'm not thinking of the hundred things I need to get accomplished the next day, because I have a plan in place.  All thanks to the book.<p>The author's cockpit idea is brilliant, and I'm in the process of trying to apply that idea to my garage and my kitchen at home.  I'm confident that this books will allow me to bring Order to those chaotic spots just like it did for my office.<p>One side note:  the author spends a few pages towards the back of the book trying to sell you her planners.  You might benefit from those planners, but you can adopt most of the author's tips and tricks using standard Franklin or Day-Timer planners instead.</span>

                    <span>I've read several time management and organizing books, and I started this one thinking I'd just get the same thing in a different form.  I was pleasantly surprised!  We were not talked down to about how our spiritual energy is being drained or how our psychological well being is being damaged, the author views organizing as practical and necessary for good business.  There are several little suggestions in this book I had not heard before or had not thought of myself, and they will be very helpful to me.  There's so much to gain from such an inexpensive item.  Buy it and use it!</span>

                    <span>This book gave me the best piece of advice I've ever received about prioritizing at work.  The author suggests that you ask yourself:  "What will make me the most money?"  and prioritize that way.  What a tremendous piece of advice!  It seems so simple, but it's so easy to spend time on busy work, and avoid doing the work that will bring in the bucks.  This book helps you spend much less time on organizing, filing, etc., and clears the way for you to make more money!  What a great, great thing.  Buy it.</span>

                    <span>What a terrific surprise to get "Order from Chaos".  I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down.  What an important book! A treasure of practical help.<p>It's just what I needed, especially now.  I've already organized my office, garage and storage shed, and gave away and threw out lots of "stuff".  I feel more in control and less burdened already.  And I love my pending file.<p>I know I'll keep referring and rereading Liz's book to help me learn to prioritize continually--my biggest weakness.</span>
