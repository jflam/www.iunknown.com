                <span id="Label1"><P> Denver homicide detective Cliff Janeway may not always play by the book, but he is an avid collector of rare and first editions. After a local bookscout is killed on his turf, Janeway would like nothing better than to rearrange the suspect's spine. But the suspect, local lowlife Jackie Newton, is a master at eluding the law, and Janeway's wrathful brand of off-duty justice costs him his badge. <P> Turning to his lifelong passion, Janeway opens a small bookshop -- all the while searching for evidence to put Newton away. But when prized volumes in a highly sought-after collection begin to appear, so do dead bodies. Now, Janeway's life is about to start a precarious new chapter as he attempts to find out who's dealing death along with vintage Chandlers and Twains.  <P> Includes information on John Dunning's new Cliff Janeway novel, <I>The Bookman's Promise,</I> coming soon in hardcover from Scribner</span>

                    <span>John Dunning has written several fiction books, and also a couple of non-fiction books about old-time radio. He at one time was in the bookstore business, which gives him a knowledgeable insight into the world of 'Booked to Die', a story set in the world of secondhand book dealers and a book that has won the Nero Wolfe award. The 2001 paperback edition includes an update written by Dunning, which tells us what has happened since the original release of this book in 1992. Anyone who haunts used book stores and/or likes old-fashioned detective stories will love this book.<P>In 'Booked to Die' we find Cliff Janeway, a member of the Denver police homicide squad and a book collector, wanting nothing else but to take down his nemesis, Jackie Newton. Somebody kills Bobby the bookscout and Cliff is sure it was Jackie. He won't stop until he has pinned the murder on him. Other murders occur, Cliff thinks he has fallen in love (again), and ultimately the story is neatly tied up. This book is a hard-boiled detective story. It's simple, fast reading. I enjoyed following Cliff on his investigations, both lawful and unlawful. He's a great tough-guy.<P>My only complaint is that two of the four main female characters are just awful: Barbara Crowell, Jackie's current interest, says insipid things like, 'God, I hate having you hate me', and Rita McKinley, who everyone calls 'the ice lady', somehow throws all her stoicism out the window and hops into bed with Cliff. Maybe a tough-guy detective needs to bounce off characters like this, but it doesn't play well these days. On the other hand, maybe the fact that I wince is because there are, unfortunately, people out there like Barbara. I highly recommend 'Booked to Die'. Its a great book for sitting by the fire on a rainy day.</span>

                    <span>First of all, this is just a good old-fashioned, hard-boiled detective story. Cliff Janeway starts out as a Denver homicide detective, but Dunning wisely contrives to get him out on his own. Even when he's with the police though, he's none to powerful. He does not have an amoral partner backing him up. He's unlucky at love and he's not an epicure. He's tough, but he has sense enough to be scared of the folks who are truly dangerous. In short, Janeway is a throwback to the lone wolf investigators of yore. <P>But then there's the unique twist that makes what could have been merely a good series into a fascinating one : Cliff Janeway is a bookman. He collects first editions of American Literature, with a particular interest in Faulkner, and in recent years has given increasing thought to becoming a book dealer himself. Ultimately, when circumstances force him to leave the police department, he does indeed open his own store, Twice Told Books. <P>Without taking anything away from the book as a mystery, it really derives it's energy from the world of book collecting. The book is set in 1986, so the prices cited must be hopelessly outdated, but when he talks about first editions of Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot going from $10 to $100 in the space of just ten years, that's an attention grabber. It's especially interesting that the books of horror authors like King and popular authors, like Anne Tyler, have already increased so much in value. I recognize that normal people don't spend the amount of time that I do looking for good, cheap books, but I guarantee that as you read about the details of book collecting, you'll be glancing up at your own bookshelves to see if your's are first editions (with the dust jacket, and not Book of the Month Club editions.) <P>Thanks to this unique angle and the character filled bookman's subculture in which it's set, this is one of the better mysteries series of recent years. <P>GRADE : A</span>

                    <span>Cliff Janeway is a Denver detective who is extremely passionate about books. When a bookscout is murdered, Janeway is put on the case and he begins investigating the Denver antiquarian book community. Janeway ultimately ends up leaving the police force after tangling one too many times with an old enemy, and he opens a book store, though he continues to investigate the bookscout's murder. Along the way, Janeway encounters a number of fascinating characters, all of whom are involved in some way in the book trade.<P>At its heart, this is a 'hard-boiled" detective story, and Janeway can be a bit of a thug at times, but that's part of his charm. The story is told in the first person (from Janeway's perspective, obviously), which I always enjoy. The action is pretty constant and Janeway's investigation is intelligent and doesn't insult the reader with obvious plotholes or pointless subplots. The dialogue is very natural, and often downright clever.<P>The cast of characters is truly outstanding and one of the greatest strengths of the book. Dunning has done a great job of crafting a Denver antiquarian book community that feels real. There are a few passages in the book describing how Janeway or one of the other characters feels about books that really hit home for me - Dunning truly "gets it" - he is clearly a bibliophile who understands what it is to genuinely *love* books.<P>This was the first John Dunning book I've read, but it certainly won't be my last. In fact, I liked "Booked to Die" so much that I've already bought the second Cliff Janeway novel. The book ends on a bit of a bittersweet note and I'm really looking forward to seeing how Janeway's new business and personal relationships progress. If you're a fan of detective stories and you love books, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up!</span>

                    <span>Cliff Janeway starts out as a Denver cop who loves books and winds up in this page-turner as an owner of a rare bookstore who doesn't forget his policing skills. The murders here all have to do with people in the book collecting business so booklovers get a double treat here. Although they are treated to a first class mystery, just as important is page after page of valuable information about collecting first editions. Ms. McKinley, whom Janeway has the hots for, remarks that when you buy "something unique, and pay twice what it's worth, it's a great bargain." And one of my favorite passages is about the worth of a good book. Ruby, a store-owner says: "A book has always cost about what a meal in a good restaurant costs. . . I get sick of hearing how expensive books are. Which would you rather have, a good book or a tender steak? I know what I'd take, seven days a week." I do not know one book lover who would disagree with that statement.<P>Mr. Dunning wastes no time in weighing in on the ongoing debate of "popular" fiction (Stephen King novels) versus the works of writers like Faulkner and Hemingway. (Remember the controversy over King's being given an award at last year's National Book Award Awards?) Janeway opines: "What the hell do I know? I sure can't explain it when a book like SALEM'S LOT goes from $10 to almost $1,000 in ten years. That's half again what a near-perfect GRAPES OF WRATH will bring, if you neeed a point of reference."<P>Oh, back to the story-- the plot twists and turns with surprise after surprise, right up to the last sentence of the novel.<P>I believe this one is a collectible.</span>

Some nice tricks of the book trade also, though some of the values and tips are really dated with the internet now available. Still, this one's guaranteed to give you an intellectual and creepy ride, and is not to be missed!</span>
