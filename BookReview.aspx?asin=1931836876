                <span id="Label1"><I>Stealing the Network</I> is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature film.<p>  One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well short of cyberpunk classics like <I>Burning Chrome</I> and <I>Snow Crash</I>. Its value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers, OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps). The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems (or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network). Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to these stories of packetized adventure. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>Stealing the Network is a collection of fictional stories, using real technologies/programs to describing hacking/cracking techniques as well as detailing what is running through the persons mind as they go through the steps of a hack. At times it was a little hard to believe, and I think there could have been a little more technical info (although there was a good amount), but overall it is a greate concept for a book and a quick read. Recommended to anyone in or interested in computer security.</span>

                    <span>"Stealing the Network" (STN) is an entertaining and informative look at the weapons and tactics employed by those who attack and defend digital systems. STN is similar to the "Hacker's Challenge" books published by Osborne, although the stories are not separated into evidence and resolution sections. Rather, a collection of authors use mildly fictional tales to introduce readers to tactics and techniques used by black and white hat hackers.<P>My favorite chapter was written by FX of Phenoelit, where a female black hat battles white hat defenders. The playing field includes HP printers, GRE tunnels between routers, and other novel tricks. Reading both sides of the story was fun and educational. I also liked Joe "Kingpin" Grand's insider theft case (ch 3), featuring Palm hacks and Blackberry sniffing. The worm disassembly chapter by Ryan Russell and Tim Mullen is worth reading as well.<BR> <BR>This book is worth reading, but it's $... cover price is steep. While the stories are fictional, much of it is probably based on the author's experiences either consulting or studying similar incidents. This book can best be used by security professionals to test how they would have responded to the threats presented by the fictional adversaries profiled in STN. There's plenty to be learned by reading STN, and I hope to see sequels.</span>

                    <span>Target Audience<BR>Anyone with an interest in network security and wants to look into the mind of a network cracker/hacker.<P>Contents<BR>This book is mostly a series of fictional stories written in first-person narrative on what happens during a network attack or an investigation into an attack.<P>The book is divided into the following chapters: Hide And Seek; The Worm Turns; Just Another Day At The Office; h3X's Adventures In Networkland; The Thief No One Saw; Flying The Friendly Skies; dis-card; Social (in)Security; BabelNet; The Art Of Tracking; The Laws Of Security<P>Review<BR>All too often the topic of network security becomes an academic exercise, until it's too late. Companies might know what they should do, and they might even think they are beyond attack. But to a motivated person, your system may be nothing more than swiss cheese. Stealing The Network takes you beyond the technical and into the psychology of an attack.<P>Stealing The Network is a series of fictional stories about network attacks of various sorts. Hide And Seek is an attack on a company's network by a person upset with poor customer service. He steals a credit card file and posts it for others to use. The Worm Turns is an all-night hacking session to dissect the latest internet virus and post a patch before any of the other anti-virus firms do so. Just Another Day At The Office is a story of hacking for organized crime against a firm developing a new type of land mine, and involves both network and physical building intrusion. While it might be easy to dismiss these as the result of a vivid imagination, the reality is that all of these attacks are done on a daily basis. They may even have happened to you at your company, and you just don't know it yet.<P>The final chapter, The Laws Of Security, is a discussion of computer security and how you need to be thinking in order to secure your network. So it's not just a series of stories with no opportunities to learn what needs to be done. Also, each story is detailed with specific software and techniques used to accomplish the hack or the trackdown of the intruder. So as you're reading the story, you're actually picking up the necessary information you need in order to understand the network weakness and how to defend against it.<P>In my opinion, it's this blending of fictional reality that makes this book so valuable. I'd definitely recommend this to any security professional who is looking to understand the person behind the attacks.<P>Conclusion<BR>An excellent read... Takes the subject of network security out of the academic and theoretical and places a face and attitude behind it all, while also teaching you the nuts and bolts of how attacks occur.</span>

                    <span>In some ways I though this would be a recipe book of hacks like most in this category. This book has great stories about hacks from the hackers point of view. It is a lot of fun following the thought process as the hack's progress. There is a technical side to the book, but its buried within the stories. I will go back through the book again and make notes of the different techniques used. <P>So if you're tired of seeing screen shots of a debugger doing hex dump for some nerd stealing or saving the world and want some realistic stories, this is the book to get.</span>

I was entertained throughout and I would recommend this book to other IT or security professionals.</span>
