                    <span>The Roper organization has long been known for the quality and reliability of its data. Now it has given us a remarkable distillation of information in order to show how a select group of people carry more weight in the decision-making processes of the rest of us.<P>In "The Influentials: One American in Ten Tells the Other Nine How to Vote, Where to Eat and What to Buy," Jon Berry and Ed Keller of Roper ASW tell us how certain people stay ahead of the curve and, essentially, create and maintain that most precious of marketing commodities: "word of mouth." <P>Of course, the real trick is discover how channels of influence weave their way through the popular culture and subtly induce us to buy. The "Influentials" among us have mastered this because, according to Berry and Keller, they are more likely to accept new ideas, to ask questions, and to listen carefully. With its fact-based approach, "The Influentials" brings us into the lives of people whose habits, desires and innate characteristics enable them to create the "buzz" that will lead to product success.<P>The book is extremely well documented, with lots of charts and graphs that go back through 30 years or Roper research. As a marketing professional, I was impressed with their arguments and their proven methods. Great book. I say, go for it !.</span>

                    <span>I read a fair number of business books in a given year, and The Influentials is perhaps the best I've read in a very long time. The book is an in-depth examination of that segment of Americans--influentials, early adopters, trend setters, pick your label--marketers drool over. After reading this book, I feel I really have new insights into who these people are, what makes them tick, and what drives their purchasing decisions, among other things. <P>The book sets itself apart in a number of ways. It is grounded in fact, based largely on findings from real research (the authors work for RoperASW, a large marketing research company), not on some fashionable and disposable management theory. At the same time, it is very well written: clear, jargon-free, practical, and fun to read. Also, throughout the book the authors profile real-life 'Influentials' to illustrate their points, which adds a nice human touch so often missing from business books. The authors really know their stuff and synthesize an amazing amount of information into a cohesive, engaging narrative. <P>Highly recommended to marketers who want to reach a desirable segment of the public, and to anyone else interested in consumer trends.</span>

                    <span>This is an important book for marketing professionals to understand the intellegence behind purchases. Many consider average consumers NOT to adequately shop around before making a large expensive purchase. But in fact, we generally ask others to help us. These are the influentials. So this book implies taking away the SEX in car advertizements, etc. For this I absolutely agree. A car is just a car. It has no feelings.</span>

                    <span>"the influentials" could have been a wonderful overview of this very intriguing group of americans. however, in the hands of market researchers, this book is about 15 pages of overview and snapshots of some influentials, followed by 300 pages of charts and corresponding text that re-hashes the charts in sentence form (here's an example, albeit NOT from the book...i'm making this up, but it's on par with what's in the book: "...47% of Influentials recycle plastic. that's 14% higher than the entire population, 12% higher than college-educated Americans, and 5% higher than those in households that make over $75,000/year. Influentials recycle paper at an even higher rate - almost 56%. That compares to 31% for the entire populations..."). i mean, i get it already. essentially, there are about 20 bullet points that define an influential, and there isn't a whole lot more to say after that. the book has little profiles on about 5 or 6 influentials, but could have benefitted from many more of those. disappointing.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the other reviewer that the "influential" 10% selected for this book consists of people who are socially and/or politically active. That's how they were chosen. In my view, it wasn't really shown that this 10% of the population strongly influences the other 90%. Many statistics of this active 10% are given.<P>Influentials do tend to talk a lot.<P>Keller and Berry write "Influentials seem to have an aversion to keep things to themselves. ... They believe it's important to give others information that could help them." (p. 148).<P>So, what do we learn about Influentials?<P>* They are two times more likely to buy online than the average consumer. They like the convenience.<P>* They like to travel and tend to like to cook.<P>* They tend to be "tactical consumers," who shop around to get the best deal.<P>* Influentials tend to be interested in news, politics, the environment, health, technology, and science. They focus upon important "substantive, meaty areas."<P>* Influentials aren't particularly interested in celebrities, sports, fashion or TV culture. (They don't mind public television, because it's educational.)<P>* They value learning and tend to have active minds.<P>* They're not into bowling or extreme sports.<P>* Influentials feel they can control their destiny.<P>* 3 to 1, they would prefer to be entrepreneurs to top executives at big companies.<P>* They don't want to be extremely rich (not more so than non-influentials anyway). But, they want financial security.<P>* Influentials were early adopters of IRA's, 401(k), cell phones, and the Internet.<P>* Influentials read a lot, especially magazines and newspapers.<P>So, for marketers looking for information about the politically/socially active 10% of the population, this book provides many insights. Plus, I think it's interesting reading. However, for marketers looking for specific ways to reach this audience, "The Influentials" seems to offer only a few broad marketing ideas. For example, Keller and Berry write: "If there's a secret to advertising to Influentials, it is to be creative and informative." <P>And, the authors say companies must provide useful information. Keller and Berry write: "Succeeding with Influentials begins with information. A salient, meaningful piece of information is at the very least a conversation starter."<P>Another idea offered is sponsoring a community event or worthy cause. However, the authors point out that Influentials tend to be skeptical of advertising and messages can't just flow down from a company to Influentials. Influentials won't just blindly accept them. Influentials will listen to those they know, incorporating their experiences and their own personal experiences to determine the quality or usefulness of a product. <P>Influentials tend to be good listeners and get feedback from others. Partially, it's their wide experience though personal feedback that makes them a valuable source of information to others.<P>The book points out that Influentials represent an early majority of the market. Whether small cars, back to big SUV's, computers, cell phones, digital cameras, debit cards, or online computer access, Influentials tend to be early adopters of products that subsequently become popular with the general populace. <P>Keller and Berry tell us Influentials don't just adopt any product. They tend to adopt utilitarian products that really add to their lives. But, that seems to reduce marketing to the old maxim, "Build a better mouse trap and they will come," which many marketers don't accept.<P>So, overall, I think "The Influentials" is interesting reading, but I don't know that readers will find it full of useful marketing ideas.</span>
