                    <span>while it is true that Mr. Brady was a Marine and in the Korean War, his writing 45+ years later leaves doubts about it. For example the word Marine is alwaysa used as as proper noun, yet in none of his books does he do this. Secondly, Marines don't wear FATIGUES, they wear UTILITIES. They wear trousers, not pants. Finally, the rank Gunnery Sgt. did not exist during Korea, that rank came out in around '59 or so. The gunny of Korea was a Tech Sdt. for a good book on Korea, read COLDER THAN HELL by Owens, or THE LAST PARRALEL.</span>

                    <span>James Brady's vignette, haunting, poignant, reflective, should take its place along side of William Manchester and John Keegan. The story he tells is not how it should have been, it's not even how he would have liked it to have been. It's like it was. Brady is like any other 19 year old, brash, filled with adventure, drunk on promise and the illusion of immortality. Then he signs up with the Marine Reserves if not avoid, then to postpone his own appointment with destiny. Unfortunately, destiny has a mind of its own, and a few years later he finds himself the Platoon Commander of a Marine Rifle platoon on Hill 749, in the winter of 1951, in Korea.<p>Brady doesn't judge. I like that most about his reflections on a horrible war in a freezing place. If you want to hang Truman, MacArthur, Eisenhower, and John Foster Dulles, this is probably the wrong book for you. It is brilliant but it tells only the story of one man-boy's experience placed in charge of 40 men in combat.<p>To some extent we look down on those boys. We judge them, forgetting that like us, they too were caught in the flotsam of other people's decisions. Although with most of us, the whole world doesn't subsequently judge us. War's change, the technology of killing becomes more sophisticated, sides change, enemies become friends, and bad guys become good guys.  Frequenly we forget that it's the young men who take the fire. The greatest homily to Brady and the only self serving remark he makes would be truly understood by a few. When he leaves the fields where 54,000 died, he says, "I hadn't lost any men . . "<p>Brady reminds us that young men are faced with terrible decisions when politicians, frequently never in harm's way, put them into unexplained and perhaps unnecessary combat. We should not judge those boys. And we should not judge them after they become men. 5 stars. A sobering read.To Jim Brady, if no one told you, welcome home.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a very written account of a young man's experience with the Korean War.  It starts with his introduction at a green infantry officer to departing as an intelligence officer.  The excellent narrative describes what it was like to serve in different parts of Korea in different seasons.</span>

                    <span>This book is a memoir of Mr. Brady's year long experience as a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps during Korean War.  Like many Americans of my generation, I have limited knowledge of this conflict and "Coldest War" helped to shed some light on what went on and what the fighting was like.  More importantly, the author talks about the people he met and the everyday experiences they had while living in Korea.<p>Mr. Brady has an interesting combination of elitism for being a Marine Corp officer and humility.  He admits to being a regular guy trying to survive extrodinary circumstances.  Without trying to do so, Brady has written an interesting guide on leadership.  I'd recommend this book to history buffs as well as anyone who manages a group of people.  Both will learn something valuable.</span>

                    <span>James Brady's memoir is perhaps the best written history of the Korean War from a solo combatant's perspective.  True, this is a story from one voice, foresaking input from others and largely devoid of big-picture strategic discussions.  The focus is almost entirely on Brady's year in-country.  It is a verbal scrapbook of one soldier's experience, helped mightily in its presentation by Brady's gift with words.  This is a ground-level view of the static, trench warfare that bogged the Korean conflict from late 1951 onward.  The reader gets candid, personal recollections of a young marine lieutenant-- not just the gritty reality of combat, but of the miserable living conditions of living half underground in bitter cold.  Read this veritable novel in one weekend.</span>
