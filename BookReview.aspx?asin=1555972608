                <span id="Label1">This book so speaks to the contemporary writer that it is nearly impossible to  believe that it was originally published in 1938. In <i>If You Want to Write</i>, Brenda  Ueland sets forth not just a philosophy about how to write or how to create, but also  about how to live. Beginning writers will certainly be encouraged by Ueland's words, but  even the most experienced have much to glean from Ueland's simple wisdom.  "Everybody," writes Ueland in the opening chapter, "is talented,  original, and has something important to say." Finding that something important  involves embracing creative idleness ("the imagination needs moodling--long,  inefficient, happy idling, dawdling and puttering"), freeing "what we  <i>really</i> think, from what we think we ought to think," and "thumb[ing]  your nose at all know-it-alls, jeerers, critics, doubters." One must think, she says,  "of telling a story, not of writing it." And when revising one's writing, she  advises, "do not try to think of better <i>words</i>, more gripping words.... It is  not yet deeply enough imagined." Finally, "whenever you find yourself  writing a single word or phrase or page dutifully and with boredom, then leave it out.... If  what you write bores you, it will bore other people." And just because <i>If You  Want to Write</i> is passionate, sincere, and even spiritual, do not think it is not also  witty. One footnote bluntly declaims, "No doubt my terms would horrify a  psychologist but I do not care at all." Elsewhere Ueland titles a chapter "Why  Women Who Do Too Much Housework Should Neglect It for Their Writing."  Amen, sister!</span>

                    <span>"Light on Yoga" is my yoga bible and "If You Want to Write" is my writing bible. I began reading this book on the Summer Solstice of June 1987 (I scribbled the date inside the book cover)and have read it in bits and pieces ever since. No matter what page my gemini mind jumps to, a jewel jumps back at me. This morning it was:
<br />
<br />"I used to have to drive myself to work. You cannot imagine what an uncomfortable, effortful thing it was supposed to be, to be a writer... It was my class who showed me I was working in the wrong way... I learned from them that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it energetic striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness. I learned that you should feel when writing, not like Lord Byron on a mountain top, but like a child stringing beads in kindergarten,--happy, absorbed and quietly putting one bead on after another."
<br />
<br />Go Look Inside This Book and see for yourself what it's all about. I especially recommend it if you are a woman at midlife and beyond! If you still find yourself cleaning house instead of writing, go straight to Chapter 10: "Why Women who do too much housework should neglect it for their writing." Amen!

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is based upon Brenda Ueland's experience teaching creative writing to adults and her success at freeing many of her students from inhibitions that prevented them from writing well.  It is basically a "pep talk" for anyone who thinks they cannot write or have nothing important to say.   And it has some interesting insights about the mysterious nature of inspiration and the role leisure plays in creativity.  ["Leisure: The Basis of Culture," by Josef Pieper, is a more advanced exploration of this theme.]  However, the book is interlaced with so much dubious philosophy that I cannot recommend it.
<br />
<br />For example, on page 129, Brenda begins with this gem:  "I have come to think that the only way to become a better writer is to become a better person."  However, she then ruins this thought by saying that by "better person" she does not mean a good person "for a great person often does things that so-called good people think very bad indeed."  She does not explain what she means by a great person.  But it seems to mean someone who is an independent thinker; an astute observer who does not accept social conventions or values that cannot be affirmed through their own inner wisdom.  Brenda does not consider the possibility that one's inner "truth" can be faulty.
<br />
<br />She relies upon quotations from the poet William Blake (one of her great people), entitling Chapter Five: "Sooner Strangle an Infant in its Cradle than Nurse Unacted Desires," based upon one of his noble sentiments about deferred gratification.  Blake saw visions and heard voices which he believed were Divine rather than demonic.  Brenda also prefers this interpretation and thus agrees with Blake's conclusion that our inner voice which says "Thou shalt" is our true conscience, while the voice that counsels "Thou shalt not" is the product of learned behavior and should be rejected.  (See page 13 and footnote on page 35.)
<br />
<br />Later, on page 174, the author reveals herself to be a ho-hum, garden-variety relativist.  She writes, "If it is true to you, it is true.  Another truth may take its place later.  What is truly from me is true, whether anybody believes it or not.  It is my truth."
<br />
<br />The problem with all this philosophy is that the author tells the reader that they too must tend toward the amoral and asocial aspects of the psychopathic personality if they want to be an independent thinker and hence, a great writer.  She teaches that the end justifies the means.  Whatever gets the creative juices flowing is justified.  And the stream of consciousness that gushes forth, whether polluted or pristine, is art.  It is art because it is true to the inner self of the artist, who has learned to cast off all restraint, fear, and ambition.  (I wonder what Brenda would think about the latest notions of modern psychology that radical independence is a less mature emotional state than cooperative inter-dependence?)
<br />
<br />Finally, the author presents her view as an either/or scenario.  Either you adopt the reckless and rule-less approach to writing, or you're creativity will be stymied.  She does not allow for the option that one can be creative and value-oriented at the same time.  Potential readers of this work should be aware that behind the enthusiastic pep talk there lurks a relativistic philosophy which may not correspond with their personal beliefs.</span>

                    <span>I found this woman to be a bit crazy.  One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate.  She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view.  I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash.  She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way.  It's like a recipe for disaster.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.  Take from it what you will.</span>

                    <span>I happened by this book while browsing a bookstore.  I luckily bought it.  I read it cover to cover the next day.  I never read a book cover to cover.  It was so applicable to my son and his mother and I.  He is studying music.  The book isn't just about writing, it's about art.  It's about pursuing art for art's sake.  It's about pursuing life for life's sake.  It gives us permission to tell our son to concentrate on making music and that making money should not be the driving force behind it.  I think an 18 year old needs to hear this, if he hasn't already figured it out.  The author tells us we all know the way as children.  Trash is inserted in our heads as we grow up and we then spend most of your lives trying to remove it.  If you know an artist or someone that needs a lift, but this book for them.  What the author wrote in 1938 stills applies today.       </span>
