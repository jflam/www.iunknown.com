                <span id="Label1"><P> Set in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s, <I>Wait Till Next Year</I> is Doris Kearns Goodwin's touching memoir of growing up in love with her family and baseball. She re-creates the postwar era, when the corner store was a place to share stories and neighborhoods were equally divided between Dodger, Giant, and Yankee fans. <P> We meet the people who most influenced Goodwin's early life: her mother, who taught her the joy of books but whose debilitating illness left her housebound: and her father, who taught her the joy of baseball and to root for the Dodgers of Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, and Gil Hodges. Most important, Goodwin describes with eloquence how the Dodgers' leaving Brooklyn in 1957, and the death of her mother soon after, marked both the end of an era and, for her, the end of childhood.</span>

                    <span>Wait Till Next Year, by Doris Kearns Goodwin, is a stunning autobiography about the connections between her hometown, her school, and her team. The book, based in the 1950's, gives tremendously reliable and accurate information on baseball, predominantly her favorite team the Brooklyn Dodgers. Goodwin's collection of beaten red scorebooks served as a diary of her whole life. At age six Goodwin's father taught her to keep score and "a lasting bond had been forged among my father, baseball, and me" (Wait Till Next Year. Goodwin. 13). Goodwin had a passion for Jackie Robinson's career as the second baseman for the Dodgers and the first black player in the major leagues. Goodwin documents the careers of other favorite Dodger players: Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella (two other black players playing for the Dodgers), Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, and rookie pitcher Clem Labine. The book is about her childhood and her keen interest in the Brooklyn Dodgers, their games, players, and box scores. Growing up in an intimate bedroom community of New York City, all the neighbors were close. Goodwin lived a sheltered, storybook life. At the end of the book, as Goodwin gets older, her perfect unravels. First, her neighborhood disintegrated, neighbors moved to cities all over the country. The Brooklyn Dodgers moved to the West Coast, along with another New York baseball team, the Giants. One baseball team remained in New York, the Yankees. Her best friend Elaine moved to Albany. Goodwin's mother, who had been suffering from a failing heart condition, died leaving her father incredibly distraught. Goodwin's father sold the only home his children had ever known, because it was tainted with memories of his late wife.<BR>I would recommend this book to anyone with a love and a passion for baseball. The thrill of hearing every detail makes the games easily imaginable. For a baseball-lover like me, remembering some of the greatest players in history and reliving some of the most exciting games ever played is a major thriller. Goodwin does an incredible job transcribing these games and players from her red scorebook memories with meticulous detail; one can easily live in every moment. This book reads easily, but slowly. If you love to live in your books, Wait Till Next Year is a good choice for you.<BR>Goodwin writes in very scrupulous detail, thus, the book reads very slowly. Her meticulous dwelling on some subjects can be dull and provide an excuse to skip a page or two. While Wait Till Next Year is an easy read, the multiple pages of detail on each subject make the book a very slow read. It is a long book, and her extensive points slow your speed of reading. Wait Till Next Year is an intriguing story that provides its readers with insight into baseball. The passion that the author shared with her father provides the backdrop for learning about this riveting game, which truly is a Great American Pass-time.</span>

                    <span>In "Summer of 98," Mike Lupica's remembrance of that classic baseball season, he describes parents and children's shared enjoyment of the game as "a love inside a greater love." In Lupica's case, the season's home run and pennnant races bonded Lupica to his children and to his father, with whom he shared Roger Maris' chase of Babe Ruth's home run record years earlier. In "Wait 'Till Next Year," what to Lupica was a daily generational journal becomes a bittersweet coming-of-age story to writer/historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.<P>Goodwin wraps her memoir around her family's shared love of the Brooklyn Dodgers: years of dissapointment (including 1951's infamous playoff loss to the New York Giants) to their 1955 championship season (recalled sweetly and vividly as the neighborhood celebration it was), and their treasonous 1958 move to Los Angeles. Goodwin grows to know and love the game, learning statistics, meeting legendary ballplayers like Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, and Jackie Robinson, sharing her passion for the game with friends and family.<P>Goodwin's story rings more powerful for its evocation, wistfulness, and sweeping sadness. She details the human face to the classic 1950s family image: successful, loving father, doting mother, precocious children, friendly (and cantankerous) neighbors, friends, shopkeepers. She shares the summer warmth of Jones Beach, nights at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field or by the radio with Red Barber, Sundays in church loving and learning her Catholicism.(not to mention schooldays listening to the World Series, which we may never see again). Security rested in tradition: the Dodgers' starting nine, clear answers to her Cathecism, friends and family there for her and each other.<P>The young Goodwin dreams and believes greater things, enabled by parents allowing her self-expression and growth unusual for young girls then. Her vivid imagination wins a Dodger pennant by breaking the limbs of players on rival teams, her cajoling saves the Dodgers for Brooklyn, her care helps a potentially polio-stricken boyfriend, her beauty and wiles win Rhett Butler and allow her to read every book in her public library. Throughout, Goodwin also feels the requisite Catholic guilt; her confession after attending a Campanella speech strikes you with humor and pathos. (You wish you could know more about her love for the then-new rock and roll, and how that differentiated her and her friends from their parents.)<P>The 1950s' seismic events (Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's treason, the McCarthy hearings and her friends' eerie re-creations of them, the 1956 Arkansas school integration, Sputnik) erode her security and faith. But in Chapter Seven, Goodwin chronicles losing what she valued most: friends and a team who moved, her mother dying in her sleep, her beloved home. These permanent changes left her and her father, who endured loss throughout his life, grieving but stronger for their shared experience. (Goodwin's descriptions of her mother were particularly moving; like her, my mother was sickly, had endured loss in her past, loved to read books and passed away at an early age.) <P>The book's title refers to the Dodgers' end-of-season mantra after years losing the World Series to the hated New York Yankees. To Goodwin and her surviving family, it is also a slogan of resilience, that through preserving the past we keep those we love -- relatives, friends, heroes, neighborhoods, eras -- close. This is consistent with Goodwin's subsequent life and career choices, from her marriage and new love of the (equally heartbreaking) Boston Red Sox, to her passing baseball tradition to her children, to her becoming a full-time historian. In "Wait Till Next Year," Doris Kearns Goodwin did in a meticulous, personal way what "Forest Gump" did as Hollywood spectatcle: insert her life and aspirations into some of history's most important events. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Memoir of Doris Kearns' younger years, as an avid Brooklyn Dodgers fan. Although baseball was her obsession, the story is about much more than baseball - it's about life in the 50's, childhood spent outside or at the corner soda shop, the importance the community had at that time, and the troubles and changes that adolescence brings.<P>Great memoir, and incredibly well written and told. I thought the book was excellent, even though I glossed over the baseball parts of it! Read this for my library book group, I never would've picked this one up on my own.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book the first and second time I read it. Doris Kerns Goodwin writes about her early years in post-war Long Island with grace.<BR> This memoir reads like a charming novel - the details are wonderful, the characters are people we come to care about, and young Doris is someone you will smile with and cry with. <BR> I've recommended this book to friends and students (I teach adult ed creative writing workshops). Everyone thanks me. If you want a good book by a good author check this one out. If you're considering writing your own memoir study WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR to see how it should be done!</span>
