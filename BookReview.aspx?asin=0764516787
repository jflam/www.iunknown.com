                <span id="Label1">The multimedia and computer-games industry has exploded in recent years.&#160; Games have gotten incredibly sophisticated&#8212;and incredibly entertaining. The programs used to create them have improved also, to the point that you don&#8217;t necessarily have to be a nerd deluxe to do it yourself. Even so, game programming can be challenging&#8212;even if you&#8217;re a veteran C/C++ programmer and licensed technogeek. Challenging, sure&#8230;but also incredibly cool.   <p>   Using DirectX&#8212;the latest and greatest technology for making games on PCs&#8212;<i>Windows Game Programming For Dummies</i> will help you write just about any 2D game you can conjure. Now updated to cover new DirectX and Windows releases, your friendly yellow-and-black companion and bonus CD-ROM sidekick will show you:    <ul>    <li>The basics of video game design    <li>The nuts and bolts of Windows programming    <li>How to work with DirectX&#8212;and play with DirectDraw    <li>How to make a real game, with an actual, step-by-step example    <li>How to market your mind-blowing new creation    <li>The ten biggest mistakes made by game programmers&#8212;and how to avoid them    </ul>   <p>   From graphics to sound to input and installation, legendary game developer and Xtreme Games CEO Andr&#233; LaMothe takes you right into the guts of the game&#8212;in an entertaining style that won&#8217;t send you retreating to the nearest joystick. Andr&#233;&#8217;s witty, he&#8217;s tons of fun, and before you know it he&#8217;ll have you up to speed on:    <ul>    <li>Setting up your game programming workstation    <li>Getting into DirectDraw: animation techniques, bitmaps, color keying, and more    <li>Adding Direct X subsystems such as DirectSound, DirectInput, and AutoPlay    <li>Getting your hands dirty by making a real game    </ul>    <ul>    <li>The physics of asteroids and other flying objects: time, velocity, force, and all that    <li>Game programming websites, downloads, 3D engines, usenet groups, and more!    </ul>   <p>   The free CD-ROM includes Microsoft DirectX application programming interface SDK v. 8.1; Paint Shop Pro evaluation version; examples, games, and source code from the book; and bonus chapters. So what are you waiting for? If you have C and a dash of C++ under your belt, and have a computer (duh!), you&#8217;re all set to get in the game.    </span>

                    <span>Given that you (a) know C and C++ programming and (b) have some experience programming in the windows environment, this is a fantastic introduction to using DirectX to write games. Andre doesn't show you how to do each and every little detail of how to write a game, but successfully introduces you to all the basics you'll need and sends you on your merry way. The samples on the disc are fantastic, and even I was surprised how quickly all the pieces came together to the point where you could write a workable game engine. He's even nice enough to do some basic explanations of physics and AI to help you with the "tricky" parts of making a game that is interesting.<P>True, the subject "for Dummies" is a bit of an exaggeration, given that it's really "Windows Game Programming for Programmers Who Have Never Written Games Before", but it's wrong to bash the book for not teaching C programming or windows programming, or for not including a full-blown C compiler! I guess this is one case where it would be nice for those complaining folks to be able to browse the book before they buy it with incredibly high expectations.</span>

                    <span>I have read several dummies books in the past and quite frankly I told myself I'd never purchase a 'Dummy Book' again because I thought they were all just terrible, and only successful because of the marketing team at IDG. :) But I had to purchase this book for one of my classes in college. I was actually suprised that it wasn't bad at all and quite good. The writing style is pretty clear cut with no ambiguity. A good brief overview of DirectX. In some cases the author is not very clear about things because he would have to get into lengthly language sematics or OO abtract concepts like COM but if you know C or C++ with Data Structures you shouldn't have any problems with this book at all. In fact, if you are an aspiring game programmer this is probably one of the best books to get your start in, you can then move on to more advanced stuff later like 3d programming. <P>This book will not teach you C or C++! You have to already know it and contrary to the cover stating that you need a little C (probably there to generate sales), you should at least know data strutures (stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, etc...). If you know that you won't have any problem with this book and you can breeze right through it and you'll be writing video games in no time, but not 3d games it does not cover that. The reason why I say having data structures is important because it was proven in my class, the only students remaining in the class at the end of the semester had a data structures class already or were concurrently taking one. Everyone with just a C class or some C experience dropped.<P>My only complaint with the book was that in some sections the author would just skim over material sometimes not providing any explaination on what is going on. But if you know how to research you can find it elsewhere which is usually a trait of a successful developer.<P>I've outline my opinion on the requisites to this book and hopefully will help you in your buying decision, I definately recommend this book even if you want to just write games for fun or just want to see how it is done.</span>

                    <span>The book starts out great, with clear step-by-step explanations about everything. One really begins to feel like they're getting somewhere. However, just over half way through, the author abandons this step-by-step approach and dumps a massive 'library' of code in front of you with little explanation, and leaves you for dead. From here, one is expected to tinker with the existing code, making alterations as necessary to fit one's own idea for a game. A very disappointing conclusion to what started out as a great book.</span>

                    <span>This book is really good for a begginer just getting into the world of game programming. It describes every aspect of game programming, and does a great job of making DirectX easy and entertaining. It even comes with 2 simple sample games and a game engine to make your first games easy. It also goes into a lot of detail about how DirectX and Windows works. But beware! the parts on DirectX can be very confusing if you skim. I also would have liked it if the author gave more code samples in the book itself so you can see how it all works. Nevertheless, if you want an introduction to the world of DirectX with C++, buy it. Oh, and get Visual C++ because it took me hours to get the game engine to work on my Metrowerks Codewarrior. That's what real game programmers use anyway. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Reading the author's brief bio reveals he's not really a programmer, and certainly hasn't programmed any of the high-tech games that came out in the last few years. Being an actual game developer myself, I don't see much value in this book. The only value is the beginner stuff about coding and basic game programming concepts. The book does present a lot of code, but in a way it satisfies a lazy dummy's desire to see what programming code looks like. Real game programming in these days of 3-D bells and whisles is much more complicated. I haven't got around writing a true game programming primer yet -- and in the publishing business it's often whom you know rather than how much you know about the subject that gets you a book contract -- but let me say this. If you want to write games, develop a solid foundation in C++, program a lot on a daily basis, and go work for a game company, or publish your own games as freeware. Reading a book and poring over somebody else's old-time code won't make you a game developer.</span>
