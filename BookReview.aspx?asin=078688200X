Rather than winning through intimidation, Jackson -- who describes himself as a Zen Christian -- stresses awareness, compassion and most of all selfless team play. Filled with stories about Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Toni Kukoc and other members of the Bulls, Sacred Hoops reveals how Jackson directs his players to act with a clear mind; to respect the enemy and be aggressive without anger or violence; to live in the moment and stay calmly focused in the midst of chaos, so that the "me" becomes the servant of the "we." <P> In Sacred Hoops, Jackson takes us inside the mind of the thinking man's coach as he builds one of the greatest teams of all time. Not just for sports fans, this inspiring memoir is for anyone interested in the potential of the human spirit.</span>

                    <span>Not only does Phil Jackson take you inside the Chicago Bulls, like a passenger, he lets you into his life story here. I read this book about 5 times since buying it. Phil keeps the interest level high. My main criticism about him and the book is that it might talk about Zen a little too much at times. I understand explaining his philosophy, but after awhile it gets redundant. 
<br />
<br />I came to love Phil Jackson as coach of the Chicago Bulls. I came to feel the opposite about him when he coached the Lakers. I guess it depends on your view of the teams. Now that Jackson no longer coaches the Lakers I can see it wasn't him that I viewed as the enemy so much as the cockiness of his main star Kobe Bryant. I despise Kobe. Much like I despised Larry Bird in his playing days (being a 76ers fan it was natural to feel that way about Bird). I felt different about Bird in his coaching days and came to respect and, well LIKE Coach Larry Bird.
<br />
<br />I just bought/pre-ordered 2 more Phil Jackson books: The Last Season: A Team In Search Of It's Soul & More Then A Game. I will write reviews on those books as soon as I recieve and read them.</span>

                    <span>Whether you are a basketball fan or not, this is an extremely enjoyable book about Phil Jackson and his coaching approach. We know that, despite his uniqueness, Phil has proved that his methods of coaching are successful. In this book, you get a peek at what he was doing and thinking while coaching the Chicago Bulls, before and immediately after Jordan's first retirement. He is quite candid also about his past as a child, a basketball player, and as a coach before he got to the NBA. He explains the evolution of his personality and personal philosophy over the span of his life. It's fascinating. I loved it, and couldn't stop reading.<p>Review by:  Evan Finer, author of "Effortless WellBeing"</span>

                    <span>When a person picks up Phil Jackson's "Sacred Hoops" for the first time and reads the first few chapters, he or she will find it very difficult to categorize.  Is it a sports biography?  Is it a guide to Zen and Native American spirituality?  Is it a manual on leadership?  The answer is that it is all of these things and much more.<p>I read "Sacred Hoops" through the lens of how it could make me a more effective leader in a school setting.  I found anecdotes in this story applicable to the classroom, the athletic field, in the boardroom, and my personal life.<p>While "Sacred Hoops" does chronicle Phil Jackson's numerous triumphs as a player, a CBA coach, an assistant coach, and eventually as the head coach of the 3-time World Champion Chicago Bulls, the most important elements of this text are not the accolades won, but rather the means by which they were achieved.  The two primary lessons of Jackson's that can be directly applied to the field of leadership is to teach one's employees/players/students about the essential nature of awareness and selflessness to the success of the organization.  Of course, these two tenants were a difficult sell in the NBA during the Michael Jordan era just as they are today in the age of Kobe and the Lakers.<p>By educating his players on the basic Zen Buddhist principles of visualization and awareness, Jackson is able to create a workforce that is better at communicating with one another, more creative and innovative even under highly stressful situations, and more solidly unified in a "sacred" cause that they are personally and collectively invested in.  A manager who could instill these values in his or her workforce will become the leader of an extremely successful and efficient organization.<p>It is no coincidence that Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal did not win their first NBA titles until Phil Jackson became their coach.  Phil's second major theme of "Sacred Hoops"--the concept of selflessness--is the key that enabled two of the game's greatest players to finally reach "the promise land."  He instills in his superstar player through the 11th and 12th man on the bench that "The power of We is stronger than the power of Me."  Coach Jackson's discussion of the numerous team-building techniques that he has used over the years is the most valuable facet of Sacred Hoops for me.  His schooling of his players to learn how to play with compassion instead of fear, and to reconnect with their pure love of the game of basketball is absolutely inspiring.<p>Reading this book in June of 2004, it is hard to imagine how torturous it must have been to work with the Los Angeles Lakers during this year's NBA Finals.  The attitude projected by his star players--Kobe and Shaq--is the antithesis of the principles of awareness and selflessness that this book so passionately endorses.  It does not surprise me in the least that Coach Jackson and the Lakers have now parted ways.  Perhaps he will have some more time to relax in Montana and pen another insightful and spiritual tome like this one.</span>
