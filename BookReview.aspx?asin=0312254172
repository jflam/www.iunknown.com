                    <span>This book is great for really diving into the history and people of the road -- past and present. We "said Hi to Fran" at the Midpoint Cafe as the book suggested -- turned out to be one of the highlights of the trip.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing the earlier reviews of the maps might have been reviewing an older edition, because we didn't have trouble following the directions (but we used this book in conjunction with the directions from the Here It Is Map Series). </span>

                    <span>I keep mine in my van. I found a lot of sites using the booklet! Vary  useful finding alinements and landmarks of the Mother Road. Great reading for roadies. It's one of the better road guide books I've found for cruising Route 66.</span>

                    <span>We tried using this book on a recent trip on Route 66.  Not only does he  use outdated maps, with old street names, but has he even tried following  this book himself?  Most of the time, when we tried to follow his  directions, we got completely off-course.  One memorable time, he got us on  an old, run-down alignment that  literally had only one lane!  Luckily, we  had only one on-coming car to pass (which was accomplished by both cars  driving on their respective shoulders!)  I think he just phones in the  "updates!"  The only reason he gets even one star is because  there is some interesting history in this book.  However, I wonder if any  of his historical facts are correct, since he gives so much misinformation  otherwise!</span>

                    <span>10 years ago, Tom Snyder compiled the first modern guide to driving Route 66.  For this third edition, Snyder has thoughtfully separated the driving directions ("Traveler's Guide") from his trove of 66-related  anecdotes ("Roadside Companion"), making the book more useful.   The guide's most distinctive features are reproductions of period maps from  the Automobile Club of Southern California, over which the route of the  modern Interstate has been superimposed.<p>Snyder's book is a fun read and  quite helpful for planning a Route 66 drive.  But once you're on the road,  BY FAR the most useful navigational aid is Bob Moore and Patrick Grauwels'  *The Illustrated Guidebook to the Mother Road*, which unlike Snyder's book  provides turn-by-turn directions and mileage.</span>
