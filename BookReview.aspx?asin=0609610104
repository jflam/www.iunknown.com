                    <span>The book is well written, but it doesn't live up to how it is advertised. It consists of a long introduction and 10 chapters (prescriptions, as the author put it). You can read what they are in Editorial reviews, so just to illustrate what to expect from each prescription, here are the exercises from the first chapter: 
<br />1. Must be done with a friend. Relax, picture a capsule of light around friend's body, cup your hand over her head, feel her energy. 
<br />2. Same as previous but should be done with strangers in the mall (or any other public place). 
<br />3. Do basic breathing exercise and at the end of it picture a tail stretching down from your spine, connecting you to the earth. 
<br />4. Relax for 5 minutes and direct your intention to your third eye (it is somewhere between your eyebrows). 
<br />5. Observe babies around you and how they are able to live in the now and learn from them. 
<br />6. Find your pulse and feel it. 
<br />7. Adopt a mantra and repeat it when you need to protect yourself from negative energy. 
<br />8. Learn to take mini technology fasts: check e-mail less frequently, don't fax for few hours... 
<br />The title of the first chapter is: Awaken intuition and rejuvenate yourself. I feel that none of the exercises helped me do that. I didn't find the exercises in other chapters helpful either. And the exercises are the best thing in the book! The rest is just stories from author's and her friends and patients lives, that just go on and on and teach you nothing. Also, there is a constant self-important and self-congratulatory tone to the author's writing, that I found irritating.</span>

                    <span>I'm so grateful for Dr. Orloff's own positive energy and sharing of her wisdom and knowledge with all who read her work.  Her deep insight into how to transform our stressed out lives from the constant daily challenges we all encounter, into  wonderful, extraordinary and perhaps most importantly, healthy lives, has helped myself and so many of the people I hold dear and close to my heart. I have been so impressed by this book, that I have given it as a gift to almost everyone I know and recommend it to all of my patients families.  All have appreciated the practical down-to-earth tools that Dr. Orloff shares with  her warmth, humor and compassion.  You can see from so many loving reviews that have been posted how Dr. Orloff's work has touched the hearts of so many.  I only want to add another voice to that long list that says, Dr. Judith Orloff, thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you for making the world a far more positive place  by sharing your truly extraordinary prescriptions for transformation with us. </span>

                    <span> I have to admit I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this book. I thought it would be another one of those preachy self help books with the same ol' story. 
<br />  I found Dr. Judith Orloff's book an exciting breath of fresh air. I could not put it down. As an energy psychiatrist she has a very intuitive perspective on people and life.
<br />  she talks about the energy vampires in our life and what can be taking our energy from us. She gives us great ways to restore it. 
<br />  One part of the book that I loved was the guidance she gives on developing your own intuitive spirituality. Rather than coming from a Religious perspective she guides us to listen to our own inner voice.
<br />  After reading this book, I felt lighter more hopeful, creative. She helps us tap into that part of ourselves that in today's society we have often suppressed, our passions, spirituality, sensuality, need for gentle quiet time, Our need to find what inspires and moves us. She shows us that we need to not just exist in this world, but live. live every moment of life. I feel a whole new energy awakened in me, and I hope you will too.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Orloff has written a book that is sorely needed in today's rush-through world. After reading it, you will be much more conscious of your own precious energy, how to conserve it and expend it, as well as how to avoid other people and situations that are energy draining. This book is an excellent investment in your mental health!</span>

                    <span>I hardly dared hope for such a breakthrough as this book. Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist, is pioneering the integration of intuition with psychiatry. The day has dawned when even doctors will use intuition for diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, Dr. Judith Orloff gives us these 10 Extraordinary Prescriptions for problems of energy, heart, and soul.
<br />
<br />Dr. Judith Orloff teaches psychiatry at UCLA, maintains a private practice, lectures, and conducts seminars all over the country. She is also the author of Dr. Judith Orloff's Guide to Intuitive Healing   and  Second Sight. 
<br />
<br />In Positive Energy: 10 Extraordinary Prescriptions for Transforming Fatigue, Stress, and Fear into Vibrance, Strength, and Love, Dr. Orloff offers us specific, practical prescriptions to enable us to:
<br />
<br />- Protect ourselves from energy vampires 
<br />- Design an energy-aware approach to diet, fitness and health (including how to stop energy-defensive eating)
<br />- Develop a heart-centered sexuality 
<br />- Awaken intuition and rejuvenate ourselves 
<br />- Find a nurturing spiritual path
<br />- Generate positive energy to counter negativity 
<br />- Open to the flow of inspiration and creativity 
<br />- Celebrate the sacredness of laughter, pampering, and replenishment of retreat 
<br />- Attract positive people and situations 
<br />- Create abundance
<br />
<br />The energetic approach of this book is what makes it so practical. Dr. Judith Orloff posits intuition as a normal part of life for everyone. With this in place, and working from a viewpoint of energy, problems become clear. The Prescriptions are easy to follow. This book can teach us to respect what energizes us and to avoid what drains us. It sounds so simple, but stop and think. Dr. Judith Orloff points out that we know what we want to eat for its taste, and asks whether we have noticed what it does for our energy level? No wonder we're tired - we've been eating delicious but tiring food! How simple it is to switch to delicious and energizing food. 
<br />
<br />The same applies to people - we link up with energy vampires people who drain our energy. Dr. Judith Orloff explains in detail how to get away from these energy vampires in almost any situation.
<br />
<br />The word Prescriptions in the title is apt. I should point out that they prescribe things to do, not chemicals to swallow. These are very specific, practical, and easy things to implement in our lives. The difference they make could be tremendous.
<br />
<br />The writing is up-beat and friendly. Each chapter varies its pace with a Prescription and an interview with people such as Quincy Jones, Amy Gross, Naomi Judd, Iyanla Vanzant, Eve Ensler, Shirley MacLaine, Wavy Gravy, Larry King, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Rosa Parks.
<br />
<br />Positive Energy: 10 Extraordinary Prescriptions for Transforming Fatigue, Stress, and Fear into Vibrance, Strength, and Love offers practical improvements for life today. It also holds hope for the future - not only for each of us personally, but also for intuitively attuned energy in medicine and in every aspect of life.
