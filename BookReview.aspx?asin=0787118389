                    <span>In an easy to read format, and in his absolutely honest way, Mark has written a fantastic guide for communication with anyone in business. While some people are different and have odd preferences, the ideas in this book show how deal with just about anyone in a professional manner. A must read.</span>

                    <span>According to research recently conducted by the American Management Association, poor communications is the main stall that delays progress in organizations of all sizes. A key reason for this problem is that each of us does not take the time to let others know the best way to communicate with us. Mr. McCormack does so in this book in an effective way. If you were one of his clients, colleagues or employees, this book would be invaluable. If everyone you worked with described how they would like to get ideas and information from you, you would have the same benefit. My subjective reaction to Mr. McCormack's personal style is that unless you are a CEO of a large organization with a lot of demands on your time, his suggestions may not always work. This would be a good book to have people read in order to stimulate their thinking about how communications in your organization could be improved. I greatly preferred his earliest book, WHAT THEY DON'T TEACH YOU AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL, to this one.</span>
