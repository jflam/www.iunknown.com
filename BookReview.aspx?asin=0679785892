                <span id="Label1">Heralded as the "best book on the dope decade" by the <I>New York Times Book Review</I>, Hunter S. Thompson's documented drug orgy through Las Vegas would no doubt leave Nancy Reagan blushing and D.A.R.E. founders rethinking their motto.  Under the pseudonym of Raoul Duke, Thompson travels with his Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo, in a souped-up convertible dubbed the "Great Red Shark." In its trunk, they stow "two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.... A quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls," which they manage to consume during their short tour. <p>  On assignment from a sports magazine to cover "the fabulous Mint 400"--a free-for-all biker's race in the heart of the Nevada desert--the drug-a-delic duo stumbles through Vegas in hallucinatory hopes of finding the American dream (two truck-stop waitresses tell them it's nearby, but can't remember if it's on the right or the left). They of course never get the story, but they do commit the only sins in Vegas: "burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help." For Thompson to remember and pen his experiences with such clarity and wit is nothing short of a miracle; an impressive feat no matter how one feels about the subject matter. A first-rate sensibility twinger, <I>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</I> is a pop-culture classic, an icon of an era past, and a nugget of pure comedic genius. <I>--Rebekah Warren</I></span>

                    <span>DIRE AND RAMBLING IN LAS VEGAS: A SAVAGE JOURNEY TO SUBSTANTIATE HUNTER'S EGO
<br />
<br />First of all I read the whole book, and never once did I feel like putting it down which is always good for a book; but there is evidence that Dr.Thompson used this book as a mode of commercialization: 
<br />1.The mention of the song `White Rabbit' (We know his connections with the band)
<br />2.`Hippy Anthem' by Bob Dylan-`The Tambourine Man'(who the book is dedicated to)
<br />3.High-powered Ego inflation (pervading the whole book)
<br />  The book was intriguing no doubt, but clear signs of embellishment cannot be easily discarded; Dr.Gonzo's (Chicano Lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta-One of Hunter's eccentric friends in real life) depravity has to be questioned: was he THAT depraved? Deranged? I don't think so; maybe he was queer but surely not THAT decadent. For instance when Hunter and His lawyer drive into the airport driveway WITHOUT anybody noticing?     
<br />Quite over-the-top stuff here, but good fiction nonetheless; if you doubt that fact simply re-read the dialogues, you will note a number of Hunter's words in BOTH characters-a fact that is overtly clear in `Hell's Angels' as well (Boring book, another fictitious story). It was then, when the Lawyer began using Hunter's words like `more or less' I came to the conclusion it was all made up. 
<br />   I can understand the hype surrounding this book, and I'm not going to lie saying that I did not enjoy the book. It was an easy read and quite easy to follow; some parts were quite hilarious too-but, unfortunately Hunter's suicide implies he is much of a coward and an egocentric maniac, narcissistic, contemptuous. Suicide is no bravery, mind you; it is a coward's way of evading the problems of latter life...though I have much MORE sympathy and concern over sensations like Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, and Hemmingway-And Hunter was never one of those and never will be. 
<br />

                    <span>There are two ways of approaching a review of this book: slowly and logically or by taking some blotter acid and  to begin hammering on the keyboard.
<br />   Thompson did something new in modern American journalism by putting the author and his immediate perceptual experiences in the center of the story itself and father a style of writing known as "Gonzo journalism".
<br />   The novel tells the story of a man Raoul Duke (Thompson's pen name) traveling to an assignment. With him he takes for company and legal advice (many times unsolicited)   a 300 pound Somoan attorney named Gonzo. But an on a business trip needs one needs a little entertainment. In this case   the entertainment come in the form of a suitcase full of various hallucinogenic drugs which the two consume in short order. But this is not just a tale of a joy ride of two doped up thrill seekers.
<br /> The assignment takes place in Las Vegas not only one of the most patently absurd cities in the world but also a totally artificial city which lies in the middle of a waste land. 
<br />   It is from a never ending drug induced haze Thompson makes him report. But here we get to very idea of perception. Every author writes from a certain perspective where it be his own academic training or from his personal experiences. And when we read that idea is an understood or should be. One might see the book as an account of his overindulgent drug use and   hallucinations the story he pursues as just a device. But it is also a commentary about reportage in general. Further the book is social commentary. Set in a time after the high-water mark of the counterculture has receded it takes place affectionately known as "Sin City" where everything is legal as long as you have the money and are one of the squares. 
<br />   So we have our two whacked out hero's tripping their brains out upon their arrival in a town devote to every fantasy and by its very nature it a fantasy made reality by the modern miracle of electric power. As Thompson has his visions and waking nightmares he wanders through a quite real human freakshow where overindulgence is a lifestyle. How absurd is the fantasy image of people turning into reptiles next to the reality of casino doubling as a circus?
<br />   The idea of putting the author putting himself front and center in the middle of a quest may have rocked the boat in 20th century America but one can draw comparisons from the past. Boswell's London Journal comes to mind as Boswell, in writing of his quest for his hero Samuel Johnson, deviates often from that story in telling us of his sexual adventures. However Thompson has upped the ante in the respect of blurring the line between fantasy and reality. I believe we have to go further back to the medieval writings of some of the mystics who were under the influence of spirituality where their visions and reality are blurred.
<br />   Many of you who are taken aback by Thompson's drug use might not be aware that   Edna St. Vincent Millay, well embraced by the general public, used a variety of drugs in her later years for the very purpose of aiding her in the creative process.
<br />   The book has been somewhat of a manifesto for years by the drug culture but that is no reason for the novel to be avoided or disparaged.
<br />Along with the wonderfully ludicrous hallucinations and the situations brought about by them is sharp social and political commentary.

<br />This nonfiction account of Hunter S Thompson's search for the American Dream is a trip you won't soon forget. It is not for the meek or squeamish. The substance abuse is staggering. I imagine there is some degree of exaggeration. Thompson himself had admitted as much in interviews. I must warn that the consumption in this book will be shocking if not scandalous to many. 
<br />
<br />FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS rocks with an unerring intensity. This book is written like a typewriter tanked on meth. The road trip, the hitchhiker, the booze and the drugs, spending an employers money destroying hotel rooms. It is a full force assault on the senses. It left me dazed and confused. It is hilarious at times but in that guilty way when you know that you really shouldn't be laughing. Raoul Duke is like Jerry Seinfeld in that you know he's a jerk but you can't help liking him. 
<br />
<br />Thompson was an extreme individual. He was notorious for missing deadlines. Reading this book makes it easy to see why. He was very absorbed in the moment. He seemed more intent on getting hammered than on writing the book. But in the end, his extraordinary talent allowed him to produce an amazing book. 
<br />
<br />Thompson is able to convey the sensation of being there as all this insanity unfolds. The carefree excitement of youthfulness is captured here. I always feel more alive when I finish this novel. 
<br />
<br />This book is for readers who like an intense, tumultuous trip into madness. It is shocking and even offensive to some but it is a great ride for those that like a bit of shock value in their entertainment. Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez, an exceptional, manic novel I can't stop thinking about, by an author whose style was very much influenced by Thompson.

                    <span>A very funny book about a journalist and his over-weight Samoan attorney on a trip to Las Vegas to find the American Dream, which happens to be dead and gone and maybe never even existed in the first place. They do quite a bit of drugs on the way, trash some hotel rooms, attempt in vain to do a story on a motorcycle race, hassle the tourists, the locals, and the police, and mock American culture in general. This is one of the funniest books you can read, though it's not for the faint of heart I suppose, and despite it being mostly a jumbled mess of drug hallucinations and strange encounters, it does have moments of clear headed introspection and retrospection (EEGARDS!). You should read it I think.   </span>

                    <span>This is a great piece of literature that poses many questions about the nature of being an American. 
<br />The book is broken up into two parts, and part one is clearly the strongest.  In book two, Thompson loses focus and begins to drift. The story attempts to take on several metaphorical resolutions, very few of them powerful. If Thompson had kept the intensity of Part 1 throughout the text, this would have been even more groundbreaking than it already was.
<br />Part 1: 5 Stars
<br />Part 2: 2.5 Stars</span>
