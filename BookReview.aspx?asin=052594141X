                <span id="Label1">Eighty percent of today's desktop computers operate on chips produced by Intel Corporation, which is now a more profitable company than the top 10 PC makers combined. But just how did the company, under CEO Andrew Grove, become so powerful? And what does its position mean to those who depend upon it? By combining public records, private documents,  and interviews with more than 100 of those who know the company best, <i>Financial Times</i> columnist Tim Jackson has produced the fascinating, definitive story: <i>Inside Intel: Andy Grove and the Rise of the World's Most Powerful Chip Company</i>.</span>

                    <span>Tim Jackson has produced a masterfully clearly and actionable rendition of Intel's evolution. In the early chapters, Jackson paints a tangible picture of the early leadership decisions (e.g., decision to assign Grove to Operations and Noyce & Moore to strategy, marketing, and R&D). Jackson effectively follows the evolution of these early decisions through to present while highlighting critical trajectory changing events along the way. <P>For example, when Bob Noyce initially invited Roger Borovoy to join Intel as legal counsel, Borovoy declined joking that Intel wouldn't need a lawyer of his horsepower for some time. Borovoy eventually accepted the offer three years after the company went IPO and stayed with Intel for eight years. The excellence in Jackson writing is seen later when he attributes Borovoy's departure to a Grove's decision to have three or four people reporting to him. Borovoy was asked to report to Larry Hootnick instead of directly to Grove. Borovoy left as the result. <P>Excellent development of critical decision threads over Intel's evolution!<P>In regards other Amazonian comments to the effect that Jackson does not try to be objective!!!? What book WOULD be interesting if it was objective! We are not reading technical specifications. This book is about history and how Intel shaped it! <P>I think Jackson did this Tim Jackson has produced a masterfully clearly and actionable rendition of Intel's evolution.

                    <span>Very nice book about the US semiconductor industry. It gives us a rare look into the world of corporate America. Very interesting, well-written, and non-technical. Anyone with an interest in the entrepreneurship and computer industry would enjoy this book. This book provides many interesting and some uninteresting details about Intel's history. <P>This book can give an authentic taste both of the history of ingenuity and energy inside Intel. Mr. Jackson did a wonderful job! But there's a little too much on Intel's battles with AMD and not enough on its unique relationship with Microsoft.<P>May be you never believe it, that such a small silicon thing as Intel's microprocessor was a one of the main media to manifest the impotence of the communist regime in the USSR. In fact, I'm sure this technology turned out more dangerous for the Soviet Union than Reagan's Star Wars.</span>

                    <span>This book gives an excellent chronologic sequence of beginning and eventual rise of Intel. It is pager turner from the 1st page. Also, gives a very clear visibility to an outsider of how well and menacingly Intel built its empire and business. A great book for anyone interested in knowing the history of Intel and semiconductor sector.</span>

                    <span>unlike most books on corporate america or stories about how exceptional american, against all odds, achieved exceptional things, this book did not do the typical left wing liberal spin to curse corporate america or give the same old same old "capitalism is evil" speech. the narratives detailed how a group of americans, in particular Noyce, Moore and Grove, took risk and boldly "go out and do something" (to quote Noyce) which eventually created wealth for himself/herself, for the employees and for many many people around the world (intel's employees and investors locate all over the world). these are people who in Anthony Robbins' definition as people who made positive difference in a lot of peoples' life. great book, extremely motivating. five star.</span>
