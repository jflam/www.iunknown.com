                <span id="Label1"><P> Today we have greater wealth, health, opportunity, and choice than at any time in history. Yet a chorus of intellectuals and politicians laments our current condition -- as slaves to technology, coarsened by popular culture, and insecure in the face of economic change. The future, they tell us, is dangerously out of control, and unless we precisely govern the forces of change, we risk disaster. <P> In <I>The Future and Its Enemies,</I> Virginia Postrel explodes the myths behind these claims. Using examples that range from medicine to fashion, she explores how progress truly occurs and demonstrates that human betterment depends not on conformity to one central vision but on creativity and decentralized, open-ended trial and error. She argues that these two opposing world-views -- "stasis" vs. "dynamism" -- are replacing "left" and "right" to define our cultural and political debate as we enter the next century. <P> In this bold exploration of how civilizations learn, Postrel heralds a fundamental shift in the way we view politics, culture, technology, and society as we face an unknown -- and invigorating -- future.</span>

                    <span>The Future and its Enemies is a fantastic and clear exposition of the dynamic vision. Postrel maintains that the old political categories of "left" and "right" no longer apply; today political camps are either "dynamic" or "static" in their vision. Those that seek to control and mandate a prescribed outcome would fall under the "static" heading. On the other side, the dynamists seek only to implement simple rules that allow for unpredictable and unplannable results. Postrel's thesis is backed up by credible data and some fascinating anecdotal stories. Postrel relates many of the ideas that were first articulated by F.A. Hayek when he described the "spontaneous order" that occured in a free market. Central economic planning by bureaucrats thus fails because is it ignores the integral process of unplanned, undesigned events, inventions, technologies that result in a free atmosphere where competition is allowed to flourish. Though we may think that good results occur from large bureaucracies planning like public school, health care, social security, and the like,this discounts the possibility that unplanned private initives would be much more effective. This is a book that should be read by all who support central economic planning or those that fear the results of allowing individuals to make voluntary decisions in the free market.</span>

                    <span>Virginia Postrel has written a book that deserves all the attention lavished on "Reinventing Government" a few years ago. She makes the case for an essentially libertarian view of the world better than any author I've ever read. <P>Her basic point is that social evolution through simple trial and error produces vastly superior outcomes to the central planning the twentieth century embraced through Communism, Socialism, and the New Deal.<P>She also does a wonderful job of showing the world is not divided purely into the standard left and right political types, but also into camps she labels "stasists" and "dynamists". Stasists resist change and can accept it only when it is carefully planned. Dynamists embrace the unpredictable process of spontaneous change that arises from individuals pursuing their own ideas. <P>"The Future and Its Enemies" is that rare public policy volume that actually contributes something new to the discussion. It deserves to be read and widely recommended, even by those who disagree with its central thesis.</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this reader friendly book. It did start to get repetetive in the last third but I adhere to the maxim that repetition is the best form of emphasis (if done with some wit).<P>My title emphasizes "context" as a way to address some of the complaints in other reviews of this book objecting to the perceived "my way or the highway" approach.<P>The dynamist environment requires a competitive marketplace of ideas and techniques. Thus, a truly dynamist environment needs stasist counterpoint to remain truly dynamist... doesn't it? I think the author realizes this.<P>What I found most interesting about this book was the attention Postrel draws to the redefinition of political and philosophical labels, Conservative vs. Liberal etc. which have had almost no coherent meaning for decades. Postrel removes the current labels (conservative, liberal, rightwing, leftwing) and reclassifies the players based on their position relating to the status quo or stasist versus dynamist. Very interesting.<P>This redefinition of the current labelling is also dealt with quite well in another book -- Bobo's in Paradise, by David Brooks. If you want to be truly entertained and enlightened at the same time get the audio version. I laughed, I cried, I pondered -- all while driving in my car!</span>

                    <span>I was a little disappointed - I'd heard such great things about Postrel. The whole book runs around a "new" term - Dynamism. I don't think we really needed another word to describe flexibility and change. Specifically what bothered me, was her observation that Dynamism exists in all areas (government and private) but she only believes it's really needed in government, while she admits McDonald's and Disney World do well without it. And that's certainly true, I must say I agree with her politics and business observations here. But then isn't the book really only concerned with Dynamism in government, if we're to be honest about it? The whole booked is marred by the fact that she doesn't want to come out and say this is a book of mainly politics that just happens to employ popular cultural as a means of explanation. Certainly the virtues of Dynamism are seen in many different areas, but the main point is that it's needed in government. And Dynamism in governement is simply called laissez faire capitalism. She makes the connection a few times, but I don't see why Capitalism isn't the term of choice. This entire book seems a little soft and compromising because of the terms used and the round about arguments. If you have 288 pages to make your point, why not make the real point? Certainly the issues, like the negative effects of a technocracy, are very important, but often the clearest points are quotations from Hayek. For a straight forward, though admittedly more righteous-sounding and maybe even over the top view, read Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. I'm not going to fault this book too much -- the ideas, if round-about, really are sound.</span>

                    <span>As a citizen of Sweden Postrels book gets a special meaning. As a liberal politician in Sweden even more so.<P>Sweden can be classified as a semi-socialist state. On one hand Sweden is modern and liberal when it comes to all the standard human rights issues. On another there is a very deeply rooted, and dominant, culture of social engineering and socialization. Virtually everything, and I really mean everything, is in some manner under direct political influence. As everything in this country is politics, everything is also subject to thorough planning, scheduling and political debate. From my point of view, Sweden is a "stasist" state with very little room for any kind of dynamist influenses. This book has given me, beeing an anti-socialist in a semi-socialist society, new hope. Maybe there are other ways to break the stale mate in our country, when it comes to analyzing politics. I'll apply the dynamist-stasist dimension here, and see what happens.</span>
