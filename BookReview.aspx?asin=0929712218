                    <span>Being a local of Las Vegas I have been to Red Rock Canyon several times. There are limited hiking trails. The author covers the trails, but does much more. There are many scrambles to peaks that without this book would be virtually impossible to get to. Unfortunately, the rangers at Red Rock want to ban this book. I guess they would rather be gambling than doing their jobs. Many rangers don't even know where named peaks are in Red Rock. My advice is to buy this book or visit the author's Web site (same name as the book) and forget stopping at the visitor's center for information.</span>

If you're just starting or serious about hiking this has everything you need!</span>

                    <span>I have hiked a lot in the Vegas area, and the first thing I noticed is that this book is not for first-timers! It is more useful for locating general spots to hike. It is very tough to follow the text and tiny B&W pictures to stay precisely on the trails. See if your library has a copy, or buy one used. It is worth a look and can be helpful.</span>

                    <span>I tried to use this book. However, the route descriptions are poor, and the author seems to have trouble telling north from south. There are too many errors to be typos. The area has some great hiking, and the book points out some good ideas, but be sure to take your topo map and compass! I thought about selling the book on half.com, but I would feel too guilty selling it to someone with less outdoor experience than I have.</span>

                    <span>This book provides instructions for many hikes around Las Vegas not described in other guides. I have hiked many of these trails and always find the guide's desciptions inadequate. In fact, while hiking Bridge Mountain, following the Guide's instructions lead my experienced partner and I into a very dangerous situation. I still use the guide, but know that I will have to use my trail finding experience to augment the book's trail descriptions.</span>
