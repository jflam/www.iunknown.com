                    </div>
                    <span>	Natalie Goldberg's book on writing is more a reflection on her life as a writer, than an advice book for beginning writers.  While her observations on her experiences provide an interesting glimpse into her life and the life of a writer, it can become quite irritating for the reader expecting a different type of work.  The effect is the same as if one were to confuse say Weekend at Bernie's with Schindler's List.  A perfectly enjoyable experience ruined by false expectations.  At some point you tire of the hi-jinks.
<br />The first chapter discusses materials to use while writing, but it is the second chapter that introduces the one major piece of advice for writer.  "First Thoughts," as she calls what I learned as freewriting, is the process of spending a block of time, ten minutes, an hour, or any length, during which to write without pause, in an uninterrupted stream of consciousness.  Ms. Goldberg stresses the importance of these first thoughts as a means of getting beyond the anxiety of writing well by writing anything.  By doing so, the writer will create a lot of bad material, but possibly some good, and in any case, will at least have written.  I agree whole heartedly with Ms. Goldberg on the importance of such practices, and the advice is well taken.
<br />	The problem is that although at some point the beginning writer wishes to advance beyond this stage, Ms. Goldberg's advice never really does.  Variations on the theme of the First Thoughts, including where to write first thoughts, why to write first thoughts, and with whom to write first thoughts, fill the majority of the book.  There are other pieces of advice, but these are mostly small or, at least in my opinion, pointless.  In one chapter, she says to freewrite two or three lines of anything, then, using those words, rearrange them at random until you've filled half a page.  Finally, add random punctuation.  The purpose is to teach the writer to break out of standard syntax by allowing him to create sentences such as "Write I'm an mouth rather cream.  Say eat ice and nothing dry! I an write rather say and; my goes cube because an there's."  Call me an enemy of the avant garde, but that just doesn't appeal to me.
<br />	However, like I said, the majority of the book does not offer writing advice at all, but rather tells of Ms. Goldberg's experiences and thoughts as a writer.  Many of her thoughts on the subject are shaped by her conversion to Zen Buddhism.  I have a deep respect for the religion and understand that religion can influence a person's view of all things.  I even looked forward to seeing an interesting new perspective on the subject of writing.  Unfortunately, this perspective quickly becomes tiresome.  The author quotes from her Zen teacher Katagiri Roshi way too much, and often on subjects with only the most tenuous connection to writing.  By half way through the work, one gets the feeling that she is mainly interested in flaunting her Buddhism, and takes every opportunity to bring it up.  Several chapters devolve from discussions of the writing process to ramblings on the interconnectedness of all things.  While this is enjoyable in Transcendentalist poetry, it doesn't transfer well to the realm of writing advice.
<br />	To be fair, the book does devote two of the last three chapters to the processes of cutting and rewriting.  However, after the rest of the book, they seem to be tacked on, added at the last minute, after the author realized she'd forgotten about them.  The advice amounts to reread your notebooks, cut out all the stuff that doesn't have energy, and rewrite the piece.  In writing about the importance of rereading your notebooks in their entirety, Ms. Goldberg recounts a time her class asked her to prove to them that she was capable of writing poorly.  To do so, she opens her notebook to a random page and begins to read.  To her surprise, it is not only not bad, but is in fact a deeply moving poem about leaving, and those who have passed out of her life, no doubt written in iambic pentameter and sonnet form, just off the top of her head.  The point of the anecdote is that we often miss what's good in our writing at the time, but it just comes off as boastful, from the start with her students doubting that anything she writes could be less than brilliant.  If you cannot freewrite for an hour and come up with two sonnets, four haiku, and a dirty limerick, one infers, then you ought not be writing.
<br />	After reading Writing Down the Bones, one is tempted to remark that Ms. Goldberg followed her own advice:  she sat down for an hour or two and wrote down whatever came to mind, and, if not producing something brilliant, she at least produced something publishable.  I, however, would not think of doing such a thing.  Rather, I prefer to assume that the books faults are really her way of telling us that there is no piece of advice that can create good writing, no secret to brilliance.  All one really can do is write, rewrite, and hope for the best.  Either that, or she realized that if she gave up her secrets, she would be ruined by all the emerging new talents.  If the latter is the case, I applaud her brilliant scheme, but declare that her secrets shall one day be mine; if the former, well then isn't she just so clever.

                    <span>I finally finished reading this book this evening, after several months of picking it up and setting it down again. I think the secret is not to read it front to back, but to open it up and read a random chapter. If you're looking for a step-by-step manual that teaches you how to write a story or poem, this is not the book for you. I must disagree with the commenter who said this book is not about the craft of writing; I think it would be more accurate to say that this book is not about the profession of writing. This book is for people who write because they have to, not for people who are trying to sell something. I heartily recommend it to anyone who knows she's a writer...down in her bones.</span>

                    <span>This is a unique book. I've taken many writing courses. Natalie gets to the heart of how to actually write. If you want rules read Strunk & White. If you want to learn how to write & motivate yourself Natalie's book is for you. This book takes a "zen" approach to writing. She shows you how and where to find material to write about. How to learn to write anywhere & everywhere. How to work through various writer blocks and times when your mind rebels. The book is done with honesty & humor. It clear to me that those who pan this book have NEVER tried to write seriously. No matter whether you just want to learn to write a better journal or publish a novel, story or poem this book is a must read. </span>

                    <span>So, years ago, when i was in college, we called this the "shooting sunshine up your **s book".  Ms Goldberg is unfailingly and irritatingly cheery about writing and also about the reader's ability to write, even to write well.
<br />
<br />However, in the years since i first read this book, it is a book that i refer back to frequently.  Writing is difficult.  Writing well, writing with truth, writing down to the bone, is gut wrenching.  That's why sometimes, Ms Goldberg's cheer, her certainty that it is possible, lingers in the back of my mind.  At the end of the day, the difficulty in writing is cutting thru the crap to the beautiful simplicity.  She gets it - and she'll help you get it too.
<br />
<br />So, as much as this book annoyed me when i first read it,  I'm glad I did.  It has served me well.  It'll do the same for you.
<br />
<br />Maybe we all could you use a little sunshine shot up our...
<br />
<br />Happy writing</span>

                    <span>Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer within is an example of an instruction manuel on how to write.  She spends most of the book talking about how to write, and zen... yet she never provides clear examples on how to write, and her stories are less enlightening an engaging.  Goldberg seems to have the assumption that everyone who picks up the book is a beginning writer.  Therefore she tries not to sound harsh or mean.  But as I found out after reading Stephen King's "On Writing", Honesty is the best policy.  I wish Goldberg had been honest.  
<br />
<br />Goldberg tends to throw in a lot of zen and spirituality into this book.  Sure, that's fine and dandy, but it keeps her from getting to the point!  And if I wanted spirituality, I'd go to a church or something.  All her zen stuff seems to be "fluff"  Not only that but she can't provide concrete examples.  She suggest one keep a notebook and fill out one every month.  Look, I'm not trying to write my thoughts and feelings, a poem, or autobigoraphy.  I'm trying to write a STORY.  
<br />
<br />The book aslo neglects to talk about the CRAFT of writing.  It reads like an instruction manuel (that or like a teacher that drops a textbook down in front of you and says: read it, understand it, and I'll quiz you tomorrow).  I don't want to read an instruction manuel.  I want a book that doesn't "tell" me how to write.  I want a book that talks to me, and shows me how to write.  Not one that preaches spirituality.  I'm not even a spiritual person!  
<br />
<br />Now, I'll tell you what I really don't like about this book.  It tries to be too nice when it comes to writing.  Sort of like telling a kid who really can't draw that he'll be an artist without practice.  It comes too lightly to its readers.  It isn't plain and direct, and it tries to avoid the Honest to God truth about writing.  Why does fiction work when it's good?  Why does it work when it's bad?  She never touches on what writing is!  
<br />
<br />If you're looking for a book on writing, I suggest Stephen King's "On Writing."  King isn't afraid to be honest, and he does more than preach.  He provides concrete examples, a story of how he became successful, and he actually TALKS to you through the pages.  There also isn't so much fluff in that book AND HE GETS TO THE POINT!
<br />
<br />If you're a beginning writer looking to build up your self-esteem, then pick this up.  If you're SERIOUS about writing, you'll pick up "The Elements of Style" William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White or "On Writing" by Stephen King. </span>
