                <span id="Label1"><div>In <i>Classic Georgian Style</i> Henrietta Spencer-Churchill explores the Age of Elegance, a heritage which is strongly evident in her own classic style. She tours a variety of Georgian houses and estates throughout the British isles to give a fascinating overview of the period (1700-1830).<br><br>Looking first at the styles and fashions of the time, we are given a real sense of Jane Austen's England-- the refined elegance of the furniture, the classic lines of the architecture and the rolling slopes of Capability Brown's landscapes. Next comes a detailed look at Georgian exterior elements-- the architecture in its setting, including town and country buildings, cottages and grand estates, courtyards and lodges, follies and outbuildings. Moving indoors, we examine the rooms and decor in fine detail, from hallway to living room, staircase to bedroom, with all the furniture, moldings, finishes and textiles that made the era unique.<br><br>A final, invaluable section in this complete source of Georgian style provides a palette of paint colors and short biographies and style guides of the influential architects, cabinetmakers and craftsmen of the period, such as Robert Adam and George Hepplewhite.<br><br>Illustrated throughout with specially commissioned color photographs and original architectural drawings and plans, <i>Classic Georgian Style</i> is an essential resource for details of the period. Lade Henrietta Spencer-Churchill's own decorating sense informs her authoritative discussion of the style to allow an understanding of the spirit of period decoration and its place in today's interiors. This is a beautiful guide for decorators, collectors and those who cherish the refined tastes of Georgian England.<br></div></span>

                    <span>i just got the book - havent read much of it yet. there are a lot of good photos, some of them, however, are just different angles of the same room. it seems that by reading the book a great deal of information will be learnt about georgian homes. my direct interest here was to learn about lighting and there isnt anything to direct me here. i think its a good book for the price.</span>

                    <span>Georgian Style, think of those beautiful curved terraced houses in Bath in their soft-buttery colours. It was an age of clean lines and classical influence.<P>It would be unfair to say that, being the daughter of the 11th Duke of Malborough, it is natural that Henrietta Spencer-Churchill should have all the advantages to publish a book like this. Not only would she have been bought up in beauty such as this at Blenheim and probably a host of other stately-home-ish settings - but no doubt she has the connections to get this published. <P>Spencer-Churchill's book certainly rises well above the ordinary. It is beautifully illustrated, her points are simply put and they are generally very clear. She has chosen to illustrate 130 years of interior, exterior and architectural design - from 1700 to 1830 - broadly the Georgian era . With a time frame this broad this book can certainly not qualify as a deeply academic study of the transition of the design. However she illustrates the broad designs trends and how they flowed into one another. She also picks some of the main names of the period (Robert Adam, Capability Brown and so on) and puts them into historical perspective.<P>The styles and their advent are explained, but also much about how design was influenced from the Chinese influence to the invention of wallpaper. Even the type, and use of colours and the range of colours available gets a mention.<P>As an interior designer herself, Spencer-Churchill no doubt has a feel for this sort of thing. I was a little disappointed because I felt with a few areas such as window treatments, she often failed to explain if these were original designs of hers based on previous drapes, or 'a georgian style' she had dreamt up. I would have liked to have seen more of Ackermann's period prints for instance - as they showed quite breath-taking interior detail of the latter part of Georgian age.<P>Occassionally too I found myself grating my teeth as she illustrated a 'Georgian' ideal, but failed to point out at what period in the 130 year time span she was talking about it would have been relevant. But I am being really picky about that.<P>Overall I found this an absolutely breath-taking book. It at once made me sick with jealousy that I didn't have one of these beautiful homes. I found her style easy to read, informative and if nothing else the illustrations are so beautiful I would keep it simply to look at them.<P>This is a great book for fans of the Regency period, Heyer or Patrick O'Brian type of books. It is also lovely if you just like beautiful things.</span>
