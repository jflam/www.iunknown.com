                    <span>I immigrated from the East (Israel) to the West (Amerika) in 1973. I tried to keep in touch with family and culture, and have not been successful. I do read a lot of good literature in Hebrew and stay in touch with cultural events and the events of the day. My children have very little facility in speaking Hebrew, although they can pray in Hebrew. We were able to raise our children "Jewish" as supposed to "Israelis", which captures at least part of my heritage. <P>I am also sure that Ms. Asayesh would agree with this statement: "in America you are Iranian, and in Iran, you are American." <P>I am looking forward to future books from this sensitive, insightful and honest author. <P>The book touched briefly on the political history of Persia, and the decline it experienced. I'd like to read more about how the Persian decline created the Islamic revolution, how the sense of inferiority created "martyrs", and hopelessness made the young Shibab easily exploited by ruthless Ayatolas and Immams. The author can be a strong advocate for both sides, and maybe help create a bridge of understanding between the two cultures.</span>

                    <span>After reading the other reviews, I thought I was in for a wonderful read. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It seems there is a tale here, but this author should have gotten a real writer to write her story for her, as she rambles around and leaves the reader hopelessly confused. The truth of the matter is that her effort ruins the story. She should find herself another job and leave the writing to other well known writers. For readers interested in the topic of women in the Muslim world, I highly recommend other books: Meena, Heroine of Afghanistan is quite nice, and Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil is another, as well as Not Without my Daughter and a recent book, Mayada, Daughter of Iraq. These are books that will entertain and educate. Sorry I can't say the same for Ms.Asayesh's work, which is plotless, rambling, and she doesn't seem to know all that much about Iran, but is someone looking for something to write about, despite the fact she is Iranian.</span>

                    <span>I was extremely interested in the subject matter since I dated a really nice Iranian man in college and had an interest in Iran, but this author came across so arrogant that I could barely finish the book. When I finally managed to plow through it, I felt like taking out an ad against the book in the Washington Post, where I believe the author is affliated, as I have seen her listed as a book critic of all things--she generally attacks other writers & their books in reviews she writes--a lot of nerve under the circumstances. A boring book that only irrtated me. I never return books to stores, but in the case I really felt like it. I'm not surprised this book in the 100,000 rating. Word gets around!</span>

                    <span>The author misses some of the harsh realities of daily life in Iran as she finds herself dumbfounded after hearing a male relative complains about current social atmosphere in Iran. It appears she has never stepped out of the role of a tourist during all her trips to Iran to face the daily humiliations, adversities and struggles Iranians face under the current regime. <BR>The title is misleading as the author has never really 'lived' in current Iran since her parents moved to the US when she was at the age of 15 in 70's. At that young age she seemed infatuated with the West; a term she calls "Gharb-zadeghee". This prolonged infatuation has tinted and biased her views towards Iran and Iranians. <BR>For those who strive to understand the Iran of the past quarter century, this diary-style book has little to offer. To meet this end, I suggest "Reading Lolita in Tehran".</span>

                    <span>Asayesh has written a soul-searching and engrossing book. It is part like a diary, part like a travel book. In seeking to balance her inner and outer lives her return to Iran after many years becomes a journey both spiritual and temporal.<P>Especially touching are her descriptions, both past and present, of her favorite aunts, Khaleh Farrah and Khaleh Mina. Along with other small vignettes featuring people she meets in the street, and old time acquaintances and relatives, we get an itimate glance into the lives of everyday people of Iran.<P>A lovely book that promises more from this talented and sensitive author. It would be interesting to learn about her life as her children grow. As second generation Americans of part Iranian heritage, it would be interesting to see how they combine the lessons their mother is trying to impart to them. And the impact of life in the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural America upon them.</span>
