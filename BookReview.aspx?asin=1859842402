                    <span>This book is yet another attempt at degrading the white race.  There is nothing wrong with being white, just like there is nothing wrong with being black.  If you want to hear someones idea on whats wrong with being white instead of looking at the facts then you should read this book.</span>

                    <span>David Roediger examines the growth and social construction of racism as it was related to the working classes of the ninteenth century. His scholarship earned him the Organization of American Historians Merle Curti  Prize for US Social History in 1991. This work is brief, but dense in  analysis, argument and scholarly interpretations.<p>The book basically  explores how white workers (with an emphasis on Irish Americans) sought  after a "wage" for their color, by placing on Black Americans the  mantle of "other", objectifying and stratifying blacks into an  object of prejudice and discrimination.<p>After a lengthy discussion of the  historiography of labor and race issues, Roediger writes eloquently of the  cultural formation of words such as slave, servant, hired hand, freeman,  white slave, master and boss.  All of which, he argues, were used to  diferentiate between blacks and white laborers.  He is careful to point out  that it was the workers themselves who created the terms as a means to  divide the races and elevate whites on the hierarchy of social status.  It  is a convincing arguement.  The text concludes with an enlightening  discussion of "black face" and the social struggles of the Irish,  whom many felt in the majority viewed as "white negroes."<p>This  book is scholarly and a read that demands one's attention.</span>

                    <span>This book challenges white male racism, proving once again that white males are racist not only when they are affluent, but when they are "working class", a term that bears some scrutiny, because even if  a Black person recieves the same wages, they are of course subject to the  horrors of racism. When *will* white males ever figure this out???</span>

                    <span>This book tackles the difficult subject of race relations among the working class of America.  The time frame for this book is generally fom 1800 through the Civil war, as America was turning from an agricultural  society to an industrial society.  Slavery was drawing to a close,  immigration had increased, and the urban populations of American cities  were growing.  All of these elements combined to create an urban working  class complete with racial tension. Within this context, David R. Roediger  defines the attitudes of race and race relation in a manner that is unique  to most histories of urban studies.  He not only records the developments  of a racial identity, but he also examines the reasons why the white  community defined itself as well as how the white community defined other  groups.  This book will probably stir a lot of controversy, but it will  also answer many questions.  Any historian or urban studies major can  benefit form this book, but beyond college level readers, anyone interested  in racial identities and racial differences can also appriciate this book.</span>
