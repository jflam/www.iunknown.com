                    <span>Few books prompt me to want to TELL THE WORLD because it may make a big difference in the quality of life of anyone who reads it. This is the first time that I have tried the Zone diet and fish oil supplements so it was all news to me and makes sense. I don't usually buy recipe books but this is more of a guide to balanced eating using raw foods, canned/frozen food, and even restaurant visits.  The authors seem to realize that I don't have the time or talent to deal with exotic food preparation. Rather than a long list of food to avoid, this book explains which foods are good, better, and best along with balanced quantities. 
<br />
<br />  Don't underestimate the health effects of the right food if you are currently in pain or taking any medications this book could change your life!  A high cholesterol report and watching Morgan Spurlock's movie, Super Size Me, prompted me to pursue some changes in my diet. In the month since entering the Zone I have discontinued Sudafed use (after years on it) and my husband is off of glucosamine and pain free. Plus, we are not hungry, have energy, and sleep better than before. This book ended the confusion I felt about what to eat. I found it very helpful.</span>

                    <span>Recipes in this book are not too exciting.  The medical information in Sears books are always good and the book has some redeeming value because of it.  I just wasn't pleased with the recipes at all.  I regret purchasing the book.  Should have checked it out of the library instead....</span>

                    <span>The Zone has been a life saver for my husband and myself(ages 56).  We have learned to "eyeball" meals when eating out;  and when in a hurry at home we now have this book which gives so many good recipes and ideas for us to experiment with.   As with anything it takes a while to change old patterns but the Zone is wonderful.  In fact we have gone vegetarian/fish and dairy included so the Zone helps us to keep a good balance of protein, carbs and fats.  Using the blender to grind oatmeal was worth the price of the book.  It makes great Zone pancakes, I use it instead of crackers in casseroles.<br>  I've made it a game and also we now treat food as medicine.   We stay on the Zone at least 80 % of the time.  As Dr. Sears says" one is only a meal away from the Zone", so it is not like being on a diet but learning how to eat better.  With diabetes on the rise I look at the Zone as way to stay healthy.   We have more energy! <br>  The Zone, which includes : diet, exercise, meditation, and fish oil is a satisfying way to live!</span>

                    <span>This is the Zone book I've been waiting for since the first book came out.  Dr. Sears' wife, Lynn Sears, shows simple, easy-to-cook recipes. My favorite was a story she recounted about not wanting to cook one night, so she just put soy crumbles over olive oil in a pan, added a jar of salsa & stirred in a can of black beans, heated it and then sprinkled grated cheese on it. <br>Not only are the recipes easy and fast, she explains how to look at labels on foods to figure out blocks, how to easily eat out in the Zone using the 'eyeball method' and how to Zone during holidays and special occations. This book is my ZONE BIBLE. Thank you, Lynn & Dr. Sears!</span>
