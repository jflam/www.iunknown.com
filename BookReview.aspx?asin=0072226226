                    <span>I am not one to spend hours reading through 900 page books to learn something, so this book was just perfect for me. If you want to get 2000 or 2003 set up in a redundant fashion, this is your book. Augmented with Technet I was able to get everything done. This book only covers the fundamantals of clustering on both platforms so if you want to go into more depth in specific areas, then you should use this book with other resources, but if you simply need to cluster or load balance Windows 2000 and 2003, then this is all you need. Since the book is listed on Microsoft's site as a resource, I picked it up and I am glad I did.</span>

                    <span>Received this book two days ago, so I didn't have the time to read the book from A..Z, but I noticed one big drawback: the book doesn't cover Exchange 2000! Although "A reader from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida USA" thinks it does.<P>I think Exchange 2000 is for 95% of the administrators the reason to use Windows Clustering techniques so a book like this should cover it. It isn't mentioned in the book once (see the index).<P>Still, in my opinion, this is one of the better (best?) books currently available on the market which handles Windows 2000/2003 Clsutering. I started with the Clustering 2000 book from Microsoft Press, but this one is out of print.<P>If you want to learn about Clustering: buy this book. If you wan't to know about Exchange 2000 Clustering: download the PDF from the Microsoft website (should be easy to find).</span>

                    <span>I bought this book (rather skimpy size) and win2000 clustering (bigger) book to try and tackle several clusters I am to build in 2003 EE. Thanks GOD I bought the 2000 book also. Much of the usable information came from the 2000 book, not the 2003 book. The 2000 book goes right at 2000 clusters, and covers them in detail. This 2003 cluster book spends half the paper rehashing 2000 clusters and then begins showing some of the differences in 2003. Half of the smaller 2003 book is about 2000 clusters. If you do not read the whole book, in order, you cannot build a cluster in 2003. 2003 clustering seems more like an afterthought than the main concern. I also am trying to build IIS6 failover clusters. This book mentions IIS clusters, not at all, nowhere. In 2000 clusters, IIS is a checkoff. In 2003 there is nary any clear documentation on it anywhere, especially this book. While SQL seems to be covered in the 2003 book there seems to be an absence of other program types.<BR>This book lacks any detail on many subjects and omits critical ones entirely.<BR>If you want a technical reference, how to book, this is not it.<BR>Shame. Its currently the only one out there for 2003 clusters.</span>

                    <span>This is without a doubt, the most poorly-written technical reference I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I agree with the other reviewer who picked out the numerous Windows 2003 Server errors - this book was rushed to press, and should have waited for the final release instead of being based on RC2.<P>I cannot believe a professional editor gave this book their stamp of approval. I have to take breaks every dozen or so pages, not because the concepts are too difficult, but because the author's akward sentences make my head ache.<P>Unfortunately, this seems to be the only book on the subject. I would stick to using whitepapers and web resources.</span>

                    <span>This book is great if you want to learn about Windows clustering. It isn't, however, so great if you already have good exposure and understanding of Windows 2000\2003 clustering and want information on cutting edge technical knowledge and troubleshooting. Furthermore, the author's writings of Windows 2003 clustering is based on its Release Candidate version. Many of the best refinements of Windows 2003 clustering (like automatic the rebuild of the quorum log if it is deleted) isn't discussed. Taking into account of the dearth of Windows 2000\2003 clustering books out there, this is one of the best.</span>
