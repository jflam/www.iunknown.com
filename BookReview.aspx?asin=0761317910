                    <span>Congratulations to Mordechai Gerstein on receiving the 2004 Caldecott medal!<BR>My twins love this book, drawn by the wonderfully true and inspiring story as well as the spectacular illustrations. The story, by its very nature, outshines the somewhat awkward and slightly didactic text, which nonetheless evoked powerful memories of Petit's feat in this former New Yorker.<BR>How fortunate that my children are young enough to be blissfully unaware that they witnessed the destruction of the twin towers while perched on my shoulder in front of the television for hour after awful hour on 9/11. However, every parent must prepare to answer the inevitable question arising from the book's final page: "Daddy, why aren't the towers there anymore?" <BR>I still haven't come up with a satisfactory answer.....</span>

                    <span>This 2004 Caldecott winner is based on the true story of Philippe Petit. During the contruction of the World Trade Center, he devised a plan to walk a tightrope between the twin towers. The illustrations are the main feature of this book. There are some wonderful overhead perspectives that allow the reader to get a sense of how it would actually feel to walk hundreds of feet in the air. This book does not dwell on the loss of the towers (although it is mentioned), but rather celebrates the courageous spirit of Philippe Petit. Both children and adults will find this story interesting.</span>

                    <span>On an otherwise normal day in August 1974, a young Frenchman pulled off what may be the most impressive (not to mention foolhardy) wire-walking exhibition in history. New York City's early commuters looked up to the almost-completed World Trade Center towers to see a man, experienced aerialist Phillippe Petit, walking back and forth across them on a wire. This amazing (albeit highly illegal) achievement has now been immortalized in impressive ink and oil paintings in Mordicai Gerstein in The Man Who Walked Between the Towers. Among the artwork you will find the ingenious use of two foldout illustrations, each one establishing an amazing change in perspective of Petit's wire-walking feat and making the drama of the event all that more palpable. Published in 2003 and the recipient of The Caldecott Medal, this book is sure to captivate many young minds with its story and artistry (with a sense of vertigo thrown in absolutely free of charge), and it does stand as something of a touching reminder of the two towers that fell on September 11, 2001 and the spell they cast in their own silent yet mighty fortitude.<P>Alongside the artwork is the story, economically told, of Petit's dream and the manner in which he made it come true. It describes how he and some friends dressed up as construction workers, hid out on both towers until nightfall, and got the wire-walking cable (which was a mere seven-eighths of an inch wide) in place, after which Petit walked, ran, danced, and even lay down on the outstretched wire over the course of nearly an hour. He was then, of course, arrested but, to my surprise, ordered only to perform his feats for the children of New York City. This is a fabulous story that will literally take your breath away, especially if you are as afraid of heights as I am, but I can't get over just how dangerous and illegal this was (to his friends as well as himself) and can only wonder how Petit got off so easily.</span>

                    <span>In 1974 as the World Trade Center was being built, young French aerialist Philippe Petit spent almost an hour on a tightrope walking, dancing and doing tricks between the two towers. Man Who Walked Between The Towers tells his story using lyrical words and ink/oil paintings which are endearing and revealing.</span>

                    <span>I have heard that very refrain from children time and time again while reading this book. In my Gypsy-like lifestyle of a substitute teacher, I took this book with me, knowing that it would enchant the students I had, no matter where I was. Every class I read this to was spellbound. They would gasp and stare and just could not believe that a REAL person ever did what Phillipe was doing! I had a first grader reach out to touch the sky under Phillipe on one spread, he was so enthralled. In a class of 29 very-hard-to-impress third graders that I was in for 6 weeks, we made a project out of it when they designed their own drawings on what they would walk between, because they were so inspired. During the reading, near the end, on the page that stated quietly "Now the towers are gone," I had very quiet acceptance of the missing towers. The author tells the story with such reverent delight (if it was ever possible to combine the two, Gerstein has) that children naturally fall in and accept the story as is. "The Man Who Walked Between The Towers" has become one of my favorite children's books and has earned a spot in my teaching "bag of tricks." It is very moving and inspiring, and highly deserving of the Caldecott Medal for 2004.</span>
