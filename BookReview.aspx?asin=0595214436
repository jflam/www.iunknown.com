                    <span>If you like reading with a red correction pencil in hand, this is the book for you. Getting through even one chapter is a chore because the reader must navigate through a minefield of botched syntax, misspellings, garbled grammer, unfinished sentences and plain ol' bad writing.  If there's an award for the worst writing and editing, this book's a shoe-in! I felt as though the writer rushed to get enough pages typed for a book and didn't bother to even do a cursory check of her work. <p>The content is not much better.  Skip this book.</span>

                    <span>I thought the book was a wonderful read and it contained some great information on riding as well as the other ladies stories that were included in it.  I thought the author included all a lady needs to know about riding when first starting out.  I loved  it and look forward to reading the next one out.</span>

                    <span>I really loved this book and the information given for ladies who ride has been so useful to me as a new rider such as how to ride in the rain, and how a woman can check out motorcycles before buying one.  I'm looking forward to reading Miss Dicks's next book, The Devil's Playground published by Prometheus Books due out this fall. I've already read, They're Going TO Kill My Son and Death Row by this author.</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating book about women who ride motorcycles, why they do, and what they think about it, but it is also an interesting look at motorcycling generally. I enjoyed the many individual accounts throughout the book by riders who contributed their own stories about how they were introduced to motorcycling, "first ride stories," their enjoyment of the sport, "most embarrassing moments," and inspirational stories. I was also impressed with the author's emphasis on safety, both with respect to driving skill and also with respect to being careful about dangerous people and situations one can encounter on the road. There are some real dangers to be aware of, and this book is honest about that, and contains good advice about how to avoid them. The book also contains a wealth of information on how to keep your bike in shape mechanically, the best kind of riding gear to wear, tips on touring, and even how to choose a motorcycle if you are thinking of becoming a rider.  And maybe best of all, this book conveys the real sense of adventure and of belonging to a unique group, that goes along with being involved in motorcycling. Even though the focus is on women motorcyclists, I can vouch for the fact that this is a book that men will enjoy too if they have any interest in the fun and freedom of riding a motorcycle.</span>
