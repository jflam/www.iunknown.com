With a clean layout and superior command tables available at a glance, O'Reilly's third edition of <I>Nutshell</I> is an essential to own.<p> Like a dictionary, <I>Unix in a Nutshell</I> helps you find what you need, even if you're not exactly sure what you're looking for (or how to spell it!). With that in mind, this book is for intermediate to advanced users only--those new to the Unix operating system would be better off with <I>Learning the Unix Operating System</I> or <I>Unix: Visual Quickstart Guide</I>.<p> The last full revision of the book was in 1992, and the new edition covers Solaris 7 as well as newer versions of shells (ksh, in particular), RCS, and GNU emacs. Topping off at over 500 pages, <I>Unix in a Nutshell</I> contains--literally--everything you could want to know about the various commands, shells, and functions. Fifty new commands have been added to the already sizable lists, and even the most seasoned user is likely to find a discover a new timesaving command. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I></span>

                    <span>Let me just start out by saying that I have taught Solaris in the past to several international companies and highly respectable universities.  I always provide each student with a copy of this book because I put that much value into it.<p>There is no other Solaris book out there that covers the most often-used Solaris commands with such intricate detail and organization as this book does.  The only drawback to this book is that the author stopped at Solaris 7.  Considering that right now Solaris is up to version 9, I so very much wish that Mr. Robbins continued this book into Solaris 8 and 9.<p>The beautiful part about Solaris, however, is that even Solaris 8 and 9 contain most if not all of the commands that are listed in this book, so it still becomes an absolute necessity for any Solaris administrator.  The complete chapter on vi also will be a welcome sight to many as well the separate chapters on the different operating system shells.<p>I must warn that this is NOT a book for those who are looking  to get started in Solaris.  This is purely a reference manual.  In effect, this book is Solaris on-line help (man pages) in a beautifully organized compendium of the essential Solaris commands.<p>If you are a Solaris administrator, regardless of whether you're a novice or an "expert", you need to have this book at your desk at all times.  It's completely indispenable.</span>

                    <span>While this book - as stated in its title - serves its designated purpose as a "Quick Reference" pretty well, be well aware of its limitations. <p>If you're not yet familiar with UNIX, make sure to work your way through one of the better introductions to UNIX. My personal favorite is Steven R. Levine's "UNIX for Dummies; despite the somewhat derogatory title of this books series (or maybe because of it), it is an easy read, and provides the UNIX newbie with a solid understanding of the overall concepts of UNIX, as well as the use of the most common commands.<p>Don't expect too much from "UNIX in a Nutshell". While it comes in handy whenever short term memory proves insufficient to recall certain command options and the likes, this reference only provides a terse abstract for each command. <p>Even though these abstracts in most cases are a little bit more elaborate than the "usage" section of the man pages, you will still have to check the man pages if you need a more elaborate explanation of the command or its options.<p>On the other hand, this reference will always be handy when you're working on a system that does not have man pages installed, as well as for quickly looking up other information.<p>Although this book does not, can not, and does not claim to be a "complete" quick reference, it deserves a place on most system adminstrator's, system programmer's and advanced user's desk.</span>

                    <span>I am basically a Windows person and when I had to work on Unix, it was hard for me. But I had to learn quickly. I was looking for a quick reference book for all the commands in unix and this had great reviews. Indeed deserving. <p>One book for complete list of commands. Each command is given a detailed explanation and also an example for better and complete understanding.<p>It does not end there; it covers other topics too - vi and other editors, k and c shells, awk programming and other macros. <p>Any Unix person should keep this on his desktop.</span>

                    <span>The O'Reilly Nutshell books are great!  I've used them for years and haven't found a bad one yet. The books are meant for users to find 'how do I ....' and get you right down to it.<p>The book is very well laid out giving descriptions of commands and shells as well as chapters on text editing/processing(emacs, vi, sed, etc), text formatting (nroff) and software development (sccs, make).  It's not exactly meant as a 'lead the hand' reference if you're just starting to learn Unix.  I say for that first try O'Reilly's 'Learning the Unix Operating System'.  <p>Once you begin to understand how Unix is put together, Unix In A Nutshell will definitely make more sense to you. For someone who has used Unix for years, I've used this book over and over for just about any flavor of Unix I've come across.  I have yet to find a command that I needed that WASN'T in this book.  I even recommended this and 'Learning the Unix Operating System' to my husband who wants to learn Unix.  This book is well worth the price for the amount of information you get.</span>
