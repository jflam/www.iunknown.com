                <span id="Label1">The Tomes of Delphi 3: Win32 Core API, the first book in Wordware&#146;s best-selling Tomes of Delphi series, has been updated and revised for Windows 2000. This new edition is the most accessible and definitive reference to 32-bit versions of Delphi, providing an accurate and comprehensive guide to the Microsoft Windows application programming interface. The Tomes of Delphi: Win32 Core API&#151; Windows 2000 Edition covers the most common Windows API functions, from window creation and message processing functions to memory management and text output functions. Each function entry includes the syntax, a description of what the function does, a list and description of parameters, acceptable constant values, return values, cross-references to related functions, and an example of its use in Delphi&#146;s Object Pascal. Whether you&#146;re an experienced Delphi programmer with a working knowledge of Windows programming or an intermediate Delphi programmer, this book will help you to extend the functionality of Delphi components and objects, and demonstrate what the Win32 API can do for you.</span>

                    <span>You'd think the qualifications for writing a Delphi book would be 1) you must be a Delphi expert 2) you must write well. Well, I can tell you for sure that this guy doesn't meet either qualification. This is, without question, the worst programming book I have ever had the misfortune to buy. Ayres writes like a third grader. And the code is even worse. A person who'd never seen Delphi before could write this code. It is mostly warmed over MSDN example code converted to Pascal. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to publish something like this. It's that bad.</span>

                    <span>When one reads the worthless pros expressed in Mr. Ayres latest manuscript, it causes one to contemplate how this dolt continues to be a published author. It is clear that based on his use of the English language that he is devoid of anything more than a High School diploma. It is sad to say that his command of Delphi appears to be equally as poor as his writing skills. The examples and sample code are so simplistic that they are literally worthless, and hardly expand on any topic in detail. I honestly think that the original "Delphi for Dummies" was a more informative and better-written book<P>It is clear that this latest book is yet another ego stroking manuscript of recycled work from his original books. Many of the API calls have not been updated and many of the samples are riddled with errors and are not syntactically correct for Windows 2000/XP.<P>It simply staggers my imagination why Wordware continues to use Mr. Ayres as an author. When reviewing all of the Tomes books, it is clear that when Mr. Ayres split company with his co-authors the quality of the book went down considerably. Perhaps Wordward should get them to re-write this book and see which one sells better.<P>Until then, go get Charles Petzolds API book. If you don't know C++ try DevGuru to get some help. They will gladly help translate the C++ calls to Delphi Syntax.</span>

                    <span>This book is an embarrassment to the Delphi community. That people like Ayres can even get published in the first place shows us how bad things really are. If I'd paid for this book out of my own pocket, I'd be sending it back, I promise you. Ayres can't write and has no knack for explaining anything. He does a disservice to Delphi and the few of us still building apps with it. <P>Now, please, someone - write a Win32 API book on Delphi that's worth reading, not something like this hackneyed gradeschool stuff.</span>
