                <span id="Label1"><I>Saint Augustine</I>, by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and cultural critic Garry Wills, is a 145-page biography of a saint whose collected works total 13 volumes. Despite its brevity, the book offers a complex and compelling interpretation of Augustine's life and work. Much of Wills's task is demythologizing: Augustine was not a central figure in 4th-century Christianity but was "peripheral in his day, a provincial on the margins of classical culture," who did not know Greek, the intellectual lingua franca of his time. Although Augustine has been portrayed by artists as a bishop "wearing all the episcopal finery of the late Middle Ages," he actually "dressed in the gray clothes of a monk." And far from being a self-righteous pontificator, Augustine was "impatient with all preceding formulations, even his own." He wrote, "Since it is God we are speaking of, you do not understand it. If you could understand it, it would not be God." Wills also argues that Augustine's <I>Confessions</I> (which, Wills persuades the reader, is an anachronistic, egoistic translation of the original Latin title, a word Wills more accurately renders as "Testimony") has been misread in a way that suggests Augustine led a debauched sexual life before his conversion. In the Shocking Revelation department, Wills does, however, find more detailed (if elaborately coded) information about Augustine's mistress and about the son they raised together than other biographers have found. Like Wills's masterful <I>Lincoln at Gettysburg</I>, <I>Saint Augustine</I> accomplishes its revisionist aims completely and yet lightly. Wills makes his arguments without ever forgetting his first job: telling the story of a life. <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I></span>

                    <span>St. Augustine's life was that of a writer on the relationship between God and his people.  Much of the material he has written forms the backbone of the Christian religions.  He is an important person in Western civilization.  This book by Garry Wills is supposed to tell Augustine's biography.  Instead Wills spends countless pages on philosophical arguments and one does not get a good view of this man nor the times he lived in.<br>A previous reviewer commented that one should read the writings of St. Augustine himself, rather than try to fathom what he stood for in the Wills book.  I agree with this assessment.<br>I don't really care for Wills' politics and after this book not alot for his writing.  This was a difficult book for me to get through.  Even though it is short, the writing style has a lot to be desired.  Perhaps Wills intended this book for his students at Northwestern.  A real disappointing read!</span>

                    <span>This short biography of Saint Augustine is written in an unbiased, readable style by a respected author.  Covering the main events of St. Augustine's life from his adolescent years to his death, the author presents Augustine in a well respected manner.  His analysis of Augustine's writings from a chronological standpoint sheds light of many of the misconceptions or debates surrounding St. Augustine's life and teachings.  The author allows Augustine to basically "grow up" while still allowing him the frivolous excursions of youth and early adult formative years when most people are figuring out who they really are.  People can and do change, and this author recognizes and accepts this notion.  For this reason, if nothing else this text is worthy of perusal.  The book's brevity does leave the reader with a sense that something is missing and hence the lower rating.  As many writings as Augustine produced and as complex as his teachings are, the concise nature of this book does a respectable job.  For those on the go or if looking for a nice gift, this book will not disappoint with its brevity and attractive cover.</span>

                    <span>There's one thing here which really hit me hard, and I commend Wills for putting it forward.  He gets into the relationship between Calvin and Augustine, which B.B. Warfield also explored.  Wills says Calvin clamped down Augustine into a fixed setting of wrought doctrine, but that this effort was essentially Calvinistic--not Augustinian.<p>Augustine, by contrast, according to Wills, was more willing to see God's word and guiding hand as a process with a relationship to our understanding--where our understanding can see more as time goes on, and as we go through life.  That's about all Wills does with this, but it's a big idea, worth considering.<p>To take it further, and to borrow a theme articulated by Jarrett Stevens, could it be that a lot of Calvinists are fixated on "Letters from John" to the point that they miss the inspiration of those letters which Calvin got from Augustine?  Or push it furhter, and isn't it clear that Augustine was trying to be a Christ-follower, and not just a system-maker?<p>But let's not dump too much on Calvin, since he also, as he said, "promptly and sincerely," sought to offer his life and his work to God--like Augustine.<p>Corollary insight:  This is a small book, but unlike "The Prayer of Jabez" it really does contain very big ideas.  I'm neutral on whether you need a background on Augustine to get much out of it.</span>

                    <span>I was prompted to read this book after reading E.L. Doctorow's novel, City of God.  I wanted to learn more about Augustine to think further about the obvious allusion in Doctorow's title, and throughout his book.  I had read Augustine before, and was not a total newcomer to his thought.  But I need a refresher and something that would expand my limited understanding.<p>Wills's book is short, clearly written, and presents in an accessible form something of the nature of this complex person, thinker, and theologian.  But the book is no mere introduction. It in many ways takes issue with other accounts of Augustine and presents him in a manner that shows why he is worthy of the attention of the modern reader, as he has been of readers throughout the ages.<p>Wills spends a lot of time arguing that the title "Confessions" for Augustine's most famous work is inappropriate and retitles it "Testimony".  This point has been made many times before, but in the process Wills does teach us something about the book.  The process is not merely a pedantic exercise.  Wills also argues that Augustine was not a sexual libertine in his youth and, actually more importantly for the modern reader, that he was not anti-sexual in his old age.  He presents a Christianity that does not despise the body (making the simple point that in Christianity God came to the earth in a body) and that seeks to use the body for God's purpose in humility and love.  In fact, Wills presents Augustine as correcting the anti-physical bias of pagan ascetics of his day.<p>The texts I was interested in for my purposes were the Confessions("Testimony") and City of God.  The first text is referred to repeatedly in the first half or so of the book and forms the basis for Wills' discussion of Augustine's life, conversion, and theology.  The second book is summarized briefly late in the book, and I found it useful.  Again, Wills argues agains an other-worldy interpretation of the City of God and finds Augustine willing to bring the City to earth in a world believers share with nonbelievers through an early form of toleration, through love, and through common purpose.<p>There is a good, if necesarily brief, description in the book of the closing days of the Roman Empire.  This is in itself worth reading and I had known little about it.<p>I think somebody coming to Augustine for the first time could benefit from the book and be encouraged to think and learn more. I found it useful.  I think Penguin is to be commended for its biographical series, making important lives accessible to modern readers in brief, but not superficial texts.</span>
