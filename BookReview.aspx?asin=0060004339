                <span id="Label1"><p>Debra Ginsberg knew that her son was unique from the moment he was born. Blaze never crawled; at one he simply stood up and walked. By the time he was four, he knew the complete works of Miles Davis. At five, he assigned colors to the days of the week. When he turned ten, he asked to reenact his own birth, so that this time he could have "enough breath to cry." But from his first day of kindergarten, Blaze was considered a "problem" in the classroom. All his life he's defied diagnosis by a host of experts who have sought to label him.</p> <p>Writing with blistering honesty and irrepressible humor, Debra Ginsberg interweaves her moving personal story and tales of her hard-fought battles with schools and medical professionals to create a book that speaks to all parents. <i>Raising Blaze</i> is a message in a bottle to all the square pegs who refuse to be shaped, shoved, or squeezed into unyielding round holes.</p></span>

                    <span>As a teacher in a public school, I feel "Raising Blaze", is a must read for new teachers as well as any teacher who believes in life long learning. This book allowed me to reflect on my profession and on myself as a teacher. Seeing through the eyes and emotions of a parent who is struggling to come to terms with a "different" child is powerful. More powerful though is seeing through the eyes of the different child while he tries to learn his way through the maze of educational "red tape" while trying to maintain a sense of self worth. This book is a must read if you care about changing the lives of children and students. What we do and say in the classroom room can have both negative and positive ramifications for years to come. This book will remind you how powerful teachers are and how it is most important to never allow this power to be abused.</span>

                    <span>After reading "Waiting", Deborah Ginsburg's memoir of her life as a waitress I expected "Raising Blaze" to be a light hearted, funny little book. It's not. Blaze is the author's son, he's the sweet baby she had at the end of "Waiting". Blaze is different and his teachers and school psychologists have called him everything from retarded to autistic to having attention deficit disorder. This book is about Ginsburg's fight to save her son from being labeled and stuck away in special ed classes. The book is about love, Ginsburg's family is still in her corner and it's about hope, there is still no telling what Blaze will be like when he grows up. The book is emotional, it's upsetting and several points I wanted to yell at the teachers and at Ginsburg herself. I wish Ms. Ginsburg and her special son the best and I look forward to her next book.</span>

                    <span>Debra Ginsberg doesn't like labels, that may be the main theme of the book. <P>I do like lables. I have one, I am autistic, I have another, I have Asperger's syndrome. <P>I would say that Debra's son probably could get an AS diagnosis and may have one by now. So in spite of her view of labels, I think it's a good book to read if you have AS yourself or have a child with AS. <P>The descriptions of good, bad, indifferent and truly hideous school district staff and teachers are great. I had forgotten about the power that teachers can have over families and the visciousness that they can dump onto parents and kids. That all came back to me in reading this book. It's post traumatic IEP syndrome. (yes, some teachers are fabulous)<P>I'm glad she gave such a detailed view of her extended family and I'm very glad that she and Blaze had them for support.<P>I hope Blaze is doing well.</span>

                    <span>I read this book as part of a book club.<P>I enjoyed this book. It was an easy, and fast read. I was very impressed by Debra Ginsberg's writing skill, especially considering this is just her second work. She is extremely talented at putting her thoughts and feelings into words.<P>One of the first things that occurred to me, actually toward the end of the book, was that I didn't really feel like I *knew* Blaze. I definitely felt as if I knew Debra, and in fact a good portion of her family, but she gave very little description of what day-to-day life was like with Blaze. In fact, the only descriptions of Blaze's life were his school days, and even those only came second-hand, as they were recounted to Debra through his teachers and school staff. I really longed to read more about how he interacted with his mom when they were alone, and to read about random things such as trips to the grocery store, or to the pediatrician.<P>Also, and this is not a criticism of the book, but I found myself wondering over and over again, if, even though Debra obviously had Blaze's best interests in mind, she and he would have been better off if she had ultimately decided to place Blaze in a "special" school early on. It seems to me that the constant struggles that both of them endured by Blaze's attempts to "fit in" and be "normal" in a regular classroom would have been detrimental to Blaze. He is obviously a very bright child, and I felt that he would have performed better in a learning environment with more individualized instruction. These thoughts made me wonder about Debra's motives - why was it so important to her that Blaze attend "regular" classes in a "regular" public school (other than the financial expense of a private school) rather than consider other options? It seemed obvious, after he was in the sixth grade, that he was not getting much out of his schooling, and the staff and other students were suffering as a result of the distraction.<P>You may or may not agree with the choices Debra makes in raising her disabled son, but since she's written a book about it, you should at least be able to understand WHY she has made the choices she's made. I didn't get it.<P>WHY was it SO important to Debra that Blaze be mainstreamed? He was clearly disruptive and distracting to other students, he was clearly not learning as much as he possibly could have in other environments ---- Debra's motives are just not explained. <P>I believe that all children with disabilities should have the right and the opportunity to mainstream at school, and as a result into society. But at what cost? Do non-disabled children have a right to attend classes that are not regularly (daily!) disrupted? <P>It's a difficult issue to decide. I just wish that Debra had explained her motives.</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I think it accurately portrays the sad state of the American educational mindset. Every child (and later, every adult) has to fit, and woe for those square pegs that don't fit. These teachers and professionals, because of the nature of their jobs, were mainly unable to appreciate Blaze for who he is, and modify their teaching to fit him. No matter how you try, when teaching a room full of students, the teaching has to be geared toward the "average". Too bad so few of us are average. Blaze is blessed to have a mother who is willing to sacrifice her own goals and desires in order to commit herself to him. Many parents would take the path of less resistance and accept labels, medications, whatever the "experts" provided. We are programmed to believe the experts, and to distrust our own instincts. Ms. Ginsburg places incredible emphasis on Blaze "fitting in", even though she recognizes what an exceptional person he is. Of course, "fitting in" is safer and more comfortable, and who doesn't want that for their children. Perhaps since she never fit in, she desires it even more for her son.<P>Speaking as a square peg who has tried to fit in, I am homeschooling my three boys, each of whom I find extraordinary in their own way. Ms. Ginsburg's honest, heartbreaking, and often joyous book makes me feel like I know her, and that we are kindred spirits.</span>
