                <span id="Label1"><P> <I>The All-American Boys</I> is a no-holds-barred candid memoir by a former Marine jet jockey and physicist who became NASA's second civilian astronaut. Walter Cunningham presents the astronauts in all their strengths and their weaknesses in this dramatically revised and totally updated edition of a book that was considered an instant classic in its first edition over two decades ago. From its insider's view of the pervasive "astropolitics" that guided the functioning of the astronaut corps to its thoughtful discussion of the Columbia tragedy, <I>The All-American Boys</I> resonates with Cunningham's passion for humanity's destiny in space which endures today. This is not just a "tell-all" book. It is also a story of the triumph of American heroes. Cunningham brings us into the NASA training program and reveals what it takes physically and mentally to be an astronaut. He poignantly relates the story of the devastating Apollo 1 fire that took the lives of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee and his own later successful flight on Apollo 7. This new edition includes an update of the manned space program and his "tell it like it is" observation of NASA's successes and failures. It also includes commentary on the Shuttle disasters Of Challenger and Columbia and his views on what NASA should be doing to get back on track and to regain public support.</span>

                    <span>The All-American Boys - BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO Cunningham! Not" a kiss and tell" or "know-it-all-book," but a lucid picture from the inside of NASA of human destiny in space and the passion of those who were lucky enough to make the journey. Five hundred years from now, the one thing that will be remember from the Twentieth Century is....Man Landing On The Moon. Of all the space books, this one is the most concise and easiest to read about a most complex journey. It is also a story of the triumph of American heroes who through great risk and determination made their bodies work like machines and their minds like computers. I liked reading for the first time about the selection process and competition of how the first man on the moon was chosen. Cunningham brings us into the NASA training program as if we were in training and reveals what it takes physically and mentally to be an astronaut. I could feel Cunningham's sadness and pain from the lost of his friends in the devastating Apollo 1 fire that took the lives of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, even though, he was chosen to fly the very next mission. It must have been bitter sweet. A mission that was very successful. This new updated and revised edition includes a "tell it like it is" observation of NASA's successes and failures. I found his commentary on the NASA and the shuttle program to be very informative. It is a book that should be in every school library across American and, definitely, required reading for students. A terrific read.</span>

                    <span>Walter Cunningham is at it again, his first All American Boys book was a great hit and now the up dated edition with much added material. Any person interested in space and the lives of our astronauts will enjoy reading over and over again. The book will become a great collectors edition to any book collection on space and the men that risk their lives to go there. The book goes where no man has gone before, into the lives of our first astronauts and into the future of space travel. Walt tells a story of how it felt to be on the NASA team of astronauts and how the public and the press treated them. Walter Cunningham was as close as you can get to what was one of our first space program disasters being on the back up crew of Apollo 1. You can only wonder what it must have felt like for him to be on the back up crew of Apollo 1. What it must have felt like to be strapped into Apollo 7 with the memories of the men before him that gave their lives. Cunningham talks about this in the new edition along with the Challenger and Columbia disaster and where we go from here. This book is a must read book.

                    <span>The crew of Apollo 7 earned the respect of the entire nation for taking the first flight after the tragic Apollo 1 fire. As I learn more about Mr. Cunningham, I am even more impressed. The All American Boys is part autobiography and part analysis of NASA past and present. It is not a detailed flight by flight chronology. Instead, it provides an authoritative perspective that cuts through the clutter and sanitized version we often get. To his credit, Mr. Cunningham communicates in a thoughtful manner without taking cheap shots at his former colleagues.<P>On a personal note, Mr. Cunningham responded to an autograph request within 7 days (small fee - check his website for details). This helped cement my respect for Mr. Cunningham. You will enjoy this book.<P>Mike Hill</span>

                    <span>Walt Cunningham's book contains information you won't find elsewhere about the inner workings of the astronaut program. I loved reading about Apollo Program and the astronaut selection and crew selection processes. This book made the people come alive for me. He has insightful and sometimes biting commentary about recent events at NASA. Overall I thought it read as if they had published a rough draft. There were many jarring changes of subject, several grammatical errors, many opinions repeated with the exact turn of phrase, and sometimes the chronology was difficult to follow. He is a physicist/astronaut, not an author. With a little more polish this would be worth 5 stars</span>

                    <span>As a Flight Controller during the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs and later as Deputy Manager of the Space Shuttle program, I was fortunate to have a front row seat for the opening of the space frontier. Naturally, I have a great interest in what anyone has to say about those years and therefore have purchased almost every book written about them. Some are very good and some are not worth reading. Among the best, for me, are "Apollo: The Race To The Moon" by Charles Murray and Catherine Cox, "Flight" by Chris Kraft", "Failure Is Not An Option" by Gene Kranz, and "Carrying The Fire" by Mike Collins. The updated version of "The All-American Boys" is now at the top of my list of favorites.<P>Why? Without getting into such boring details as his early childhood and his later personal life, Cunningham has captured not only what it was like to be there during Apollo but very effectively addresses what we as a country were able to do in a very short time, why we did it, how we did it, and what it means to our future. While I may disagree with Walt's assessment of some of the principal people involved (Chris Kraft especially), I find his overview of the first four decades of manned spaceflight to be very insightful and his ability to communicate it to the reader very rare. Often, when I reflect on post-Apollo events such as the Apollo Soyuz Test Program, the mistakes of trying to justify the Space Shuttle program on "payback" and allowing passengers to ride along, the dreadful years with Dan Goldin as NASA Administrator, putting American astronauts on the Russian Mir, inviting the Russians to be a "partner" on the Internation Space Station, and the horrible tragedies of Challenger and Columbia, I am not too proud of NASA. Cunningham does an excellent job of communicating those feelings.<P>Finally, I think the last chapter of this book, "What Our Past Tells Us About The Future", should be mandatory reading for every American, but especially for the current NASA management, Congress, and anyone who questions the need to keep exploring. Thanks, Walt, for reminding us why we must keep looking beyond the horizon.</span>
