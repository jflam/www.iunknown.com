                    <span>Once upon a time in the world of computers, there was just a scant few languages, mostly just text displays, and the Internet the sole domain of universities. Things became complicated fast, and today it seems like you need a specific tool to do anything. Unless you spend a lot of time reading computer magazines, and just keeping up, it's hard to know what tools are useful. Flash, was a nice product to spruce up, and enhance a boring website a few years ago. It had a few extra features beyond that, but it was still just more of a niche product. How things have changed in a few years.<P>Today you can build many websites from the ground up with flash. It has many of the programming features of JAVA, and even subscribes to the object-oriented programming model. The animation features are now easier than ever to implement, making even the less creative among us, seem a little more artistic. It is still lacking in the world of database connectivity, but that is rumored to be coming.<P>This book does a nice job with Flash MX basics, expanding later to the more detailed features. As a programmer, when I first learned Windows-based programming, I had to search through hundreds of books, to find one that covered the basics. It seemed like every book assumed you already knew how to program Windows! I had programmed Macintosh, and the Windows method was much different. Here I'm thankful to get a book, which just doesn't assume I'm already a Flash Guru.<BR> <BR>Hey, I know most of us are a bit turned off by the prospect of another, nearly 1000-page book. Still, the interactive CD ROM lessons get you up, and running quickly. The detail of the book is not just another printed reference. It's a real explanation on how to use features, step by step, and to create something. The smaller books, either only do high-level features, or cut parts they think will be seldom used. It always seems like the features they cut down on, are the ones I need to use in a project. Kudos here to the author, on writing a book that's useful, despite its massive girth.</span>

                    <span>I just recieved Flash MX 2004 HOT in the mail Dec. 31, 2003 - right on time for 2004 :) Thanks!!! I would had purchased the MX2004 Flash Bible, but its not available yet. Instead, I purchased Rosanna Yeung's user friendly book. One of the first things I did when I opened up the book was pop in the included tutorial CD that is loaded with wonderful examples and exercises. I especially enjoyed Rosanna's Quicktime tutorial movies relating to basic Action Script (controlMC.mov, loadMovieNum.mov, menu.mov, motionGuide.mov, musicSelector.mov, mutplShpTwn.mov, onion.mov, stop_play_actions.mov, stopAndPlay.mov, stopAndPlayMC.mov). The final Xboarding site .swf example pulls all the tutorials together... Nice Job! I would have enjoyed an additional chapter pertaining to .xml, as this seems to be essential knowledge for dynamic content, i.e. sound files, video, picts... etc. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a user friendly guide. Thanks again!</span>

                    <span>so far I am glas i did not spend the money on an other class, save you mony use the book, all you need is some motivation. the exersizes are fun, there are no missing steps, everything is thoroughly explains, the lay out is consistantly through the entire book, so you do not have to relearn how to use the book every chapter, as a matter of fact, I used the PhotoShop and ImageReady for the Web, and Dreamweaver befor, and the lay out is the same there too.</span>

                    <span>I'm a professional software developer, and I have little patience for most programming books and classes. I recently decided to learn Flash, and decided to try this book based on the "hands on" exercises. I'm completely satisfied! The descriptions and overviews are clear and well written, and the step by step exercises walk you through the important tools and techniques. I skipped a few exercises that seemed redundant, but others may want the additional reinforcement.<P>There's a LOT to Flash, and an intro book can't possibly cover it all. I'm already forgetting a few things from the first exercises. But based on this book, I now feel comfortable and competent to develop basic Flash animations and interactive files, and to explore further on my own.<P>I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Flash.</span>

                    <span>I needed to take a graphic character apart, and have the pieces fly back together on the website. With just a little reading and a little playing, I figured it out. The book shows good logic in the manner it presents its lessons. Admittedly without the background I have in Photoshop and understanding layers, it might have been more difficult to figure out.</span>
