                    <span>Jack Welch is a fabulously successful manager, but most small entrepreneurs are not.  They are just getting by on a day to day basis with little planning and are subject to bankrupcy with every crisis.  They don't have an MBA, and they don't have time to study the principles that would give them more time.  This book is a quick, easy read, it re-aligns their thinking, and gets them on track to success.  You can't give your struggling business acquaintances a better gift.

                    <span>This book reminds me of the best seller "Who Moved My Cheese". They are both written in oversized font and are about 100 pages long and both cover simple messages. If the books were in a regular font they would be 30 pages??<p>Please do not get me wrong. But it is just a feeling one gets that they have been had, sold a bill of goods which is just a summary with comments for $10. Somebody has written down a list of XX number of principle ideas or management techniques, and then expanded each idea to fill the 100 (30 real) pages. It would be almost as effective to just make a list of them on one or two pages.<p>The upshot of all this is do not buy this book, but by Jack's book "Straight from the Gut", or buy Slater's book:  "Jack Welch & The G.E. Way".<p>I prefer Jack's own book, and to me it beats many more sophisticated business books hands down. Business is not black and white. Almost every day there is one crisis or problem or another, and Jack's story puts it all together plus conveys the energy and excitement that he brought to the job. Something is lost in the list approach.<p>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>There are many books about Jack Welch and all of them show and teach the corporate strategies and tactics this legendary manager implemented while at GE. Most of those titles portrait Welch as the successful business person everybody would like to be. However, I would like to warn the reader that the professional success of famous CEOs cost them their families. It's hard to believe how Welch was able to manage thousands of relations with millions of people at GE, while on the other side he failed on a relation with only one person: his wife. By the way, how many wives has he had??? Is that success??? In which planet???<p>Now about the book . . . it's a good title but only read it if you have never before read a title about Jack Welch or GE; if you had, it's more about the same old stuff, and I would recommend your spending your money in a smarter way.</span>
