                    <span>A quote I used in a speech once says it all -- "Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity. They seem to be more afraid of life than death" - James F. Bymes
<br /> 
<br />In the October 2003 issue my newsletter I reviewed, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad." Then I read "CASHFLOW Quadrant" which Kiyosaki's says is Part II in a three-part series. As I read the book I found it to be an "eye-opening" experience.
<br />
<br />Financial success, or any other success for that matter, begins in the mind! The core idea is that there are four types of people in business: Employee, Self employed, Business Owner, and Investor. For quite some time I've advocated that Self-employed "Business Owners" are not really business owners because a business is a living entity unto itself and is not dependent on individuals. Kiyosaki takes that concept to the next level, explaining how employees (working for others or self) and business owners (and by extension, those who invest in businesses) think differently.
<br />
<br />In the end it boils down to security versus risk. Employees are consumed with an overriding desire for security that they will stay in dreadful jobs rather than risk opening their minds to other opportunities. On the other hand, business owners and investors constantly seek new ideas and seize opportunities. One reason they are so successful is they do not try to do everything themselves. Instead, business owners and investors hire a team of professionals to assist in their quest for financial success. Kiyosaki says that "the true motto of a 'B' is, Why do it yourself when you can hire someone to do it for you, and they can do it better?"
<br />
<br />"CASHFLOW Quadrant" is divided into three parts:
<br />
<br />Part I - The CASHFLOW Quadrant. Maps out the E/S/B/I Quadrant to explain how Employees, Self-employed, Business Owners, and Investors think and behave differently.
<br />
<br />Part II - Bringing Out The Best In You. Talks about how "Money is a drug." And how "A diet will not help if your thoughts do not change."
<br />
<br />Part III - How To Be A Successful "B" and "I" Presents "THE 7 STEPS TO FINDING YOUR FINANCIAL FAST TRACK" which illustrates exactly how to take control of your mind and your financial freedom.
<br />
<br />Whereas "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" offers inspiration, "CASHFLOW Quadrant is more about the "how-to's" of changing your view on work - hard or smart, and opening your mind to the unlimited possibilities surrounding each of us.

                    <span>The concepts of The Cashflow Quadrant can change your life. 
<br />Like other MAJOR self-help products, the concept is deceptively simple, which contributes to its elegance and power. 
<br />
<br />This book is a Charter Member of my Self-Help Collection, along with a number of KEY books that helped me to develop 
<br />the best aspects of myself as a man and as a person. 
<br />
<br />Other books and self-help products which are on par with this book are: 
<br />
<br />NEW SEX NOW: Life's Ultimate Pleasure 
<br />Giant Steps 
<br />How to Win Friens and Influence People 
<br />Self Matters 
<br />7 Spiritual Laws of Success 
<br />Ageless Mind, Timeless Body 
<br />THE 4 AGREEMENTS 
<br />The Power of Concentration 
<br />GODDESS WORSHIP 
<br />
<br />I believe that anyone who wants to be a great person would do well to study all of the above very sincerely.</span>

                    <span>In typical Kiyosaki fashion, Cashflow Quadrant gives the reader some extraordinary advice about building wealth. The cashflow quadrant is represented by four squares, where the E square represents Employee, S equals self-employed, B is business owner, and I is investor.
<br />
<br />The interesting point is that while many self-employed people see themselves as business owners, Kiyosaki believes a self-employed person is somebody who owns their job. A business owner is somebody who controls a business, but is not tied to its day to day operations. For example, a doctor is self-employed, and is limited in his ability to grow in wealth by his ability to work, while not being able to replicate himself. The owner of a service company, on the other hand, is able to hire a manager, build control mechanisms, and esentially leave the day to day operations to others, while collecting portions of the profit and being free to build other businesses.
<br />
<br />This book is highly readable and takes off where the first Rich Dad, Poor Dad ended. I recommend this book to any aspiring wealth builder. </span>

                    <span>This book is a continuation of the first book, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad." Some of the material is repetitive. This is not a problem as it goes deeper into cash flow concepts. The book does not give any simple answers and does not give the reader a blueprint or recipe to success. However, the book is superb at assisting the reader in thinking about money in a healthy way. The reader is given the concept in having money work for the reader, rather than just working for money. You can work hard to put money to work rather than just working to get money to spend on wasting assets.</span>

                    <span>I have to say that if you want to get out of the rat race you need to understand how cash flow works.  This book will change the way you think about money - your money.  I couldn't recommend this book higher for everyone who is tired of working hard and tired of not being wealthy.  I also recommend Stop Working by Rohan Hall.  This book teaches you how to build a cash flow based Agile business.  Buy both of these books and learn how to become financially independent.</span>
