                <span id="Label1">J. David Kuo had a ringside seat at one of the biggest busts of the Internet age. Value America (NASDAQ:VUSA) was supposed to revolutionize retailing by using the Internet-no more retailers or distributors needed. Fred Smith, legendary founder of Federal Express, called it the best business model he'd ever seen and invested millions of dollars.  In a few short years, the company raised and spent hundreds of millions of dollars before a spectacular crash. <P>As Senior Vice President of Communications, Kuo saw the stupefying insanity of it all: the machinations, delusions, good efforts, and wild miscalculations that led to the company's demise. Writing with a liveliness and flair seldom seen in business narratives, Kuo brings us tales of wretched excess, inspired salesmanship, online dreams, and unmitigated moneygrabbing.  This is an unforgettable story of Internet mania that everyone who ever invested in a tech stock will be dying to read.</span>

                    <span>I think some of the criticisms of Mr. Kuo are too harsh. Like others, I noticed that in this book Kuo alternates between praising Craig Winn and describing the horrible actions of Craig Winn. I took that as a sign that Kuo personnaly felt ambivalent. That doesn't make it a bad book. Ambivalence is a normal condition. Glossing it over to create some kind of artifice of consistency would have truly made this a bad book.
<br />
<br />One thing I got out of this book, besides that I enjoyed reading it, was some insight into human nature. It's a book that can tell you something about the way people act and the strange drives that they have. It shows how sometimes people with terrible psychological problems and huge blind spots are the most rich and powerful.</span>

                    <span>Commendable read of the Internet debacle from a self-proclaimed insider. The problem of Value America was the same of most dot.coms during its epoch--it should have never have gone public when it was still suffering from such a disastrous business plan, mammoth burn rate, and megalomaniacal CEO/founder. Great basis for a story; unfortunately, Kuo lacks the aplomb to carry the book towards the pantheon of great business books.

                    <span>Though much has been written about dot.com successes (Google, EBay, Amazon), few books have been devoted to the failures which I believe provide the more interesting stories. 
<br />
<br />I'm glad this book came along to provide us an inside look of a dot.com company(Value America) from its inception, near death, rebirth and inevitable demise from overblown expectations, mismanagement and intrigue which could very well be the stories of dot.coms past. 
<br />
<br />If you want to know why corporate graveyards are littered with dot.bombs then this is the book to read.</span>

                    <span>The problem with this book is that it didn't climax. The company didn't spectacularly go up in flames. Instead, Kuo lays out its problems page by page. It never builds toward anything, instead plodding to the company's demise. There wasn't a single anecdote that was worthy of retelling, which is a rarity for me among non-fiction books. I'm always recounting something fascinating or interesting or funny that happened to the main character. There just didn't seem to be any of that here.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I'll admit -- I finished this book relatively quickly. It's a quasi-page turner; that's why I gave it three stars instead of one. <p>But all along, as Kuo recounts his story of working for a seemingly mentally unstable CEO, he seems to feign naivete. "I saw Craig Winn as a visionary." But in the next paragraph, Kuo is pointing out how Winn was lying to the press and financial analysts. So Kuo really undercuts his own credibility by trying to play both sides here.<p>Here's my theory: He needed to suck up to Winn to get access in order to write this book. So even though he points out Winn's erratic moments and his outright lying, he thanks Winn at the end, and praises him. Ah, the price of media access!<p>Also, I think Kuo is embarassed, as he should be. He bought the dot-com story hook, line and sinker. He thought he'd be a millionaire, so he desperately wanted to believe Craig Winn's blather. On top of that, Kuo recruited his own wife and in-laws to work at Value America, so he's got a lot to be embarassed about!<p>Ultimately, Kuo's own equivocation prevents this story from being genuinely compelling.</span>
