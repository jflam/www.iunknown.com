                    <span>I bought this book 4 years ago when converting a bedroom into a sewing/craft room. Best book I've ever read on remodeling/building. In fact I still like to pick it up and pour over its pages. Ms. Black covers all the bases, from lighting to colors, walls, flooring, counters, drawer sizes, pegboard ideas. Plus, its not limited to ideas for the person who has a big space to fill. She works with rooms that share office space, guest bedrooms, closets and even a pantry. I followed her advice on color, countertops,insisted on kitchen cabinets and not the dinky bathroom vanity size, lighting and much more - and love my space. I've recommended this book to many friends (but refuse to lend them my copy). Useful for other rooms as well.</span>

                    <span>I got this book when we were in the process of buying our house where I would be blessed with my own sewing room.  Preparing a sewing room promised to be expensive, but in addition to the standard ideas for doing the room, this book also gave many inexpensive yet stylish and convenient ways to set up the room.  I love it and will not part with it, even after the room is finished.  I'm sure I'll use this reference for as long as I sew!</span>

                    <span>This book was an excellent resource for planning my sewing <br>room in the spare bedroom of my new house. I bought it long <br>before I moved into my new space and it had terrific ideas <br>I could use in my existing kitchen corner sewing area.  Once <br>I moved, I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I was able to <br>convert my old kitchen and office furniture to a fabulous <br>space for myself.  You'll never want to buy one of those <br>lame prefab sewing consoles once you see the spaces in this <br>book. Excellent ideas for all types of storage depending on <br>how you work and what type of sewing you do. Even if you only <br>have a closet or a corner, this book will inspire you.</span>

                    <span>A great book chock full of information and inspiration! This book will help you turn any space, from a closet to an extra room, into a well-planned sewing area that meets your specific sewing needs.</span>

                    <span>This book is helpful but not as inspiring as I had hoped. There are many good ideas, but for me there was just something missing. I found a few things I will certainly include in my new sewing room but I did not find my dream sewing space in this book.</span>
