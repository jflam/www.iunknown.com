                <span id="Label1"><P> <B>"The miracle isn't that I finished. The miracle is that I had the courage to start." <P> Take <I>your</I> first step toward fitness and a happier, healthier life.</B> <P> Has the idea of running crossed your mind, but you haven't acted on it because you don't think you have the body of a runner? Have you thought about running but quit before you started because you knew that you would be breathless at the end of your driveway? Well, put aside those fears because you <I>can</I> do it. John Bingham, author of the popular <I>Runner's World</I> column "The Penguin Chronicles," transformed himself from an overweight couch potato who smoked into a runner who has completed eleven marathons and hundreds of road races. <P> Forget about the image of a perfect body in skintight clothes, and don't worry about how fast or how far you go. Bingham shows how anyone can embrace running as a life-enhancing activity -- rather than as a competition you will never win. In an entertaining blend of his own success story and practical advice, Bingham provides reasonable guidelines for establishing a program of achievable goals; offers tips on clothing, running shoes, and other equipment; and explains how <I>anyone</I> can prepare for and run distances ranging from a few miles to marathons. <P> After all, in running and in life, the difference between success and failure sometimes comes down to a single step. Waddle on, friends.</span>

                    <span>John Bingham writes an excellent and often funny book about how running can empower a person. He discusses his progression from overweight couch potato to slow but fit runner. His story is an inspiring one. As someone who lost 100 pounds through running and now frequently competes in road races, this book was like reliving my journey to fitness. It made me feel nostalgia.<P> Bingham discusses what is the essence of running - pushing through discomfort to become more content. He is funny, eloquent, and willing to be proud of his accomplishments. The Courage to Start is a book that I wish everyone would read just once. There is something in it for everyone - from the 15 minute 5Kers to those who seek a more active and healthy lifestyle. The book conveys a message that so few people in America don't hear enough - go for your dreams and don't be afraid to fail. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of John Bingham's through reading his "Penguin Chronicles" in Runner's World. Like his monthly column, this book serves to inspire, motivate and teach the fitness or recreational runner how to participate in this sport and eventually, to race. I wish this book were around when I started to run, because it would have saved me useless self-doubt. John's talent is that he "gets into the head" of the recreational runner, who may have much enthusiasm, but have more limitations talent-wise than, for example, Flo-Jo or Carl Lewis. Nonetheless, as he points out, we all belong to the running community. In his book, John teaches us that no matter what our respective place in a race, or age-group category, we all are winners.</span>

                    <span>This book will inspire your inner athlete! An active life style involves mental as well as physical conditioning. Wanting to be more active is the starting point. Getting started takes an act of your courage. Set your mind in the right direction, and the body will follow. Bingham's writing style is entertaining and encouraging. The dedication to a goal that one learns through running/walking can be used to focus on non-athletic goals in life.</span>

                    <span>I found myself in this book. When things get rough for me I pick it up again. I found my mantra in the introduction and repeat it while running. "Yes I am round! Yes I am slow! Yes I run as though my knees were tied together! But I am running! And that is all that matters!" Truly inspirational!!</span>

                    <span>After reading such fabulous reviews of this book, I was eagerly anticipating reading it. I was very disappointed. Many of us have tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed at running. In my case, this was because I really didn't know how to train. I would try to do too much, and wind up doing too little, and quitting before I ever improved.<P>This book told me many times, it's OK to be a slow runner, but keep trying. It didn't tell me HOW to increase my stamina so that I could actually achieve anything. The only practical information I got was about buying running shoes. <P>If you're looking for a lot of wordy inspiration, you might like this book. But if you want to know what you need to DO to progress from a non runner to a runner, Bob Glover's "A Runner's Handbook" is a much better bet.</span>
