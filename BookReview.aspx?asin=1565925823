                <span id="Label1"><I>Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution</I> is a fascinating look at the raging debate that is its namesake. Filled with writings from the central players--from Linux creator Linus Torvalds to Perl creator Larry Wall--the book convinces the reader of the overwhelming merits of freeing up the many iterations of software's source code.<p> The open-source movement has become a cause c&#233;l&#232;bre in light of the widespread adoption of Linux, Perl, and Apache as well as its corporate support from Netscape, IBM, and Oracle--and strongly felt opposition from Microsoft. <I>Open Sources</I> doesn't address <I>why</I> these Microsoft foes are throwing their weight behind the movement. Instead, it focuses on the history and philosophy of open-source software (previously referred to as <I>freeware</I>) as an argument for shaping the future of programming. <I>Open Sources</I> is much larger than just a fight with any one company. Instead, it is a revolutionary call to release software development from the vested interests that label new directions in software development as threatening.<p> This is not to say that opening the source code is an entirely egalitarian and communistic endeavor. These are programmers and startup owners; they want to be able to continue to program for a living. To that end, <I>Open Sources</I> contains strong business profiles from entrepreneurs such as Apache's--and now, O'Reilly & Associates'--Brian Behlendorf, who discusses how to give away software in order to lure customers in for specialized versions. In many ways, this is a hands-on guide, displaying an insider's view of the development process and providing specifics on testing details and altering licensing agreements. However, interspersed with tech talk is a reader-friendly guide for those interested in the future of software development. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I></span>

                    <span>This book is an interesting window on the Open Source world. It is a strange planet with strange people. Some crazy idealist like R. Stallman (I like the guy very much), some smart and intelligent person like L. Torvald (he did a very good job with Linux). In between someone that was just in the right place at the right time, but who doesn't deserve so much space and celebrity. I am talking about a person that seems confused as the language he invented: Larry Wall. His contribution does not require further comments.</span>

                    <span>This is a good idea on O'Reilly's part to try to document the history and goals of the Open Source movement, which had roots in several college campuses and research labs in the '70s and '80s, and became news in the late '90s with the popularity of Linux, Apache, and the decision of Netscape to open its browser source. The best introductory piece, however, is probably Eric Raymond's "Cathedral and the Bazaar" which is not in this book(O'Reilly publishes it separately, but it's available free on the Web and short enough to be read in one sitting).  As for this collection, I liked Robert Young's business case for distributing open source - his story of how Red Hat was launched reminds me of the Compaq tale of "three guys in a restaurant".  The Apache article is also quite good, and Linus Torvalds offers a brief but interesting (and characteristically opinionated) article about how Linux evolved technically.  There's also a good article discussing the various open source licenses (BSD, GPL, Netscape, etc) and what they do and don't restrict.<p>Others I was less impressed with.  Stallman's article is predictable and self-serving.  He explains how he evolved his software-as-gift philosophy but doesn't come close to terms with how the software industry can support substantial employment if all source is given away.  There's yet another history of the different branches of BSD Unix.  There's a breathtaking inside account of the launch of Mozilla which ends with the fancy Silicon Valley party when development has finally gotten underway. The low point is Larry Wall's "essay", which is a frankly ridiculous waste of time and print.<p>Although this is a mixed bag, there's enough reference material and interesting points of view to keep the book around.</span>

                    <span>This book was the first O'Reilly book to contain essays about the concept of Open Source and was later followed by the book, The Cathedral and the Bazaar. While some essays may seem similar to the latter, each of them are still fascinating and offer an insightful look into what makes Open Source work and why this phenomenon has become its own industry.<p>Among the essays here are included a "history" of Unix, essays about Cygnus (who offers a source code complier program) and Red Hat (who offers Linux), two businesses that sell services related to open source, an essay about the effects of releasing open source code for Netscape, one about the GNU Operating System and even one by Linux Torvals, the "father" of Linux.<p>What's continually fascinating to me the more I read about Open Source is the amount of time and energy others voluntarily put into an open source project to make it work that much better. Not to mention the entire "society" that is built around Open Source.<p>An interesting read, along with the Cathedral and the Bazaar.</span>

                    <span>Open Sources is a collection of essays by people who have been involved in a prominent way in what is being called "the open source revolution."  The authors are all very bright people with good  intentions and diverse viewpoints; this makes for interesting reading.  However, I had a problem with the introduction.  In fact, I hated it. It  attempts to couch the issue of free vs. non-free software in religious  terms: in the bad old days, free software only came from universities or  other government-funded research.  Then, a few companies saw the light and  began to open-source their software; currently the industry is divided  between these companies (the saved) and the rest of the companies (the  damned) who will spiral into oblivion due to their proprietary selfishness.   I thought the presence of this sort of rhetoric in the introduction, which  sets the tone for the rest of the book, was particularly unfortunate.<p>The  essays in Open Sources are a mixed bag.  Kirk McKusick's history of  Berkeley UNIX is great, as is Michael Tiemann's history of Cygnus  Solutions, RMS's article about the GNU project, and Bruce Perens' article  about licensing issues.  Also, I really enjoyed the transcript of the  infamous 1992 flame war between Linus and Andy Tanenbaum about the merits  of Linux vs. Minix.  On the other hand, Paul Vixie's article about software  engineering is pretty random, Larry Wall's article does not seem to have a  point at all, and Eric Raymond's<p>second article and Tom Paquin's account  of the open-sourcing of Netscape are too self-serving to be useful.  <p>Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  However, the year that has  passed since its publication has exposed some of the more outlandish  predictions made by its contributors (Eric Raymond said that Windows 2000  would either be canceled or be a complete disaster).  My guess is that Open  Sources is not destined to become a classic.  Rather, in a few years it  will be viewed as an interesting but somewhat naive period piece.</span>
