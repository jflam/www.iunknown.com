                    <span>This book has really helped me jump into learning how to create server side components for Microsoft Transaction server and components for stand alone applications as well. From the history of VB and COM to finely tuned real world examples, this book covers it all. Although it could have done without the Internet primer (like what is HTML?) I think a majority of the book is chalk full of COM and VB goodies. Enjoy! I sure did...</span>

                    <span>This is a well written and logical survey of COM from a VB perspective. With only 371 pages of text, it attempts to tackle a broad subject area. The level of complexity is comparable to what is expected in the VB Distributed exam (70-175), for which it is an excellent study adjunct.<P>I enjoyed reading it from end to end, and keep it as a reference for certain developer skills that I use infrequently. While I consider the book to be aimed at a "beginner" in COM, beginners in COM are at least intermediate level VB developers. The moniker on the cover, "for enterprise developers", is a little misleading, since serious enterprise VB developers will need more detail than is provided. However, in creating a survey aimed at broadening one's understanding of all of Microsoft's COM technologies, the Eddons are successful.<P>Weaknesses: The book is far too brief for so broad a subject matter. For example, a single chapter on MTS (the lifeblood of n-tier architecture performance) can only touch the highlights. Creation of ActiveX controls gets much deeper coverage. Another weakness is the (not unexpected) Microsoft optimism with respect to the performance and robustness of COM technologies. A healthy dose of caveats is lacking.<P>Conclusion: A good introduction to COM for intermediate level VB developers. A superb study adjunct for 70-175 candidates.</span>

                    <span>Originally I bought Dan Appleman's book on ActiveX. Intimidated by its size and by what seemd to be digressions into nowhere, I switched to this one. Not a good move. VB6's own manuals do a much better job of leading you through the paces, and contain a bit more background than found here -- though it's still not enough. The authors furnish a few step-by-step recipes, but no in-depth understanding that allows you to move beyond the limited examples or design your own from scratch. They neglect to mention COM's performance hits and offer no workarounds. Even as a basic intro to ActiveX, you'll find more in the VB6 manuals. 3rd-party books ought to supplement and enhance the original product's documentation; this book doesn't. Save time and money; no 3rd-party manual is a 100% substitute for the original product documentation, which in the case of VB5/VB6 is actually quite good (especially compared to what's in this book). Start with the VB6 online docs first, then go to Appleman's book for a deeper understanding of what's happening and what you can do with it. As it turns out, what I thought were Appleman's "digressions" were a preface to what COM/ ActiveX is about; perusing through 3 other competetive books revealed that they all use the same approach, but none are as complete or as clear as Appleman's version. This book by the Heddons is far too skimpy and incomplete to be of great use to intermediate/advanced VB users. If you want a general summary or to dip a toe in the water, save $$$ and read VB6's own chapter summaries from the online manuals. You will not be able to use the information in the Heddon book without covering most of the first 2 VB6 volumes beforehand.</span>

                    <span>This book briefly covers all the relavant COM subjects, without much depth. However, I found the section on ActiveX controls very useful.<P>For example, the section on page 129 on setting base addresses is a rare discussion of base addresses for ActiveX controls and DLLs. Something like this subject is often passed over in other books to make room for more depth or programing examples. This book covers subjects like this in a way that is easy to understand and use.</span>
