                    <span>I am new to the world of machine embroidery, altho' I've been sewing for 35 yrs.  I was hesitant to begin, knowing there were lots of variables that needed to come together to make successful designs, and I didn't want to ruin anything.  This is a great book if you are just starting out, and probably a great reference even if you are not.  All the information you could want regarding types of materials, tools, and techniques is here.  I was even having trouble when I was practicing a design I had downloaded, and this book helped me figure out what I needed to do to make it work.</span>

                    <span>I work in a store and teach embroidery & digitizing, this is absolutely THE BEST primer for people just starting out in machine embroidery, and it's a great reference manual for everyone else. It is not machine-specific, so no matter what you've got, you will find information in here to help you out. This is THE book I always recommend to newbies!</span>

                    <span>I bought the book because I have a new Bernina emboidery machine, although this book has excellent photos, and step by step projects, it only shows designs and examples from most machine but Berninas. If you are trying to but a book as a reference for projects, this book is great. I will have to keep looking for something that shows at least one example on a Bernina machine, and more information on how to get designs from a computer, internet, and the use of the magic box.</span>

                    <span>I was new to machine embroidery and I happened to see this particular book lying on the store owners sewing desk.  I browsed through it and was immediately hooked!  I had to have my own copy. It has everything you could possibly need to know about machine embroidery.  I never did go back and do the classes for my machine...it was all in this book and then some!<br>The extra CD was a nice touch to the lessons!</span>

                    <span>I'm very please with the information in this book.  It covers many techniques and has suggestions on all aspects of machine embroidery.  I wish I had this book when I got my machine since it would have saved me from making many mistakes.  I also like the inspirational section to provide many different ideas to try.</span>
