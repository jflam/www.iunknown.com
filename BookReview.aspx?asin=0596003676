                <span id="Label1">Everybody who has worked with Cisco routers for any length of time has had to ask their friends and co-workers for example router configuration files that show how to solve a common problem.  A good working configuration example can often save huge amounts of time and frustration when implementing a feature that you've never used before.  The <i>Cisco Cookbook</i> gathers hundreds of example router configurations all in one place.  As the name suggests, <i>Cisco Cookbook</i> is organized as a series of recipes. Each recipe begins with a problem statement that describes a common situation that you might face.  After each problem statement is a brief solution that shows a sample router configuration or script that you can use to resolve this particular problem.  A discussion section then describes the solution, how it works, and when you should or should not use it.  The chapters are organized by the feature or protocol discussed.  If you are looking for information on a particular feature such as NAT, NTP or SNMP, you can turn to that chapter and find a variety of related recipes.  Most chapters list basic problems first, and any unusual or complicated situations last.   The <i>Cisco Cookbook</i> will quickly become your "go to" resource for researching and solving complex router configuration issues, saving you time and making your network more efficient. </span>

                    <span>This is not a networking or Cisco primer. This book assumes that you have a task to accomplish, then gives explanations and examples to help you accomplish them. It's extremely helpful when you have an idea of what needs to be done and need help with specific configurations.<P>If you know how to create and administer Cisco networks but sometimes need outside help when unfamiliar situations arise, then this book can be that assistance.</span>

                    <span>I always thought nobody can do justice other than Cisco Press when it comes to Cisco books. I was absolutely wrong!. <P>Just my 2 cents worth of comments to a previous reviewer saying "no backgound problem information is given". My answer is: There is a reason why they are saying it is a "CookBook". Whenever you are stressed for answers, this book will save you and give a quick solution and enough theory so you can implement what you want to. For theory there are plenty of books in the market and I don't think that approach would have added any value to the book other than size :-) I recommend this title to any cisco professional without a doubt.</span>

                    <span>This book is much like Cisco Press's the Practical Studies or the Field Manual, with "down-to-earth" explainations. I like idea of the book where it starts from a problem then to suggested solution and discussion on the "why that way".<P>But I think before the authors throw the problems, they should start with background as to why the problems arise or what the situations are that push up the problems to arise. For years-of-experience Cisco networkers, this might not a problem. But for most of us who just start to get deeper on Cisco product configuration, the book kind leave us hanging.<P>For instance, page 162; convert between the three different formats that Cisco routers use to present mask information: standard netmask, ACL wildcards, and CIDR bit numbers. Many of us may wonder, why would someone need to do this? What is the background situation that makes this problem come up?<P>Another example, page 183; restrict how many paths your router can use simultaneously to reach a particular destination. The solution the authors suggest include OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP (dynamic routing protocols). The problem is that discussion on OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP comes up on next pages. So the authors expect the readers to have sufficient knowledges on such protocols. But what about most of us that only have little or no knowledge of such things but need to configure Cisco products as easy and as quick as possible?<P>Previous reviewer mentioned about connecting a network to two different ISPs using two routers to eliminate any single points of failure (page 327). The solution the authors suggest is to use BGP. This situation comes up usually when redundant Internet connections is needed. Yes, it can be done by BGP. But the authors never mention that deploying BGP in a network is not as easy as it looks. To run BGP, there are a lot to prepare (not to mention a lot of money to spend that only large organizations can afford). For small or medium size companies, they better use other dynamic routing protocols or just static routing with equal weight (equal cost load sharing or load balancing); which the author never mention.<P>When this book's 2nd edition comes up, I hopefully that the authors should consider this issue to make the book more appealing to "commoners", general audiences, and to people who just start configuring Cisco products. Also the authors should point out any problems, consequences, caveats, or requirements by running their suggested configurations. Therefore, anybody (especially the commoners) can have better understanding of the situations.<P>I suggest that all readers of this book should be aware one book (including this one) is never enough as single reference of all Cisco configuration problem. You should also refer to other books and literatures such as the Cisco Presses, Cisco websites, any Cisco discussion groups, and most important; your own experiments.</span>
