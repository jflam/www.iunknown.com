                <span id="Label1">Pete Rose's <I>My Prison Without Bars</I> is written for a purpose: to make Pete Rose's case for the Hall of Fame. On paper, Rose's credentials seem unassailable. The all-time career hits leader, Rose owns seven Major League and twelve National League records from his 24 years in baseball.<p>  The controversy comes down to Major League Baseball's Rule 21: "Any... employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible." In 1989 Rose was suspended from baseball after allegations that he gambled on the sport, allegations Rose denied. Thereafter, fans and sportswriters have speculated that baseball officials would re-instate Rose if only he admitted his guilt. In the book, Rose confesses--for the first time--that he did in fact bet on Reds games while he managed the team, though he claims that he never bet <I>against</I> the Reds. This would seem to be the "coming clean" that baseball was looking for.<p>  Rose, however, doesn't seem ready to give up his fight. The book attacks John Dowd and Commissioner Bart Giamatti for the 1989 report which ultimately led to Rose's suspension. Rose picks apart the report showing that the evidence was either falsified or from unreliable sources. Yet, he admits that the document's conclusion--that he bet on baseball--was accurate. Rose declares guilt but still seems to believe, as he says, that gambling is a "victimless crime" and that his punishment does not fit the crime. He won't "act sorry or sad or guilty" because he is "just not built that way."<p>  Admirers of Rose the athelete will likely be disappointed by the book. After a too-short recollection of his life in baseball, Rose dwells heavily on the gamblers, bookmakers, runners, and memorabilia dealers who made up his world when he could no longer compete as a player. In the end, <I>My Prison Without Bars</I> is an interesting historical document in one of the greatest baseball scandals of all time, but those looking for a record of Rose's amazing baseball achievements are better off consulting <I>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</I>. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I></span>

                    <span>I write this review as an ex-Pete Rose fan who saw Pete play in person in 1979. I also saw him sign a lifetime ban in 1989.
<br />
<br />As far as readability, the book is just fine. But it seems to me to symbolize the Jason Giambi apology or the Bill Clinton clever ruse - confess to as little as possible and get out of the way.
<br />
<br />And here's the unfortunate part: Pete Rose actually did bet on baseball. That may be as surprising as the headline saying "Sun Rises In The East," but the admission is a big one. The problem, however, is that Pete not only took 15 years to admit he did it - which is bad enough - but he also waited to release his book and go on 20/20 the day the new Hall of Fame inductees were announced (Eckersley and Molitor in 2004). Given that Pete gets two basic shots before the Vets Committee has to decide on him, it seems Pete is hoping a sympathy backlash will get him in the Hall. After all, that's all this is really about.
<br />
<br />He also spent time justifying his different behaviors by claiming to be a compulsive gambler, suffer from ADHD, and to suffer from anti-social personality disorder. Why not just say you did it?
<br />
<br />Well, Pete doesn't have that option. He wrote a book in 1990 that claimed he didn't - so I'm guessing that one should go to the fiction section, right?
<br />
<br />The fact is that Pete had 15 years to come clean and made a lot of people look foolish who took up for him. The only thing in Pete's favor I can say is that the current steroid scandal is making him look far more appealing.
<br />

                    <span>This book was not really worth the time it took to read it.  I was expecting a David Wells type tell all but Pete just goes on about his mistreatment.  I once believed Pete should be in the Hall of Fame and signed a few petitions but never again.  After reading Fay Vincent's book I was hoping this would show the other side of the coin.  No such luck.  Rose constantly finds somebody else to blame for his problems or throws down the terms his therapist uses to give him an excuse.  Read something else.
<br />
<br />I recommend: Perfect I'm Not - David Wells, The Last Commissioner - Fay Vincent, Catcher in the Wry - Bob Uecker, Zim - Don Zimmer and any by Yogi Berra. </span>

                    <span>being a baseball player myself, i've always admired pete's style of play. so needless to say i've always be a fan of his. now i've never met pete personally, but my father played on the reds with pete. my dad describes pete as a great teammate...not cocky and hard to get along with like everyone describes him.
<br />
<br />any fan of baseball should naturally be interested in this book. once i read the book i was overwhelmed. of course his 4,000 plus hits seem immortal, but he certainly isnt. in this book he talks about all aspects of his life, and shows you Pete Rose-The Man, the father...not pete rose, the baseball player, gambler. now many would say that he lied to his fans for over 10 years, but the truth is, he was just in denial because of the thought of the consequences of what might happen. 
<br />
<br />at card shows, old timers games, celeb golf tournaments, etc., people always come up to my dad and ask him whether or not he thinks pete rose deserves to be in the hall of fame...and he answers the same every time, and i agree with him. pete rose was a helluva baseball player, and a good person, but nonetheless, what he does off of the field does not take away from what he's accomplished on the field. do i think he should be in the hall of fame? YES!!!!</span>

                    <span>Disclaimer: I attended Game 4 of the 1972 World Series (Reds vs. A's) as a screaming young A's fan. My favorite player was Gene Tenace, but I loved baseball and could appreciate players from the National League, too, even a Reds player. Johnny Bench was my second favorite catcher.
<br />
<br />If this is the book that Pete Rose thought would change the Commissioner's mind, then he is deluding himself about more than his problem gambling.
<br />
<br />Rose has a zillion excuses for his gambling -- it's legal, he has attention deficit disorder, it's just the way he is, he doesn't drink or hit his wife, his father gambled, etc. He just wants to be treated the same as everyone else. Except that he also wants special treatment for having more hits than Ty Cobb.
<br />
<br />My Prison Without Bars (how's that for a self-pitying title?) tells the story of Rose's life. He's just a regular guy who swears and spits and scratches and likes to bet on just about anything. But he loves baseball more than all that and he's really good at it. 
<br />
<br />I can't imagine this book changing anyone's mind. Rose portrays himself as a victim, hanging out with people who took advantage of him, being treated unfairly by Giamatti and Kuehn and now Selig. He takes credit for everything good that happens and blames someone else for everything bad. The good ol' boy style of the narrative gets old fast.
<br />
<br />It seems that interest in Rose's situation is limited. Most fans of the game formed an opinion about Rose's suspension years ago, and there is nothing here to change one's mind. At this point, Rose reappearing to press his claim once more is a bit sad. Rose says he wants to move on now, and maybe he will.
<br />

                    <span>If Pete Rose was hoping this book would help his case for reinstatement, he has made yet another error.  "My Prison Without Bars" provides insight into Rose's self delusion.  I was ambivalent until reading this book, but Rose convinced me that baseball should never allow him back.  Read it for yourself and I'm certain you will agree. </span>
