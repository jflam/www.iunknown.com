                <span id="Label1"><i>The Grid is an emerging infrastructure that will fundamentally change the way we think about-and use-computing.  The word Grid is used by analogy with the electric power grid, which provides pervasive access to electricity and has had a dramatic impact on human capabilities and society.  Many believe that by allowing all components of our information technology infrastructure-computational capabilities, databases, sensors, and people-to be shared flexibly as true collaborative tools the Grid will have a similar transforming effect, allowing new classes of applications to emerge.</i><br>                  -From the Preface <br><br>In 1998, Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman introduced a whole new concept in computing with the first edition of this book. Today there is a broader and deeper understanding of the nature of the opportunities offered by Grid computing and the technologies needed to realize those opportunities.  In Grid 2, the editors reveal the revolutionary impact of large-scale resource sharing and virtualization within science and industry, the intimate relationships between organization and resource sharing structures and the new technologies required to enable secure, reliable, and efficient resource sharing on large scale.<br>Foster and Kesselman have once again assembled a team of experts to present an up-to-date view of Grids that reports on real experiences and explains the available technologies and new technologies emerging from labs, companies and standards bodies.  Grid 2, like its predecessor, serves as a manifesto, design blueprint, user guide and research agenda for future Grid systems.<br><br>*30 chapters including more than a dozen completely new chapters.<br>*Web access to 13 unchanged chapters from the first edition.<br>*Three personal essays by influential thinkers on the significance of Grids from the perspectives of infrastructure, industry, and science.<br>*A foundational overview of the central Grid concepts and architectural principles.<br>*Twelve application vignettes showcase working Grids in science, engineering, industry, and commerce.<br>*Detailed discussions of core architecture and services, data and knowledge management, and higher-level tools.<br>*Focused presentations on production Grid deployment, computing platforms, peer-to-peer technologies, and network infrastructures.<br>*Extensive bibliography and glossary.</span>

                    <span>I don't understand some of the critical reviews of this book. The fact is that Grids do exist today and are being used by Research oriented companies. About two dozen companies are already serving clients in the realm of grid computing. Platform Computing, United Devices, and Avaki are just three companies who are helping to create the future of the grid computing. The web succeded because it connected everybody. Until larger grids are contructed for business enterprises I agree that grid computing will not grow. The book does a great job of showing what the future may be like in terms of grid computing. Someday your computing resources will come from your local Grid Computing Company just as you get electricity from your Power Company. How that comes to be is still the ultimate question.</span>

                    <span>This book is full of visions of the future and other hyperbole. The "grid" is discussed as if it: a) is already in existence or b) is completely planned and the subsystems are tested, and is just waiting implementation. Neither could be further from the truth. While making hopeful predictions about the future is a good way to guide your thoughts and help in planning, it is sill just a guess! In particular, the notion of a "computational grid", analogous to the power grid, is quite a reach. This concept is not a technical one so much as a social/business one. I just don't buy it. <P>The technical content of the book is limited. Few new concepts are presented, are scattered and poorly explained. For instance, I don't need this book to learn about 3-tier architecture. The best feature appears to be the surprisingly complete bibliography of reference papers. <P>Networks will continue to expand, in number and critically, in capacity. Computers, and the services that run on them, will take advantage of this added connectivity in ways that are not yet clear. But, this is far from the ubiquitous utility model where anyone can plug in anywhere receiving any service for a modest fee.<P>Lastly, the whole pretext of a completely planned grid that is proposed is shot down by the author's own arguments that services and utilities have grown mainly due to unanticipated forces. i.e. the whole example of the city of Chicago. No one planned a vast city, but it grew nonetheless. In this sense, I'm sure that if something like the grid will come to fruition, it will happen without the massive planning and government spending that is implied in the book.</span>

                    <span>Boy, when was VA declared an imagination-free zone? Don't the critical reviewers of this book have any belief in the possibilities afforded by grid computing? To complain that the book is light on technical detail is somewhat churlish, because the purpose of the book was to examine the possibilities, not show you how to code one up in an afternoon at the comfort of your desk. <P>Can there be any doubt that computing grids will start to become popular in some form or another? I don't think there is any doubt at all. Perhaps when some of the research and early work is complete and the standards agreed, some enterprising author can write a book on grid computing with more technical meat on the bone, but until that work is done, what would be the point? I suspect there just isn't all that much technical detail to point at yet. <P>To my way of thinking, all the possible uses and configurations of computing grids are still to be discovered. If you are one of the explorers intent on doing something new and different with the technology, then this book is for you. If you are only content to follow the crowd, once all the technical details have been worked out and served up on a plate to you by somebody else, then by all means skip this book and wait for one with more technical gravitas.</span>

                    <span>My title says it all. This is one of those "hand wave across the map" kind of books, and to call it a textbook is doing it quite a favor. If that's what you're into - a lot of dreams with no technical info to back it up, this book - and the most recent Starfleet manual - are for you. If you genuinely want to learn about real subjects in the area of high performance computing and networking, tho, skip this thing with prejudice.</span>
