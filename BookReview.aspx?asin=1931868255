                <span id="Label1">Color is a catalyst for feelings&#150;&#150;about how we look, decorate our home or office, plant in our garden, and relate to each other. The right colors stimulate or relax our senses, release happy memories, reflect how we feel about ourselves and our personal space. For the past twenty-five years, color authority and best-selling author, Lee Eiseman, has spoken to thousands of consumers and professionals about the influence of color.Now she provides expert answers for all of us who want more color in our lives. For The Color Answer Book, she has selected the questions people ask her most and broken them into the areas that most affect your life&#150;&#150;emotional responses; wardrobe planning, makeup, hair color, and accessories; decorating your home and office for yourself and for those you live and work with; your health; and especially your garden or outdoor space.</span>

                    <span>Laetrice Eiseman certainly hit on some common questions and answered them very well. This book should be read in conjunction with her other books, especially "Colors For Your Every Mood". These books are complementary.<P>I can't seem to get into her Color Word Association Quiz, which she has also used in another book. I like all the colors depending on context. Maybe it just isn't relevant to me yet or I'm too left-brained. It's a great concept if it works for you.<P>I use the Pantone Textile System for interior design. Homeowners should buy the vastly cheaper consumer version at http://www.therightcolor.com. Latrice's books are grounded in the Pantone systems and you will find her book more relevant if you make a small investment in the full color guide.<P>- jim</span>

                    <span>Ms. Eiseman delivers just what she promises here: lots of interesting and informative material about color, written in a nice conversational style. The book is lovely to look at, just as one would hope for a book of its type.<BR>It's interesting that Eiseman addresses "theory" as much as she does, yet still manages to write a book that is so personally oriented - it's all about color's place in your OWN life. I especially like the historical information included on many points. Highly useful and enjoyable.</span>

                    <span>This book deserves a whole universe of stars, not just 5 Stars. Most experts get "tired and repetitive" when they hit their 3rd or 4th books. But Leatrice's new book,the Color Answer Book, breaks new ground for her, yet she never diminishes her message. She informs and teaches with delightful wit and an elegant style. Most importantly, she asks the questions we ought to ask ourselves about color, but are too uninformed to know how to, even better; she gives us smart, intelligent, useful answers. What a package! Where else do you get the Questions and the Answers in Life, or in this case, in color?<BR>Brava, Leatrice. Thank you again for giving us all a wonderful tool. This ought to be gift wrapped and packaged with "Communicating with Color" and given to anyone who has color in their life or their business. <P>This is going to be another book I advise my clients to run out and buy. ..........</span>
