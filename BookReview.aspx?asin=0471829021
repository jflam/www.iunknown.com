                    <span>This book was used for Michigan Tech's Field Geology course and was very helpful for everything from the symbols used for geological features to correct field note taking. I have a hard cover which is much more durible than the paperback. I don't know if they still have the hard cover but I would recommend that first.</span>

                    <span>Compton's text is one of those it seems that every geologist has read at some point. Clear, concise and practical, the text covers all the basics of field geology. The text is in three basic parts: Chapters 1-8 cover doing field work, e.g., equipment needed, basic procedures at outcrops, mapping rock units, geologic mapping, use of aerial photos, and mapping with a plane table and alidade. Chapters 9-15 cover describing the basic rock types (sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic) as well as volcanic structures and plutons. I remember well almost memorizing the chapter on Stratigraphic Sections as an undergraduate. The final part of the book is the appendices which contain much valuable information such as percentage diagrams for estimating rock compositions by volume and a table of standard lithologic symbols. I carry photocopies of several of the appendices in my field notebook for reference. (They are lighter than the AGI Data Sheets and on some trips weight is critical.) Use of the book will clearly be dictated by the type of field work one does, however, the entire text is a wealth of information. The book only shows its age (1985) with omission of a couple of important developments in field geology such as GPS, now often used in field reports. However, this is only a minor complaint. Field geology is done in the field, but Compton's manual will give every geologist the necessary information to begin the adventure. And mastering the basics in "Geology in the Field" will provide a solid foundation on which to build all of our individual, personal quirks and habits we seem to evolve while at the outcrops.</span>
