                <span id="Label1">In Koufax, the first book in more than 30 years on the legendary baseball player, Edward Gruver tells the life story of the man many consider to be the greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.  <P>For five seasons, from 1962-1966, Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers wowed fans with his hard-throwing talent and dominated the game as no pitcher had before or since.  In the 1963 season alone, he went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA, struck out a major league record 15 Yankees in a game one win over New York in the World Series, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the series.  <P>Also an observant Jew, Koufax inspired a generation of youths to embrace their religious identity. He refused to pitch the opening game of the 1965 World Series since it fell on Yom Kippur, the most solemn of Jewish holidays, and he gained lasting admiration among Jewish people for observing other religious occasions.   For all his athletic brilliance, however, Koufax held the national spotlight for a relatively short time.  His dazzling career was marred by severe arthritis in his throwing arm.  A shy and private man, he retired in 1966 at the young age of 30 while still at the height of his game.  After a brief stint as a national broadcaster, he went into self-imposed exile from the media and lived in relative seclusion.  <P>Koufax includes extensive interviews with childhood friends; Dodger teammates, opponents, and front office personnel; and sports journalists who covered his career. Koufax will reacquaint fans with a legendary player from their youth and introduce a new generation to one of baseball's greatest pitchers.</span>

                    <span>Koufax...The name evokes visions of perfection; one who had it all and dominated baseball like no other pitcher before or since. Stricken with arthritis, the great Dodger southpaw walked away from the game in 1966 and seemingly vanished from the public eye. In his book, aptly titled "Koufax", author Ed Gruver successfully recreates the career of Sandy Koufax from the sandlots of Brooklyn to his final outing in the '66 World Series.<P>The only shortcoming of the book is that Gruver does little to unravel the mystery of Koufax the man. But, then again, Gruver can hardly be faulted as the Koufax mystique has reached DiMaggio-like proportions over the years and it is doubtful that anyone will ever crack it. As always, the mystique creates the legend.<P>Koufax was not interviewed for the book, so Gruver relies on former teammates and sportswriters to provide the meat of the book. The antedotes of Koufax's career are framed within a series of flashbacks relating to his gutsy victory over Minnesota in the 7th Game of the 1965 World Series.(A nice touch; reminiscent of Kevin Costner's "For Love of the Game".)Gruver describes, in horrific detail, the amount of pain and sheer torture that Koufax endured not only during the crucial 7th Game, but also during the final three years of his career. We learn of the near amputation of the middle finger of his pitching hand after suffering a mysterious circulatory ailment in 1964. In '65, when Sandy set what was then a Major League record 382 strikeouts, his left arm would swell to the size of his leg. Prior to each start, Koufax "treated" his arm with with an ointment so hot, it seared his skin. After each game he dipped his permanently bowed left arm into a tub of freezing ice-water.<P>Ironically, by relaying tales of pain and torment suffered by Koufax, Gruver inadvertently lets the reader gaze into the psyche of Koufax the man, not just Koufax the pitcher. We learn of the utter devotion and selflessness that this great athlete possessed. We discover the drive and the relentless pursuit of perfection that landed the hurler in the Hall of Fame. Most of all, we remember the one of a kind class act that was, and is, Sandy Koufax. Recommended for all sports enthusiasts.</span>

Gruver describes, in horrific detail, the sheer torture that Koufax endured not only during the crucial 7th game, but during the final three years of his career. In 1964 a mysterious circulatory ailment nearly prompted the amputation of a finger on his pitching hand. The following year Koufax pitched a mindboggling 336 innings (modern day aces usually rack up only 250 innings), while striking out what was then a record 382 batters. After each game his left arm , permanently bowed from arthritis, would swell to the size of his leg. The man never complained, he just "treated" his arm with an oinment so hot it seared his skin. So great was Koufax -- he won 26 games in '65, and 27 in '66 --that opposing players had difficulty believing his golden left arm was ravaged by arthritis. Ironically, by relaying such tales of anguish, Gruver inadvertently reveals a great deal about Koufax the person, not just Koufax the pitcher. We learn of the utter devotion and selflessness that this remarkable athlete possessed. We discover the drive and the relentless pursuit of perfection that landed the great hurler in the Hall of Fame. Most of all, we are left remembering the class act that was, and still is, Sandy Koufax. Recommended for all sports enthusiasts.

                    <span>"Koufax", as written by Ed Gruver, is a highly focused book that covers the life and times of this most private man with flair and tact.<P>The strength of this book is the combination of the author's narrative with the insightful quotes from interviews he conducted with Sandy's friends and former teammates.<P>Gruver covers Koufax's life and career through the spectrum of one game - Game 7 of the 1965 World Series. It's an interesting approach, and it works here since this game is regarded as the defining game in Koufax's great career. (Interesting that Jane Levy's book, published one year later, uses the same format, though with a different game).<P>"Koufax" is a wide-ranging story of the life and career of the man many consider the greatest left-handed pitcher in history. It's filled with interesting anecdotes and brings to life a highly private individual.<P>Overall, I found it an accurate portrayal of one of sports' most enigmatic figures.</span>

                    <span>Sandy Koufax is frequently described as a shy, introverted, and very private man. Perhaps because of this truth, it's hard to really get to know the real man... and even a biographer has trouble shedding any light on Sandy.<P>Gruver's book doesn't offer any new insight into Sandy's personality or private life. And the book frequently repeats several phrases over and over again! His pitching motion is described at least five times using the same description, and everyone interviewed for the book chimes in with the same description of his private side. Very repetitive! Lacking any real depth or anything new to say about Sandy Koufax, I guess the author decided to pad the book with repeated phrases. Sandy threw a great curve because of his "long fingers and overhead delivery." Sandy's lack of a good curve in the World Series forced him to "rely almost entirely on his fastfall." I can't tell you how many times I read this same information within the space of this short book.<P>Taking up the rest of the book is a pitch-by-pitch retelling of Game 7 of the 1965 World Series. Koufax was amazing to see pitch, and his dominance over other players was exciting to watch. But retold by Gruver in minute detail doesn't recreate the drama, it only puts us to sleep. Football fans have long said that "baseball is boring," and Gruver helps prove them right.<P>The author attempts to frame Koufax's story on the aforementioned 1965 World Series game 7, and jumps forward and backward between that game and the rest of Koufax's life and career. It's a literary device that doesn't work; I found myself confused about what year it was and what important game was being played. Also, Gruver's segue phrases between the 1965 World Series and moments earlier in Koufax's career are forced... moving from the eighth inning of Game 7 to an earlier Koufax pitching start, Gruver might say, "It was just like that time in San Francisco in 1962," and - BOOM - now he's recounting the details of a game played three years earlier. And then back to the 1965 World Series for the bottom of the eighth. And so on.<P>Hopefully, that newer Koufax biography ("Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy") is better and more exciting than this one. I don't think I've ever read a more boring baseball book, and certainly never one as monotonous as this one.</span>

                    <span>Koufax was the greatest, he deserves a better book. I suspect that some of the more positive reviews posted are more a reflection of the reviewers' feelings about Koufax, rather than the book. This book is poorly written and incredibly boring. How any writer could make the subject of Sandy's brilliant career boring is beyond me. But Gruver finds a way. The writing is dry and disorganized, there is little flow to the material, too many meaningless quotes from others are included without sufficent editing, and a plethora of unimportant details not only overwhelm the narative but are frequently repeated, sometimes three or four times. I've just ordered Jane Leavy's book, it's got to be better.</span>
