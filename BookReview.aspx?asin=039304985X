                <span id="Label1">The grand master of adventure photography reveals the art, craft, and philosophy behind his images. In sixty-six essays based on his popular column in <I>Outdoor Photographer</I>, and in more than one hundred and sixty color photographs, Galen Rowell shows how he transforms what he sees into vivid, memorable works of art. He clearly explains why "pre-visualizing" a photograph before exposing any film is one key to making an arresting image rather than a mere replica of what we see through the viewfinder. Along the way he also offers advice on practical and technical matters such as how to pack camera gear; what to leave behind when you've got to travel light; pushing film to extremes; and when and how to use fill flash, smart flash, and remote smart flash. This is a how-to book by an artist who has made adventure and photography a way of life. It is both an inspired manual to taking better photographs and an inspiring journey of discovery into the creative process. 160 color photographs.</span>

                    <span>This book ignites the passion of outdoor photography.  The way Galen writes makes you think you are next to him on that mountain creating the perfect shot.  While he doesn't tell you how to become him, which he shouldn't, he does offer great experince to all those who wish to seek it.</span>

                    <span>The best book I have ever purchased and I have read a lot of books. Have read this one four times in the 2 years I've had it and actually found more useful information each time. I think this is due to the fact that it seems you can only unlock in your mind the sense of what Galen is saying once you have taken something, applied it to your photography, seen a dramatic improvement and then gone back to check you haven't missed anything. It is then that the magic occurs and what appeared on first reading to be a simple statement is now laden with meaning not visible before. I expect to learn from these passages for some time to come as my photography evolves. The first half is particularly insightful and ultimately very applicable, despite first appearances.
<br />
<br />A true look into a highly creative mind, it is a pleasure and somewhat of a privilege to take this walk with Galen.</span>

                    <span>If you're a serious photographer (amateur or pro) and find your interest in shooting lagging occasionally, Rowell's enthusiasm might be contagiousness enough to provide a cure. This man was passionate about photography and went to extraordinary ends to get the shots he visualized. The majority of the book deals with his philosophy of photography and how he accomplished what he did. There's also much excellent technical advice. The book's only shortcoming, from my very personal perspective (take it for what it's worth), is the undercurrent of Rowell's ample ego. Were the personal pronoun "I" deleted from the book, its page count would be reduced considerably.  Nonetheless, I still strongly recommend "Inner Game" for the highly passionate and very personal account that it is -  an extraordinary photographer's testimonial to a life  totally devoted to the art of photography and love of nature. It makes you want to climb a mountain and take pictures!</span>

                    <span>People that purchased this book thinking they will be instructed on how to insert TAB-A into SLOT-B will be very disappointed.  <p>People that purchase a book on electrodynamics to tell them how to change a light-bulb will also be disappointed.<p>Let's be very clear about this:  This is not a How-To book.  If you're looking for a How-To, there are people lined up around the block to tell you what to do.<p>This is a book about capturing emotion, feeling, and energy in a photograph. Most importantly, this book discusses the need to be able to communicate these feelings and energy to other viewers.  Without this, your photograph has failed.  This is how to put parts of yourself (not physically) into the images you've captured. This is book that explores more the philosophy of photography than anything else.  <p>I've certainly gained a much greater appreciation on what it takes to capture those elements from this book.  It's not a be-all-end-all to photographic discussion, but it has made me think.  The first part of the text has probably been the most valuable, but each section thereafter ties into elements of the first section in quite interesting ways.<p>This book is not only humbling, (as are most books written by professionals and read by amateurs,) but it is uplifting.  It has both inspiring me to start down the path to being a better photographer, and has shown me with frightening clarity how my habits could turn that path into the road to mediocrity.<p>It's sad that Mr. Rowell's voice and shutter have been silenced, but I'm glad to have been introduced to his work and writings.</span>

                    <span>I have read all of Galen's books, God rest his soul, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's a collection of things about how good a photographer he is. I already know he was a great photographer but what I wanted is some ideas how I could get better. After 200 pages or so, I gave up reading the rest. Some info. is useful but 90% of the 280 pages were just plain boring.</span>
