                <span id="Label1">Writing kernel-mode Windows NT programs--such as file-system drivers (FSDs), filter drivers, and antivirus programs--poses a challenge to even experienced Windows programmers. It's hard enough to get these programs to work, but getting them to live peacefully with other kernel programs and NT itself is an art. Nagar sorts through the mechanics of writing such programs in this book, which is no mean feat considering that Microsoft provides no documentation for its development kit. The author begins by orienting the reader to NT's kernel mode, detailing what runs there, how the various programs interact, and what you need to keep in mind when developing software for the kernel mode.<p> The book then explores NT's key managers--I/O, virtual memory, and cache--covering the operation and exposed services for each.  Nagar then takes the explanatory information he's provided and works it into a how-to guide to developing FSDs. In walking you through developing an actual FSD, the author covers I/O requests, cache operations, and buffers. Exercise files appear on the companion diskette.<p> Short of having a live instructor, you could not ask for a better guide to this complicated subject.</span>

                    <span>This book is by far, one of my most favorite books. It has been the only complete text book that explains the details of the Windows NT File Systems Framework. If you are to buy the book these days you would not feel the value of the book as I felt it when I started reading it six years ago. Nowadays, there are some other literatures that provides deeper coverage for certain topics like the OSR materials and the first IFS conference (both are available as part of the IFS kit). But still, the book remains the only complete reference. To get most of the benefits of this book, it is better that you look at the FASTFAT source code that comes with the IFS kit. The main drawback of the book is the lack of deep coverage for network based file system drivers. OSR materials provided with the IFS kit are essential to have better knowledge about File System FILTER drivers. Read the book while watching the videos of the first IFS kit conference, this will help a lot. Finally, if you are new to file system drivers then, be more patient while reading the book. You would not get everything from the first reading.</span>

                    <span>This is certainy a must have for any Windows 32-bit file system developer. It reveals great secrets, make sense of the NT IFS chaos, and make Your IFS nightmares go away. It's a great book, but much of it is presented in most  others, and that's the only bad thing )like memory managment, cachemamaner  etc.). Thanks, RN.</span>

                    <span>The first 2 sections of this book provide detailed information on NT internal functions that are not readily availble elsewhere.  As a sys admin, this takes your knowledge of the OS to a much deeper level than  most.  I'm not a programmer or developer, so I purchased this book just for  the first 2/3 of the info.  Great detail.

                    <span>Though this book was meant to teach about File system, it teaches more than what it promises. I had many questions in mind about NT. After reading this book, most of my questions are cleared. I strongly recommend this book  to know more about NT. I really don't agree to rate this book with less  than 5 stars. To believe me just try this book.</span>

                    <span>I have bought a great many O'Reilly books and give most of them 5 stars, but this is one of the worst computer books I have come across.  I'm no newbie to NT but nor a guru, so I bought this book to learn the internal  workings.  This book is confusing and I even found a few important typos.   I do not recommend it.  NT books from Microsoft Press (with which I'm NOT  affiliated) might be better.  Avoid this book for now; will there be an  updated edition soon?</span>
