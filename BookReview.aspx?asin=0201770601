                    <span>It has great advices on UP and UML. It shows you not only how but why and when to used UP and UML. I learned an interesting way of using UP and UML together on my next project.</span>

                    <span>I stumbled on this book at Borders while browsing through a dozen or so<br>books on the OOA&D, RUP, and the UML. I am not a novice: I have studied the<br>field and worked in OOA&D for over a decade. I immediately felt that<br>this book is a treasure: it is the best overview of the OOA&D, RUP, and XML<br>that I have ever read.<p>While many practitioners have their reasons to favor one approach over<br>another (RUP, Agile, XP, etc.), this book  does not project any bias and<br>contains the most clear and simple explanation of  RUP, its phases, work<br>flows, and the UML. Its language is enjoyable, the examples are just right<br>to illustrate the points of discussions. It is not an in depth volume, but<br>it is thorough enough to teach you about the most important flows and<br>artifacts, and how to interpret and use them.<p>If you are tired of reading books filled with vague, useless, and boring<br>definitions -- try this one.  You will not be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book for the IBM's Object Oriented Analysis and Design with UML certification (Test 486). <p>I have not taken the test yet, however, after reading it, I am more confident for the test. <p>Comparing to the "Applying UML and Patterns" by Craig Larman, the author uses common English describes what UML and UP are. It is more concise, and easier to understand. <p>Craig's book was okay, but it put me to boredom while I was reading it. (Z Z z z z)<p>Thanks, <p>David Zuo.</span>

                    <span>Actually I wanted to give 4.5 stars for this book.<p>One of the best UML books i have read so far, very clear and sets lot of things straight in the somewhat vague (if we don't know the concepts behind the diagrams) UML world..! Has a slight Java bias, which is understandable. <p>One complain i always have against UML (not this book) itself is.. most software professionals should be very familiar with UML and the methodologies first before developing something or be a part of the project - but it has always been the other way so far. You do 2 or 3 projects, know all the mistakes, then realize the importance of something like UML and try to learn it. In fact UML itself borrows so liberally from C++ and other Object Oriented languages than leading the software engineering. And then the companies coming out with their own methodologies (rather than improving UML itself) to grab the market.. it can be quite difficult. <p>This book treats most of the technologies it refers quite fairly - with even some C# and Java comparisons side-by-side. Another notable thing is the wonderful style adopted that makes it an easy read, stressing important points again and again, clear summary at the end of each chapter without missing anything etc.,</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I have read on this subject. I read various articles I found on the internet that explained the syntax of UML but none of those resources explained how to use it. This is exactly what this book does.<p>I think what I like most about this book is the way it is set out. The way they have used their numbering system makes it easy to reference back to previous sections of the book. Each chapter ends with a 'what we have learnt' section that is also numbered the same way. Before each chapter starts they provide a uml activity diagram to map out the chapter which I thought was pretty cool.<p>The book starts out by explaining what UML is and what the UP is, I found the explanations very clear. After that it goes through the steps in UP and explains how to apply UML while going through the unified process.<p>It covers a lot of information, and the examples are very valuable (they are examples that explain concepts well rather than hard to understand useless examples).<p>I can't really find any faults in this book I read it from start to finish and enjoyed it. I would like to have seen some more real life examples at the end. There is a sample eCommerce UML model at the end which is good but some more of that would have been good (I find I learn a lot that way).<p>I won't be needing another book on this subject.</span>
