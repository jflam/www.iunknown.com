                <span id="Label1">Today, Microsoft commands the high ground of the information superhighway by owning the operating systems and basic applications programs that run on the world's 170 million computers. Beyond the unquestioned genius and vision of Bill Gates, what accounts for Microsofts astounding success? <P> Drawing on almost two years of on-site observation at Microsoft headquarters, eminent scientists Michael A. Cusumano and Richard W. Selby reveal many of Microsoft's innermost secrets. This inside report, based on forty in-depth interviews by authors who had access to confidential documents and project data, outlines the seven complementary strategies that characterize exactly how Microsoft competes and operates, including the "Brain Trust" of talented employees and exceptional management; "bang for the buck" competitive strategies and clear organizational goals that produce self-critiquing, learning, and improving; a flexible, incremental approach to product development; and a relentless pursuit of future markets. <P> Cusumano and Selby's masterful analysis successfully uncovers the distinctive way in which Microsoft has combined all of the elements necessary to get to the top of an enormously important industry -- and stay there.</span>

                    <span>Michael Cusumano's "Microsoft Secrets: How the World's Most Powerful Software Company Creates Technology, Shapes Markets, and Manages People" is truly as in depth as its title suggests.  Cusumano has gone to great lengths to give a very detailed picture of how Microsoft goes about its business, both internally and externally.<p>The purpose of the book is to explain what makes Microsoft tick.  It may come as a surprise to most people, but, according to Cusumano, Microsoft is not a dictatorial fiefdom.  Perhaps Microsoft's greatest success is in obtaining and retaining the best programmers in the field.  Programmers are notoriously independent souls who likely wouldn't stand an overbearing workplace for long.<p>That's not to say that Microsoft is not a high pressure environment.  Programmers are expected to meet deadlines and to be knowledgeable about what they are doing.  This may sound axiomatic but the number of companies whose employees are partially (or even completely) in the dark is staggering.<p>The best part of "Microsoft Secrets" is that most of the lessons to be drawn from it can be applied to any organization, especially the people management techniques.  Even some of the more 'software industry specific' techniques can be transferred to other deadline oriented industries (e.g. publishing).<p>The only real drawback to the study though is its long-windedness.  When I say that Cusumano has gone to great lengths to present this picture of Microsoft, I mean he has *GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS*.  This only detracts partially though as the book does remain a good read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The Good<p>Where do most of the worst business people come from?  M.B.A. schools usually.  Students with strong academic skills with the honored M.B.A. can do the accounting, statistical work, and market research analysis.  But does that mean they have a "business mind," or good "business sense?"  Absolutely not.  (That's why a new test is being devised to determine the "common sense" abilities of MBAs). Gates is a perfect example of the many successful business people who didn't spend time in front of Ph.ds in ivory towers regurgitating "business theories and paradigms."    <p>A look into the technological and mainly business side of Microsoft, the author breaks down the organization into the "how's, why's, and what's" of MSFT.<p>It's common knowledge that Gates is a genius in the technical realm,  and MSFT is a behemoth organization that has the majority of market share.  But how did Microsoft grow to where it is and thrive in this ever-changing and competitive industry?  This book explains the business (more than technical) philosophy, model, and actual examples from products and projects.  Interviews with former and current managers and employees are also included.      <p>Again, it's common knowledge that Gates is exceptional at business.  Ask their competitors.  Note that Steve Jobs had a better product that was on the market earlier but he lacked the business, marketing, and management acumen.  Gates not only seeks out brilliant techno minds but considers their business sense equally important, and this is heavily weighed when he decides to hire prospective candidates.  Those hired are also individualists who will challenge him and other superiors, and argue and debate with him, in the search for the best idea or model.  An employee gets Gate's respect, the author writes, "when his employees yell back."  If Bill is converted by their arguments as opposed to his, he likewise changes course, taking the best route.  <p>One of the most dangerous and damaging things to a company, and any organization, are "yes men."  A company culture that rewards the "yes man/woman" mentality leads people to misrepresent themselves and their work, and the managers and ownership eventually become "out of the loop."  This leads to uninformed decisions, cover-ups, resentment, and alienation that benefit no one.  <p>This is written for the laymen, but can be a bit dry.  Things such as shipping strategies, keeping teams small on projects, constant self analysis and critiques, and the reliance on customer feedback, are some of the many interlinking factors of the organization.  The company likes people and departments that are interdependent upon one another to be physically close to one another. I.e., in the same building or on the same property, so if there is a problem or a need for clarification, they can see each other face to face to discuss it, instead of swapping emails, voicemails, and engaging in converence calls from across the country.  Again, it's common knowledge that a major tenet of MSFT is to find out where the industry is going in the future, become the leader, and provide products with such strong quality that they become the "industry standard."  The author even provides some organization charts to pin-up on your wall.  <p>Not The Bad And The Ugly<p>The point of this book was to focus on the positives.  The strategies and models that make the company pre-eminant.  What is not in the book is: the common claim that the company is a monopoly, engages in unfair business practices, and limits the choice of consumers by ramming its product down their throats.  There have been numerous charges and lawsuits that MSFT treats employees poorly.  This company hires a lot of temps, work them overtime, plays with them, and then discards them.  For the positives, read this book.   For information on the not-so-great things about this organization, there are plenty of other books to read.</span>

                    <span>The authors definitely did a fine work by doing excellent research about Microsoft's product development and marketing. This book would prove to be very helpful to those who are coming from a non-technical perspective. It occasionally offers some valuable insights into Microsoft's strategies but it is quite dry for the most part even for a person who has plenty experiences in software development. The Microsoft 'secrets' are not exactly impressive. It would be impossible to know the true secret in a book, otherwise every software company would become a Microsoft (then again, not every company wants to). The book is a bit dated, but nevertheless offers the curious reader some insights into the development and marketing of Microsoft's past successful (and unsuccessful) moves. This book made Microsoft seems to be more fallible than its invincible image of every day praise.</span>

                    <span>As the story goes:  Leaving his car, a man and his friend walk down a dark lane passing under a street lamp along the way.  Upon arriving at their destination, the man discovers he has lost his keys.  He and his friend  quickly re-trace their steps and the man begins his search under the light  of the lamp.  His friend asks "why do you choose to search under the  lamp, we first walked nearly 200 meters".  He answers, "you fool,  can't you see we've been provided with light *here* !".  Even a  scholar or two can be led astray under the influence of purposeful  guidance.  Another reviewer commented, 'Microsoft is obliged to create its  own language'.  As an IS professional with a background in business  management and 20 years experience dealing with this company, I too have  labored with this language - the language of obfuscation.  This book covers  the obvious strengths of Microsoft in Research and Development.  And no one  disputes the talent attracted to this company.  However, time proves the  true direction of travel despite the claimants' insistence of a praisworthy  course.  The accurate reasons for Microsoft's success lie in ruthless,  paranoid management, expert public relations and remarkable skills at  marketing, not innovation or the development of superior products.  History  may well prove Microsoft's legacy as squandering the advantages and  qualities alluded to in this book.  Perhaps the author's would be  well-advised to supplement 'the before' with a reflective 'after' as  appropriate in the future.</span>
