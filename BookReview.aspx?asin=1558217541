                <span id="Label1">First published in 1954, <I>The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook</I> is one of America's great works of recollection, culinary and otherwise. Toklas lived, cooked, and kept house in Paris and rural France with her companion, Gertrude Stein, from 1908 until Stein's death in 1947. During that time she cooked for and shared food with friends, including Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Thornton Wilder, accumulating recipes for the simple and haute bourgeois dishes compiled in the book. She also saw and remembered all, from life in the high bohemian circle she and Stein occupied; to France during two world wars; to the United States, visited in the '30s; to summers passed in a paradisiacal country retreat at Biligin in France. These and more Toklas depicts vividly and acerbically, all viewed through the prism of food and good eating. <p> Woven within chapters such as "Dishes for Artists," "Food in French Homes," and "The Vegetable Gardens at Biligin," the 300 recipes run the gamut from hors d'oeuvres and salads to breads, entr&#233;es, drinks, and sweets. Original (and sometimes whimsical) dishes like Stuffed Artichokes Stravinsky, Gigot de la Clinque, and Bavarian Cream Perfect Love appear among more traditional offerings, such as Boeuf Bourguignon, Chicken &#224; l'Estargon, and Green Peas &#224; la Goodwife. Many of the recipes (which are written in abbreviated-narrative style) will be attempted only by adventurous cooks with time (and, in some cases, money) to spare. The rest of us will enjoy reading the recipes, the droll reminiscences, and the fantasizing about a time when the dishes' creation could be relatively commonplace. The tour of this era and its food, by one of literature's great cook-writers, is obligatory reading. <I>--Arthur Boehm</I></span>

                    <span>I particularly recommend the Egg Nog of the Commonwealth Club of Richmond, VA.  My husband made this for a party at a friend's house, and everybody loved it!  This is the best egg nog I ever tasted, and I have tasted a few.</span>

                    <span>I believe that this is one of the best French cookbooks of all time. Very old, traditional recipes explained in a way that makes even the more advanced ones seem doable. She also includes recipes from her youth in America and tells how she came across the recipe for Haschich Fudge. The stories interwoven are captivating, especially about the society she and Gertrude Stein kept, and their efforts during WWI as volunteers. In this respect it is a fascinating historical document. It is written as if she is speaking to you, and her speech is very blunt, to the point and quietly humorous. Very enjoyable to read.</span>

                    <span>Ive been cooking with _Joy of Cooking_ for a long time now. _Joy_ makes reference to a chapter in this book, "Murder in the Kitchen," as a sort of primer on how to 'murder' a carp in the kitchen before cooking. I  decided, on a whim, to buy the book.<p>I had no idea that having this new  cookbook would be so rewarding!<p>Alice Toklas has some INCREDIBLE recipes  in here (Scheherezade Melon being a favorite!), all of which should be  tried and enjoyed.<p>Furthermore, this book contains recipes you simply  wont find in other, newer, cookbooks. My girlfriend really summed this book  up by suggesting that the recipes in this book are the recipes you know  exist -- but are being passed from grandmother to granddaughter; you simply  dont get these unless youre in that circle of people.<p>This cookbook is  your way in to exquisite dishes that were prepared for the likes of  Gertrude Stein, Hemmingway, Picasso, and Matisse.<p>That, and where else  are you going to find a recipe for Hashish Fudge?<p>This book has my  whole-hearted, overwhelming approval.</span>

                    <span>2002 is Alice's 125th birthday, so why not get her most famous book and cook up a birthday dinner?!<br>This classic of 20th century food lit appears every few years and rightfully so. First published in 1954 by Alice B. Toklas, the life partner of Gertrude Stein, established Alice as a writer in her own right and made her world-famous(once again) with her "Haschich Fudge" aka Alice B. Toklas brownies! This recipe, which was not included in the first American edition, but was included in the British edition, does appear in this book. It's more than a cookbook, it's an affectionate remembrance by someone who knew and was known by some of the artistic giants of the 20th century.</span>

                    <span>This is Alice's _real_ autobiography.  The sketches of the 'lost generation' and of life in defeated France are wonderful (try combining this with "A Movable Feast" and "Tropic of Cancer").  Many of the recipes are practical, if rather advanced.  The section on gazpacho is a special favorite of mine, and easier to try than most.  Don't bother looking for a hash brownies recipe</span>
