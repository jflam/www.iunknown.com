                    <span>"Hacking Exposed" series grew from a relative unknown to one of the most famous information security books of all times. The interesting part about it is that its reputation is largely deserved.<P>The fourth edition presents an incremental improvement over the previous ones. Considering that the previous books were great, it is no mean feat! Its is a pity that the book lacks "What's New" section, which would be useful for those familiar with the series. <P>As usual, the book offers balanced platform coverage (UNIX, Windows, Novell) and follows the same winning paradigm (from scanning to owning the system). The above is obvious since the same author crew from Foundstone is behind the book. The book is somewhat biased towards the attacker side, just as the title promises. Among new sections are wireless security, web hacking and attacking clients (such as web browsers) by malicious servers. The latter section presents some interesting tips on attacking over email, web browser (via ActiveX and other malicious technologies), IRC, etc.<P>Overall, if you own the 3rd edition, there is some motivation to go grab this one. However, if you haven't read "Hacking Exposed" yet, run to the store to get your copy if you are involved with network or system security in any role. For novices the book will server as a useful introduction to security and hacking, for intermediate readers the book will bring new tools and techniques and will serve as a useful refresher for experts. Companion website hackingexposed.com has the books' table of contents and some other material.<P>Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

                    <span>Hardly a week goes by that CNN does not report a high-profile Web site being defiled or an e-commerce site being penetrated. While most people know why these incidents occurred, Hacking Exposed explains how they occurred and, more important, how to prevent them from occurring. <P>The cover of Hacking Exposed announces that "Network security is Y2K without the deadline." That alarmist statement, however, is the only hype in the book. The work is packed with real-world examples and links to tools needed to assess the security of any type of client/server and Web system. As they detail the myriad vulnerabilities in different types of systems, the authors provide countermeasures for each of them. <P>Well organized, the book progresses in an orderly fashion. It methodically goes through the process of exploiting a target to penetrate a system--from identification and enumeration to actual penetration. The authors provide detailed instructions and explanations for many security features and flaws in Unix, Linux, Windows, NetWare, routers, firewalls, and more. Topics covered include state-of-the-art computer and network penetration, as viewed by both the attacker and the defender; remote system identification; vulnerability identification; war dialers; firewall circumvention; and denial-of-service attacks. An appendix explores the security characteristics of Windows 2000. <P>Some may argue that books such as this one only serve to motivate and educate hackers. The truth is that hackers are already aware of the book's contents. This book is designed for system administrators and managers who need to know their systems' risks and vulnerabilities and how to address them. When they are done with this book, system administrators and managers will be familiar with such critical topics as back channels, port redirection, banner grabbing, and buffer overflows. Hacking Exposed is a must-read for anyone who wants to know what is really happening on their network....</span>

                    <span>I have plenty of experience with computers and have been hacking since the term Hacker wasn't a dirty word. Anyway, a friend of mine that is very interested in Hacking purchased this book and a few other titles from these authors. He showed me the books and asked me to give him my opinion of them. As I was looking thru these books I started to laugh and told my friend to get his money back. I was shocked to see that all the info in these books can be obtained just by doing a search on SecurityFocus and Google and most of the info in this and the other books where outdated exploits that have been patched already. The IT industry moves at the speed of light and the most important aspect when it comes to securing your networks is having the newest attack and exploit information, which no book can ever provide... including this lousy book that is nothing but a compilation of what can be found for free online. Don't waste your money! I wish I could give this book zero stars.</span>
