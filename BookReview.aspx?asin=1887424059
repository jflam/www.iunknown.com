                <span id="Label1"><i>Women with Attention Deficit Disorder</i> addresses the millions of withdrawn little girls and chronically overwhelmed women with ADD who go undiagnosed because they don't fit the stereotypical notion of people with ADD. They are not fast-talking, hyperactive, non-attentive, and they are not male. Though the book focuses on ADD, much of what is said also applies to women with ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Introduction by Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo, authors of <i>You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Crazy or Stupid?</i> Foreword by John J. Ratey, MD, co-author of <i>Driven to Distraction</i>.</span>

                    <span>Most books on ADD/ADHD fail to focus on its effects on females. This book offers excellent insight and information that is specific about how this disorder looks in women, and can be extrapolated to young girls. The specifics offer a new ray of hope for women afflicted with this unrecognized, but high damaging disorder that so often goes undiagnosed until it is too late. All teachers, medical practitioners treating the disorder, parents and counselors should read this book. It is very informative, and offers a whole new perspective for women.</span>

                    <span>Yes, there are people with ADD who aren't hyperactive! This book was highly enlightening to me for two reasons. First of all, it talked about the 'hypoactive' kind of ADD- the kind without the H(yperactivity). Secondly, it dealt specifically with adults and the struggles adults face dealing with ADD. And third, the fact that it was specific to women was also very helpful. Like I said earlier, I felt like the book was talking about me, as if it had me as a source or something (well, except for the parts specific to married people with children). If you are a woman and think you might have ADD, read this book. If you know a woman with ADD (or ADHD), read this book. If you know me, read this book! I'm not alone in this after all! Wow!</span>

                    <span>I was soooooooooo relieved after i read this book,as I am not the hyper type(although I talk a lot-but I am not jumping around -fidgeting or worse daydreaming when I have to sit still)<BR>A lot of is highlighted in yellow and I lended it to the ADD psy(he heard about but did not have the opportunity to read,well this could have save both of us a lot of time,anyway...)<BR>It was like a thriller I spend 3 nights and days reading and reading.I highly recommend it along with "ADD in women" by nadeau,this one is more recent and quote a lot from it.</span>

                    <span>This book stilled so many fears and anxieties I've had for years because I had no idea what was wrong with me but knew it had to be something terrible! Now, after reading this very informative book, I feel enlightened about a woman's unique symptomology as compared to boys and men.....no wonder I never dreamed that I might have ADD!</span>

                    <span>I just got this book yesterday and I'm up to Chapter 6! I was just recently diagnosed with ADD and it seems every page of this book is describing some aspect of my life! I can't wait to read the next page, the next chapter, the next section. I'm hoping to also be able to help my teenage son who also has ADD. Thank you Sari for helping me know that I am definately not alone!</span>
