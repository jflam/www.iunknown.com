                <span id="Label1">When you run a fleet of Windows workstations (particularly ones that are geographically distributed) and are responsible for maintaining the software on all of them, you need Microsoft System Management Server (SMS) to automate software installations and updates. Rod Trent's <I>Microsoft SMS Installer</I> takes a from-the-trenches view of software management under SMS, explaining precisely how to write SMS scripts for scores of diverse situations. Trent shows how to write scripts that operate efficiently under ideal conditions and deal gracefully with irregularities and problems.<p> Though many readers will jump right to this book's companion CD-ROM and start digging through its prewritten SMS scripts, the book is primarily useful as a tutorial and reference for people who want to do their own scripting. Trent (an MCSE) shows how to create, edit, and deploy scripts with SMS tools. More importantly, he documents the SMS scripting language in a way that's both intelligible to newcomers <i>and</i> useful to old SMS hands with relatively obscure problems to solve. He explains scores of capabilities--such as configuring ODBC data sources--by documenting each parameter that script coders must set and explaining how each contributes to the big picture. Adequate (but not overwhelming) code listings, with annotation, describe full solutions to a variety of problems. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Microsoft System Management Server 2 and its application to networks of Windows NT, 95, and 98 computers. The Installation Expert and Script Editor tools are explained, as are the logical and syntax conventions of SMS scripts themselves.</span>

                    <span>Rod's book fills a gap in the SMS world with his fine coverage of the SMS Installer tool. I both train and consult with SMS, and my students and clients have often lamented that more info about SMS Installer was not available. I have been recommending Rod's book to them for some time now, and all who have read it have thanked me for the recommendation. It's clearly written with practical examples for creating, writing and customizing scripts, and I highly recommend it to you as well.</span>

                    <span>Its about time a book came out that actually shows how to script with sms installer. There are about 15 books out about sms and this is the first one to actually have anything to do with scripting, I guess 4 years is a better wait than never...</span>

                    <span>This book is awesome! I've dabbled in SMS Installer for a while, but this book forced me to get serious about it. I love the way the book progresses through the product allowing you to go from beginner to pro. The flow of the book is very logical and the organization is right on target. And, the CD full of like 500 scripts has kept my nose to the computer screen for two days!</span>

                    <span>I've been waiting and waiting for another print of this book. I was pleasantly surprised to find its back when I was searching through Amazon.com. Other SMS Admins I know have raved about this book for years, and I've never been able to get my hands on a copy, because its always sold out at the local stores. Glad to see that its in another printing. Digging into it the first day, I'm already using the product to distribute my own custom packages.</span>
