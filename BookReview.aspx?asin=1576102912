                    <span>| is both a bitwise and logical op in Java unlike in C or C++. The || op is called the conditional-or. See page 388 and 389 of the Java language spec, 2nd ed.</span>

                    <span>You would think that a study guide would be pretty accurate, but ... WOW!  I found several factual errors on the very first page of the book.  The following error is on the "Cram Sheet" which is the very first page of the book (right behind the cover).  The Cram Sheet says "Logical OR operators | and ||."  Well, | is not a logical operator; it is a bitwise arithmetic operator.  It goes on to say in the next two sentences "The | operator always evaluates both operands.  The || operator 'short-circuits' an evaluation and does not evaluate the right hand term ...".  WOW!!!!!!!!!!  Nuf said!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>

                    <span>I had just passed the Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 1.4 Platform exam (with a score of 80%), and I want to help prospective test takers in finding the "right" Java study guide.  I bewildered by the number of books available, and I had to try many of them before I settled on the right one.  Here are my short reviews for each of the major Java study guides:<p>"Sun Certified Programmer & Developer for Java 2 Study Guide" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates (five stars): I felt this book was the best among all the Java study guides.  Both the authors were responsible for the Java certification exam's development, and the practice questions are *very* similar to the actual exam. The authors also cover exactly what will be on the 1.4 exam, pointing out potential topics, questions, and pitfalls.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.<p>"A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification" by Khalid Mughal and Rolf Rasmussen (four stars): This is a good choice if you plan on taking the 1.2 exam.  The book also has a dual purpose of teaching Java and sometimes goes beyond the actual scope of the exam, but it is nonetheless excellent.  However, as the title suggests, this isn't the book for you if you don't have any programming experience.  Also, the book's practice questions are much, much harder than the actual exam.<p>"Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide (3rd Edition)" by Philip Heller and Simon Roberts (two stars): This was the most disappointing book of all.  I don't know why so many people swear by it, but the book appeared to have been rushed into production.  Many of the errors and typos have been updated in the book's second printing, but the book's coverage of topics is quite weak.  Lastly, the practice questions were not only too easy, but they don't look very similar to how questions look on the real test.  It's not a terrible book (many people appear to have passed the exam with just this book), but there are better options.<p>"Java 2 Exam Prep" by Bill Brodgen (three stars): This compact study guide isn't a bad choice for prospective test takers with a good Java foundation.  It covers all the exam's topics succinctly, but as another reviewer noted, it should not be your primary study guide.  I personally did not find the book particularly useful.<p>Lastly, sign up for Sun's ePractice practice exams. You'll get three sample tests, and they will help you prepare for the exam by showing you how the questions will look and what type of questions they will ask.  I didn't like the idea of spending the extra money, but the practice exams definitely helped me prepare for the real thing.</span>

                    <span>I'm not so agree with some of the comment that have been posted on this book, I have used this book for my preparation for SCJP exam and till now after two years, I still have farely good impression on the book and refer it in my day to day work. I admit this book cant be used solely as the only guide especially for newbie but it serve as a good complement to a more detail guide, i pick up tricks from this book which I cant find in other place, in certain area it really shield light when I was confused by other material.<p>I passed with 86% from zero knowledge of Java in less than 3 months time, I think this book have lift me up to certain level.<br>Get it if you want to score high and pass at the first time</span>
