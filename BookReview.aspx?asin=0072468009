                    <span>Ignore the guys complaining about the odd wrong answer and ignore the guys complaining about Brealey & Meyers. <br>Let's face it: "Principles..." is THE book in educational finance; and most likely, if you're reading this review you haven't chosen the book on your own accord but rather it was chosen for you on your M.Sc. or the like. And now you're wondering about buying the solutions manual...<br>So, why do the exercises? Well, it's the only way to learn finance. The book is good, but having gone through it and the quiz questions, you might think "Was that all? I could pass an exam with one hand tied to my back." (I know I did...) So you need the exercises to get you down from that pedestal and get you to LEARN finance (!). The questions are good and varied and get you to think about the concepts, formulas etc. They are in general better and more advanced than the quiz Qs. And if you can't figure out all the questions on your own then a book with solutions is quite handy.<br>Only problem is that it's a bit expensive considering it's only a solutions manual. But a good buy nonetheless!</span>
