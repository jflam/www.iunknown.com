It follows the design of a 40-foot cruising sailboat from the first sketch to the final weight, strength, and sail area calculations, with tables, charts, and diagrams to let the reader adapt the process to any design. This edition is revised and expanded to cover powerboats as well as sailboats.</span>

                    <span>This is a worthwhile text on yacht design and is fairly comprehensive. It's the best replacement to date for the venerable but dated "Elements of Yacht Design" by Norman Skene. One word of caution though-if you take the time to actually follow through all the formulas and design methodologies, you'll find that the calculations are often incomplete or simply incorrect! If the publishers or authors would take the time to properly edit this book, they'd really have something.</span>

                    <span>Larsson and Eliasson present - in detail - the engineering and naval architecture processes that a yacht designer should use in designing a seaworthy yacht. The book presents, as an example, the design -from scratch- of a 40 ft. cruising sloop. Every aspect of yacht design is covered: hull shape, speed, friction, displacement, stability, dynamic stability, rigging, construction, interior design ergonomics, deck design, scantlings, standards, etc.<BR>Typical of an engineering book, the style is factual and dry. Some people may find it lacks the poetry of other books.<P>Specially attractive is the presentation of formulas in separate boxes. Be prepared, however, to get acquainted with metric units, and engineering terms and formulas.<BR>This is probably the most serious book on the subject of the yacht design. The only possible deficiencies are that motor yacht design is not specifically covered, and that emphasis is placed in the design of safe cruising sailboats rather than high performance racing boats. Despite these omissions, there is no doubt this book is a MUST for anyone really interested in the subject of designing a boat, specially if it is a sailboat.</span>

                    <span>This book focuses almost exclusively on modern, fin keel, canoe body, racing/cruising sailing yachts, with sloop rigs. There is little to interest those whose tastes run more to traditional designs or rigs, multihulls, or anything out of the ordinary. Much space is devoted to the hydrodynamics of fin keels and rudders, and as presented it is reasonably accessable/understandable to the average reader. All the mathmatics in the book is left out of the main text, and presented instead in separate boxes, a very nice arrangement. The index is poor, to the point of atrocious. I never seemed to be able to easily find what I was looking for.</span>
