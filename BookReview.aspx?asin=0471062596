                <span id="Label1">Synchronization in Digital Communications Volume I Phase-, Frequency-Locked Loops, and Amplitude Control Heinrich Meyr and Gerd Ascheid Volume I provides in-depth coverage of the synchronization function and related topics of digital communications systems. The objective of the book is to develop a theoretical framework for synchronization that will enable the reader to derive practical solutions to synchronization problems in the diverse areas of digital communications. It covers the fundamentals of phase, frequency, and amplitude control. An understanding of these functions is necessary to comprehend any synchronization system. 1990 (0 471-50193-X) 510 pp.</span>

                    <span>If you want a single book on information theory, you must have this one. Tom Cover, as one of the major contributors to the development of information theory over the years, wrote a clear and understandable book on a somewhat involved topic. The notation is neat and clean, something difficult to find in IT books. Also, the practice exercices at the end of each chapter are all of them worth doing. In each one you discover something in the theory you did not paid due attention. The spirit of IT important quantities such as the entropy and mutual information is well explained through examples and Venn diagrams. Also, despite the fact that this is a technical book, reading it can be quite enjoyable.</span>

                    <span>Thomas Cover is a legend in the fields of information theory, telecommunications, and complexity theory, and this book is a reflection of his expertise in these fields. Thus, I recommend anyone to read this book who is even remotely interested in these fields, for Cover will make you *very* interested after reading the book. I found the Chapter on Kolmogorov complexity to be very good, and it was the first time that I could claim I actually had a good intuitive grasp of the subject. I found the Chapters on AEP, Data Compression, and Entropy Rates also very informative. On the downside, I found the chapters on Rate Distortion and Channel Capacity (two very central topics in information theory) somewhat confusing, and have seen better presentations (see Steve Roman's "Coding and Information Theory").</span>

                    <span>This book is a predictable dissapointment. It is just yet another of the best examples of how modern textbooks have diverged from traditional textbooks of the 1950 - 1970's. Although this book doesn't focus too heavily on the "practical" aspects as far as implementation of information theory, it is clear that todays books are not nearly as mathematically rigorous as the books of yesteryear. ...</span>

                    <span>This is a well written book. But i think the title is misleading;<BR>in vain will anyone will find any material on information<BR>processing (quite strange for a book on information!). as such<BR>automata, computability and complaxity are totally absent.<BR>Kolmogorov complexity is there but the main questions in<BR>complexity theory are not.<P>In addition even in coding theory you can not see covering<BR>of error-correction, cryptography. The authors treat a <BR>small part of coding theory (that is communication) and they<BR>name it ''Information theory''!. Well the latter is much much more. You want find these in this book. In addition <BR>the book does not even deserve the title ''theory <BR>of communication'' but ''classical communication'';<BR>you wont find anything in modern quantum coding theories.<P>Overall, well written but not able to say what information<BR>really is.</span>

                    <span>This book is very thorough in its content, and the information is laid out very nicely, and easy to find. However, from a non-information theorist perspective it is not a good introduction. It covers the theory very well, but is light on the practical application (which is what drew me to the subject). This book requires a solid foundation in probability.</span>
