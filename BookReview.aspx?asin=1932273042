                <span id="Label1">Since its launch ten years ago, In Style has built a readership more than eight million strong. In doing so, it has become the pre-eminent publication for style-conscious women. The magazine's lively mix of fashion, beauty, lifestyle, and celebrity has created a legion of loyal readers who consider In Style their most trusted fashion advisor.  In Style: Secrets of Style, The Complete Guide to Dressing Your Best Every Day is the magazine's first book dedicated to its signature subject: fashion. Secrets of Style offers a full range of timeless advice, including tips on dressing the best for you and your lifestyle, developing a personal style, and shopping strategies, beginning with the basics: * How to flatter your body type. * How to find the right fit for every clothing item. * How to look great seven days (and nights) a week. * How to shop wisely for everything, from shoes to winter coats. Scores of detailed, full-color illustrations and beautiful still photographs bring the book's ideas to life, while photos of chic celebrities demonstrate how the beautiful people get that way. From defining the perfect fit to examining successful style icons of the past, Secrets of Style is a complete and timely reference designed to help you discover your best look every day. Secrets of Style explains the best cuts and fabrics for every figure type. Wardrobe staples like pants, suits, and tops are discussed in specific detail, and advice is offered on how to get the most out of accessories. Tons of tips on time and money-saving shopping strategies, selecting clothes for special events, maternity wear, travel wardrobes and packing, clothing care, and much more make this title an enduring one-stop reference.  Secrets of Style is a trend-proof resource not only for the millions of In Style devotees but also the newcomer in search of a personal fashion companion.</span>

                    <span>This fashion manual is written with the same exuberance and focus on practical advice as In Style magazine. With its index and tables, it is a user-friendly guide rather than a fashion book, though it does contain information on fashion history (e.g., "A Short History of Khakis"). The book's goal is to help readers develop a personal style that works with their body type, and, with more than 150 photographs and 100 illustrations, anyone is sure to come away with a better sense of which fabrics, cuts, and colors best highlight assets and downplay weaker features. Aside from the basics such as suits and dresses, the book features sections on what items to invest in, how to shop for vintage items, the best time to shop the sales, and how to use a personal shopper. Though geared toward women, this shoppers' bible will also benefit men. A timeless work that focuses on style and classic pieces rather than fashion trends, this will be a valuable addition to any public library</span>

                    <span>The book "Secrets of Style" describes itself as, "the complete guide to dressing your best everyday" and it does not disappoint.<P>Jam-packed with detailed information, fine illustrations and beautiful color photographs, the book is a treasure for the woman who wants to look great.<P>"Secrets of Style" is an offshoot of Instyle Magazine. The magazine's fashion coverage over the years has been extensive. The author, Lisa Arbetter and the editors of Instyle, have compiled the information from the magazine and transformed it, into a working guide for the reader.<P>The beauty of the book is the information will not become dated. This is not a book about clothes. This is a book about style. By reading the book and visually seeing the examples you will learn how to develop, expand and enhance your sense of style.<P>We all want to look good. To wear our clothes and not let them wear us. To build a wardrobe of garments that meets our needs, gives value for our dollar and makes us look our personal best.<BR>And within these pages you will learn how to do exactly that.<P>"Secrets of Style" includes chapters on selecting the clothes to best flatter your figure. How to spot quality. Vintage shopping. Best fit for jackets, pants, skirts and more. A look at lingerie. Picking shoes and bags. Care, repair and storage of items. There are sections on a stylish pregnancy and tying a scarf. The editors have done an exhaustive job to cover everything from head to toe and more!<P>The color photographs are lush and telling. Nothing like seeing a picture to gain a clear view of what looks great. Many of the photographs are from issues of Instyle and these are classics. Kate Hudson glowing in her champagne Versace. Jane Fonda booted in a scene from Barbarella. Sela Ward with a lipstick red bag adding "punch" to an all black outfit. Despite the use of celebrities many in designer duds it's still very effective in teaching those of us in Gap what works and what doesn't.<P>This book will help you analyze your wardrobe, find your best look and pull it together with confidence. An excellent resource!<P>Lee Mellott</span>

                    <span>In Style is a good, current magazine brimming with ideas, and this book also has a very inviting look. It seems best suited to the Twentysomething generation of women who are bridging between studenthood and professional adulthood, interested in how clothes make up an image investment and not just a current fashion statement. The book contains useful information about building a wardrobe based upon (your) wearable neutrals; buying classic items clothes and accessories (and identifying what the classics are); judging material and tailoring quality, and adding a bit of individuality to the mix. It isn't a manual of comparisons, like "What Not to Wear," and it's not an analysis of what works and why about celebrated womens' styles. For instance, you won't find why Jackie K.O. wore sleeveless shifts and large sunglasses, or why Nicole Kidman chooses particular types of gowns, and how to apply that knowledge in your own case. All in all it's a good book if you're a bit overwhelmed by all the choices out there (and who isn't, when you walk into some stores :-), but if you've been reading a variety of women's magazines over the years or have seen fashion spin a few rotations, you may have already absorbed much of the information.</span>

                    <span>Like most women's magazines, this InStyle book makes the twisted assumption that all women hate the way they look and must "camouflage" their countless flaws. Its persistent notion that anxiety is our key motivating force is, in a word, depressing.<P>As well, in an effort to be a comprehensive primer, it tends to be patronizing and ridiculous. We KNOW what a turtleneck is, thanks.<P>I was amused to see the rave review here from "Tracy Lawton" who is obviously related to InStyle's editor, Charla Lawton. <P>Disappointing.</span>
