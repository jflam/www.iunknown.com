                <span id="Label1">As a way of disposing of corpses in a climate that hampers decomposition, the Tibetans have a custom of taking corpses to a sacred place, breaking up the bones, chopping away the flesh, and leaving it all for vultures to clean up.  This is called "sky burial," and as a metaphor for the plight of the Tibetan people, it couldn't be more apt--something Blake Kerr, a doctor fresh out of medical school, discovered by accident. During an innocent visit to Shangri-La, Kerr suddenly found himself treating the wounds of people beaten and shot during the largest riot in Tibet in almost 30 years. <p> Kerr and his mountaineering buddy John Ackerly start out as typical brazen adventurers. Through several happenstance contacts in Lhasa, however, they are introduced to the lives of Tibetans under communist occupation. What they see is disturbing. Gradually, their sympathies turn toward Tibet and ours toward them. When the riot breaks out, they risk life and limb to chronicle atrocities and assist the wounded. For weeks after, they engage in clandestine operations of assistance. And for years after, they work to bring the oppression, suffering, torture, murder, and forced sterilization of a helpless people to worldwide awareness. Part rollicking travel story, part investigative journalism, <I>Sky Burial</I> is finally a testament and will leave you staring blankly, wondering what can be done. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>This book brought me to tears. As an activist for the Tibetan cause, I thought I knew how bad things were there, then I read this book. It is fantastically written and includes photographs of China's atrocities in Tibet. <P>This book is the journey of a man. We watch him go from being a simple tourist and climber to being a doctor and a witness while being present at one of Tibet's largest recorded protests.<P>Anyone who cares about human rights should read this book</span>

                    <span>I'm from Brazil, and here we have only few notices about the situation in Tibet. It's not easy to me to read in english, but it's the only way to be aware of the terrible situation on Tibet. Sky Burial is one of these books that bring us some conscience and desire to make something to help those people and that country. Since I read this excellent book , I don't buy chinese goods anymore and I do the possible to talk about the tibetans reality with my family and my friends. We, all the people of the world must help Tibet from the chinese hands, before it's to late.</span>

                    <span>Add this book to Tears of Blood By Mary Craig and In Exile From the Land of Snows by John Avedon and Whispered Prayers by Steven Harrison. It is important to understand the brutal nature of China and what buying the "Made in China" label supports in both the government and those who control manufacturing and trade. Read, understand and act. This and other books will break your heart that the U.S. wants to become a business partner with the horror that is the government of China.</span>

                    <span>i recomend this book to everyone and if you are a tibetan you must read it. this is one of the best books i have read on tibet and it gives you a very vivid picture of the october 1,1987 uprising in Lahsa and the events that followed. it inspired me and it reminded me as a tibetan that there are thousands of tibetans right now as we go about our daily lives, that are imprisoned and being tortured mercilessly in a dark, damp cell in some corner of tibet. it reminded me that i have a responsibility as a tibetan towards the freedom of tibet. i constantly sobbed throughout the book as i learned more and more how the chinese relentlessy killed tibetans and tortured them with cattle prods, riffle butts, electric batons and all kinds of horrifying instruments. the book also includes numerous interviews with tibetan refugees who have escaped the tyranny of the red star. Blake Kerr later travels to Dharamsala and meets the Dalai Lama. the book is very well written and i enjoyed reading it and the scant humur used in it. go read it...</span>
