                    <span>The common mistake everyone does while learning COM+ is that they try to pickup the syntactical details to write a good COM+ component. But trust me you will never learn COM+ that way. There is more theory in COM+ than code and this book exactly does that. It gives you the inside scoop and at the same time doesn't overload you with details. The best part about this book is that the author never make you feel bad for YOU being a VB programmer. When you complete this book, you will feel good about yourself and have more confidence in your work. <BR>This book is definitely not for beginners. This book is for those people who want to know "Why things work the way they do in Windows and Why do I always do these things in VB?" At the end of this book you will think twice even before you write a simple Select statement. You will know what I mean when you read the book. I took a few day off to complete it as it was so good.</span>

                    <span>The author definitely did extensive research into COM+ when writing this book. Every page is packed of insightful information and valueable guide to use COM+ EFFECTIVELY. If you are a developer using COM components, this book will sure to broaden your understanding into COM and get your skill up to date with COM+. Sure there are other books out there on VB & COM, but I have yet to across one that is as well written as this one. Many reviewers said they read the book more than once. It's not because the book is hard to understand, it is because they didn't want to miss out anything.</span>

                    <span>Good book. As one reader noted above, it seems aimed at providing background information rather than how-to guidance. And this is a good thing. It's definitely worth reading if you're interested in broadening your understanding of COM+ architecture and its underpinnings.</span>

                    <span>I have huge respect for the author and the knowledge shared with us in this book. I love the aspect of "WHY is this the way it is?" for every chapter in the book. I would rather know first how things work beehind the scenes so I can then develop against that knowledge. This is definitely for someone with at least 2-3yrs of good experience with VB6 and MTS. I was able to step one level up in COM+ architecture and become advanced programmer/architect just by finishing this book. Excellent!</span>

                    <span>I agree, the book is excellent. COM+ is one of those complicated subjects that, when mastered (is that possible?) can make your like SOOO much easier.<BR> Beware, though: some of the author's comments are opinions, not facts. Take this one: "From a scalability point of view, it's better to conduct multiple operations inside stored procedures." Ouch. I HOPE he meant PERFORMANCE, not SCALABILITY, because that statement not only breaks one of the main benefits of stored procedures (code reuse; if you have your SP doing multiple things it's much less likely that you'll be able to use it somewhere else); it also breaks one of the main benefits of scalability (the ability to easily scale out pools of objects that are agnostic about their data source).<BR> But hey, it's a Microsoft Press book, so in fairness, he probably doesn't want us thinking about how to scale mySQL {:-}, as I seem to be doing these days...</span>
