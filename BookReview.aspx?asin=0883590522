                    <span>Similar in layout to the other New Holland guides. Thereby making it obvious that it is not intended for the scientist. Small and handy, perfect for a pocket. However, do not think it only covers a small number of the best known mammals. Several newly discovered mammals are included (e.g. a strange ungulate called the Saola, and a beautifully striped rabbit only discovered in the late 1990's). Most of these are interesting but would never be encountered by the "normal backpacker". Several rarities are also included for example the Lesser One-horned Rhino, of which it is believed that only approx. 60 individuals survives. Almost all of the larger mammals known to occur in this region are described individually with at least one (usually very good) colour photo. The small number of large species not described are almost always mentioned in the description of a relative. The smaller mammals (bats, insectivores etc.) are described in groups (also with at least one photo) usually comprising a genus. The text is strait forward and easy to read for everybody with average English skills. However do not forget your glasses, the text is very small! The text itself is good and actually quite long with the books size in mind. It usually comprises of id, range (no maps!), behaviour, habitat etc. Each species description (incl. photo) comprises 2-1/2 page. A great thing for the novice is the use of easily recognisable thumbnails (an example being deer). Thereby it shouldn't be a problem finding the species your looking for. In the intro of the book a chapter speaks about finding and observing mammals, and 31 national parks or reserves are also mentioned briefly. The thing I find most annoying is the very small number of dark or unclear photos. Another thing to remember is that the book doesn't included whales or dolphins other than the one species which regularly enters fresh water. With the prise and size in mind everybody travelling to this area should bring a copy.</span>
