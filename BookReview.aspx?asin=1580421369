                    <span>Super System is a great addition to any Poker library. SS2 is no exception it includes key chapters on Holden, Stud Hilo and Omaha (PL).
<br />
<br />I will not bore you with elaborating on the NLHE chapter rehash or the Aceball Chapter (Who's going to play that anyway?) or the online chapters other reviewers have commented on those.
<br />  
<br />One of the book's strong points is that it covers so many different games some of which have very little information or erroneous information particularly Stud 7 hilo and Omaha Pot Limit
<br />
<br />Each card variant is covered by a world class player in about 60 pages, and much of what they talk about is not covered anywhere else. It's a good format you get the fillet mignon rather than the whole side of beef.
<br />
<br />All sections assume that you know the games basics leaving plenty of space for advanced concepts and play.
<br />
<br />The No-Limit Hold'em section, by Written by Brunson himself, has been revised to a much greather extent than the other reviewers are stating. I would say at least 15% has been changed with about 10% being new info or stated differently. The typeset is also much easier to read. Doyle's recent 55th placing in the WSOP main event at age 70 plus and 1st place on one of the WTP events shows he still has what it takes.
<br /> 
<br />The Stud/8 or better section by Todd Brunson is fantastic, covering lots of material which has never been printed elsewhere. It is compulsory reading for all Stud Hilo players. I will also let on that SS1 has the best Hilo stud section ever written and that is by Sklansky however it's very mathematical based both sections now complement each other very well.
<br />
<br />Limit Hold'em by Jennifer Harmon is also excellent, it's a great supplement and refresher to any other HE books you may be reading or have studied. She emphasizes several new concepts not focused in other books.  I would rate her section as a must read for any HE player. The chapter is very complementary to the SS1 HE chapter by Bruce Baldwin.
<br />
<br />The Pot Limit Omaha chapter by Lyle Berman is outstanding and is probably the best chapter ever written on Omaha (btw there are only a handful of books on Omaha). Berman is the best living player in PLO (This is confirmed in the TJ Cloutier Omaha book) and he introduces several new learning's including the use of small connectors with a suited ace e.g. A,4,5,6, and double suited pairs. In the case of double suited pairs I would advise only play QQXX and up, from computer simulations I have seen every pair down have negative expectations. My guess is that a lot of negative comments in respect of poker book is from players that do not want others to read the book and improve their play.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Omaha/8 or better by Bobby Baldwin is very solid. The essentialness of having an Ace in the hand is interesting.
<br /> 
<br />In terms of stud, I was not surprised to see that it wasn't included at all in SS2. It was covered by Chip Reese in the original Super System 1 (SS1) and his chapter remains a great reference chapter
<br />
<br />Overall, Super System 2 has a place as a supplement to other books that give greater coverage to a particular game. The chapters are great for revision and alternate points of view. Also if you do not currently play the particular game they should get you into the black.

                    <span>If you read only one book on poker strategy (which I highly recommend against if you're going to be serious about poker), this should be it.  I read it over and over again, and each time I find something new.  It's true that some sections are better than others.  The online section is hopelessly uninformative.  People don't need a primer on how to play online; they need an understanding of how the strategy is different, if at all.  But the rest of the book is excellent.  I like that it covers different games because I enjoy playing different games.
<br />
<br />The book is not going to have all the answers.  Those looking for the "definitive" piece of advice have much to learn about poker.  One needs to read lots of authors to help hone one's own strategy.  But for basic strategy -- basic understanding of how to approach various games -- you can't find anything better than Doyle's book.</span>

                    <span>As other reviewers here have noted (and I have to agree) there is a certain messiness to the way this book was written and it could have used a much stronger editorial hand.
<br />  Those quibbles aside, there is plenty of new and valuable info inside, including Brunson's tips on playing online poker (and suggestions as to why someone might prefer to do that compared to playing poker in real life, offline). There are additional tips on tournament play and then there is the advice by other card playing experts. 
<br />  All of this makes the book worth buying because - when it comes right down to it- you never know when the right kernel of info might just be what you need - at that crucial moment. And face it - if you're a pro (or aspiring to be one) you aren't going to be able to resist reading this or you'll drive yourself nuts wondering if there is some little tidbit that could help you win that next hand. So don't fight the urge.  </span>

                    <span>There is much debate on whether this book is simply an update to the old classic or a bona fide second volume and whether one should buy both (as the author recommends) or just the new one.  For the majority of people (whose primary interests lie in various forms of Hold 'em and Omaha) you really only need to buy Super System 2.  The chapter on no-limit is essentially the same and the section on limit in the original book is outdated because of the changes in blind/ante structure that have occurred over the years.  The new book has chapters on pot-limit Omaha, Omaha high/low (Omaha8), Eight or Better (7 stud high/low), Triple Draw (2 to 7 and A to 5 lowball), tournament strategy, and Mike Caro's section on tells.  If you get the new book and don't get the original, you're mostly missing out on a bunch of games that casinos rarely, if ever, spread (although you might see them in some home games).  You'd miss things like 5-card draw (lowball and jacks or better), Razz (7 stud for low), etc.  Probably the only meaningful (by that, I simply mean mainstream) chapter you'd be missing would be Chip Reese's section on Seven Card Stud.  I personally don't think it's profound enough to warrant buying the original book just for that chapter, but great 7 stud books are hard to come by (compared to hold 'em).
<br />
<br />Yes, the book has its share of "filler" (preface, forward, intro, history, and plugs for his poker site) as you might expect from a book of this size, but you basically get all that "filler" at no charge, because the book is still reasonably priced for what you get.  Even if you were only interested in Hold 'Em and Omaha, you'd be hard-pressed to take the same money and get decent books on limit Hold 'em, no-limit Hold 'em, pot limit Omaha, and Omaha8.  You could probably find a single book on one or two of those four and have some money left over, but that's about it.  If you're really interested in all of the chapters in Super System 2, then you could probably rate this book a 5.  If you're going to ignore or gloss over half of it, then a 4+ is about right.
