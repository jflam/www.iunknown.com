                <span id="Label1">Hobbits and wizards and Sauron--oh, my! Mild-mannered Oxford scholar John Ronald Reuel Tolkien had little inkling when he published <I>The Hobbit; Or, There and Back Again</I> in 1937 that, once hobbits were unleashed upon the world, there would be no turning back. Hobbits are, of course, small, furry creatures who love nothing better than a leisurely life quite free from adventure. But in that first novel and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the hobbits Bilbo and Frodo and their elfish friends get swept up into a mighty conflict with the dragon Smaug, the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <I>Paradise Lost</I>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring.  The four books' characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in <I>The Chronicles of Narnia</I>, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <I>The Path of Daggers</I> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <I>--Tim Appelo</I> </span>

                    <span>I have been an avid reader of fantasy genre for many years, but even though I've read and enjoyed "The Hobbit" as a child, for some reason I haven't got around to Tolkien's epic trilogy until well after falling in love with Peter Jackson's take on Middle Earth. I can safely say that, even with countless fantasy knock-offs flying around, Tolkien's books are quite unlike anything I've read before. Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy is probably the only work of imagination that could rival it in sheer originality and uniqueness. Mostly it's got to do with the fact that no other author I can think of has attempted what Tolkien has achieved with his trilogy - which is the most stunningly intricate, detailed account of an imagined world ever committed to a page. At times it feels as if you're reading a non-fiction history book rather than a novel, which admittedly can be a source of irritation if you're principally interested in the story itself rather than learning -yet more- history of Middle Earth. Personally though I found this the most rewarding aspect of the books as it filled in so many blank pages left by the films relating to the characters' backgrounds and places they come from or visit. That Tolkien did not approach writing his books as conventional novels also lends them a lot of idiosyncratic charm. I for one like the leisurely pace of the adventure and the transition of the style from the light and whimsical start of Fellowship of the Ring to the grandiose heroic description of the Pelennor Fields in the third book. And the Hobbit heroes' plain speech is an interesting and often welcome contrast with the lofty language of the Elves and humans. 
<br />
<br />On the minus side, Tolkien's dry, scholarly approach leaves other aspects of the book somewhat shortchanged, especially when it comes to characterisation. Fantasy genre often gets criticised for being very black-and white in its depiction of good and evil, but IMO it's still possible to write your basically good faultless heroes and irredeemable villains -and- make them engaging. I actually feel that in this respect The Hobbit is a much more successful book - the characters of Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin etc. are lively and charming and I felt that I truly cared for them. With the exception of Sam, Gollum and perhaps Eowyn, LoTR book characters left me quite cold. Frodo starts off as a fairly likeable protagonist and the one whose inner world Tolkien describes the most, but by Return of the King he becomes rather like a closed book and his conversion to pacifism, for example, comes out of a blue rather than a natural development. Human heroes like Aragorn or Faramir fare much worse still: Tolkien has an amazing talent for creating distinct cultures and races, but when it comes to individual characters he mostly writes them as flat and archetypal. Also, compare the amount of evocative descriptive passages he devotes to the scenery and locations to the amount of adjectives he allows his characters - most of them are suitably generic descriptions like "proud", "stern", "wise", etc. As a result, Middle Earth the country often seems far more alive and vibrant than the people who inhabit it.
<br />
<br />My other misgivings come from the fact that I've been a LoTR films fan first and find it hard not to look at the books without films affecting my judgement. For example, I was unpleasantly struck by how much more class-ridden the books are compared to the films; the divisions between "superior" and "lesser" races are much more accentuated here and the relationships are firmly defined by the social hierarchies. It doesn't make the books worse, of course, but personally I cringed every time Aragorn behaved like a haughty aristocrat or Sam was acting oh-so-deferential and servile towards "Master Frodo". Still, character misgivings aside, reading the books was an enormously rewarding experience and they're definitely a must-read.</span>

                    <span>First of all, I am NOT writing this review over what "edition" is best and what is the worst.  Frankly, I don't even know what edition I own!  However, I am glad that people are making recommendations...for the Tolkien lover, it probably is a good idea to get an edition that you'll treasure.
<br />
<br />What I am writing about in this review is the story that's beneath the cover.  I read "The Lord of the Rings" when I was eleven (almost twelve) and loved it.  I am thirteen (almost fourteen) now and I have read it at least five times!!  If you are thinking of buying the books, then you must get ALL OF THEM.  People say that the LotR was written to be three separate volumes; I believe they are wrong--the LotR was PUBLISHED in three different volumes but it is all one story--and the books IN NO SHAPE OR FORM stand alone.  They are all one.
<br />
<br />If you have not yet seen the movies (which is probably unlikely), read the books first.  That's what I did and I have never regretted it; 1)It makes more sense 2)You get much more out of the story 3)You understand the characters better.  I won't waste my time going over the story line and the characters and all that--I'm sure you've heard that a million times.  But, altogether, it is a BEAUTIFUL story that far surpasses any movie...though they did a better job than I expected on those.</span>

                    <span>Two other books were published the same year as The Lord of the Rings; The Broken Sword by Poul Anderson and Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake. Both are excellent, and they are still read today. I can highyl recommend them. They are even in the same fantasy genre as Lord of the Rings, and both Anderson and Tolkien drew on the same nordic mythology. Why is then Lord of the Rings so outstandingly popular? Especially Gormenghast rivals LOTR in complexity and brilliance. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that Tolkien poured all of his soul in his books. These are not mere books; they *are* Tolkien. I have heard that Tolkien wrote to escape a dreary life - therefore he created the ultimate escape fantasy. I remember how hypnotised I was as a child reading them. Tolkien weaves such a rich tapestry that as in no other fantasy book have I ever felt that the author is describing a real world. The only book I can think about that comes close is Frank Herbert's Dune, but it is also obviously inspired by LOTR. 
<br />So, the combination of a will to create a fantasy world to escape to with the imagination and education to do it and a remarkable writing ability has created a literary masterpiece. I think that he created the modern fantasy genre with these books, and all role-playing games up until the mid-eighties were directly modelled on Middle-Earth.
<br />However, I must add that I have some caveats: The moral of the books is rather primitve - static rural countryside/good, dynamic industrial society/bad. There is a total dualism; you are either with the good guys or with the bad guys (and gosh, are the bad guys BAD!). There has also been a lot of commercial exploitation of Tolkien; his family has published material that was never supposed to be published, and I fear that it is more driven by money than respect for his legacy.</span>

                    <span>I really like these books.They are kind of funny and very adventerous.If you like the movies you will love the books.They have alot of things and people that are not in the movies.J.R.R Tolkein is a awsome writer.The books have some things that are not even thought of or even mentioned in the movies.So,read the books before seeing the movie.I hope you read and enjoy the books.Just because they are long doesn't mean they are not good books.</span>

                    <span>My goodness - I am really surprised by some of the criticism of this boxed set!! I have read through all the books twice and I never even noticed a typo! Not one! (I am sure there are some typos, but I failed to see them.) 
<br />
<br />And I really like the movie photo covers! I like the connection it makes between the movies and books.
<br />
<br />I bought this boxed set of paperbacks to be my "reading copies" of LOTR. I find I can get more "comfortable" with a paperback as opposed to a big hardback. Since they are small, they are easy to stick in my pocket/purse and take with me. I did not purchase this boxed set anticipating fancy maps and artwork! (For that, I will purchase the more expensive hardback editions.)
<br />
<br />I think some of the reviewers had unrealistic expectations of this boxed set...
<br />
<br />With all that said, I read these books after seeing the movies. I can understand why fans were concerned that the movies would not do the books justice. The books are so descriptive, imaginative, and full of brilliant detail. But I think Peter Jackson did an awsome job with the movies.
<br />
<br />There is so "much" in these books, that you really must read them more than once to take it all in... I'll probably read them for the third time later this year. </span>
