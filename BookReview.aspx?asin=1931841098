                    <span>It amazes me that people post reviews stating, "Don't buy this book," or "3 stars (but should be less in my opinion)," among many others, because the book doesn't have the quote un-quote "advanced" information they were looking for. According to one reviewer this "advanced" information he was looking for was "a non-Final Fantasy type combat system." This book TEACHES you the IDEAS behind how game programming works, with an emphasis and examples on ROLE PLAYING GAMES. What's the most popular type of role playing game? Final Fantasy type. If you are an "advanced" game programmer and this book didn't help you, then you should be able to use your own knowledge and program your OWN combat system. It seems like you were looking for a book that offered the solution (combat system) that you wanted to cut and paste into your "advanced and superior code." For those that want a book to help their imagination grow and problem solving nodes start firing away after seeing some real-life examples, this book is for you. If you want to buy a book that contains code you are just going to cut and paste into your own source, then you're right, this book is not "advanced" enough.</span>

                    <span>OK, first off, I have not been fond of Lamothe, or the PrimaTech series in the past. Everyone knows by now that you can get most of the information in the older ones straight out of the DX docs. I almost totally built my first 3d engine in this way, straight from reading through the DX docs and looking at the samples. Now, that is where I find this book shines. I had a few things that I needed some extra help on that are not well documented elsewhere, and I found it here. Advanced topics such as collision detection, skinned meshes, and more are all here. <P>I will admit, I will probably never read the entire book. It covers the standard n00b stuff that no one wants anymore. What it DOES provide is a valuable reference book and samples to look at when I run into a problem. It covers pretty much all aspects of game programming, and they can be applied easily towards other types of games. (I am actually using certain things from it for my FPS). <P>So here's the lowdown: Great book, some useless stuff, but there actually is USEFUL stuff. I'd buy it if I were you. Advanced topics are there, and the author does a good job with them. The other books you should look into are Multiplayer Game Programming (by Todd Barron), which is not bad, but could be more advanced, and I hear Isometric Game Programming (by Ernest Pazera) is good, and what I have seen seems good.<P>All I can say is, of all of the game programming books i've seen, this one is #1! All of the samples are excellent, and work. The final game, The Tower, is impressive for a game created for a book, although i'm sure expert programmers could improve it quite a bit.</span>

                    <span>Prima Press has the merit of being the first company to heavily invest only in publications of game-programming books.. I find that game-programming is one of the most fascinating and well, fun <BR>area of programming and CS in general.. so any effort in this direction is welcome to me.. but I have seen too many titles from this publisher who were too superficial to do any good, or just plain rubbish. This title stands out for the professionality and competence of the author and for the level of detail and completeness of presentation. If you are a programmer with decent C/C++ skills, a curiosity about how games like Diablo work, and a LOT of patience and enthusiasm for game programming by all means get this book. It won't enable you to write the next episode of Diablo or Dungeon Siege but still if you work your way through it studying carefully the text and especially the code presented, in the end you will know enough to create a small<BR>2D/3D adventure game on the diablo style. <P>Beware this book is thick and dense, and will take time to absorb but you cannot help it if you want to learn something interesting and enjoyable about game programming.<BR>The second edition is coming out, probably updated to the latest <BR>release of DirectX, so watch out for it!</span>

                    <span>This book is very helpful, but this book is not intended for the absolute beginner. You should know at least the basics of either C or C++. Other than that, it does a fairly good job of laying down what you need to know, and how to go about doing it.</span>

                    <span>I rate this book with 3 stars even though my own personal opinion of it is somewhat lower. As has been pointed out in previous reviews the books does cover a lot of ground and leaves you with a complete mini-game. That's why the book might be good for newbie programmers who are looking for an example of how to write a rpg. And that's what earns the book 3 stars in my review.<P>I just want to stress something that the other reviewers haven't mentioned - this book is *not* for experienced programmers who are working seriously on their own rpg already! It cannot be used as a reference on how to implement those things you haven't done yet because the book tries to cover so much that it only presents very specific solutions for all the topics. There is only *one* type of combat covered for example, and that's a FF7 style turn-based combat. If you're planning for something else this book will be useless for you on this subject. And the same can be said about all the other topics: item management, engine design, level management, automapping, AI etc. Each topic is quickly breezed over and then a specific solution is presented. Take it or leave it. In my case I didn't take any of them...<P>So in summary: Might be interesting for newbie rpg programmers who wants a guide through an example rpg. But any experienced programmer should leave this book alone!</span>
