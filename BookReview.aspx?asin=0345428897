                <span id="Label1">If you want to understand the 1990s, you have to understand venture capitalists. These are the people who listen to business pitches by the score, the financial-world equivalent of miners turning over tons of earth in search of precious metal. They're looking for the next Amazon.com, the next Yahoo!, the next eBay. Randall E. Stross, who teaches business history at San Jos&eacute; State University, just happened to be there when a firm called Benchmark Capital discovered eBay. <I>eBoys</I> tells the story of how a group of not-quite-middle-aged men came to make an investment that returned a Silicon Valley record of 100,000 percent.<p> Stross is a gifted storyteller who weaves the personal histories of the Benchmark partners with stories of how the firm came to back such companies as Priceline.com and Webvan. We meet guys who weren't born to privilege, men who took unconventional routes into the venture capital business. Probably the most intriguing is Dave Beirne, a hyperaggressive executive recruiter who went into the business after realizing venture capitalists are the ones who really call the shots at high-tech start-ups. We also see the problems Silicon Valley guys have when they try to dot-com the bricks-and-mortar world. The short tale of an aborted partnership between Benchmark and Toys 'R' Us illustrates why the old economy is so mystified by the new.<p> Anyone interested in how business works should find something of interest in <I>eBoys</I>. From the organizational structure and corporate culture of Benchmark to the histories and personalities of its partners to its adventures in the world of Internet start-ups, it's a digital snapshot that reveals how successful businesses look, think, and mine gold in today's economy. <I>--Lou Schuler</I> </span>

                    <span>I doubt "eBoys" was intended to read as a period piece, but it certainly does in the post-technology bubble world.  There are a couple things that come across loud and clear: first, these venture capitalists were not blind to the bubble that was forming; second, if they wanted to stay alive and relevant in their field, they needed to keep financing new companies and unwillingly participate in furthering the bubble.
<br />
<br />The story is well-told and gives you an insider's view of how at least one venture capital firm makes the decision of who gets funding and who doesn't.  It also serves as a cautionary tale about how even the most sophisticated investors get sucked into bubble mentality.
<br />
<br />A valuable read for investors, entreprenuers, and aspiring venture capitalists.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I stand corrected on my earlier review of "The Perfect Store" -- Eboys has now usurped the title of "quite possibly the best book I've ever read."  O.k. so I tend to exaggerate after I read a really great book, but this is definitely in my top 10 books of all time... and I'm a voracious reader (500+ easy... at age 28).
<br />
<br />Informative, educational, entertaining, instructive, and incredibly motivating and inspiring -- for all those with an insatiable entrepreneurial spirit like the one I have, Eboys can be thought of as an entrepreneurial bible... or maybe hymnal would be more appropriate.  I read the book and now I'm listening to the Audible audiobook... simply awesome... again!  This is a must-have book for any budding Bill Gates, Micheal Dell, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, or PIERRE OMIDYAR out there.  Heck I even sent Benchmark the executive summary for my business even though they don't invest in my industry... I was just that impressed with those guys.  
<br />
<br />Read it.  Save it.  Refer to it.  You'll be glad you did.</span>

                    <span>Broad overview of the netherworld of venture capitalists as well as short take on eBay, the unlikely "profitable" internet company that learned how to scale its technology and augment its customer base with the help of Benchmark. As other reviews will corroboarte, it's this book's ebullient writing that salvages it from a more tepid rating. </span>

                    <span>I found the book to be totally engrossing and entertaining, but also amusing (not always in a good way), a little inaccurate, and probably more than a little embarrassing to the participants in hindsight.  If you are looking for an entertaining read about the highest fliers in the internet bubble, this is a great choice.  But if you are hoping to learn more about venture capital from an insiders point of view, this book will lead you astray.<p>The author's description of the prevailing attitudes and lingo at Benchmark and other venture firms seems out of place.  He seems to be describing the macho environment of an investment bank rather than the more subdued approach of venture capitalists.  But maybe that's the way things actually were at Benchmark in the late 1990s.<p>As a venture capitalist myself, I was surprised by the apparent lack of due diligence and the thin premises upon which the partners seemed to make their investment decisions.  I'm sure this perception is in part a consequence of the author's intentional decision to gloss over the nitty gritty details.  But explicit dialogue between the partners shows that the partners did in fact have a shoot-from-the-hip style.  I am hardly qualified to question the partners' instincts when they were so successful.  But I do think it is a wildly inaccurate portrayal of the industry as a whole.</span>

                    <span>I usually finish all books that I buy, but this one ended up in the scrap heap after about 100 pages. The author projects that these VC's are the coolest thing to ever happen, all their fancy lingo, and the fact that companies, people, and dreams are all waiting for their "thumbs up".<p>The entrepreneurs should be the real success story hear, not their stupid VC's.</span>
