                <span id="Label1"><P><B><I>Is "Chicken SOup" Too Sweet for Your Soul?</I></B>  <P>When you take the road less traveled, do you get lost? When bad things happen to other people, do you feel good? Do self-help books make you feel selfish and helpless? Congratulations, you're one of us. Welcome to the farthest side of reality -- and the first collection of stories sure to harden your heart and dampen your spirit.  <P><B><I>Chicken Poop for the Soul</I></B>  <P>Here is the story of "Step-Mother Teresa" who turned an orphanage in Calcutta into a sweatshop...and "The True Meaning of Love," romance as seen from a stalker's point of view. Explore the positive side of feeling bad in "The Joys of Depression." Learn the code of the urban teacher who vows "I will never respond to a student's demands, no matter how outrageous, with the phase 'Over my dead body.'" Read the multimillion-dollar government study that discovered that the primary cause of anxiety in America is government studies. And, finally, learn the true secret of happiness.  <P>Ruthlessly hilarious, this is the world's first "sinspirational" book, a guide absolutley guaranteed never to be a selection of Oprah's Book Club.</span>

                    <span>If you've had enough of all those nauseating sugar frosted "self help" books that flood the market, try this one! A true curmudgeon's choice. Biting sarcasm and satire, (For those of you in Rio Linda, that means it's mocking) it warms the cockles of my jaded heart. There is more than a little truth in these tales for the cynical. In fact, this would be a good primer for those who don't have a grip on reality, but would like to try it. Face it, LIFE STINKS! A few cartoons would have been a nice touch, but you can't have everything.(I won't give up trying to GET everything) For those of you who are offended by this book, I'll speak very slowly so even YOU can understand it, IT'S HUMOR.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book when I was still in High School. Durring one of my study halls, I loaned this book to a friend. When he finished with it, he passed it on to someone else. For the rest of the year, it kept getting passed from one person to another. The next year, I heard that it was still in circulation. As far as I know, it still is.</span>

                    <span>Now, here is something that truly made me laugh and feel good about things, as opposed to those wretched chicken soup books, filled with cancer, car accidents, and other such things that leave the reader feeling as though she should jump off an overpass onto the highway because she has not suffered as others. Seriously though, I'm not disparaging the Soup books. I'm just saying that this one made me laugh more and put me in a better mood than the other ones. And as for the reader who decided that this mocks the word of God, I'd like more information about the church whose gospel consists of an old, hand copied edition of Chicken Soup for the Soul...</span>
