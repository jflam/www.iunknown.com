                <span id="Label1">"What if" scenarios are often suspect.  They are sometimes thinly veiled tales of the gospel according to the author, taking on the claustrophobic air of a personal fantasia that can't be shared.  Such is not the case with Philip Roth's tour de force, <I>The Plot Against America</I>.  It is a credible, fully-realized picture of what could happen anywhere, at any time, if the right people and circumstances come together.<p>  <I>The Plot Against America</I> explores a wholly imagined thesis and sees it through to the end:  Charles A. Lindbergh defeats FDR for the Presidency in 1940.  Lindbergh, the "Lone Eagle," captured the country's imagination by his solo Atlantic crossing in 1927 in the monoplane,  <I>Spirit of St. Louis</I>, then had the country's sympathy upon the kidnapping and murder of his young son.  He was a true American hero: brave, modest, handsome, a patriot.  According to some reliable sources, he was also a rabid isolationist, Nazi sympathizer, and a crypto-fascist.  It is these latter attributes of Lindbergh that inform the novel.<p>  The story is framed in Roth's own family history: the family flat in Weequahic, the neighbors, his parents, Bess and Herman, his brother, Sandy and seven-year-old Philip.  Jewishness is always the scrim through which Roth examines American contemporary culture.  His detractors say that he sees persecution everywhere, that he is vigilant in "Keeping faith with the certainty of Jewish travail"; his less severe critics might cavil about his portrayal of Jewish mothers and his sexual obsession, but generally give him good marks, and his fans read every word he writes and heap honors upon him.  This novel will engage and satisfy every camp.<p>  "Fear presides over these memories, a perpetual fear. Of course, no childhood is without its terrors, yet I wonder if I would have been a less frightened boy if Lindbergh hadn't been president or if I hadn't been the offspring of Jews."  This is the opening paragraph of the book, which sets the stage and tone for all that follows.  Fear is palpable throughout; fear of things both real and imagined.  A central event of the novel is the relocation effort made through the Office of American Absorption, a government program whereby Jews would be placed, family by family, across the nation, thereby breaking up their neighborhoods--ghettos--and removing them from each other and from any kind of ethnic solidarity.  The impact this edict has on Philip and all around him is horrific and life-changing.  Throughout the novel, Roth interweaves historical names such as Walter Winchell, who tries to run against Lindbergh.  The twist at the end is more than surprising--it is positively ingenious.<p>  Roth has written a magnificent novel, arguably his best work in a long time.  It is tempting to equate his scenario with current events, but resist, resist.  Of course it is a cautionary tale, but, beyond that, it is a contribution to American letters by a man working at the top of his powers.  <I>--Valerie Ryan</I></span>

                    <span>My sense is that Philip Roth writes about what he knows. What he knows is what it was like to grow up Jewish in Newark, NJ, at least as far as this book goes. In fact, he makes no pretense of changing the names of the characters in this book--it's about the Roth family, lower middle class and Jewish in the early 40s. And most especially it's about a young boy named Philip Roth. He comes up with the device of having Lindbergh elected in 1940 instead of Roosevelt with the subsequent release of an American-style anti-Semitism and how the family reacts to this. He does a very good job of describing the quirky life of the Roth family, but these descriptions are better as a series of episodes and character studies than as a way to move the plot forward. I think it's good for books to have solid, real characters, but I also like it when the plot is involving, entertaining, educational, and seems like it could have happened. For me, this plot was something Roth dreamed up to get another book out. While the descriptions of the family are organically drawn, I felt the story about Lindbergh and what he unleashed had a mechanical feel to it, as if Roth needed that idea to have a story in the first place. Roth is rightly praised as a author who writes with a precision of language and description and insight into character, but I think he is less successful as a storyteller.Various reviewers have praised this book as an instant classic. My sense is that if someone other than Roth wrote this book, such accolades would be less likely. Read this book to see why it has gained so much notoriety, but do it knowing that it's unlikely to be as good a book as you may have been lead to believe it is.</span>

                    <span>Both critics' and readers' reviews seem to me to concentrate on the "non-fiction novel" aspect of Roth's book, rather than the undercurrent of emotional, intellectual and physical stress and terror that "the unthinkable" could happen here. Roth forces us to experience this night- mare, using the device of a popular American hero,  Lindbergh (who was pro-Nazi), defeat FDR in 1940, and change the character of the countrty from democratic to totalitarian. Roth had to exploit Lindbergh's character up to a point to  get our attention, fair or not. Americans can be so smug and self-satisfied, so secure and certain that this kind of evil could never overwhelm our culture. Really? Study the agenda of the neocon extremists operating today, using religious faith as their banner.</span>

                    <span>While it got off to a slow start, in my opinion, I really enjoyed Roth's story once I got used to his writing style. I'm drawn to this genre of historical fiction, which so cleverly weaves together a great, fictional family drama with historical figures and events (real figures and events, but unreal actions and outcomes). While you go into the story knowing that it's fiction, it really makes you think and inevitably compare it to current events. Since nearly the entire story has already been covered here in other reviews, I'll just say that it's an interesting "what if" and some of the real facts in the post-script are the most disturbing (e.g., Lindbergh and Ford both received the Service Cross of the German Eagle from Hitler himself). The twist in the storyline at the end was also an interesting surprise, but the ending itself didn't satisfy.

                    <span>Roth's latest book is based on a clever and interesting idea.  However several things contribute to my disappointment with this novel.  Philip Roth intrudes into the novel by being the principal character...Philip as a small boy growing up in Newark and his family ...and this device adds nothing and includes a lot of information which is, frankly, boring!
<br /> Secondly, the plot is totally unbelievable..not because Fascism couldn't happen here, but because the plot line and writing are
<br />simply not convincing.</span>
