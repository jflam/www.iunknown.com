                <span id="Label1">Sometime during the last 30 years, the service economy emerged as the dominant engine of economic activity. At first, critics who were uncomfortable with the intangible nature of services bemoaned the decline of the goods-based economy, which, thanks to many factors, had increasingly become commoditized. Successful companies, such as Nordstrom, Starbucks, Saturn, and IBM, discovered that the best way to differentiate one product from another--clothes, food, cars, computers--was to add service.<p>  But, according to Joseph Pine and James Gilmore, the bar of economic offerings is being raised again. In <I>The Experience Economy</I>, the authors argue that the service economy is about to be superseded with something that critics will find even more ephemeral (and controversial) than services ever were: <I>experiences</I>. In part because of technology and the increasing expectations of consumers, services today are starting to look like commodities. The authors write that "Those businesses that relegate themselves to the diminishing world of goods and services will be rendered irrelevant. To avoid this fate, you must learn to stage a rich, compelling experience."<p>  Many will find the idea of staging experiences as a requirement for business survival far-fetched. However, the authors make a compelling case, and consider successful companies that are already packaging their offerings as experiences, from Disney to AOL. Far-reaching and thought-provoking, <I>The Experience Economy</I> is for marketing professionals and anyone looking to gain a fresh perspective on what business landscape might look like in the years to come.

                    <span>As I write this review on July 29, 2003, I see 'The Experience Economy' is ranked at #624 in amazon.com's constantly updated sales rankings. Pretty heady for a fairly esoteric business book published in April 1999.<P>The reason has to do with the latest (August 2003) edition of 'Fast Company' magazine. The editors asked a series of business leaders to pick one "book that matters," noting that "one book can change the direction of a company -- or a career." Bob Nardelli, ex-of GE and now CEO of the Home Depot, chose 'The Experience Economy.'<P>That's a great thing, because this excellent piece of work really got the short shrift - with its April 1999 publication date, its message of capturing the full potential of face-to-face retail got buried in the tsunami of e-commerce hysteria. <P>Now that we all recognize the Internet as just another viable sales channel, this fine effort by Pine and Gilmore has a second life. The fact that Nardelli picked it as his one book that matters tells you all you need to know about his vision for the future of Home Depot.</span>

                    <span>Transformations are what all of us are looking for: experiences that change us for the better. Gilmore and Pine maintain that in the coming century, companies that provide us with transformational experiences will rule the roost. Pine and Gilmore explain what it means to systematically design for experience, when "the customer IS the product."<P>Disney is their hero, and with good cause: Disneyland and Disneyworld continue to raise the bar on entertainment experience. But as the authors point out, experiences are to be found everywhere -- in customer service, a TV ad, the way people work together, even a cup of coffee. And in the commercial future, experience will be king.<P>The premise and the execution of THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY are equally invigorating. Pine and Gilmore identify existing examples of experiential design -- and then they go one better, with prescriptions for how to do it yourself. Excellent. So many authors are content merely to reveal The Truth. Pine and Gilmore want you and me to apply their philosophy and start changing the world. They additionally apply some moral precepts that this reader found stirring, to ensure that if change is to come, it will be positive.<P>THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY is easy to read but not simplistic and has just the right amount of tables and charts to support and highlight the authors' position.<P>Most business books get read only half-way through. Begin THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY, and you'll not only read it cover to cover, you'll carry it with you as a reference. Everytime you try out something to buy, in a shop, online, or simply in your head, Pine and Gilmore will be speaking to you. Like Jimi Hendrix before you, they'll be asking: "But are you...experienced?"</span>

                    <span>This book definitely makes you stop and think about what today's consumer wants and expects. (In fact, it's easy, just ask yourself what you would want - what you're offering or what Walt Disney is offering). Businesses that don't make a lasting impression, offer an experience for the consumer will eventually go the way of the dinosaur.</span>

I've become incredibly passionate about the experience economy concept, and am constantly looking for real life examples or potential applications.<BR>When I stand in a queue I'm thinking about how I would go about offering the service or product I'm queueing for.<BR>When I speak to the beauracracy that provides me banking or insurance services, I'm forever demanding that they change the impersonal and inflexible way that they engage with me.<BR>If you're looking for a new paradigm in selling what you have to offer, then this is the book for you.<BR>I love it.</span>
