                <span id="Label1"><blockquote><p> On the football field, he was an explosive force; a mold- breaking and bone-crushing linebacker who wreaked havoc on offenses each Sunday. But off the field, the fury that made Lawrence Taylor a Hall of Fame player put him on a runaway blitz to self-destruction. </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>LT:: Over the Edge</i> is a smash-mouth memoir by one of the game's greatest players, an unsparing look at the giant of all Giants whose struggle with a cocaine habit was the only thing in his life he couldn't tackle with ease. </p> <p> Raw and uncut, Taylor tells of his life from a small townin Virginia to becoming the most dominant defensive player of all time. Through a record ten straight All-Pro seasons, LT led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl victories, along the way revolutionizing the outside linebacker position. But the bright lights of Giants Stadium were nothing compared to the even brighter lights of New York City, where the King of the NFL held court all night long, fueled by booze, drugs, sex, and his own sense of invincibility. </p> <p> Twice suspended from the league for substance abuse, Taylor walked away from the white lines of the football field to the far more alluring white lines of New York drug culture. Not one week after his retirement in 1993, he was on vacation and binging on coke. And so began an endless blur of years of all-nighters, prostitutes, and crippling paranoia that ended his marriage and very nearly cost him his life. But after several arrests, with the Hall of Fame beckoning, Lawrence Taylor finally stared down his toughest opponent -- himself -- entered rehab, and got clean. In 1999, in his first year of eligibility, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame -- the man who had raised hell on and off the field had lived through it all. </p> <p> Filled with intimate and revealing stories from his teammates, coaches, family, and friends,<i> LT: Over the Edge</i> will forever change the way you look at the game of football and the indomitable Lawrence Taylor. </p></span>

                    <span>Over the edge covers everything from LT's college days, through his career with the Giants to his post career problems. The book gives you a god idea of the lifestyle LT led off the field but doesn't go into too much detail. In a nutshell, he partied hard, had extra marital flings, but still managed to show up and give 100% on Sunday Afternoon. Having been a Giants fan for over 25 seasons, I had can say that. you'd never know that there were many a night that LT would show up at the stadium after being out till 8 am, and still manage to play a helluva game. The after career chapters, which detail LT's drug use make you feel some sympathy, but also angry that it took LT so long to clean his act up. Overall, This is a decent sports biography, one any football fan will appreciate.</span>

                    <span>This brutally honest look at Lawrence Taylor's life is a must read. Although LT has been described as larger-than-life, reading about the protagonist's ascent from rock bottom including overcoming a powerful drug addiction, makes you see LT for who he really is, human. Excellent job by Steve Serby in extracting the candidly raw details of LT's life. The book is a story about survival, overcoming obstacles and I couldn't put it down! Lawrence Taylor's life may have gone horribly awry, but, you still find yourself cheering LT LT LT</span>

                    <span>Lt can't seem to make up his mind in this book if he wants to sound contrite and sorry for his failings in life or brag about them. Admittedly the guy was as wild and uninhibited off the field as he was on it and some of his adventures in the world of drugs and sex make excellent reading. Lt was a great if not the greatest football player but off the field he was out of control. The premise of the book is that he landed on his feet and the reader should admire him for his recovery. However his descriptions of his wild life may sound more enticing to other readers. This is a story that seems to have another chaper or two in the wings. I like the guy and hope he is sincere in his desire to stay straight.</span>

                    <span>LT is very honest in recounting the disturbing details of his battle with drugs and a lifestyle that ultimately was out of control. Yes he became a different person as LT and lived off the field witht he same wild abandon that he brought to the game. <BR>The stories are entertaining if somewhat predictable. Drugs, sex, more sex, etc...<BR> MY problem with the book is that while Taylor is attempting to demonstrate his contrition for his bad behavior , especially toward his family, the tone of his descriptions of the wild times comes across as giddy and bragging. <BR>The guy was the best football player I've ever seen and I am glad he landed on his feet after going through all of this.</span>

                    <span>In this book, Lawrence Taylor goes into his life of drugs, fast cars, lots of woman, and tons of money. He describes his life, but with not so much detail. In fact, a chunck of his book are actually quotes from other people intermingled within his text. The book is about 250 pages long with a large font. I bought so it would last me a while, but I started reading it at noon, and finished it before dinner.<P>The third person quotes are what really got to me. A portion of the quotes are self promoting, and other quotes just repeat what LT described in the previous paragraph. They hardly provided any insight into LT, but ruined the flow and continuity of the book in general.<P>The lack of detail is also apparent. There are many references to how fast he was and how he revolutionized the game, but he provides no expansion of this. No information on how fast he ran, or how much he can bench press, or what types of plays he helped revolutionize. In terms of a football book, it's virtually non-existent. He doesn't go into much detail on other parts of the books as well. He describes a lot of parties, bar hopping, fast driving, and throws a few general stories in there, but with only a few exception, nothing specific to hold on to.<P>Another bad part of this book is that in the end, he tries to evoke sympathy to which no one really can't.<BR>This brings it back to his life story. The most admirable aspect of the book is that he is very honest with himself. He knew cocaine destroyed him, and sometimes goes into some depressing stories. He knew he was lazy sometimes, but he still played hard.<P>All in all, it's short, but extremely readable. It's more of an outline than a full fledged expose, but it's honest and somewhat shocking nonetheless.</span>
