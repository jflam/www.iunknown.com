                    <span>As other reviewers have mentioned, this can't fairly be called a translation: Mitchell doesn't know Chinese, can't understand the original, and in any case isn't interested in doing so. The sections where he says he's "translated freely" - or, less charitably, made things up - are ample proof of that. Whatever value the book has, it's as a reflection of American pop-Daoism, and not as a fair or accurate interpretation of the religion.
<br />
<br />I'll be fair: I was given a copy of this years ago, and fell in love with it, and decided that I'd learn Chinese so that I'd be able to read it in the original. Along the way, I took courses in the history of Daoism, read actual translations (Henricks' rendition is very good; D.C. Lau's is OK and provides good commentary, as well as the Mawangdui versions of the text), and began to realize that I'd been had. Reading the text in the original while studying the Daode Jing (Tao Te Ching) and the Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu) at Beijing University, my suspicions were confirmed: Mitchell fudged his "translation." The result is a very nice work of English free verse and pop spirituality, but Daoist it ain't.</span>

                    <span>Of all of the various translations I have read either all or part of, this is the most fluid and dynamic.  Not being able to read Chinese, I will not pretend to comment on its fidelity to the original, but the ideas conveyed by Mitchell inform the Taoist philosophy well.  I consider the handful of one star reviews to be unfair; however, since I am not necessarily familiar with the better translations they mention, I cannot make any claims on their individual criticisms.  One thing, however, is certain:  Just because there may be a better translation does not make Mitchell's a bad translation.  If anything, you should become familiar with a variety of translations, and this should certainly be among them.</span>

                    <span>Please do not buy this translation of the "Tao Te Ching." Though Mitchell's effort may have been made with the best of intentions, the results fail to capture the elusive essence of the concept he is pursuing. Try Heider or Hoff; either one will be of more benefit. Don't deprive yourself of a rich philosophy...</span>

                    <span>"A good traveler has no fixed plans / and is not intent upon arriving," writes Stephen Mitchell as the opening to Chapter 27, which is most often translated as "A good walker leaves no tracks."  So let's be clear from the start:  the Tao Te Ching is a guidebook; nothing more or less.
<br />
<br />And as with guidebooks for travelers of all types, following physical or spiritual paths, the text is in danger of becoming the focus of people's attention rather than the subject it tries to embrace.  One can almost imagine the pained expression on the Old Boy's face at being asked to define such a thing as the Tao with mere words, knowing full well what the result would be.  Fortunately, he also realized he could not remain silent, lest someone else point people in the wrong direction.
<br />
<br />So is this the long-awaited "definitive" version of the Tao Te Ching?  No, Jonathan Star's version has claimed that distinction.  Or was it Victor Mair's?  Red Pine's?  The right answer is: the one that speaks most clearly to you and points you in the right direction.  How will you know this is happening?  You'll laugh...</span>

                    <span>       There are much better translations of the Tao Te Ching out there. One gets the sense from reading the Stephen Mitchell translation that it was tailored to sell in the west. I would recommend the Red Pine translation above all any day of the year, as it makes use of all discovered versions of the Tao Te Ching in its translation, and includes commentaries on each verse from scholars of the past 2000 years.</span>
