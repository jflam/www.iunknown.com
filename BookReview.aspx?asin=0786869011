                <span id="Label1">A moving tale of oppression and courageous defiance -- the true story of a teenage girl growing up in war-torn Afghanistan.  <P>From 1997 to 2001, sixteen-year-old Latifa was a prisoner in her own home as the Taliban wreaked havoc on the lives of Afghan girls and women. This is her testimony -- a young woman's reaction to the inhumanity taking place before her very eyes. Latifa's life was turned upside down the moment the Taliban took Kabul. The oppressive regime banned women from working from schools, from public life, even from leaving their homes without a male relative. Female faces were outlawed as the burka, or head-to-toe veil, became mandatory. Latifa had planned to pursue journalism, in a quest for the truth about the ever-shifting power structure in her country. From the Russians to the warring factions, Latifa's existence had been marred by violence and upheaval. But when the Taliban took over, her world was reduced to the few rooms of her apartment. Like a contemporary Anne Frank, Latifa was forced to observe, absorb, and make sense of what was happening to women, to her country, from the!  confines of her four walls. Frustrated by the sight of children wandering the streets below, and despite the danger to her own life, Latifa established a school and attempted to defy a regime, one child at a time. In May 2001, Latifa and her parents escaped through dangerous Taliban territory to Pakistan, then Paris. After several weeks, their flight was discovered, and the government issued a fatwa against them. Now in 2002, with the Taliban in retreat,  Latifa's future seems brighter, although her homeland is still in turmoil. Written during her exile, this book is an extraordinarily powerful account of a teenager's life under terrible circumstances and a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit.</span>

                    <span>I would like everyone who believes in liberty and freedom to read this book. It is a personal story of what happens when people distort religion and turn it into a means of oppression and cruelty and it is important to note the distinction. The events taking place under the rule of the Taliban I have read about. However, reading about it from this young woman's personal experience made even a more powerful impression on me. One cannot dismiss the cruel acts of the Taliban by saying that they are only human and humans are not perfect. The cruelty that took place there is on the level of the Nazis. Examples, beating a young boy to death in front of his mother because he watched a video. And of course the extreme cruelty towards women making them wear clothes that are so confining and hard to see out of that they actually can get run over. Talking about cutting women's fingers off for wearing nail polish and the massive rapes and torture of women. I could go on further but it is best to read the book. When women are denied medical care, this alone is horrible. It was very liberating to read about the author's escape from that barbaric regime. Thank God I have not experienced anything like that and for those who have, I feel deep sorrow.<BR>This is not an ordinary book to look at and say, well it could have been written with more literary skill etc. To do that is to miss the point.</span>

                    <span>A young woman bravely chronicles her coming-of-age under the heel of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Her life hardly begun, "Latifa" describes the effect of the harsh regime on the hopes and aspirations of a generation of young women in war-torn Afghanistan, their dreams imprisoned behind restrictive laws meant to subjugate women.<P>When the Taliban regime gained control of Afghanistan in the mid-nineties, Latifa was preparing to extend her education and pursue a career in Journalism. All that changed as Afghani women were forced to remain behind closed doors, forego careers and higher education in order to survive. The window of the world slammed shut on these women. The restrictive laws of the fundamentalist Taliban enforced secondary citizenship for Muslim women, whose faces must remain hidden at all times when in public. It is shocking to realize the unquestioning acceptance of the government of the Taliban by Western nations while ignoring the human rights of the Afghani women. So rarely do we have access to anything written about the plight of these women behind the burkas, that each small story is important, each reveals a way of life they have been forced to endure. Nothing is so powerful as the soft-spoken words from behind the veil, where sight is limited and the world obscured. Families live quietly imprisoned by the walls of their homes, shadows in contrast with the former cultural diversity and expectations they enjoyed, patiently waiting to live once more in the light of day. Latifa speaks for these women who cannot be seen or heard. She speaks with the unsophisticated voice of a young woman who still nurtures her dreams. It is time to listen.</span>

                    <span>As I was reading through the reviews I completely identified with Rachel, from Dallas, Texas. I read this memoir as an individual project for a Philosophy course. By the end of the book I was absolutely stunned how much I did not know about Islam, Afghanistan and the Taliban. I came to realize through Latifa's explanations and recounts how absolutely ignorant I was. I assumed that women in Afghanistan had been treated unfairly for centuries, and had no idea how similar life was to American life for most women and men. By the end of the book, I felt utterly guilty for thinking the way I did about Latifa's culture. I am so glad that I read this book, as it was a wonderful eye-opener.<P>I recommend it to all American women so they can understand how precious our freedoms and liberties are. Also, any person who is interested in learning more about the Islam religion would greatly appreciate this book. <P>My only complaint is that her recount is somewhat impersonal. Her memoir is more factual, when I felt she could have put a lot more of her own feelings and emotion into the book. Other than that, it is a maginifcent read.</span>
