                    <span>There are 2 ways of learning new concepts and principles:<BR>1. learn principles first, then try to use them<BR>2. observe good implementations first, then learn to appreciate the principles behind them<P>The authors successfully convince me that the 2nd way is the better way of learning a paradigm like OO. The authors first give us a little principles (Chapter 1), and then intorduce to us the good designs one by one (Part III, IV, V). While explaining these good design solutions (design patterns), authors didn't forget to stop and show us what we have been through, and the principles we can draw from our experience.<P>This is really a joyful and mind-shifting reading.<P>This book is not trying to teach you everything about design pattern and OO. But it lays a very sold foundation in your brain, and force you to think in a new perspective.<P>Of course, you should read GoF after or along with reading this one.<P>Also recommend:<BR>Craig Larman: Applying UML and Design Pattern (this book puts the things you learned into real developement process)</span>

                    <span>One of my goals is to read all the books about Design Patterns. I know, it makes a very good business for some bad writters. But not here.<BR>Honestly, when I began this book, I was just thinking about starting "Another Book to Introduce Patterns". It is. But the first thing is : it performs the job very well. Probably because the material comes from a course given by one of the author, the very nature of the patterns is very well and clearly explained, in fact the explanation outperform the one given in the GoF !! So, without any doubt, the book is O.K. for beginners, and I will recommand it as a first book on patterns (with the GoF aside ;-).<BR>The second surprise comes from unexpected thought about patterns : relationships between GoF patterns and Alexandrian patterns and about "pattern process", or how a seniormost pattern leads to a new one. It's a simple, true and new idea exposed here. Last but not least, this book make the relationship between patterns and refactoring, and idea I support for more than one year.<BR>Finally, the reading is very pleasant. So, why not 5 stars ? Well, I reserve this note for very rare books I found "nearly perfect" like the GoF itself...</span>

                    <span>These folks lead you gracefully into the very important world of software design patterns. Their book wisely explains & maps OO concepts, UML and patterns. It has a sufficient explanation of OO and UML at the outset in preparation for their brilliant patterns explanations. Their style of explaining patterns via examples and concepts is masterful. Readers with a firm Java background who are looking to understand design patterns should consider this book required reading. My background is 12 years of professional programming, 8 years of PowerBuilder, a few years of serious Java studies and a half-read UML book.</span>

                    <span>I was unable to penetrate Gamma et al before reading this book and was able to make use of Gamma et al after reading the book. Reading this book was a major breakthrough in my capacity as an object oriented programmer.<P>Clear and insightful, easy to read yet precise. If you understand the nuts and bolts of an OO language but feel you aren't quite "getting it" this book may very well get you over the hump.<P>Very highly recommended.</span>
