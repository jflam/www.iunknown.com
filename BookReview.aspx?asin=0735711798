                    <span>This is a good instructional book.  It tackles several Dreamweaver techniques and offers a good variety of time saving tips.<p>The book really stands out because of its real world application.  Almost every section can be applied to real design and development situations.  The projects are well designed and the techniques are, for the most part, easy to follow and are backed by sound design. <p>Unfortuneatly, many books in this series are very simple, "show and tells," lacking useful instruction.  That is not the case with this book. New Riders hit the target on this one.</span>

                    <span>This is my first time in here but over 15 years of doing emerging technology training.  Here is my beef:<p>1)  It is an excellent hands-on book, including its own CD, that you can practice and practice to get the feel of how you want your webpage content to be arranged in a professional manner;<p>2)  There are 13 projects to work with and their authors have thoughtfully arranged it carefully for you with the aid of required files from the book's CD and ONLY you to pick it up and go!; and<p>3)  Unfortunately, Chapter Project 3, prepared by a Brad Halstead, is arranged quite shoddy and not quite complete, if not very confusing.  You get the feeling that he did this in a hurry.  It even requested you to contact a website to get an updated snippets that was needed for this project, instead of within the enclosed CD.  The website then suggested go elsewhere and yet updated snippits were not clearly identified anywhere.  What is even worse, this idiot even left a support email address and we still have no response from him.  A note to the publisher - this was a wasted 29 pages of this remarkable book.  We had to hit another fairly decent book, "How to do everything with Dreamweaver MX", to make up for Brad's sloppiness.<p>However, I would love to see more of this "MAGIC" for other popular web development software.  Keep up the nice work!</span>

                    <span>I have been a fan of the New Riders series "Magic". This one does not fail to deliver. As with other Magic books, even if the project is not up your alley, there are so many great gems of tips and tricks that only add to your skills set.<p>Inspiration is intangiable product of this book too. Many of the projects will spark some kind imagination here.<p>Just can't recommend this book enough. Best on the market.</span>
