                <span id="Label1">Diarmaid MacCulloch wrote what is widely considered to be the authoritative account of the Reformation&#151;a critical juncture in the history of Christianity. "It is impossible to understand modern Europe without understanding these sixteenth-century upheavals in Latin Christianity," he writes. "They represented the greatest fault line to appear in Christian culture since the Latin and Greek halves of the Roman Empire went their separate ways a thousand years before; they produced a house divided." The resulting split between the Catholics and Protestants still divides Christians throughout the Western world. It affects interpretations of the Bible, beliefs about baptisms, and event how much authority is given to religious leaders. The division even fuels an ongoing war. What makes MacCulloch's account rise above previous attempts to interpret the Reformation is the breadth of his research. Rather than limit his narrative to the actions of key theologians and leaders of the era&#151;Luther, Zingli, Calvin, Loyola, Cranmer, Henry VIII and numerous popes&#151;MacCulloch sweeps his narrative across the culture, politics and lay people of Renaissance Western Europe. This broad brush approach touches upon many fascinating discussions surrounding the Reformation, including his belief that the Latin Church was probably not as "corrupt and ineffective" as Protestants tend to portray it. In fact, he asserts that it "generally satisfied the spiritual needs of the late medieval people." As a historical document, this 750-page narrative has all the key ingredients. MacCulloch, a professor of history as the Church of Oxford University, is an articulate and vibrant writer with a strong guiding intelligence. The structure is sensible&#151;starting with the main characters who influenced reforms, then spreading out to the regional concerns, and social intellectual themes of the era. He even fast forwards into American Christianity&#151;showing how this historical era influences modern times. MacCulloch is a topnotch historian&#151;uncovering material and theories that will seem fresh and inspired to Reformation scholars as well as lay readers. --<I>Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>I wasn't sure I would ever make it through this book, but it kept me interested through the three months it took me to read it.  My only recommendation is to buy the hardcover, not the paperback as I did.  First, it's a book worth keeping.  Second, the small format and tiny print of the 700 page paperback was difficult to deal with.  I would recommend this book to even casual readers of history. </span>

                    <span>Diarmaid MacCulloch is an excellent writer and story teller.  I highly recommend this book for it's broad coverage of the reformation.  
<br />
<br />Throughout the book, the reformation is viewed as a  theological power struggle that often involved preoccupations with rules that people wanted, not rules that always made rational sense.  It is true, as other reviewers have pointed out, that the book places emphasis on the ideas of the reformers and counter-reformers, which surely was important in causing such popular swings of religious viewpoint.  Additionally, the printing revolution is emphasized as a primary reason for the reformation.  The economic situation is only lightly touched on as a major factor.
<br />
<br />I personally feel that author did an outstanding job of remaining unbiased throughout this book, which is especially hard to find in history involving religious ideas.  As a Roman Catholic, I also think that the author did a tremendous job covering Catholic theology. Although it is touched on very lightly throughout this book, which is my only complaint.  Catholic theology is something that most non-Catholic journalists nearly always screw up, and for this reason, it was a pleasant surprise to find the Catholic theology outlined accurately.  
<br />
<br />This book covers the reformation period from the late 15th century to the beginning of the 18th century.  Many aspects are touched upon throughout, including the reformer's long beards.  MacCulloch brings an expert's insight to a subject that few know much about today.  A summary of the historical conclusions made by MacCulloch is found in the final pages of the book.  One such conclusion, summarized below, illustrates a common misperception about the reformation, and one that the author is quick to point out.  
<br />
<br />"We have no right to adopt an attitude of intellectual or emotional superiority, especially in the light of the atrocities that twentieth-century Europe produced because of its faith in newer, secular ideologies."

                    <span>In case you never guessed it before, the Reformation was without a doubt the single most important and influential "event" of modern European history prior to the Twentieth Century. I put "event" in quotes because clearly it is a series of events played out over more than two centuries in virtually every country of Europe. This includes clearly even those countries that remained Catholic from start to finish, as the Counter-Reformation is but the converse to those happenings in Protestant lands. Everything was connected. Diarmaid MacCulloch has written a book to help guide the reader through as many of these events and ideas as possible in a single volume. Reformation: Europe's House Divided is an aptly titled work that makes clear the wide-ranging and profound impact that the Reformation had on Western Civilization as a whole.
<br />
<br />That said, there is much to consider in perusing this work. MacCulloch's expertise is never in doubt, but the reader's grasp of the material may well be. As other editorials have mentioned, he passes through ideas, places, and events at sometimes breathtaking speed. Although the material is broken down into sections and chapters, I still had the feeling of trying to focus on many spots at once in a moving kaleidoscope. The reader without some knowledge of things will be at a serious disadvantage. This is not so much even a historical problem as a theological one. Some historical fields require more subject matter knowledge than others, and religious history, particularly the theological history that MacCulloch presents, certainly is one such field. I've never personally regretted having essentially no religious background of my own, but reading this book made me come close as I tried to sort out what the fuss was about. What MacCulloch assumes more than a basic historical knowledge of Early Modern Europe is a basic knowledge of Church doctrine, either Protestant or Catholic, as both are still more similar than they are different. A true armchair historian should not shy away from MacCulloch over this, but neither should the casual reader assume that anyone can dive into this material. I did not find MacCulloch's style to be especially engaging, even if it was eloquent.
<br />
<br />There is another curious lack that MacCulloch seems to perpetuate throughout most of the text. While he explains, I'm pretty sure well, what the theological points of difference are, he never quite brings alive why it was enough to create such a violent split. If nothing else is clear, it is that the hatreds and conflicts brought about by the Reformation were extremely, excessively violent. The carnage of the Thirty Years war was only the most notable of many specific acts of warfare and violence that went on. Near the end he makes the comment that modern readers should have no right to criticize the participants over this, because Twentieth Century ideologies have produced suffering as bad or worse. This strikes me as a bit of a cop-out, not only historically but morally as well. Historically, there must have been some issues within religious tradition that made so many people so willing and even eager to spill blood by the barrel over what is essentially scriptural interpretation. But what are they? Regarding MacCulloch's comparison to modern day horrors, I don't accept his assertion. Firstly, contemporary ideologies have dealt with real-world ideas about the ordering of society, and everyone's life is affected by such things. This is not the case with the Reformation. MacCulloch's sometimes excessive focus on theology makes it clear that theology is what was at stake. While explaining the principal actors' intellectual paths, he never tries to explain their emotional evolution. And secondly, how many modern readers in the Western world are unwilling to condemn the horrors of our own bloody decades as much or more than those of the Reformation era? MacCulloch is trying to evade the issue here, and I at least have noticed this.
<br />
<br />It's unfortunate that the issues most worth writing about concern MacCulloch's negatives, because despite all this Reformation is still clearly an exceptional piece of work. Even if the reader flounders about a bit as I did, it is floundering put to good use. Giving the book even part of the attention it deserves will increase the unfamiliar reader's understanding of these times greatly, and I suspect it would read as a magnificent epic to those readers familiar with and caring about Church history. There is, for those interested, something here for everyone.

                    <span>At over 700 pages, it's hard to summarize a book that covers almost every person and event surrounding the religious upheaval that shook Europe from 1490-1500; in fact, it's impossible, and the best that can be done is highlight some of the information contained in this valuable, albeit long, work.   Author Diarmaid MacCullogh presents the chronology of the `Reformation' to be sure, but provides welcome digressions to paint a vivid picture of what life was like both for the movers and shakers (Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Charles V) as well as the common person (the last part of the book deals with marriage and sex and how religious changes affected these matters).  To say that this book is an `exhaustive' study is an understatement: from Transylvania to Poland, from the `Atlantic Isles' (Britain and Ireland) to the `New World' of the Americas, we see the changes Protestantism brings, as well as the reaction and Counter-Reformation of the Catholic Church. One of the best parts of this book is really detailing the differences between the competing Protestant theologies of Luther and Calvin, something important that a general view of this movement sometimes glosses over. Some interesting facts: Poland had, at one point, over 34 denominations in its Commonwealth; Transylvania was a progressively Reformed area that had Protestants from all over Europe traveling there to study its theology; some Anglicans believe they did indeed `reform' the Catholic Church and are really the `true' Catholic faith!  England is emphasized extensively in the book, and the author makes a good point in why: besides an island's isolation, England's reformation really stopped in 1559 with Elizabeth I; from then on, a `high' church or `reformed' church was debated, but nothing else really changed, causing breakaway groups such as the Puritans and Quakers to leave for New England.  It is interesting to note that Thomas More, the martyr of Catholicism during Henry VIII's reign, is barely mentioned, which is surprising, all things considered.  However, lesser known persons, such as the "Learned Maid of Utrecht" who taught at a university in a time when women did not receive a higher education, are mentioned.  Again, it's hard to include everything MacCullogh relates in this book, and even he resorts to citing previous chapters to remind the reader of important points covered.  This is well-worth reading, but only if you have a good idea of the basics of the Reformation beforehand; otherwise, you will find you head filled with too much new information!</span>

                    <span>Most people think of "the Reformation" as a movement that began with Martin Luther's 95 Theses.  This book, however, describes an overall "reformation" movement (1400-1700 AD/CE) taking place before, during and after Luther.  Luther is the catalyst giving things sharper focus, however many political, cultural and religious factors beyond Luther were also in play.  This book chronicles, in great detail, these religious developments and struggles within both Protestant and Catholic factions throughout Europe, and how they interacted with and shaped each other.  The book also examines these currents as they spill over into North and South America, with continuing effects to the present day.
<br />
<br />This book is very detailed and comprehensive but is a bit "dry" reading for the non-academic reader.  Since it covers such an extensive body of material, it also gives cursory treatment to the things discussed.  (I personally felt that more extensive discussion of Luther and his writings would be appropriate.)  However, the book is useful to gain an overview of the significant names, places, and events of the entire reformation period, from which one can then seek other more in-depth material. </span>
