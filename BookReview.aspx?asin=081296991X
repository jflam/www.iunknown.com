                    <span>What a terrific, thrilling read! Perrottet, who also wrote the book Pagan Holiday, is absolutely peerless when it comes to vibrant, visceral - and hilarious - evocations of the ancient world. If it's historical education you're after you'll get it here, too, as the book contains a wealth of information about the rituals and customs of the period, but there's nothing dry or academic about it. The Naked Olympics is fast-paced, funny, sublimely raunchy, and even adrenaline-rush inducing - like the original Olympics it so colorfully depicts. Too bad teachers don't assign books like this Western Civ classes!</span>

                    <span>I heard the author interviewed on NPR radio recently, and was intrigued. This book is much more than just about the Olympics -- it recreates the whole pagan world, in all its strangeness and human detail (which makes sense, as sports was only one part of that great festival -- there were literary events, artistic events, and plenty of boozing -- maybe that explains why there's more about sex in the book than athletics!). It's ideal for anyone interested in ancient history -- the past really springs to life from its pages!</span>

                    <span>More than just the Olympics, also a fast tour of Hellenic society. Perrottet is good not just on the details of the games but also on the role of the games in the Hellenic world.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book, as with Perrottet's other two books, never fails to both entertain and teach. If all history was as accessible as this, perhaps we would all be keener on history. In helping me learn the naked truths about the Olympics (yes the original athletes went in the buff), I'll certainly enjoy this summer's ones. A Great READ--well worth it!!! Funny and smart, light but learned.</span>

                    <span>Very enjoyable I thought. probably the perfect primer for this summer's Olympics in Athens Greece. I wish I was going, but no matter how exciting they are in august they won't be able to compare to the ancient version. The Greeks not only used to perform nude (hence the title) but the whole thing was a five day party, with cheap wine, dodgy sausages, and plenty of sex on the sidelines. The author's style is light and witty, but he's obviously done his homework. Great popular history!</span>
