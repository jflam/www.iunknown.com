                    <span>I started to learn this course at the beginning of this semester and I just brought this book from Amazon in August.
<br />I had no introductory course before but I was so curious about this subject so I am taking this graduate level course.
<br />Now, I am in chapter 10, and I would like to give a review of this book.
<br />This book is well organized, from the beginning to the end.
<br />I have read almost each word in this book(including the extra ones in the box), and I would like to say: It is worth to do that.
<br />Although sometimes the sentences are not very clear(maybe because I am an international student), but almost all the ideas are precious. So, please be patient when you are reading.
<br />Trust me, if you do not have any related course before, you need time for it. but if you can understand all the contents in this book, and if you are more energetic, finishing most of the exercise with excalmatory marks, you will find your mind becomes so clear that is beyond your imagination.
<br />For the tests, if there are some in your class, is only a half piece of cake. you will feel 100 points is just for the left hand(given the condition that you are a right-hander). :)
<br />If you buy an international version, prepare to visit the book's website. and I will say this second edition seems to me the -1th edition because it contains all the errors listed on the website. Prepare you pen and become a co-auther of the book.
<br />If you feel you need to improve your mathematics, take it, because reading this book can improve your mathematical thinking and proof ability tremendously.
<br />If you feel all the course in your university is too easy and can not match your intelligence, take it, then you will find something interesting.</span>

                    <span>The first edition is one of the best book in its field. A classic. A reference for many advanced courses in computer theory.<p>Sadly, the second edition misses a great deal of the first edition. Many chapters were removed. Important lemmas and theorems are missing.<p>I would gladly exchange my second edition for the first one, if it wasn't out of print.<p>J.</span>

                    <span>This was my textbook for an introductory course on Finite Automata and Languages - I enjoyed it a lot and I think that the chapters until the Turing Machines are covered very well, along with good examples. As one previous reviewer has already mentioned, the exercises can get very hard as compared to what's actually presented - this I found not too good.<p>The topics of complexity classes and NP-Completeness, as well as the chapter on Turing Machines are rather succint and do not cover the full depth. Papadimitriou's "Computational Complexity" does a better job in this respect, even though it is not at all flawless. Some might say that there is a reason why this book is introductory, but I argue that instead of doing a poor job, the authors should have maybe just made another book dealing with the above-mentioned topics.<p>PS: My professor told me that the first edition was much better - maybe you could find it somewhere in the library, if interested.</span>

                    <span>As a student using this book, I simply found it a little too difficult at times to grasp what the concepts were.  The examples, at times were just too complicated, and could have been done better with easy to understand examples.  Not so sure about this one.  However, if you are already tamed in automata theory concepts, I'm sure you'll love it.</span>

                    <span>Hopcroft's book is a very good introduction to the theory of computing, from finite automata to undecidability.  He introduces the text with a crash course in proofs, which is useful for a text of this nature.  They have several examples with illustrations to facilitate quicker learning of deterministic finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines.  These illustrations proved very helpful for me, a visual learner.  The book itself is chock full of examples and theorems with proofs.  Problems with the book: more explanation on Homomorphisms would be nice.  The exercises can get very much harder than the simple material the book teaches, so running through them takes considerable amount of time often.  Overall it's a good book, and a lot easier to understand than their first edition in 1979.  The material can at times seem a bit outdated since the computing world has changed by several orders of magnitude since their original work, but it still provides a solid foundation in the philosophy and mathematics of computing.  Perhaps if you're a Cornell student you'll get the privilege of taking this theory class with Hopcroft as your instructor; he's very nice and willing to help students understand the material.</span>
