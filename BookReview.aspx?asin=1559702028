                    <span>I have always had an interest in the Holocaust, but until I read this book some fourteen years ago, it had always remained at a distance.<P>A reputable colleague at work handed me a copy of this book and said 'this is worth a read'. <P>Having begun, I could not put the book down. The book gripped me from start to finish. The story is horrific but, nevertheless, it is a story that we all owe it to ourselves to be familiar with.<P>The story and the author's experiences were so profound and penetrating that I have spent the last fourteen years studying and reading as much about the Holocaust as I can. I have visited the Concentration Camps at Treblinka, Majdanek, Auschwitz, Birkenau and Plaszov, together with other areas in Poland directly connected with the Jewish Holocaust. I have seen the buildings full of human hair from the Jewish victims, the gas chambers, crematoria and the other hideous instruments of mass murder referred to in this book.<P>The book by Dr. Miklos Nyiszli will not take you long to finish. The voices of the victims referred to have long since disappeared. Many people today are not even aware of the Holocaust and others deny it's very existence. Books like these, written by people who were actually there, are essential if our this and forthcoming generations are to be made aware of "man's inhumanity to man" and to prevent such a horror from occurring again.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Miklos Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jew, was carted off to Auschwitz along with the rest of his family sometime in early 1944. He volunteered to be the assistant to Dr. Josef Mengele--the so-called "Angel of Death"--because he was a doctor and had very good insight into pathology. He was a Sonderkommando, a man of the living dead that did the disgusting job of disposing of the bodies of gas chamber victims. In Nyiszli's case, he was given a pathologist's job of performing autopsies on freshly killed cadavers. Miraculously, he survived the terrors of the camp because Mengele refused to have him killed (all Sonderkommandos were killed after four months and replaced by others, for the SS wanted no survivors to tell tales) for there were very few doctors who were as good and skilled as Nyiszli. Therefore, he wrote about all of his experiences in this book after he was a free man. However, I have found that Nyiszli's book is just another account of the sadistic ordeals that the inmates of Auschwitz went through. If you are well-read in the history of the Holocaust, then you too may find this statement to be true. In other words, there is not much in here that has already been written about it, even though this book was one of the first to come out on the subject. Aside from that, Nyiszli's book is excellently written: it reads like a fast pacing novel in which you find yourself at the start, and in the next moment, you are at the end.</span>

                    <span>I would actually give this book 4 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.<P>What could be more realistic than terror through the eyes of a person who lived it? As one reads the book, it's difficult to understand that such a thing really happened.<P>It's a fairly short book, but it tells enough to get its point across. It's not a history of Auschwitz. It is simply one man's experiences while trying to survive. I certainly don't blame him for his part in the cruelties. He did what he had to do to live, day by day.<P>I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the cruelties inflicted upon the "undesirables" of Europe.</span>

                    <span>The things this man saw day after day, what he had to do under the terrible circumstances. Heartwrenching, yet something everyone should know in order for this to never be repeated, ever.<P>It was a well written book, hard to put down. I couldn't even imagine having to live through was he did.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in an afternoon. It was a quick read. Horrific and graphic in detail. The Dr. in question is sent to Auchwitz in 1944 and he spends a year in Nazi camps. He is well known for his personal observation of the Nazi Doctor Mengele. He details the 'experiments' and also explains the camp structure(his privilidged position allowed him to circulate freely and he had access to camp records and the S.S). This book is an important document in Holocaust literature. Yet it raises many questions. This man collaborated with the Nazis to survive. He does nto detail the true nature of Mengeles crimes. Instead he seems to whitewash the horror and torture infliced upon innocents. I felt that he was not telling the whole story, maybe it was too horrific. He leaves some questions to be explained, but his book is full of details.</span>
