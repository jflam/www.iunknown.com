                    <span>I purchased this Windows Server 2003 encyclopedia and think it's absolutely great.  It has everything covered from the basics to the in-depth configuration of the operating system.  I bought this book because I did not have any working knowledge of Win2k3 and took on the task of designing and implementing a school computer lab network with it.  Needless to say, this reference book has been invaluable to me throughout the process.  The CD-ROM media of the book makes it real easy to do a quick search on anything.  I was able to deploy the WinXP Pro client workstations and my Win2k3 server all on my own!  Pretty neat.

                    <span>I spend too much money on technical books so I try to find books with the included eBook so that I can read the book anywhere (including my PDA), anytime and not pack the HUGE books around. This eBook will not work without the CD so I can't use the book on my PDA. I don't share the books or CDs with others but I do like to have the reference material at home, laptop and at work. I will take this into consideration for future book purchases.</span>

                    <span>This book has a lot of pages full of the obvious, but not enough detail on the difficult issues to be of any real trouble shooting value.  I get far more valuable information from the help menus within Server 2003. </span>

                    <span>Completely disappointed.  I honestly don't understand what the raves are for this book. The chapters are dense, it's very difficult to follow, and try to find something when you need it I dare you. It's like Minasi doesn't know how to articulate himself. I found myself wishing he'd get to the point. And what's with all the coverage of Windows for Workgroups and other archaic OSes. Does anyone use Windows for Workgroups?</span>
