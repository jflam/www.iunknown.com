                    <span>This book was o.k. it's not something that u should run to the store and buy.  It's very predictable and it's the urban life u have read before.  I give it 2 stars just for trying.  Read someone else's book before u read this one.</span>

                    <span>I wasn't going to review this book because I was tired of giving less than great reviews, but I changed my mind. This is a good book. The problem with me is that so many authors are running into the category of read one read them all. I could easily guess in the beginning of the book that she was going to end up liking her man's friend. After reading book after book, I am looking for something I haven't read before. Not a remake of another novel, add a little, subtract a little.  I have just become bored lately, until I read The Preacher's Son. That was a  literary breath of fresh air. 
<br />
<br />These street books are original and bring something different to the table: Coldest Winter Ever, B-More Carful, How Can I Be Down, Street Dreams, just to name a few. These were original storylines that knock you off your feet. I am so sick of mediocore readings. In 2005, I am only finishing the great books. I normally finish books just because I started them. The getting by reads are going to the side unless I am bored. </span>

                    <span>From page 1 this was an EXCELLENT read. Someone recommended this book to me and I wasn't too sure...glad I went against my conscience and read it anyway.
<br />The story revolves around Celeste, her salon and her stylists. And did I forget the love triangle between Celeste, her man and his sexy best friend. And did I forget to mention that her man is married. The story is ripe with drama - it's set in and outside of a beauty salon. Ladies you know how it is in the salon!!!! 
<br />A good read...I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>The book was ok, not a real page turner but not a bad book either. It was comical the way it really gave insight on the salons in the hood and the player in most men, topping it off with the envy and jelousy of women. I liked  the authors stlye of writing. She did a very good job!</span>
