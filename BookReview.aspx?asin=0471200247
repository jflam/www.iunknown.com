                    <span>This book simply is the best data warehouse book in the market, and an absolute must-read if you are in Data Warehouse field.  The best part about this book is that it's not hogged down with technical non-sense, and it's quite easy to read and understand.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>After six years of creating data warehouse applications, making a plethora of mistakes and learning stuff the hard way, I wish I had had this book at the start! Every other page offers a solution to some problem or other that I have had. In the project I am just starting I am facing new challenges and am finding help with them as well. The best part is how solutions I used in the past which were appropriate for those problems are contrasted with solutions for problems like the ones I am facing now. Almost as bad as solving a problem the wrong way (or overlooking it entirely) is reusing an old solution that does not fit the new problem. This book clearly spells out when each solution is appropriate. I can not speak too highly about how useful this book will be for you!</span>

                    <span>Data Warehousing is more of an art than a science - but then again what isn't?<p>There isn't a standard blueprint that can come close to solving most data issues. Data Warehousing (DW) involves constant tweaking and the goal of good DW project management is minimizing the associated operational cost.<p>I have been a fan of Ralph Kimball as he writes as a person who has been through many implementations. With Mr. Kimball there isn't a miracle cure being touted - stay away from publications that claim such a cure.<p>Mr. Kimball approached the subject with good advices and encourages the readers to watch out for the pitfalls and follow best-practices in design implementation. It is similar to working with a well experienced supervisor.<p>The core to successful DW implementations is - LISTENING. Listening to the users on their needs and gauging the software resources available at your disposal.<p>Trade-offs in design versus cost/performance are a must. You will never have all the resources you need to implement the DW of your dreams. And if you did, chances are very high that once the DW is ready for use the business cases have changed making the design redundant.<p>Mr. Kimball will help in passing these information and much more. It also goes in good technical detail for suggested modeling of data. <p>I hope this review is helpful, please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.</span>

                    <span>I was undecided if I should buy this book after having read the first edition, but I'm happy I did. <br>The second edition updates many of the concepts contained in the first and includes some new chapters on hot topics like CRM and Telecommunications (which is the most important sector for dw at least here in Italy where I live). <br>I think that Kimball books are everything that's needed to design good, robust and flexible data warehouses, and this book maintains his high quality standards.</span>
