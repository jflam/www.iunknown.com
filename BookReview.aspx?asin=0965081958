                    <span>Mr. Jan Axelson must be laughing by making fool of them who bought this book to learn something about USB. On the cover page author states "host code in Visual Basic and Visual C++". How people can lie up to this extend? There is no source code at all but just a function description which you can find by just pressing F1 with C++. I think you will find more information yourself than reading this bull... . It is just waste of Money. </span>

                    <span>The USB protocol is a completely different animal than the simple protocol of yore, the serial port, that it is designed to replace. Why? Becasue it is orders of magnitude more complicated. The idea that you will know and understand USB completely by just reading a book of this size is simply laughable. 
<br />
<br />But the complete in the book's title doesn't even really claim to make a USB master out of you anyway: it simply refers to the fact that following the information in this book, you will succeed in building a USB enabled peripheral and access it using VB and device drivers supplied by Windows 98.
<br />
<br />The book first imparts upon you a basic knowledge of USB and once you are fairly knowledgeable about that, it then ventures to show you how to use commercially available off-the-shelf USB controller chips, available from Cypress and other manufacturers, and how to program them for use in your own USB peripheral. 
<br />
<br />At this stage in your USB career, it would be nearly impossible for you to build a USB enabled peripheral without the help of these USB controllers, since it'll take you at least a year to fully absorb all of USB before you could be in a situation to even attempt doing so. USB is really that complicated my friend, trust me.
<br />
<br />Using these specialized USB controllers in your design, shields you from the complexities of USB's intricacies and having bypassed them, you can focus on getting the job done i.e. building your USB peripheral.
<br />
<br />Now, once you have successfully built your first USB enabled peripheral, using USB controllers, as taught to you in this book, you can then take all the time in the world that you need and incrementally learn more and more about USB using for example, a tool like a USB protocol analyzer to really get to know USB intimately, inside and out.</span>

                    <span>I couldn't believe the negative comments on this excellent book, especially the ones that harp on it not being 'complete'. I've read the other USB books (and hate several), but Axelson's book is by far the best. It's not an idiots or dummys guide, but I'm not sure that idiots or dummys have what it takes to do USB develoment anyway. You want 'complete', get the unbelievably dense specification from the USB.org folks, thumb thru that for a couple of minutes and you'll love Axelson's book. Lighten up on the gal, she did an exceptional job on a difficult subject. </span>

                    <span>This isn't the first time I've seen this assumption, but having been on mailing lists with Ms. Axelson, I can tell you Jan is a she, not a he, as the previous overly negative reviewer said.  "Complete" comes from the title of a previous book by this author on RS-232.  Admittedly, that term is probably over-reaching, but it beats Intel's lousy "DBE" on USB.</span>

                    <span>This book (and his others) do not cover things from a "complete" standpoint. If you are looking for a book to help you design hardware from scratch THIS IS NOT IT. All hardware and references to hardware are for off-the-shelf demo boards or OEM products. This book is more about writing software for *existing* hardware.</span>
