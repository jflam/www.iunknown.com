                    <span>It has been a while since I've done much with IIS, but this book got me up to speed very quickly with the latest features of IIS 6.  Mitch has a very lucid writing style that makes the material easy to read.  If you are looking for a comprehensive tutorial on IIS, I would highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I look to a lot of different resources when I study something. This one was fairly good but not the best. I think it is a good start but I have found better books on IIS 6.</span>

                    <span>I have enjoyed Mitch's writing style since I found his Administering IIS 4 book here on Amazon.com. He writes in such a way that technical books are very easy to comprehend and everything flows with the right amount of screen snaps.<p>He has covered a lot in this book which includes a very detailed section on how to install both Windows 2003 and IIS using a lot of different methods which works well if you have one server to a farm of 100's of servers.<p>The standard things you would expect from an IIS book are here, creating sites and virtual directories and these are explained clearly and concisely. A chapter is included on securing IIS which covers NTFS file and directory permissions and how these integrate with the IIS permissions. He also explains the different IIS authentication methods and application pool identities, and SSL. <p>There is some very good information Performance tuning and monitoring and a good section on the IIS Metabase (IIS configuration now in XML) and how to interface with it from the command line using ADSI and WMI Scripts.<p>Overall I think that this book would help anyone who has to work on an IIS server and even if you have administered IIS before you will get value from it. I would rate it 4.5 stars but since I can not I will give it 5 stars. Level Basic to Intermediate<p>Chris Crowe...</span>

                    <span>Mitch does it again, every book he puts out just gets better and better and this book has it all!  Having worked with IIS for over 4 years I didn't expect to lean much (we all know it all don't we?).... I was wrong!  This book has ranges from Screen Cap's and diagrams to a full break down of the metabase, NTFS permissions needed and even the dreaded Front Page extensions.  If you are new to IIS or have been around the block, this book is a definite must have for the work bench!</span>
