                    <span>This is a collection of some of the most beautiful and masterfully composed portraits I've seen. McCurry is a National Geographic photographer and almost every page in the book could be a cover photo. Many photos of interesting faces from India, Chad, Nepal, Afghanistan, Philippines, China, Mali, Tibet, and (a few of the most interesting) Los Angeles. Small format photos (about 5x7). Photos are printed full page (to each edge of the page) on the right-hand side, and opposite each photo is printed the city, country and year the photo was taken. Photos lack commentary or descriptions and are not categorized, but I found this rather nice. Page turns are often new locations, and the lack of commentary leaves interpretation to the imagination. Just look into the eyes of the subjects and you'll start to feel their story. Great book -- too bad it's so small. It's got a spot on the coffee table nonetheless.</span>

                    <span>A thick book of the pictures taken by the prolific Steve McCurry. The title is "portraits" so the theme will be more often than not of people's faces. Their expressions, their feelings at the moment of the shot, their life, where they are, and where they've been.<P>Many of these photographs are striking, and if you like to travel you can do the same as McCurry does here. I would have liked a small caption about some of the people that were in this collection. Who are they? What is their story? Obviously it isn't always possible or necessary to collect the facts and tid-bits about subjects, but at times it would have added something to the colorful photos of these folks. <P>Those who've followed McCurry and love photography likely have high expectations, and may feel that they should get more from "portraits." With "Portraits" and its' beautiful photos of these residents of the world (primarily Asia), you can enjoy and respect McCurry's work. One postscipt, is that one of his most renown pictures, of the girl on the cover, (she) was found and interviewed over twenty years later.</span>

                    <span>This book has been a bit of a dissapointment. I'm very interested in travelling and all the photography related to travel and people. Therefore, I buy anything related to it and I owned a good collection of this kind of books.<P>My impression is that Steve McCurry's work is a bit overrated. Some of the photographs contained in this book are excellent but many others are just plain and nothing special. There are some other photographers who are much better and not so well known as Mr. McCurry.<P>After a while, it becomes quite boring to peruse through this particular book. Asia has plenty of great moments and people to photograph. I've seen amateur pictures much better than the ones showed here. So it has not impressed me at all.<P>He is always going to be remembered by his pic of the Afghanistan girl. I have to thank him for that brilliant and unforgettable one!!!</span>

                    <span>I gave this book a 4 star review because the book would have been better if it were a coffee table size book, and that I wish there would have been stories next to the images just like most phaidon books do. Steve McCurry is a excellent photographer, he carries the emotions of the people in the potraits...too bad it's all in 5x7" format.</span>
