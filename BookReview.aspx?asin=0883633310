                <span id="Label1">Editor's introduction<br>Michelangelo Buonarroti achieved such renown in his lifetime that he was widely known and celebrated as  Il Divino, or the Divine One.  In 500 years, his fame has scarcely diminished.  Michelangelo is generally recognized as one of the greatest artists of all time, a universal genius in all fields of visual creativity-sculpture, painting, and architecture-as well as a widely admired poet.   <P><b>Accessible to readers-useful to specialists</b>Much has been written on Michelangelo.  By 1970, the number of scholarly books and articles exceeded 4,000, approximately a tenth in English.  In the past 25 years, the literature has grown exponentially, with a notable increase in English-language publications. This five-volume series reproduces some 100 articles in English, selected from a broad range of books and journals.  The collection is both accessible to the general reader and useful to the specialist, offering a representative sample of old and new commentary on the artist and his work.  <P><b>Close to 100 photographs in each volume</b>This collection also presents the artwork which illustrated the books and articles from which it is drawn-some 500 black-and-white photographs in all.  <P><b>Offer scholarship and creative thinking</b>These volumes  introduce the reader to a wide range of scholarship and some of the best minds in the discipline, including Johannes Wilde, Erwin Panofsky, Charles de Tolnay, Rudolf Wittkower, Edgar Wind, and James Ackerman.  The volumes offer easy access to an immense and widely scattered literature, much of it difficult to locate.  The collection will be especially useful to scholars, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates.  As journals become prohibitively expensive, and as materials are increasingly moved to storage facilities, this collection will prove a welcome addition to general and specialized art libraries.  <P><b>The career of a genius</b>Articles are arranged chronologically with separate volumes covering the artist's early life and works, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, commissions associated with San Lorenzo, the tomb of Julius II and other Roman projects, and a final volume devoted to drawings, poetry, and miscellaneous studies.  Spanning his entire 89-year life, the articles explore Michelangelo's prodigious creativity as an artist, thinker, and poet. The sheer quantity of what has been written on Michelangelo can be intimidating; most students have little sense of how to approach or effectively utilize the vast literature.  By presenting a varied introduction to a great artist, this collection is a handy reference tool for a wide array of topics, problems, and literature. Individual volumes available:  <P><b> Vol. 1 Life and Early Works</b><br>544 pages, ISBN 0-8153-1823-5  <P><b>Vol. 2 The Sistine Chapel</b><br>616 pages, ISBN 0-8153-1825-1  <P><b>Vol. 3 San Lorenzo</b><br>496 pages, ISBN0-8153-1826-X  <P><b> Vol. 4 Tomb of Julius II and Other Works in Rome</b><br>488 pages, ISBN 0-8153-1827-8  <P><b>Vol. 5 Drawings, Poetry, and Miscellaneous Studies</b>472 pages, ISBN 0-8153-1826-8</span>

                    <span>MICHELANGELO: THE COMPLETE SCULPTURE, PAINTING, ARCHITECTURE is one of those books that would be a generous addition to any art/art history lover's library. This very large scaled volume is meant to be about the visual and not the stuffy, thesis-driven, dry tome words of biography. William Wallace has excellent credentials as a writer and his style of writing is warm, thoughtful, insightful, and informative. He has elected to begin his book with an abbreviated biography, knowing that most people know the general facts about Michelangelo's life, and then presents the artists' output in sections of scultpure, painting, and architecture. It is said that Michelangelo never considered himself a painter, despite his glory in the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. It is his sculpture for which he wished to be known and surely there are few extant examples of heroic sculpture that are in his rarefied league. The reproductions of the frescoes are color correct and the sculptures are captured with excellent photographic drama. For those who wish to know more about the writings and sonnets of Michelangelo as well as the contorversies that colored his life, then look elsewhere among the many books available. But for sheer joy of turning page after beautiful page that document Michelangelo's genius, then look no further. A perfect gift for yourself and for those who care about art.</span>

                    <span>If you are doing a research paper on Michelangelo, look elsehere. This book is all about the pictures, most of which fill the entire page (and this is a tall book). The text is fairly informative and a light read but really doesn't make that much of an impression. Just buy it to marvel at the stunning skill of one of the greatest artists who ever lived.</span>

                    <span>The strength of this book is the excellent photographs, showing each work from a variety of angles so you can really appreciate the complexity of the sculpture. The commentaries are well written and straightforward. Having read the previous review, I read the Anthony Hughes book too and found its commentaries more complex--well, anyway,more opionated!--but its tiny pictures can't compare to the splendors in this book. Short of a trip to Italy, it was the next best thing!</span>

                    <span>The book is fairly well-written (perhaps a bit too simple), but some of the plates are somewhat disappointing. Also, the author omits the two paintings in the National Gallery, London (one of which, the Entombment, is accepted as a genuine Michelangelo by most scholars). I would recommend instead the book by Anthony Hughes, published by Phaidon.</span>
