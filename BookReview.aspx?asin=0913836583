                <span id="Label1"><P>This book is a general account of the doctrine, worship and life of Orthodox Christians by the author of the now classic The Orthodox Church. It raises the basic issues of theology: God is hidden yet revealed; the problem with evil; the nature of salvation; the meaning of faith; prayer; death and what lies beyond.  In so doing, it helps to fill the need for modern Orthodox catechism.  Yet this book is not a mere manual, a dry-as-dust repository of information.  Throughout the book, Bishop Kallistos Ware shows the meaning of Orthodox doctrine for the life of the individual Christian.  Doctrinal issues are seen not as abstract propositions for theological debate but as affected the whole of life.    <P>A wealth of texts drawn from theologians and spiritual writers of all ages accompanies Bishop Kallistos&#39 presentation. They too reveal Orthodoxy not just as a system of beliefs, practices and customs but indeed as the Way.</span>

                    <span>Orthodoxy can be a difficult subject for Protestants and Catholics to understand. This is due to the Western, compared to the Eastern approach in viewing Christianity. While the west generally likes things in neat rational-concrete catagories, the east is generally able to except the mystery of God and focus their efforts in that area.<P>Bishop Kallistos Ware, a Protestant Convert to Orthodxy, has written this book in a very easy-to-read style. He writes concisely (maybe at times to concise) which does not overburden the average Western reader. I would have personnaly like a little more in-depth analysis in certain areas, but this was not his purpose. It has caused me to study some ideas even more and I think that may have been the purpose. To give a clear meaning aboutthis cherished religion, and for those who desire further study, to do so.<P>All the chapters are well written: God as Trinity, creation, man, spirit, prayer, and eternity. At times trying to understand the view point may be difficult, but this is due to a cultural make-up in approaching philosophy and theology. An outstanding text.</span>

                    <span>"The Orthodox Way," by Bishop Kallistos Ware is the second most frequently recommended book on Eastern Orthodoxy in the English language to date, and the top book specifically on Orthodox Christian spirituality. (The number one book on Orthodoxy is his classic work, "The Orthodox Church," published under his given name, Timothy Ware.<P>I first read an earlier edition of "The Orthodox Way" many years ago as an Evangelical Christian, shortly after I began looking into the Orthodox Church. At that time it communicated to me that something profoundly spiritual was going on in this church of "smells and bells," robes and formal liturgical worship. It introduced me to the mystery of God, and made me realize that it was important to spend less energy talking about and trying to understand God, and to spend more time getting to know him in prayer. This is where I first encountered the idea that theology in the strict sense of the word is "the contemplation of God himself."<P>It was this book that explained the importance of the Trinity, not only as part of the Nicene Creed, but that God has been Trinity since before the book of Genesis, and a proper understanding of him will drive how we commune with him. My first reading introduced me to new terms and concepts: apophatic approach (saying what God is not rather than what he is), apatheia (dispassion), passion (any disordered appetite or longing that takes possession of the soul), nous (spiritual intellect), nepsis (watchfulness, sobriety and wakefulness), theosis (deified, or "christified," or "made sharers of the divine nature" [2 Peter 1:4]), and the difference between the "essence" and "energies" of God.<P>Now, seven years after I began "checking out" the Orthodox Church, and four years after coming home to Orthodoxy, I found myself rereading this volume (revised edition) and discovering how much went right over my head. This time I paid closer attention to the many quotes from liturgical texts, Church Fathers, saints, mystics, monks, historians and theologians. It made me appreciate how much Bishop Kallistos is writing from a rich tradition, that has become my tradition, and how that this Orthodox way, is The Spiritual Way. For fear that this last statement may sound sectarian, it should be noted that this volume has been endorsed by a number leaders and authors outside of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.<P>God wants all to come to know him, and this volume can introduce the reader to a Way that is well mapped out, but sadly, not often traveled. May God grant me the ability follow this way more closely.<P>On a closing note, at the time I write this review, Mel Gibson's film "The Passion of the Christ" is in the theaters, and causing many to discuss the significance of Jesus' death on the cross. "The Orthodox Way" has perhaps the best brief summary of what Jesus accomplished by his passion and death on the cross, not to mention his birth, life, teachings and resurrection, which are all part of the story.</span>

                    <span>Bishop Kallistos Ware does an excellent job of offering the reader a modern Orthodox catechism. The book presents theology in a way that is never stuffy and always enlightening. Non Orthodox readers will be impressed by the similarities of the basic trinitarian theology of the Orthodox church and other branches of Christianity whether it be Roman Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, etc. However, readers from other traditions will be challenged by the depth of mysticism in Orthodoxy and the emphasis on a serious relationship with God this side of heaven. Eastern Orthodoxy has a message for the rest of Christianity and this book delivers it well.</span>

                    <span>If anyone has read Ware's book, The Orthodox Church, then this book is a must read. For those who haven't read Ware's introductory work on Orthodoxy, this book will still be enlightening and rewarding. <P>Bishop Ware's main purpose in this book is to introduce the reader to the more salient and deeper teachings of the Orthdox Christian faith. Ware begins by arguing that God is an ineffable and incomprehensible mystery that cannot be understood by the human mind. This squares well with traditional Eastern teaching, but not so well with Western paradigms. The Orthodox believe that God's Essence and Uncreated Divine Energies are two distinct and separate concepts, whereas the West, following after Augustine, believe that God's essence and energy are one and the same. Therefore, the Orthodox believe that God in His essence is completely mysterious and unknowable by man, but God's energies may be perceived and understood. Also, the Orthodox employ a different method in order to understand and know God called the apophatic approach. This method states that one can know something about God by understanding what God is not. I think this is a valuable method and one that needs to be utilized more by Christians of a Western mindset. <P>Next Ware deals with the traditional Orthodox understanding of God as Trinity. Ware argues that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in essence but consist as three separate persons. Nothing really new or groundbreaking here, but Ware does an admirable job of defending the traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity. The area where many will disagree with him is on the issue of the procession of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox believe that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as Jesus says in John 15:26, whereas the West holds that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Ware argues that to hold that the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son can have disastrous consequences by leading one to confuse the distinctive characteristics possessed by each Divine person. Also, he believes that since such an idea was a later unauthorized addition to the creed, and not argued for by the Eastern Fathers of the Church it is to be rejected. Finally, Ware deals with the subject of God as creator and God in relation to man. Once again, one won't find to much disagreement between traditional Eastern teaching and Western teaching, but there are a few differences. The Orthodox have a completely different understanding of original sin. They believe that mankind is not guilty of Adam and Eve's sin since they can only be guilty of that transgression, but that we all bear the consequences of their disobedience. Since the human race exists as a corporate solidarity Ware argues, mankind suffers evil, pain, death and sin because we are related to and descend from Adam and Eve. <P>Lastly, Ware deals with the subject of God as man and God as Spirit. Ware shows why the Incarnation was an absolute necessity because of the sinfulness and fallen nature of mankind. He speaks of the redemptive significance of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and here is where Ware goes off the beaten track by hinting that maybe even Satan and the fallen angels will eventually be redeemed. I believe that Scripture seriously mittigates against such a view and leaves no doubt about the fate of Satan and his demons. Also, Ware's treatment of spiritual toll houses and the 40 journey after death are odd and are not well established teachings within Orthodoxy. In fact, such a teaching seems to have more in common with early pagan beliefs than early Christian teaching. Although the 40 days following one's death is an imporant time in Orthodoxy, the belief that one is tested and tried on a path of toll houses is not a common teaching. Overall, this book is an excellent work on the basic tenets of the Orthodox Christian faith. Although it does have some awkward elements it is still an excellent book and one that should be read by anyone interested in learning more about the Orthodox Church.</span>
