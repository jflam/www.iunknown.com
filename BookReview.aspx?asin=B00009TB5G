                <span id="Label1">The extended edition of <I>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</I> was perhaps the most comprehensive DVD release to date, and its follow-up proves a similarly colossal achievement, with significant extra footage and a multitude of worthwhile bonus features. The extended version of <I>The Two Towers</I> adds 43 minutes to the theatrical version's 179-minute running time, and there are valuable additions to the film.  Two new scenes might appease those who feel that the characterization of Faramir was the film's most egregious departure from the book, and fans will appreciate an appearance of the Huorns at Helm's Deep plus a nod to the absence of Tom Bombadil.  Seeing a little more interplay between the gorgeous Eowyn and Aragorn is welcome, as is a grim introduction to Eomer and Theoden's son.  And among the many other additions, there's an extended epilogue that might not have worked in the theater, but is more effective here in setting up <I>The Return of the King</I>.  While the 30 minutes added to <I>The Fellowship of the Ring</I> felt just right in enriching the film, the extra footage in <I>The Two Towers</I> at times seems a bit extraneous--we <I>see</I> moments that in the theatrical version we had been told about, and some fleshed-out conversations and incidents are rather minor.  But director Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's world is so marvelous that it's hard to complain about any extra time we can spend there.<p>  While it may seem that there would be nothing left to say after the bevy of features on the extended <I>Fellowship</I>, the four commentary tracks and two discs of supplements on <I>The Two Towers</I> remain informative, fascinating, and funny, far surpassing the recycled materials on the two-disc theatrical version.  Highlights of the 6.5 hours' worth of documentaries offer insight on the stunts, the design work, the locations, and the creation of Gollum, and--most intriguing for rabid fans--the film's writers (including Jackson) discuss why they created events that weren't in the book. Providing variety are animatics, rough footage, countless sketches, and a sound-mixing demonstration.  Again, the most interesting commentary tracks are by Jackson and writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens and by 16 members of the cast (eight of whom didn't appear in the first film, and even including John Noble, whose Denethor character only appears in this extended cut).  The first two installments of Peter Jackson's trilogy have established themselves as the best fantasy films of all time, and among the best film trilogies of all time, and their extended-edition DVD sets have set a new standard for expanding on the already-epic films and providing comprehensive bonus features.  <I>--David Horiuchi</I></span>

                    <span>Arguably better than the first installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, The Two Towers is a more than seamless continuation of the first film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the ring, and are now guided by the deceitful Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join the fight to defend the city of Rohan as Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his dark lord Sauron proceed with their plan of the eradication of mankind. More violent, fast paced, and with a more epic feel; The Two Towers is, as of this typing, the best action/fantasy adaptation yet; and while it may not take place exactly as Tolkien himself had written it, he himself would nod his head in approval of the fantastic job done by director Peter Jackson. Most of the cast from Fellowship of the Ring has returned: including Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Hugo Weaving, and Andy Serkis providing his movements and voice as Gollum, who is a fantastic pinnacle of how far computer animation has come today. The battle scenes are more than epic; including the climatic slickly put together battle of Helm's Deep. All this however is only a taste of what is to come with the third and final film in the trilogy: the eagerly anticipated The Return of the King.</span>

                    <span>Peter Jackson surpasses himself again with this extended DVD version of "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" that is far more impressive than the theatrical release. Here he has added 43 minutes of additional footage, along with additional new music scored by composer Howard Shore, giving us more for our eyes to feast upon the royal family of Rohan, the family of Denethor, the Steward of Gondor (portrayed by John Noble, who appears only in this extended version, in a brilliant flashback sequence involving his sons Boromir and Faramir), and the Ents. There is also more time spent on the relationship between King Theoden's advisor Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) and Saruman (Christopher Lee), shedding more light on Saruman's alliance with the dark lord Sauron. There is splendid acting by the entire ensemble cast, though highest honors must go to Andy Serkis for his brilliant portrayal of Gollum, Sean Astin's Samwise Gamgee, Ian McKellen's Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn, Miranda Otto's Eowyn and Bernard Hill's King Theoden. 'Tis a brilliant sequel to "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" which is now even better.</span>

                    <span>Usually, the second movie in a trilogy is the weakest. It doesn't have the freshness of the first movie or the finality of the final movie. The Two Towers, however, is the exception to the rule. For lack of a better phrase, it rocks!!! The extra material included in this extended version DVD really fleshes out the movie. After you watch it you'll wonder why Peter Jackson left it out; it makes the movie complete. The fight scenes at Helm's Deep are great, and you forget that a lot of what you're seeing is computer generated. Several new characters are introduced, but you feel like you've known them all along. The best part of the movie is the addition of a Boromir/Faramir scene. Of course, I could be biased. I love Boromir (Sean Bean). This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It's great!!!</span>

                    <span>OMG! I love this movie so much, I never put it back in the case...it's always in the dvd player. If you at all liked the original theatrical version, you HAVE to get the extended version. The addded footage completes the story and fills in character developement. And you HAVE to listen to the cast commentary. Dom and Billy are hilarious. And the bonus disks are well worth the money. Forget that...added Viggo footage makes it WELL worth it. Plus, the box is beautiful.</span>
