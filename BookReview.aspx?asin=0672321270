                    <span>Unix has many levels to master and there is no one book that could possibly cover all of them. Moreover I would say that it is problematic to cover even one layer thoroughly because of the exceptional variety of subjects to address and enormous wealth of commands and abilities that Unix offers. Unfortunately the most problematic stage while learns UNIX it is a beginning. As we progress there are more and more things that one can address ourself. 
<br />I have quite formidable experience with different book on UNIX and related subjects and this one would be in the list of my favorites. It is very well written, very articulate; it goes into many subjects with great attention to details and so on.
<br />As for now there are three major methods had been available: real course, book and knowledgeable friends. I have discovered another one and it is "UNIX Essentials" DVD that sells here on Amazon and it is well worth mentioning.  The DVD isn't complete as I said there is no way to cover everything in UNIX but, but it covers 90% of what one has to know to start work with UNIX independently. It is very nice compilation for someone who likes to learn UNIX but it has to be supplemented by a book like this one. Take both, work trough them for two weeks and there are few people around who could possibly recognize that you are novice. It provides VERY nice training altogether. </span>

                    <span>I recently got hooked on the whole Linux "thing" after seeing "Revolution OS" (and yes, you might say I'm a late bloomer). On my quest to find good courses on Linux, a site recommended this book as the first read. And I must say it was excellent advice. The book covers all relevant topics in adequate language, has good excercises and also gives you the context, history and opposing views in Unix-land. I was so satisfied I sent Dave Taylor (the author) an email and guess what - he got back to me in a few hours. Buy this book!</span>

                    <span>This book is VERY basic. This is definately not the book you want if you are already somewhat familiar with Unix. This book is geared more towards someone that has never even logged in to a Unix box.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in under 24 hours, and as the author recommended, I emailed him to tell him that I had managed to get over the material in that time.  He emailed me back and asked me to write him a review on Amazon, so here I am.<p>I was impressed with the book.  I read the older 2nd Edition but it was mostly still relevant for a Mac OS X 10.3 "Panther" user.  It was a thorough introduction to the Unix sub-system.  The only chapers I had trouble with were the one on programming.  I found these a little too advanced for me since I have absolutely no experience in programming.  Plus, Panther users will find that they need to install Apple's XCode to get the C compiler to work.  But the rest of the book is really very good and so I strongly recommended it to anyone who wants to explore their Mac (assuming you are running OS X).<p>Thanks Dave!<p>BKB.</span>

                    <span>Target Audience<br>People who have a need to learn how to work with Unix at the command level.<p>Contents<br>This book is a hands-on tutorial on the Unix operating system divided up into 24 lessons.<p>The book contains the following chapters:  What Is This Unix Stuff?; Getting Onto The System And Using The Command Line; Moving About The File System; Listing Files And Managing Disk Usage; Ownership And Permissions; Creating, Moving, Renaming, And Deleting Files And Directories; Looking Into Files; Filters And Piping; Wildcards And Regular Expressions; An Introduction To The vi Editor; Advanced vi Tricks, Tools, And Techniques; An Overview Of The emacs Editor; Introduction To Command Shells; Advanced Shell Interaction; Shell Programming Overview; Slicing And Dicing Command Pipe Data; Job Control; Printing In The Unix Environment; Searching For Information And Files; Archives And Backups; Communicating With E-mail; Using telnet, ssh, And ftp; C Programming In Unix; Perl Programming In Unix; Working With The Apache Server<p>Review<br>I'm seriously considering starting to explore the use of Linux as an alternative to using Windows.  And fortunately for me, the Linux desktop has evolved to the place where you can use it much like a Windows environment.  But like earlier versions of Windows, there is a lot of power if you delve under the graphic layer of the operating system.  In Windows, that was DOS.  With the Linux, it's the command line interface.  If you don't know where to start when you get there, Teach Yourself Unix In 24 Hours will get you off on the right foot.<p>Dave Taylor takes you through a hands-on approach to the basics of maneuvering and manipulating a Unix-style operating system.  By working through the examples and exercises, you'll start to grasp the commands that are needed to do the basics.  From there, you learn how to string commands together to create scripts that will automate many of your tasks.  And that's where the real power starts to come into play.  You'll also learn about permissions and ownership of files and directories, which you'll run into with many other systems you may work with during the course of your job. <p>I found this book useful on a number of levels.  First of all, it helped me to understand some of the Unix concepts I need to know when I'm working with other departments that use Unix as their base platform.  It's also giving me the fundamental knowledge I'll need when I start with my Linux work.  Even though I'll be doing a lot of work at the graphical layer, I want to be able to feel confident to go beyond that when I need to.  Until I get beyond the basics, this book will stay close at hand in order to figure out what I just did or what I just broke.  :-)<p>Conclusion<br>This is an ideal text for someone who has to work with Unix and doesn't have much, if any, prior experience.  The hands-on nature of each lesson will appeal to those who want to learn by doing.</span>
