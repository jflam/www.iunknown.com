                    <span>I bought two books on the first 100 days--this one and "The First 90 Days" by Michael Watkins.  I found this book the most useful, and it quickly and immediately inspired me to prepare a succinct 100 day plan broken down into 10 day blocks, for a new $2 billion a year agency.  Hence, I completely disagree with those that trash this book and recommend "The First 90 Days" instead of this book.  I do find both books useful--read this one first, then cherry pick from Watkins.
<br />
<br />Sure, anyone can cook a meal with the same ingredients, and sure, there are a number of books on this topic.  For me, this book has exactly the right combination of white space, font size, lay-out, progressive structure, and inspiring snippets (including the all-important advocacy for having an in-house revolutionary).
<br />
<br />I recommend this book be read in conjunction with Robert Buckman's "Creating a Knowledge-Driven Organization," Margaret Wheatley's "Leadership and the New Science" (which Buckman told me inspired his own work), and Clayton Christensen's "The Innovator's Solution" (or you can just read my short summative reviews of those three books).</span>

                    <span>It is important to also look beyond the 8 points of this book to its overall meta messages:
<br />*Today, the CEO on-board process is a relative manageable and predictable process
<br />*During this process a variety of individuals have specific roles and objectives to ensure the CEO's success
<br />*There are specific, transferable skills and experiences to get in preparation for the CEO job
<br />*More Boards then ever are flexing their newly acquired, legislative muscles. This has resulted in a tremendous amount of CEOs firings. A more cost effective solution would be for Boards to prevent these firings by providing the CEO adequate pre- and on-boarding support.
<br />
<br />It is correct that, in their most summarized form, these eight points have been written about in literature since centuries. Yet, messages such as these are worth repeating two hundred fifty million times (that is approximately how much it has cost to replace seven top CEO in the last three months) as long as this keeps occurring:
<br />*New CEOs make unnecessary mistakes
<br />*Boards fire CEOs they only hired a year ago for mistakes which could have been prevented with adequate guidance and counsel
<br />*Boards react ("Well, we needed to fire him/her because of mistakes") instead of plan and execute pre-emptive solutions

                    <span>Why would two headhunters want to write a book about best practices starting their jobs among new CEOs?  Based on reading this book, I can only conclude that they wanted to show off the CEOs they had recruited for client companies in order to garner more business from those companies and to obtain CEO search assignments from new clients. 
<br />
<br />Having read many books on this subject, I can only assure you that this one adds nothing to the literature beyond some new cases.  On the other hand, this book is no worse than any other book on the subject.
<br />
<br />Those who will be most disappointed are readers who wanted to learn something new who have read other books on this subject.  The next most disappointed group will be those who are taking on leadership jobs that will not involve heading companies or divisions.  Those readers will find little specific information aimed at those needs.
<br />
<br />With a natural market of 150 U.S. CEOs a year, why does a book like this sell many more copies?  It's really a book that appeals to those who hope to be CEOs of large public companies someday, which will mostly be MBAs who are fairly young.  Such readers can dream about how they would handle these same situations.  While that can be fun, the time would be better spent on developing a new skill for your current and next job.
<br />
<br />As I have noted before, best practices can be misleading.  Best practices can suggest that there is no better route available.
<br />
<br />That thought led me to think about what's missing from a book like this.  Here are a few of the many examples I could list:
<br />
<br />1.  A description of what on-going measurements to put in place in order to understand where the company is today, how it needs to change and what its most realistic opportunities are.
<br />
<br />2.  A process for creating a premium-priced stock price based on a realistic understanding by investors of the company's situation and where it is going in the future.
<br />
<br />3.  A way of monitoring how well the CEO is performing in terms of each of the 8 points in the plan described in the book.
<br />
<br />4.  What to do differently after the first 100 days.
<br />
<br />Now, if those areas seem fundamental to you, they are.  Why are they missing?  I have to assume that the authors lack the expertise to work on those areas.  They are, after all, just headhunters.
<br />
<br />If you are still interested in the book, what do the authors tell you to do?
<br />
<br />1.  Prepare before you start the job.
<br />2.  Encourage low expectations of what you will accomplish.
<br />3.  Pick and brief your management team.
<br />4.  Determine your strategic focus.
<br />5.  Improve the corporate culture.
<br />6.  Develop your relationship with the board.
<br />7.  Communicate what you are doing.
<br />8.  Avoid making common mistakes.
<br />
<br />Did you really need to read a book to figure that out?  If so, I'm not sure you are ready to be a CEO.
<br />
<br />I would like to comment that when I coach new CEOs of major companies I find that NO ONE takes point 6 seriously enough.  So if you do read the book, pay particular attention to that point.
<br />
<br />Good luck!

                    <span>Neff and Citrin's eight-point plan to great performance in the first 100 days of a new job makes a lot of sense.  The steps won't come as a surprise to anyone who has gone through this process but their logical progression adds up to a big push in the right direction.  The real surprise in this book is how readable it is, thanks to the  many well-known CEOs who candidly confess their ups and downs during their own first 100 days.  </span>

                    <span>When you start a new job or take on a new project, you're almost always in what Citrin and Neff call "a temporary state of incompetence."  This book offers a welcome source of advice and reassurance.  The advisors couldn't be much better, since they're some of the top CEOs in business today:  GE's Jeff Immelt, Gap's Paul Pressler, Mattel's Bob Eckert, Gillette's Jim Kilts, AOL/Time Warner's Dick Parsons, etc.  They're friendly, forthcoming -- and brutally honest -- about what they did right, what they could have done better and, in some cases, what they did that was dead wrong. Their stories make for readable entertainment as well as providing a helping hand for managers at any level. </span>
