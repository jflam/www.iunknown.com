                    <span>This book claims to take a reader with a solid .NET and web background into a deeper grasp of web services. Unfortunately, that's just what it doesn't do. Instead, it's a hodgepodge of complicated details about this or that about SOAP and WSDL and XSD. I've worked a fair bit with XSD, and nothing in that chapter would have helped me grasp its essence, or how to use it effectively, if I were trying to learn about it by reading this book.  It *sounds* like the authors know what they're talking about, but what good is that if it doesn't help the *reader* know what they're talking about?<p>This book contains a lot of things -- such as catalogs of encoding types -- that can easily be looked up. What it doesn't contain is what would have made it valuable: clarity and understanding. A good technical book is a distillation of complex material, filtered through a clear mind that has found a way to express it so others can understand. That isn't easy.  It takes a lot of time and effort, but it saves time and effort for those who read it. This book had just the opposite effect: it wasted my effort and was not worth the time I invested in it. It didn't help my work in any practical way, and adds little value over just reading MSDN.</span>
