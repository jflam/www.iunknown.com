                    <span>The "How to" in the title is deceptive. This isn't yet another book that advises you to conserve electricity in your home, or to donate to charities, or to volunteer at local homeless shelters. This is effectively a collection of short nonfiction stories telling about many personal accounts of social entrepreneurs: the sort of people who devote their entire lives to actually *go out there* to make changes happen, who create organizations, not people who just support organizations. These are stories about people who actually went out and helped construct solar panels to bring electricity to rural Brazil, people who actually run a street-youth safety hotline in India. These are in a very different league from things like conserving water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth. These aren't things that anybody can just do in their spare time. A lot of the cases of social entrepreneurship described in this book are things I haven't even heard of before. There are grayscale photos of the people and events. There's a lot of statistics. Both defeats and victories are described. This seems to be a college textbook, not light reading. At the back are extensive lists of reference websites. 
<br />
<br />Suggestions: if possible, get it from the library before buying it, to decide if you're ready for owning this heavy of reading. Expect to read a few chapters at a time, not in a single sitting. You probably don't need to take notes to keep track of it. This would be an excellent book to have a friend read also, so that you can discuss the significance of the anecdotes told in it. </span>

                    <span>How to Change the World is a great compilation of social entrepreneur case studies. Just don't take the title too literally. This book is not a "how-to" manual for changing the world.  I would also challenge the premise that non-profit entrepreneurs are the only people committed to positive world change.  Nevertheless, the book serves as an inspirational review of good ideas and people committed to serving others.   </span>

                    <span>First of all, David Bornstein is an excellent writer.  This book is very readable and without jargon, but it is not "dummed down" whatsoever.  It is very thorough in both describing how various "social entrepreneurs" from around the world have succeeded in realizing their dreams to make the world a more liveable place and in laying specific guidelines for what it takes to become a successful social entrepreneur.  He also alternates chapters from specific case studies to more general and practical tips on what one needs to do to succeed, thereby making it all the more interesting.  In other words, after reading a case study, I would find myself inspired and wondering what I could do to put myself on the path towards social entrepreneurship.  The next chapter would answer a lot of those questions and by the end of that chapter I couldn't wait to read more about real people and what they were doing to change the world.
<br />
<br />Before reading this book, I thought the title may too much hyperbole or perhaps a little "cheesey", but after finishing the book, the I think the title is perfect.  In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever wished they could change the world for the better.</span>
