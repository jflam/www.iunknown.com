                    <span>Let me say right away that I found "Realizing the Power of Now" much less inspiring than "Even the Sun Will Die" by the same author. And it is definitely not the complete programme of lectures of a week-long retreat since many concepts handled by Tolle in the course of his speeches have never been explained before. 
<br />
<br />What you will find here is a quite commonsensical mixture of Zen quotes, Christian meditations, all too predictable recommendations to be aware and to accept "what is" and jokes about human silliness, all of this interspersed with the sound of Bali bells, supposedly meaningful silences, outbursts of noisy laughter and the heavy sound of E.T.'s breathing. 
<br />
<br />Somehow I find that E.T., whose books I have all read and studied, has been corrupted by the enlightenment industry or the "enlightenment club", as Tony Parsons calls it. I have a feeling that he is now increasingly playing a role and trying to conform to people's expectations about what a spiritual teacher should look and sound like. His slow manner of speaking seems terribly contrived, almost calculated to create a state of hypnosis in his hearers. There is affectation in everything he says. 
<br />
<br />I found the content of "Realizing the Power of Now" boring, shallow and repetitive. If you really want to follow E.T., I recommend "Even the Sun Will Die" instead. "Even the Sun Will Die" is an interview with Tolle made on September 11. In it, Eckhart develops a number of rather profound ideas and relates his own adventure. It is much more interesting than this insipid stuff for mass consumption about awakening. 
<br />
<br />If you are looking for the real thing, my advice is to read Tony Parsons ("As It Is" is his most famous book). I also recommend Jiddu Krishnamurti, who is both a profound "thinker" and a delightful English prose writer (read his "Commentaries on Living"). But no matter who your "teacher" is, I think it is essential not to accept anything just because he says it. All teachings are dangerous and misleading because words are by definition misleading. As St John of the Cross said, our two most fearsome enemies are the devil and...our spiritual director! 
<br />
<br />Well said, Juan...

                    <span>I have been reading and listening to Eckhart Tolle for a few years. His message (or as he would say "signposts")is simple, but profound. If you open yourself up to his teaching, it can change how you live and perceive your life situation.
<br />At a time when our world is in such utter chaos, his message has never been more meaningful or important.</span>

                    <span>Realizing The Power Of Now is a 6 CD audiobook in which counselor and spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle provides the listener with an wonderfully articulate and insightful presentation on transcending the finite world to touch our tree essence which has "no form, not time, nd no name". Eckart Tolle deftly addresses the use of our "inner body" as an anchor to the Now; the cultivation of "pure awareness" moments; the power inherent in the simple act of noticing; the liberation of laughter; nature as a bridge to the divine; dissolving our "pain-body" with the light of consciousness; finding the peace underlying personal loss; separating our "life situation" from our life; and so much more. This 7 hour, 30 minute, flawless recorded presentation by Eckhart Tolle is as life affirming as it is highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Wow. I am 44 and was blown away by reading Krishnamurti many years ago. But that was pretty much it...a sense of having my mind blown while I was reading Krishnamurti but didn't seem to take much away from the reading other than a memory of having my mind blown. Admittedly 20 years have passed and I am not the same person, but Eckhart seems so much funnier and practical. I just kind of bliss out listening to him and get the sense that I am being transformed. Even if I'm not (which I doubt) it is such a pleasure to listen to. Suddenly life loses all seriousness.</span>

                    <span>This is a powerful and incredibly mind opening set where you will be taken on a journey into what has been blocking you, and how to transcend "egoic" patterns in order to become one with the NOW moment, so you can live in peace. <br>I absolutely love listening to Eckhart's teachings, because he is real, humble, genuine, and his wisdom profoundly enlightened. <p>If you can't attend his teachings in person, this is the next best thing! Highly recommended for the genuine impact this will have in your life. Listen carefully, and take it all in. Once you do, you will "become the watcher" of your habitual thoughts, and the pain that your ego pulls you into, without your realizing it. After listening to this set, you should be well equipped to transcend that egoic state, and live with the true joy and peace you deserve NOW. <p>If you click on "Audio Download - Audible" above, you can download the set for $9.95 from Audible (which is in partnership with Amazon) right into your Windows Media Player. It's well worth it either way. This set will genuinely have a profound impact on your life.
