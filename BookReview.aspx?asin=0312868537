                <span id="Label1"><b>The story of the siege by the acclaimed author of<i> Hitler's War</i></b><br><br>In 199 Days, acclaimed historian Edwin P. Hoyt depicts the epic battle for Stalingrad in all its electrifying excitement and savage horror.  More than the bloodiest skirmish in history-a momentous conflict costing three million lives-the siege was a hinge upon which the course of history rested.  Had the Red Army fallen, the Nazi juggernaut would have rolled over Russia.  Had the German's not held out during those last few months, Stalin would have painted Europe red.  Now, over 50 years after the most extraordinary battle of the second millenium, the truth about this decisive moment is finally revealed.<br></span>

                    <span>This is a solid account of the hellish battle for Stalingrad. Hoyt is at his best when he has ample detail to illustrate just how horrible this battle was--the tales of Germans cracking horse bones for food, stories about men's feet freezing in their boots and the insanity of fighting floor to floor in a building. It's muddled in parts, but I generally enjoyed the book and would look for more books from Hoyt on World War II.</span>

                    <span>Granted, Edwin P. Hoyt does give a rather simplified account of the battle entire (a lot of time is spent on explaining the opening of the war), but this was the first book I read on Stalingrad. I think that's what this book basically is: an introduction.<P>Some people might not like the fluff added in (although I must admit reading about the Russian girl beating up the German soldier made my day), but I think for those not yet ready for the cold, hard facts it pretty much entices your interest to learn more. I have to also add it was great to read about the true story of what was later made into the film "Enemy at the Gates." When I saw the trailer for the movie this book was the first thing to pop in my mind. To me, Edwin P. Hoyt is like the H.P. Lovecraft of history. He may not talk about any thing new and he may not be the best of the best, but man can this guy write!<P>I wouldn't call it the definitive book on Stalingrad, but if you'd like a nice read from all the hardcore factual history books out there, or you've gotten interested in this field of history, then it's a good book to get.</span>

                    <span>Forget this book if you are a serious researcher or student of the Battle of Stalingrad. Get Joel Hayward's acclaimed "Stopped at Stalingrad" and Antony Beevor's great "Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege" instead. Also check out anything by David Glantz and John Erickson. Get THIS book maybe if you've never read anything on Stalingrad and want a clear and basically accurate introduction.</span>

                    <span>This book is typical of Hoyt; very well written and nicely presented, but also unoriginal and non-innovative. Readers wanting to learn new things about Stalingrad, or even to get a detailed analysis as opposed to a mere chronicle, will find this book disappointing. So buy this book if you want a good yarn, but buy Joel Hayward's STOPPED AT STALINGRAD, Antony Beevor's STALINGRAD: FATEFUL SIEGE, John Erickson's THE ROAD TO STALINGRAD if you want substance, new findings and real analysis. Stalingrad enthusiasts are unanimous that these are the three "standard works" on Stalingrad. Although I give Hoyt's book three stars, I give all the other three five stars.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I have changed my mind about this book...from bad to mediocre. The problem is that this book is marketed from the publisher as a scholarly study of the battle, drawn from the newly opened Russian archives, as well as the older German archives. This is not the case, & Mr. Hoyt never claims this in his book. Mr. Hoyt simply got a bunch of older Stalingrad books, and rewrote the words into his book. I respect Mr. Hoyt for actually admitting this in his appendix, which he does in great detail, to my amusement. Mr. Hoyt's choice of books to use as the basis for his are generally good secondary sources, but unfortunately are only English titles. Therefore, the well read Stalingrad student will just see a rehash of material he/she has already read. I would recommend this book for the person who just wants to read ONE Stalingrad book in his life. If you read Hoyt, you have essentially read Erickson, Chuikov, Ziemke, & a host of others.</span>
