                <span id="Label1">Ken Burns's documentary style is so unencumbered; the subject matter is effortlessly presented. His regular mix of photos, subtle sound effects, excellent musical score, and actor readings of historical text hasn't changed since his breakthrough of <I>The Civil War</I>. And it doesn't need to. Even though this 220-minute production is a biography--on heavyweight champion Jack Johnson--the film resonates about the how race was dealt with in the early part of the 20th century. Four decades after the Emancipation, the American black was still struggling to find elementary terms of equality. Along came a strong and headstrong man who took on sport decades before Jackie Robinson and became the key figure in heavyweight fighting, a champion against the longest odds.<p>  Samuel L. Jackson voices Johnson's words with great verve and helps create an absorbing picture of Johnson along with various historians and boxing experts laying down the tale of the tape. Here's a man so smart and patient in the ring who took great liberties in his day-to-day life, unafraid to showcase his success, and ruffle the morals of the time (including, most scandalously, marrying a white woman). Viewing film of his prizefights, the amateur eye can understand Johnson's style and bravura. Burns's certainly takes his time and, as usual, has a vast awry of facts of how the world reacted to news of Johnson's success and the conspiracy which led to his downfall. The highlight, natch, are two of Johnson's epic fights near the end of his reign as champ (and the search for a "Great White Hope"). The appearance of James Earl Jones (who won a Tony for his portrayal of Johnson in 1959) and Wynton Marsalis's musical score are grand touches. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>Wow, Black Man threatening violence!! Now where did that come from!!!? 
<br />
<br />As for disparaging White athleticism, I would remind NewUser that White (10% of the World population) won 90% of the medals at the Olympic Games and (99.9%) at the Winter Olympics. 
<br />
<br />As for the main Heavyweight Boxing Champion, who is he? Oh yeh some big Black guy by the name of Vitali Klitschko, who just happens to be an albino. 
<br />
<br />This documentary is quite interesting, but I think Ken Burns had one eye on the awards (which are usually won by scoring PC points) rather than the truth. It comes across as a bit of a whitewash (excuse the pun)ch.

                    <span>I knew something of Jack Johnson before I saw this documentary, but Ken Burns tells his story with incredible detail.  One of the many revelations for me was the astonishing level of accepted racism that was prevalent at the time.  Supposedly reputable newspapers (e.g., The New York Times) and authors (Jack London) are quoted at length, with bigoted excerpts that border on inflammatory.  One couldn't imagine hearing something of this nature from today's mainstream media.  Just the very idea that a black man/African-American could defeat a white man seemed preposterous to many; so much so that boxers often refused to even fight one.  It took Jack Johnson a long time to get a shot at the title; but once he got it, it took white America even longer to get it back.  What stands out in this program is the towering figure of Johnson himself.
<br />
<br />I couldn't help noticing that Johnson appeared to be the prototype for the modern American athlete.  All the brashness, bravado, conceit and over-indulgence that we associate with the "headliners" of today...all this began with Johnson.  He seemed to revel in flouting society's conventions.  When you think of the arrogance of Ali, the controversy of Jim Brown, the bravado of Namath...Jack Johnson was all this before they were.  At the same time, however, I can't help but remember Charles Barkley saying "I am not a role model."  Jack Johnson wasn't either, as much as Black America wanted him to be.  In the end, he was too loud, too defiant, too controversial.  He was too much, really, for the times.  But I came away from this program thinking  exactly what he wanted his epitaph to be:  Jack Johnson WAS a man.  No doubt about that.

                    <span>This documentary does nothing but feed all sorts of mistruths
<br />and misconceptions about Jack Johnson, race relations at
<br />that time in american history and boxing.
<br />
<br />Jack Johnson was a good boxer.  He chased the champion, got
<br />a match with him and beat him.  His road to the championship
<br />wasn't all that unusual for the time (white or black).  And
<br />he got his title shot because he was good and because there
<br />were more than a few white people behind him.  Among other
<br />things, what it took to chase Tommy Burns was MONEY.  And
<br />the money that got Tommy Burns into the ring was
<br />white money.  
<br />
<br />After he won the title, he proved that money and celebrity 
<br />can buy most anything in america regardless of color.  He was
<br />not a "victim" during his years as champion, he was a great
<br />success.  He also wasn't particularly brave about anything.
<br />Aside from the Mann Act conviction, the law left him alone.
<br />He wasn't (for example) arrested after winning matches or
<br />ever in danger of the typical lynching.  In America, if you
<br />win, you have celebrity, you have money, you can largely get
<br />away with whatever you want.
<br />
<br />The most confusion about Jack Johnson exists in the image the
<br />racist created in the public mind about him.  "They" wanted
<br />him seen as the "uppity negro" chasing after the white women
<br />and being disrespectful.  But in fact, Jack Johnson was no
<br />different in attitude toward the public or opponents than 
<br />any other past boxing champion of that era.  He ran with
<br />prostitutes like every other boxing champion.
<br />
<br />The fight with Jim Jeffries was a disgusting spectical that
<br />had little to do with Jack Johnson and everything to do with
<br />promoting a boxing match as a race war.  White America (and
<br />Black America) were put at each others throats over a boxing
<br />match.  Riots broke out.  And as much as it was about racism
<br />in America, it was also about using racial hatred to make
<br />money.  Johnson and Jeffries were incidental to what was really
<br />going on and didn't make the real money out of the fight.
<br />
<br />The worst thing that happened to Jack Johnson was that he was
<br />convicted on a manufactured charge.  But they didn't take the
<br />title away from him and money spoke again with him getting
<br />out of the country.  
<br />
<br />He eventually lost the title because all boxers have a rise
<br />and a fall.  They wear out and lose.  Nothing horrible happened
<br />to Jack Johnson in all of that.  
<br />
<br />And when he returned to the US, he did his short jail-time
<br />in almost joke-like conditions.  He wasn't killed or mistreated
<br />in prison or a victim.
<br />
<br />The problem Jack Johnson had in his boxing career and now is
<br />that white & black America both wanted to use him as a symbol
<br />of their own problems with each other (hate in one case and
<br />pride in the other).  He could never be just a boxer or just
<br />a champion because most of america wanted to see him used as
<br />part of one agenda or another.
<br />
<br />And in his later life, again, he was never a victim.  By boxing
<br />standards of the time (white and black) he lived a good life.
<br />Cut short by tragedy of course, but still a good life.
<br />
<br />The most important thing I can say about Ken Burns project
<br />is that nobody should think that they are getting close to
<br />the "real" Jack Johnson through it.  Most of what your getting
<br />is the public image of Jack Johnson that was created to whip
<br />up the crowd at the time.

                    <span>Blacks could not fight for the world heavyweight championship in the 19th century.  The "world's strongest man," it was thought, could not be black: Blacks were not men.  That attitude drove race relations to an all time low between 1890 and 1917.  Segregation, disenfranchisement and lynching took root throughout the country.  Hanging black men was sport.  
<br />
<br />Which makes Jack Johnson's bravery remarkable.  He refused to be a "complacent negro."  When Tommy Burns, then-heavyweight champion, refused to give him a fight, Johnson chased him around the world and forced him to accept his challenge for the world title.  Johnson knocked Burns out in 1908, then beat Jim Jeffries, "the Great White Hope," in Reno, NV in 1910.  White America, by and large, did not approve.  Prosecutors later railroaded him on a false count of transporting women over state lines.
<br />
<br />Quite a story, huh?  Ken Burns thinks so, and he empties his tool box here, pulling out breathtaking cinematography, top-of-the-shelf voiceovers, and superb period photographs.  The director gets a big assist from the wealth of film with Johnson.  The speedy jabs and sly charisma fly out of the flickering black and white frames, making Johnson one of Burns' more dynamic protagonists.
<br />
<br />That's important, because this is pretty grim stuff.  The slurs thrown at Johnson made me shiver, as did the casual assumption that blacks like Johnson were beasts.  The boxer, to his credit, refused to bow to any of it.  
<br />
<br />That's a shining example for the rest of us.  It's a problem for "Unforgivable Blackness."  
<br />
<br />Race is Burns' chief concern, and his documentaries show an admirable frankness in tackling the issue.  Johnson, from a distance, seems like the race problem personified: An exceptionally gifted athlete, his considerable talents were overlooked because of his skin tone.  It would seem, then, that the hatred demolished Johnson.
<br />
<br />Except it didn't.  In the face of violent abuse, he smiled, insulted his smiters and slipped back into a well-tailored suit.  A $50 speeding ticket?  Johnson gives the cop $100 and tells him he's coming back the same way.  Attacked for dating white women?  He dates another, and another and another.  Convicted on trumped-up "white-slaving" charges? Johnson leaves the country and tells people he likes Mexico better.
<br />
<br />That makes the "Fall" part of Burns' subtitle problematic.  As deeply ingrained as racism was, no one ever stripped Johnson of his title.  He lost it not because of his race, but because of his age and his refusal to take Jess Willard (his successor) seriously.  He was persecuted, and eventually went to jail.  But even in prison, Johnson followed his own drummer, and seems to have lived a fairly happy life after his release in 1921.  We should all have falls like that.
<br />
<br />Burns says a great deal about America's shameful racial attitudes in the early 20th century, but overreaches when he tries push them down on Johnson's shoulders.  Johnson shrugged the hate off and stood tall in the ring.  His opponents handed their money over and flooded the arena, screaming and spitting and praying that a white man would knock him out.  Johnson smiled, dispatched his opponent and had a great dinner on his enemies' cash. He never fell; his fierce individualism made him soar above his contemporaries. </span>

                    <span>Great job! With an amazing inclusion of actual fight films and newspaper clippings from the era, this is a fine documetary on Mr. John Johnson (aka Jack), the world's first black heavyweight champion. All of the major issues are covered, and the 4 hours goes by quite quickly as an example of good history and good storytelling.
