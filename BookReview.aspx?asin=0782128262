                    <span>I'm not ready for the exam yet, but already I've picked out numerous typos, goof-ups and errors. Seriously it seems like they didn't even bother to proof read it before printing. The more I read the angrier I get - there's no excuse for this kind of sloppiness in a text that deals with very complicated material, where subtle differences in meaning make a HUGE difference for the exam. I'm tempted just to not finish reading it, it's very difficult to read, worded poorly and circularly, and often just does more to confuse me than help. The full size study guide is much better. Read that first and then approach these exam notes critically, and DON'T rely on them. If in doubt check your facts with other sources, cause this book can't be trusted.</span>

                    <span>I typically don't bother writing reviews but the quality of this book is upsetting. In terms of the content this book is alright but don't expect to get away without one of the larger ones. This is only a brief review after all and sometimes not well explained. However, I must say this book is the lousiest quality I have seen for a while now. More errors and typos than all the books together I have read during the last year. Be aware, this book is brief and compact and it gives you a lot of brief and compact misinformation.</span>

                    <span>Although this book is a good review for the certification exam, it is filled with errors in code and language. Many code examples, when applied into JDK, gave results that were different than expected (compile errors etc.). Computer programming textbooks, especially a study guide for certification, cannot afford to be sloppy. <p>I am not a publisher and do not claim to know anything about publishing. However, I was taken aback by the lack of attention given to the correctness and compilibility of the code examples. I would compare it to missing ingredients in a book of recipes. It might be excusacble as an oversight or typo - but what good is it to you if you have to keep second-guessing the contents. <p>Do not attempt to take the certification exam with this book as your only source (unless you are a Java Guru and a walking Java compiler). The most helpful book I have found is Deitel & Deitel's Java How to Program Third Edition. All of their code compiles cleanly and they give wonderful explanations of the topics at hand. <p>You can buy The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide, by Simon Roberts, Philip Heller and Michael Ernest (although this book has many errors and is bone dry when it comes to real life analogies and examples) and use the Exam Notes review as a review only!! There is a lot that is mentioned in the review book that is not covered in the Study Guide and vice versa.<p>I am a computer professional for close to ten years and am relatively new to Java. I was able to get Sun Certified only through mixing and matching the strengths of many Java books and web resources.<p>I still think it's worth your time to get the review book - but just be aware that it does not come without its shortcomings.<p>Good luck to all you certification candidates!! The exam is tough!!</span>

                    <span>I passed the Java 2 programmer's exam this morning and with a comfortable margin. This book is the primary reason why I passed.  I would recommend "Thinking in Java", "Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide", and this book.  That's all you will ever need to pass.  I did it from scratch, on my own without any instructor or experience.  Starting from scratch without knowing java to taking the exam and passing took me about two months. Good Luck!</span>
