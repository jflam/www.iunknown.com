                <span id="Label1">Your digital camera is more than new incarnation of your old film camera. Yes, it still produces photos, but it also offers new outlets for creativity, including instant gratification of seeing your photos now, the ability to experiment without worrying about expense, the technology to fine-tune your photos with advanced professional techniques, and the means to share your work instantaneously with anyone, anyplace in the world.  It's no wonder that digital cameras are outselling traditional cameras for the first time ever. But the question most digital camera users ask is this, "How do I get from taking 'decent' photos to doing the things I'd really like to do? How do I tap into that potential?"  <i>Digital Photography Hacks</i> is your passport to taking the kind of digital photos you've always aspired to.  Written by Derrick Story, photographer and author of <i>Digital Photography Pocket Guide</i> and other books, it goes beyond the standard fare of most digital photography books--such as camera basics, understanding memory cards, and when to use a flash--to the things that professional photographers have learned through thousands of shots' worth of experience, years of experimentation, and fiddling and hacking.  The book includes a foreword by photographer  Rick Smolan, author of America 24/7.  With exquisite, full-color photos throughout, the book presents a collection of tips, tricks, and techniques for photographers ready to move beyond the basics.  And if you don't have the latest in digital camera photography, this book will show you how to extend the life and functionality of your existing camera.  All the hacks in the book are platform-agnostic, designed for use on both Mac on Windows-based computers. You'll find 100 proven techniques in the areas of:<ul><li>Daytime and nighttime photo secrets</li><li>Flash magic</li><li>Digital camera attachments</li><li>The computer connection</li><li>Photoshop magic</li><li>Fun photo projects</li><li>Camera phone tricks</li></ul>This book is for the photographer you are now, and the one you want to be. <i>Digital Photography Hacks</i> is for the creative adventurer who resides in each of us. </span>

                    <span>"Hack - a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well." - the new Hackers Dictionary.  This book is another in the series of O'reilly 'hack' books, this time on the subject of digital photography.  Some may take issue with the fact that many of the techniques described in the book are not really hacks at all.  Its clear the author does not know the meaning of the word hack.  In fact, the book would be more aptly titled 'digital photography techniques'.  As such, although I would consider about a third of the techniques to be 'hacks' in the hackers dictionary sense, the book is more about photography techniques that you can apply to your digital camera.  
<br />
<br />The book is organized into a series of 100 'hacks', divided into chapters, organizing the techniques.  The first chapter covers attachments you can buy for your digital camera.  Depending on your situation, you will find some of these useful and some not.  Some of the 'hacks' are quite obvious advice - buy a tripod for example.
<br />
<br />Other chapters contain info on daytime photography, nighttime photography, flash photography tricks, computer tips, photoshop tips, camera-phone tips, and weekend photo projects.  These chapters were the highlight of the book for me, containing information about photography techniques applied to digital photography, plus some digital techniques perhaps not available using traditional film photography.  These chapters show the author's good experience with photography and will be quite useful for beginner photographers.
<br />
<br />While the daytime, nighttime and flash photography chapters were interesting.  People with computer knowledge may find most of the computer tips chapter a waste.  Linux users will be disappointed that the book does not cover any image processing techniques available on linux using the Gimp.  While I am no photoshop or gimp expert, I do know enough about the gimp to know that many of the techniques described have equivalents in the gimp.  Besides that, the gimp is free, available on linux and windows, while photoshop costs a lot of money.  You would think a book with a true 'hack' spirit would cover free software for use in digital photography (to be fair, it is briefly mentioned on one page in the camera phone tricks chapter).
<br />
<br />The last two chapters, the camera-phone and weekend photo project chapters, discuss some ways to use your digital camera you may not have thought of.  The camera phone chapter has a bit about cleaning up those low quality camera shots, something generally useful for any camera if not all of your photographs are professional quality.  I also appreciated the information about panorama techniques and image stacking found in the weekend photo project chapter.
<br />
<br />Overall, I would recommend this book for certain types of readers.  If you are an experienced photographer who is familiar with most photographic techniques, then this is probably not the book for you.  If you don't know a whole lot about fancy photography techniques and you are looking to get more out of your digital camera, you will find value in this book.  If you are already an expert at using photoshop to enhance your digital photographs, a majority of the computer techniques in the book will probably not help you.  If not, you may learn something.  Gimp users should look elsewhere, however the general techniques shown for photoshop can probably all be applied to the gimp if you can figure out what the equivalent functionality in the Gimp is.</span>

                    <span>This book could have been titled 'Stuff you really really ought to know about digital photography'. Heck, many of the tricks could be applied to point-n-shoot, disposable, even some pro equipment both in digital and film arenas. While most pros are keenly aware of most of the hacks in this book, many things only come after years of goofing up and asking others how they did something.
<br />
<br />For example, we've all seen soft-focus portraits, but would you have thought to stretch nylons over the lens to get that effect? Or maybe you'd tear tiny holes in the nylons to get a more mottled appearance. Need a well-lit portrait but don't have a studio? Buy two flashes that can be fired by remote control, or consider using a mirror to bounce one flash around.
<br />
<br />In the digital side, learn some tips about sorting an filing, backing up, and creating working copies so you don't lose your originals. Take your images into the 4th dimension by creating movies and slide shows - free! And learn to use the unique benefits of digital cameras to shoot many more exposures than you normally would with film, then combine the best parts of each.
<br />
<br />The hacks in this book range from boring to quite imaginitive, and cover not only shooting techniques, but lighting setups, Photoshop tricks, archiving, weekend projects, and stuff you can do with a camera phone. Not all the hacks will be useful to everyone, but there is enough variety that most novice and intermediate photogs will be kept busy for quite a while.
<br />
<br />The only drawback to this book is that many of the hacks rely on purchasing or building additional equipment. While this is not the fault of the author, it is a bit disappointing to open a book and be told to buy something else. However, Story does give plenty of information on do-it-yourself solutions, and generally provides alternates. Some things, like additional flashes, or more advanced digital cameras just can't be substituted.
<br />
<br />Digital Photography Hacks really isn't meant for the shooter looking to solve very specific problems. Instead, the goal seems to be to get people thinking more creatively about their cameras and shooting. It might make a serious hobbiest of some, while give some inspiration to others. I've been shooting for a little while, and found lots of unique approaches to techniques I've already learned, and a few new tricks here and there.
<br />
<br />This is a great book for anyone with a point-n-shoot digital camera who wants to do something more interesting than the typical travel or kid snaps.</span>

                    <span>O'Reilly has released another pretty handy book by Derrick Story called Digital Photography Hacks, 100 Industrial Strength Tools and Tips. The Book is broken into 8 chapters that cover different types of hacks & tips. I have highlighted points from a few of my favorite chapters. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 1 covers attachments for your digital camera. This chapter has 15 hacks that cover different types of tripods, making a walking stick into a monopod or monopod into a tripod, along with flash brackets. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 2, Taking photos in daylight. The 13 hacks featured in this chapter are some of the best hacks in the book. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 3 goes into 10 notable hacks on nighttime photos. What I liked about this chapter is how he explains some easy ways to get some great pictures after dark. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 4 gives up Hacks 39-46 called "The Magic of Flash".  Most snap shooters wouldn't even think of using the cameras flash on a bright sun shiny day, yet that flash helps a lot with shadows that are caused by a bright sun.
<br />
<br />
<br />While this book isn't really Photoshop "How to" book, Chapter 6 makes it clear that Photoshop can be part of your digital camera lifestyle. The tips in this chapter are very easy to follow, making a complex program like Photoshop easier to use.
<br />
<br />Seems that 2003 was the year of the camera phone. The 10 hacks in Chapter 7 cover tips that will help you get the most out of your camera phone, for better or worse.
<br />
<br />While Mr. Story is mainly a Macintosh user, the book is also useful for Windows users too. If you're interested in improving your photography skills, I would recommend that you purchase this book.

                    <span>I can't recommend this book enough. In 300 pages the author takes you all the way from how to take great shots with cheap cameras, to how to store, edit, and get them printed. There is a lot of practical low-cost advice on taking quality shots through different mounting and filter techniques. There is also practical advice on how to do the standard photo editing work that most books take hundreds of pages to explain in just 50 pages or so. He also covers managing the little movies the cameras can take, and the working with the crummy photos cell phones take. A well written handy resource for any photographer. Couldn't be happier with this one.</span>
