                <span id="Label1"><div>A book of practical guidance and simple wisdom about running... and about life. From a key figure in the running world comes a unique little compendium of information and anecdotes about a life in motion. Champion marathoner Amby Burfoot has created a distinctive resource to help runners run better, faster, and farther. More than this, his succinct and sure-footed text will help runners rediscover and deepen their own joy in the sport. This is a celebration of running. <br><br>Training, racing, nutrition, injury prevention, issues for women, weather, mental preparation, and the marathon are discussed in detail with plenty of solid information. Each chapter ends with a list of relevant principles of running. Interwoven among the facts and fundamentals are enlightening personal notes from a learned lifelong runner. <i>The Principles of Running</i> is much more than a simple manual. It is a book that you will not be able to put down, although you are not sure whether you are reading it for the running tips or the life lessons. It is a book that you will keep on your nightstand, tuck in your briefcase, and give to your friends. It is a book that is certain to help you hit your stride--whether your running shoes are off or on.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I ran all through grade school and high school and am picking up the sport again after some years off. I found this book to be a great re-introduction after some time off. I think Amby describes it best as that book that has lots of answers to the questions you've been asking yourself for months (or years), and instead of buying many books to find the answeres, they are all in one small, relatively inexpensive book.<P>If you run, buy it, you'll like it, if you are thinking about running, buy it, it'll help you along the path towards your running goals.</span>

                    <span>execellent book for the beginners. the principles are short, comprehensive, precise and right to the point. but for the intermediate and advance runners, this book has nothing new to offer other than repeat and remind of what you have already learnt.</span>

                    <span>This book is great for runners of all age and experience. I have never been much of a fitness nut, but Mr. Burfoot's book inspired and helped me to begin a personal running program.
