                    <span>TEXTILE DESIGNS provides the reader with more than just a visual smorgasbord. That alone would warrant owning this beautiful book. The depicted designs, limned clearly is vibrant color, can be returned to again and again for both inspiration and delectation. In addition, the accompanying commentary deeply impresses me with its scholarliness. The book is scholarly in the sense of reflecting much research and thoughtful distillation of material. It is also witty, trenchant, and amusing in the manner in which facts are presented. And facts there are aplenty. Tracking the history of textile design carries us through the spread of French, British, Dutch and Russian colonialism. It takes us on a tour of Art Nouveau and Art Deco. Leaf through the book on a randon basis, and you will find nuggets of information that throw light on subjects as disparate as the origin of the myth of the cornucopia; the relative cost of a fine paisley shawl in early nineteenth England (as much as a London townhouse); or the connections between the slave trade and the textile industries of France and England. Indeed, reading this book is like taking a ride on a magic textile-design carpet, darting and swooping from one aspect of the human story to another...but maintaining a unique perspective based on a deep appreciation of the link between decorative design and its cultural and historical context. This book is a must-buy not only for those who seek aesthetic visual delights, but for individuals who are intrigued by the web of socio-economic connections generated by the textile industry during the past two centuries.</span>

                    <span>I designed and printed my own engagement announcements and wedding invitations using patterns from TEXTILE DESIGNS DIGITAL: FLORAL. They came out beautifully!! Not only did it save printing costs, but it was a lot of fun for my fiance and I to create them together. We have also used the CD-ROM designs to make note cards, birthday greetings, post cards, and gift wrap paper, resulting in many compliments. I highly recommend this product. It contains many beautiful patterns.</span>
