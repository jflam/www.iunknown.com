                <span id="Label1"> Moose Flannagan moves with his family to Alcatraz so his dad can work as a prison guard and his sister, Natalie, can attend a special school.  But Natalie has autism, and when she&#146;s denied admittance to the school, the stark setting of Alcatraz begins to unravel the tenuous coping mechanisms Moose&#146;s family has used for dealing with her disorder.   <P> When Moose meets Piper, the cute daughter of the Warden, he knows right off she&#146;s trouble.  But she&#146;s also strangely irresistible. All Moose wants to do is protect Natalie, live up to his parents&#146; expectations, and stay out of trouble.  But on Alcatraz, trouble is never very far away. <P> Set in 1935, when guards actually lived on Alcatraz Island with their  families, Choldenko&#146;s second novel brings humor to the complexities of family dynamics and illuminates the real struggle of a kid trying to free himself from the "good boy" stance he&#146;s taken his whole life.</span>

                    <span>No question that this is an excellent novel.  However, teachers, don't rush out and get a class set without reading this novel first. This novel contains material that you may not want to discuss with students -- including some "inuendo" regarding Natalie, the autistic sister, and a prisoner.  </span>

                    <span>Al Capone's simple message to protagonist Moose concealed in laundry is the perfect, "big-smile" ending for an exemplary story.  It typifies my stereotype of the cigar-gutteral gangster thug of that era.
<br />
<br />What a read! This one exemplifies heartfelt, poignant, and clever writing that comes from personal experience; in this case, G. Choldenko's sister who had autism as well as her time spent as a docent on Alcatraz Island.  It was Choldenko's research that yielded one of the most clever and pranksterish child plots to make money I have read--simply delightful!
<br />
<br />The depiction of Moose's sister, Natalie, and a family's perseverence to do the best they know how for her is written with such poignancy that it will indeed move readers forever.  Choldenko reached "deep down."
<br />
<br />No doubt Choldenko enjoyed using a "Bacall/Hepburn model" for her feisty, spirited Piper.  It works!
<br />
<br />Get "Al's Shirts" for your classroom shelf! </span>

                    <span>This book was pretty good. It's not the best i have ever read (this is coming from a 13 year-old girl). I've always loved Alcatraz and because that is the setting of this story, i got to learn a lot about it. It's kind of weird because the story is being told in the present-tense so instead of saying "Mom said" it's "Mom says". It was a hard book to put down and i finished it in two days, but i think that there could've been a little more in the ending; some things were left unresolved. But all in all, a good book for most all ages.</span>
