                <span id="Label1"><P> As good a rifle company as any in the world, Easy Company, 506th Airborne Division, U.S. Army, kept getting the tough assignments -- responsible for everything from parachuting into France early D-Day morning to the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. In <I>Band of Brothers,</I> Ambrose tells of the men in this brave unit who fought, went hungry, froze, and died, a company that took 150 percent casualties and considered the Purple Heart a badge of office. Drawing on hours of interviews with survivors as well as the soldiers' journals and letters, Stephen Ambrose recounts the stories, often in the men's own words, of these American heroes.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Ambrose successfully captured the moments of 101st Airborne. This book was dedicated to the soldiers who gave their lives during World War II. It followed the footsteps of E company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne or well known as the ¡§Screaming Eagles¡¨.<P>As a top elite parachute regiments, men in ¡§Easy¡¨ company had their toughest experience in their lives. They first met as a group in Camp Toccoa, Georgia. They all came from different places and background but with one goal ¡§to serve their country well¡¨. They later were sent to Europe to fight the ¡§Jerries¡¨ or the Germans. They parachuted through the sky of Normandy. They fought against time in Holland. They were in the freezing foxholes of Bastogne. They fought bravely as a group. They had heavy casualties. Brothers and friends were lost. They somehow survived through the harsh time of the war. It was because of these moments that the men of E company began to trust their brother soldiers and later became ¡§Band of Brothers¡¨.<P>The book told individual stories of E company. For example Major Richard Winter, who was basically the most incredible person of the whole company. He led the group with intelligence and ¡§common sense¡¨. He led the group through all the battles they went through and never forgetting his soldiers when raised for a higher rank. He gained more than just respect from the men of Easy. They had love like brotherhood which made them unique from other companies.<P>Stephen Ambrose recorded every action, operation or even patrols of Easy Company. The book is very detailed in every action taken, with colorful and exciting lines. Dialogues and social talk between men made me as the reader more into the actual battle. Different perspectives were written down to show the characteristic of each person.<P>There are pictures and maps in the book to make sure the reader follow along. The book is very ¡§real¡¨ side of the war. It showed the true feeling of soldiers trying to survive through harsh conditions. This book moved many readers including Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks who later made this book into an HBO TV series, ¡¥Band of Brothers¡¨.<P>I would recommend this book to people who are interesting in history of the 101st airborne and World War II. This book is simply a forgettable classic.</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend "Band of Brothers" for history readers and general readers alike. The new HBO miniseries will cause renewed--and well justified--interest in this slim and often overlooked volume by Stephen Ambrose. Unlike his other WWII books, which either provide biographical detail on a certain individual (e.g. Eisenhower) or cover a huge event from many angles (e.g. D-Day), this book puts you in the boots of an elite unit of paratroopers--Easy Company, 506th Airborne Division, U.S. Army--and sticks with them throughout the war. The narrative follows this small group of men from basic training through an absolutely amazing series of combat experiences: from D-Day, to the Battle of the Bulge, to the concentration camps, to the the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. It seems this unit was everywhere, and did everything, in the European Theater. You would swear the tale is fiction, but it's true, and it's very compelling.<P>As always, Ambrose, with his straightforward prose, does a great job of describing the circumstances, thoughts and feelings of the characters--you can almost feel the cold when he describes hunkering down in a foxhole in the Battle of the Bulge. And while Ambrose lauds Easy Company as heroes, he describes their faults and frailties as well, and neither shies away from nor unduly revels in the horrors of war. The scenes at the end of the war--with American paratroopers driving around Berchtesgaden in the cars of Hitler's senior staff and swiping the swastika silverware--are almost over-the-top; a fantastic addition to an already gripping story.<P>I strongly recommend this book, even if you watch (or watched) the HBO miniseries. It's a quick, engaging, and fast-paced read that will give you new appreciation for these extraordinary men.</span>

                    <span>Band of Brothers follows an elite group of soldiers in World War II. Did I say "an" elite group? I may be understating them a bit; from this book, they appear to be one of the greatest collection of soldiers to ever face combat, a group a young men who excelled in all endeavors and played a major part in winning the Second World War.<P>Once you understand how much material is covered in this book, you will be amazed it is told in a mere 300 pages. While much is gained from this thrifty narrative (it is really hard to put down), it does becoming confusing for those of us who aren't familiar with the content. I have a hard time with some of the military terminology (I don't know which is higher, 1st or 2nd lieutenant). Ambrose doesn't slow down to explain these things either. He zips right on to the next training mission or engagement. This isn't a book about the military in general. Rather, it is a tightly focused account of one group's experience in WWII, from training to their post-war lives. <P>Easy Company is also a very large group, making it nearly impossible to keep all the names straight. Ambrose doesn't want to focus on a few people, because greatness was found in the actions of many. Therefore, it at times becomes difficult to recall who exactly is at the center of the story playing out. The men all seem to become a conglomerate, one nameless, faceless soldier who does everything. <P>Those may be two problems I have with the novel, but don't read this as a negative review at all. This is a powerful and important book. I am in awe of the brave, young men who signed up for Easy Company, knowing they would have the hardest training and most difficult assignments in the war. To a man, the boys answered they wanted this challenge so they could trust the man beside them in battle. The only way to know you are surrounded by the best is to become the best yourself, and these boys did that. <P>I am humbled by reading their exploits and feel blessed to share a country and a flag with these men. I only fear I will be haunted by these tales, as I realize it will be hard to do as much with my life as these men did with theirs; they did indeed set the bar high for the rest of us.</span>

                    <span>This follows E Company all throughout WWII. It starts when everyone joined the Army and ends after the Company's occupation of Europe after the War. It flows very well and keeps you on your seat. I couldn't put it down! Anyone even slightly interested in history would appreciate this book.<P>The HBO series, "Band of Brothers", follows this almost exactly.</span>

                    <span>While the concept of teamwork draws acclaim in corporate circles, real life examples of what teamwork can accomplish for an organization are all too rare. This book takes care of that need, by portraying the total dedication of a group of soliders who grew up together, fought together, cried together, grieved together, and became triumphant together. Fortunately, the book brings the same "you are there" sensation provided by the video series, which I saw before reading the book.<P>If you want to teach your group about teamwork, start with this book. They will learn what it means to be totally dedicated to a mission, and to give of yourself far more sacrificially than anyone could expect.<P>This book portrays one of the most heroic periods in American history. You will enjoy it, and will cherish even more the freedoms the Band of Brothers protected for us.</span>
