                <span id="Label1">The Dalai Lama serves as a living symbol of holiness and selfless triumph over tribulation for people of all religious traditions-as well as those with no religious affiliation at all. This collection of daily quotations drawn from His Holiness's own writings, teachings, and interviews offers words of guidance, compassion, and peace that are as down to earth as they are rich in spirit. Suffused with endearing informality, warmth, and practicality, they cover almost every aspect of human life, secular and religious--from loneliness, suffering, anger, and everyday insecurities to happiness, intimacy, and responsibility to others. With a special foreword by His Holiness on the power of meditation and personal responsibility, <i>The Path to Tranquility</i> is a fresh and accessible spiritual treasure to return to day after day, year after year.</span>

                    <span>When I got this book, I thought it a little boring. I like histories, not words of wisdom. But through the days, as I read it, I could see how it would help me. So, every time I am sad, or when I am too nervous, I like to read it and forget everything. It is very beautiful, and coming from a so learned man, it is a promise of a good book. Read it with your eyes closed and even so, you'll feel the power of Dalai Lama's words. (I don't know English so much as that, so please, sorry)</span>

                    <span>The daily wisdoms of the Dalai Lama have inspired me each morning . The last thing I do before heading out the door is read my wisdom for the day. It has inspired me, made me think before I act and, most important, made me think about how and why others act. This is the first book by the Dalai Lama I have owned. I am so inspired by it that I have given it as gifts to my friends. His Holiness has such insight and is an inspiration to read. I reccommend this book to everyone, religous or not, as I believe we all need a positive thought to begin our day.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for everyone, even if you do not follow Buddhism. The Dalai Lama speaks to the heart and soul of civilization in this book, a collection of his writings, segmented for daily reading. He has amazing insights on how to live life as a happy, healthy, functioning member of society. A friend calls this "written Prozac". It makes you feel good!</span>

                    <span>I am not a buddhist, nor do I have any intentions of becoming one. But I must admit that this Audio book is full of wisdom. I was blown away over and over by the sayings of the Dalai Lama. Of all the people I have read or heard, I must admit that he is the wisest of all.<P>If you don't mind an occasional reference to reincarnation and rebirth (as a christian, I do not hold these beleifs), then the wisdom from this audio book is more than worth it.</span>
