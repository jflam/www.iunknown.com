                    <span>I originally checked this book out from the library in my town. I read through it over and over, and when I would watch reruns of SNL, I would look and see if skits from the episode were in the book. This book even lists every guest host, musical guest, and the songs they played on the show from the beginning up to 1994. After having to turn the book back in, I decided I had to find one to buy. This book is my favorite non- novel!</span>

                    <span>I'm sorry to say that this book was published a year too early. It went to press after the 1993-94 season which was SNL's 19th. Were the authors and publishers so anxious to get it out? I guess they were. Anyway,this book tells about the amazing history of Saturday Night Live. Every overall cast member,director,writer,producer and everyone else involved. We'll never forget October 11,1975,the day of its premiere. The premiere episode began with the late John Belushi and the late writer Michael O'Donoughue in a sketch called "The Wolverines". O'Donoughue played a psychiatrist and Belushi was the patient. At the end of that sketch and before the pre-taped opening montage played,Chevy Chase came out yelling "LIVE FROM NEW YORK,IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!",which is said at the beginning of every show,even to this day. Chase didn't stay very long on the show. Before the end of 1976,Chase,the first Weekend Update anchorman,went to Hollywood. Jane Curtin,another original cast member succeeded Chase on Weekend Update. Shortly after Chase's departure,in came Bill Murray from Chicago. After 1978-79,Belushi and Dan Aykroyd left SNL to go Hollywood and concentrate on their Blues Brothers act,initiated on SNL. They filmed THE BLUES BROTHERS in '79,a year after Belushi's first starring film ANIMAL HOUSE. In 1979-80,Harry Shearer joined remaining original members Curtin,Garrett Morris,Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner. After that season,all five were gone. The 1980-81 season began unusually late due to the actors' strike and Presidential debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan(the SNL studio was used for the debate). That season brought an entirely new cast,one of them being Joe Piscopo who stayed thru 1983-84. Eddie Murphy,then age 19,joined the show and departed with Piscopo. Another member was Gilbert Gottfried who was then not-so-famous. Jean Doumanian succeeded original producer Lorne Michaels,who had left with the remainder of the original cast. Gottfried was let go after 1980-81. In 1981-82,Piscopo and Murphy had new castmates,some of them Canadians. Robin Duke and Tim Kazurinsky are Canadian like original member Dan Aykroyd. Later(1984-85) came Billy Crystal who almost became an original member,and James Belushi,John's brother. Also joining in 1984-85 was Martin Short,who'd go Hollywood himself later. The following season,things finally settled down in studio 8H. Lorne Michaels returned,triumphantly(Doumanian was fired after 1980-81 and succeeded by Dick Ebersol) to serve as producer like he did for SNL's first 5 seasons. The new cast members were Nora Dunn,Dana Carvey,Kevin Nealon,Victoria Jackson and Dennis Miller who'd become the next Weekend Update anchorman. Mike Myers joined in 1989. Myers and Carvey became Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar,two hard-rocking and babe-loving buddies on the sketch Wayne's World,later inspiring two films. Chris Farley and David Spade later came and also went Hollywood. Another big SNL star is Adam Sandler,another film star. Sandler previously worked for NBC,guest-starring on a few episodes of The Cosby Show. Every show had a guest host and musical guest(some shows had more than one of each). We will never forget the Coneheads,Emily Litella,the Festrunk Brothers,Ed Grimley and Wayne's World(sorry if I forgot anything). We also won't forget John Belushi,who died in 1982 of a drug overdose and Gilda Radner who died at 42 of ovarian cancer. Farley fatally overdosed on drugs in 1997. O'Donoughue succumbed to lung cancer in '94. Oh, by the way,Bill's brother Brian Doyle Murray was an SNL member from 1981 to '84. This book should have been updated in 2000 for the show's 25th anniversary. After nearly 29 years on the air,Saturday Night Live continues to pull in tens of viewers from 11:30 PM to 1 AM,EST.</span>

                    <span>Since its television debut in 1995 few will argue the fact that Saturday Night Live was a cultural, comedic, and TV phenomenon.<P> Here in one volume is a collection of the sketches, characters, performers and phrases that first appeared on the show that kept many of us up late.<P> It's also a visual reminder of some of the great comedians who were first showcased there and the once shocking catch phrases that became a part of our collective vocabulary.</span>
