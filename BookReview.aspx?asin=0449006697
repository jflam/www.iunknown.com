                    <span>Hey Amazon--spell Harvey's last name correctly--anyone else catch that error?<P>First let me say that I always hate finishing one of the Shark's books--that means I will have to wait a year to read the next one. His online site is a good snack, but I love a seven course meal of his best insights and keys to success.<P>Some of the chapters seemed a bit too familiar, as in "Haven't I heard this from Harvey before?" but I love how he can put into perspective almost everything that happens to you in your professional career.<P>Harvey is not shy about telling you his mistakes and what he has learned from them. That's the key, learn something from your failures as well as your successes.<P>A must read for any young professional (as is Dig Your Well...) But like all his books--take notes and/or dog ear pages or risk forgetting some of the many nuggets included. <P>Bravo Harvey, another job well done.</span>

                    <span>I have been a fan of Harvey Mackay since reading Swim with the Sharks. Pushing the Envelope is even better.If you are in business or want to be, read this book and learn from a master..</span>

                    <span>One of my favorite things to do besides learn about the stock market is read books on starting/running businesses and self help/motivational/inspirational books I find these books to be a relaxing brain stimulant that helps me better myself. I am sure others receive the similar feelings and thoughts from reading material like this.<P>Pushing the envelope is another great book by Harvey Mackay (he owns an envelope company incase you were wondering.) Like his other books "Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive" and "Beware the naked man who offers you his shirt" Pushing the envelope is choke full of real life tips on how to be better at work, at home and with friends. Hands off to Harvey for he has created another wonderful book.<P>If you would like to invest in your future I recommend purchasing this book: Pushing the envelope all the way to the top<P>Reed Floren</span>

                    <span>Did I read the same book as the rest of these reviews? I like Harvey Mackay and enjoyed Swim With the Sharks, but I thought this book was a fairly simplistic brain dump of cliches and unoriginal thoughts. I do believe Mackay's geniunely decent nature come through and most of the concepts were fairly well presented, but I found very little here I hadn't already heard. I kept thinking to myself that this was Harvey's publisher squeezing out another book under contract. Sorry.</span>

                    <span>From Author of "Script Magic: Subconscious Techniques to Conquer Writer's Block: Want to get motivated? Want to do the impossible! You can, with Harvey MacKay as your guide! There are many poignant messages in this book, but the two that touched me the most was the fact that MacKay aimed for and achieved his desires, despite the "odds." And secondly, the subtle message I get from him and his book is that generosity is really the best policy. Tuck it under your pillow at night and read it for inspiration!</span>
