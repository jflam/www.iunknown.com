                    <span>As a writer I was looking for a source of both history and everyday life during the 1920's era. "Only Yesterday" is informative, and interesting, but not much was mentioed about everyday life of the average struggling American. Focus was particularly paid to the flappers, gangsters and the negative effects of Prohibition. Still, it is a must have source for those researching this time period.

                    <span>	The 1920's brought with them a drastic change in the way people acted.  It was the general belief that young women acted perfectly.  They never drank, smoked, or did anything wrong, for that matter.  Some young men could be expected to slip up, and give into the temptations of sex, but that was only with women of low class and disrespected families.  Thus, boys and girls had a lot of freedom to be together.  Parents just assumed that they wouldn't take advantage of the situation.  This wasn't the case.  Young women began to smoke and drink much more.
<br />	The way women acted wasn't the only thing that changed, however.  Women were beginning to wear clothing that revealed way too much skin.  The skirts, in fact, were now beginning to show kneecaps.  Yet another reform was in music and dance.  The good ole' elegant music of the violin was being replaced by the loud, up-beat saxophone.  Kids were now even dancing with their bodies touching each other.  For the elders of America, this was too much.  Most felt that these kids were morally lost.
<br />	There were a couple of reasons for this revolution in morals.  First, these kids had just gone off and fought a war.  They had been through hell in Europe and now came back to America after facing some emotional times.  They returned home expecting an exciting life.  They just couldn't settle down and live by the moral code already laid down.  Also, women were growing more and more independent at the time.  They had just won women's suffrage in 1920, giving them equality to men.  Women's role of housekeeping was also becoming less important.
<br />	Another big cause to the moral reform was the automobile.  At a time when cars were becoming more and more popular, kids saw a great opportunity for freedom in the automobile.  At any time, kids could just jump in and go somewhere without supervision from a parent or chaperone.  Kids could drive out to a dance in another town, where they could act more freely, without people they knew all around them.
<br />	Finally, there was prohibition.  The 18th Amendment, passed by 1919, banned any sale of alcohol in the United States.  This law, of course, was never followed.  Bootleggers and speakeasies were created as safe havens for alcohol.  Drinking became thing to do because it was a way to revolt.  
<br />	The change in women's dress was another key change in the `20's.  From 1921 to 1924, the skirt length only shortened by a little bit.  Paris, in fact, predicted that skirts would return to longer length, but women just kept on buying the shortest length they could find.  By the end of the decade, the knee-length skirt was the regular skirt length.  Women began to wear rayon, too.  Rayon was a skin-colored stocking that was extremely popular.  They were wearing less and less clothing in general.  The amount of fabric needed for a woman's outfit had shrunk from 19.25 yards to just 7 yards.  Clothing wasn't the only big change.  Women also started to wear their hair shorter, another freedom that they had never experienced before.
<br />	Barriers between men and women were being broken.  Both views of drinking and smoking were changing drastically, too.  Women began to widely accept smoking.  Before the `20's, it was something women didn't do.  Another such barrier was found in drinking.  Men and women were now drinking together.  Speakeasies were one popular scene for mixed parties.  People would also go out to hotels to drink.  Men and women would lie on the beds in their rooms and drink away.  During these years of prohibition, alcohol was drunk in more abundance than ever before.
<br />	With the weakening of morals and the increase in sexual activity among kids, the divorce rate began to rise.  In only 8 years, the divorce rate rose by nearly 8 percent.  Divorce, in earlier years, was really looked down upon.  To get a divorce was a shameful disgrace to you and your family.  By the end of the `20's, however, it wasn't such a bad thing anymore.  At the beginning of the decade, people thought that you would find the perfect spouse and get married and live happily ever after.  Now the attitude was that it was okay to settle for somebody, because you could just divorce them if it didn't work out.
<br />	Overall, there were three big results from this reform in morals and manners.  First, the nation became very sexually active.  In fact, it almost became the nation's obsession.  Sex magazines became very popular.  More and more people became enthralled by it.  Also, there was the change in manners.  In fact, manners at that time were not very mannerly at all.  Finally, people dropped the old moral code for a new one.  The old code had set values in it.  This new morality didn't really have any clear values.  It could almost be said that morality was thrown out the window in this age.

                    <span>The author details the ephemera of the roaring twenties and in doing so seems to capture the geist of the times. The country is already divided between the forces of "decency" and the predators, who, at the most articulate levels, profess "laissez faire capitalism." <p>The object of this French term is the United States government. By 1918 it was a fast ship, roaring to the aid of the beleaguered peoples of Europe, tipping the balance in the "war to end wars" in favor of the right side. In this spirit also, prohibition was passed. The moment the war came to an end, the American people fled from the banners of decency just as fast as their legs could carry them. The government became a derelict hulk captained by token presidents.<p>Wilson drove himself to death trying in vain to bring about a "just and lasting peace." Harding, the great American "good guy", enmeshed himself in the "Teapot Dome Scandals" perpetrated by his friends, the Texas oil millionaires. The author speculates that his rather unexpected death was a concealed suicide. The oil intended for U.S. naval reserves went elsewhere at a large profit, much to Japan.<p>The south rose again in the form of the resurrected Klu Klux Klan (the book does not mention its previous disbanding by the actual confederate veterans). They ruled at the state and local levels (hence "states rights"). Justice was an open joke, but who cared about it? The American people were busy pursuing a sexual revolution and illicit booze. The satirist, H. L. Mencken, had a field day. Al Capone ruled Chicago. Hundreds of rackets sprang up everywhere and small businessmen paid taxes to the mob.<p>Why did the government not act? Mammon was God and was being preached not only by the clergy from the pulpit but by its new apostles, the salesmen. "Hands off", they said, and that will be the best. The little people attempted to defend themselves and their jobs through unions and were assaulted by reactionary forces acting at state and local levels. Anarchy and disorder were on the increase. The IWW reached maximum extent, especially in the west. Reactionaries countered with "the red scare." Sacco and Vanzetti were executed for a crime the judge and prosecutor knew they did not commit, because they were "anarchists" (they were not).<p>Reaching the end of the decade, the author gives us the handwriting on the wall: the crash of late 1929. Laissez faire, he hints, was not going to work in the 20th century. He could not then know of the rise of FDR, the suppression of the Klan, the legalization of unions, and the strengthening of the government into a social regulatory force and quasi-empire. Nor could he know that the divisiveness would continue, and the protagonists would be roughly the same. What a pity.</span>

                    <span>Allen takes us back to the 1920s through the craft possessed only by skilled storytellers. He puts culture into its proper context by pointing out how rapidly things were changed by technological innovations of the time. For example, on page137 he notes "there was no such thing as radio broadcasting to the public until the autumn of 1920, but that by the spring of 1922 radio had become a craze."<br>The nation was in some ways, still in the remnants of an agrarian society, poised to enter the industrial, urban era, but not making the full plunge yet. Perhaps a transitional time would be a better label to put on the snapshot of this period. The reason I say that is due to the description he gives of the swearing in of Calvin Coolidge. "Business was booming when Warren Harding died, and in a primitive Vermont farmhouse, by the light of an old-fashioned kerosene lamp, Colonel John Coolidge administered to his son Calvin the oath of office as President of the United States" (p. 132). <br>The book is full of glimpses which fit together to provide a hoistic portrayal of the decade.</span>

                    <span>Im a 15 year old student and  just finsished reading this book (and am writing a 10 page paper for in in A.P history  :( )This was an excellant book. Allen is very insightfull for his time. The changes that occur, and the analysis he gives are parallel to those of present day. The only dull point was the Harding Scandal, but otherwise the rest was a good read. I like his sense of humor. <p>Flip Side</span>
