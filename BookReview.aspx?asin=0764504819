                    <span>I just finished reading MCSE Exchange Server 5.5 for Dummies. Of all books I have read on Exchange Server 5.5, I have found this the most readable book out there. And it contains quite a bit of critical information that helped me pass the MCSE exam on the first try! I agree that the end-of-chapter questions are not like the ones on the exam, but the material in the book is so great that you can still pass the exam easily with only this book to help you. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of taking this difficult exam. I only hope these authors write a book on Exchange 2000 after it is released. Well done, guys!</span>

                    <span>I just finished studying for the NT Exchange Server 5.5 exam using this book and passed the test !!! The book is very easy to read and understand, and the authors have taken great pains to give you all the information you need to know to pass the test. They even tell you what you DONT need to know! A true lifesaver for me and I would reccommend this to anyone who would like to learn about Exchange Server 5.5 and pass the test. Good luck folks **smiles**</span>

                    <span>Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding-heart liberal, but in a review that Scott Rachui wrote, he said that liberals don't like conservatives because if conservatism wins, then liberals won't be able to have the elite positions that they have held onto. Now, in your profile, you said that you live in Allen, Texas, you enjoy scuba diving in the Caribbean, and you like visiting Paris and Stockholm. Unless I am mistaken, someone who can afford to go to the Caribbean to scuba dive and visit Paris and Stockholm is probably very rich. Coupled with the fact that you are a conservative in Texas (and don't contest me here, I live in Dallas) I think it's a safe bet to say you are a wealthy individual. I just couldn't tolerate the blatant hypocrisy that you are showing by calling liberals elite when you are a rich conservative. Also, a book you probably adhere to says that "It is easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven."</span>
