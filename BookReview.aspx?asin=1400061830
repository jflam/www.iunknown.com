                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. I was looking for a new writer and a good story - and with this book I found both and more. I read the book in a couple of days - because I just enjoyed the story so much. The characters were interesting without being so self-absorbed that they became not fun to read. I was engaged and found myself rooting for all the characters in their own unique ways - I definitely recommend it.</span>

                    <span>"What to Keep" is a promising first novel about fatherless (one way or another) children and a playwright; as I'm both it had a particular resonance for me. I liked the span and the scope of the thing over many years, its three sections (presumably deliberately) like the three acts of a play. <P>I did think the ending was anticlimactic, but the ride getting there was so easy to take that I still think fondly of the book.</span>

                    <span>"What to Keep" is a phenominal first novel that I think has a strong resonance. It's the story of a mother and daughter that shows a great perspective into the ups and down of growing up, and perticularly when you're growing up pretty much all alone. The writing is quite outstanding. The ending was poignant and touching. I have to recommend this book to anyone who loves an easy, endearing story.</span>

                    <span>This book reminded me in many ways of Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD with its swings back and forth between present day and childhood--also with its themes of literally "What to keep." Cline writes elegantly and with promise and if this is her first novel, we can only hope what we'll be given in the future. With its beautiful characters and memorable moments, this is one book not to be missed.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I have to say right off the bat that I had really high expectations for this novel; everything I read made it sound really terrific. While the novel is good, it did not live up to my expectations, but I would still recommend it. The story concerns Denny Roman at three points in her life. We meet her at age twelve, where much of the focus in the narrative is on what happens to her mother on her 41st birthday. We next meet Denny in her mid-twenties, as she returns to her native Ohio to sort through her things before her mother moves to New York City. The final section of the novel takes place during Denny's mid-thirties, where she faces what could be a life-altering decision to assume responsibility for the son of a dear friend, Maureen. The writing in What to Keep is excellent, but the novel lacks, I don't know, that little extra oomph for a five-star rating. That being said, this novel is much, much better than most (if not all) chick lit, which apparently this novel is being marketed as.</span>
