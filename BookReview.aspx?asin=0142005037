                    <span>I was a bit disappointed in this book. I did like the bike photos that were shown... not many. Lots of filler of Jesse and his gang posing with guns. What looks like porn stars on the bikes....  I would rather just see the bikes man. I don't need to see pictures of Jesse playing tough guy holding a shotgun or burning money. Or his freaking dog dish with the WCC logo on it... my god. It makes you wonder what he is trying to make up for. His bikes are cool. They need to show more of them. And the text is pretty much a joke too... F this and F that. Its like a big kiss up to Jesse as a bike god or something and F the rest of you. If you pay full price for this book, you deserve to get beat down by Jesse. </span>

                    <span>A short collection of color photos - many partial views of motorcycles, tail pipes, chrome fittings, engines, yellow painted fenders, wheels, nude women sitting or mounted on custom bikes, assorted leather clad people pointing their fingers at the camera trying to look cool, etc. James himself appears in just a few photos and many shots are just partial glimpses of bikes so we do not learn much about the man that we did not already know. So the purpose of all of this is not clear, except perhaps as pop art or dare we say to make a quick buck for Jesse.
<br />
<br />The book has just a few pages of text. I did not buy the book. The book store had a pile of copies but just the top copy was well worn, where at least 100 people must have thumbed their way through the myriad of color photos of partial bike views and nude women, leaving their finger prints and heavy breath on the cover and photos. Most people I suspect stopped there. They saw the photos, returned the top copy to the pile with their finger prints added, and left the rest of pile of books undisturbed in the book store.
<br />
<br />If you really must buy a Jesse James book, as an alternative have a look at "Jesse James" by Mike Seate also on Amazon.com. This "unauthorized" book - whatever that means and apparently hated by Jesse and his friends - also has flaws but at least it has some coherent writing with the pictures.

                    <span>Don't expect any lessons on how to build a custom Harley Davidson. This book is just pure eye candy. Considering that bike magazines are so expensive this book is worth buying for inspiration. As a 'coffee table book' (whatever that means!), it serves its purpose well, which is why I'm giving it 5 Stars. I'm not really into custom Harleys (As far as H-Ds are concerned I would prefer a Buell X1 Lightning or Sundance Performance Super XR1200) but I appreciate the effort, skill and craftsmanship that goes into each of his bikes.
<br /> 
<br /> I bought this book because I wanted to know ... "Who is this guy?" ... "Why is he so famous"? I've created a couple of special edition automobiles ... but why am I not even half as famous? :) We could all learn a bit about marketing, advertising and promotion from Jesse James.</span>

                    <span>I am a big fan of Monster Garage and of Jesse James. I bought this book after reading The Man and His Machines thinking it would provide an insight into who Jesse is and some details about his life and his struggles. The photo's of the bikes are great but I have seen those same photo's over and over again. I expected to see more photo's of Jesse. I also expected it would be a more autobiographical book, not something I needed a magnifying glass to read and finished within the hour. Jesse needs to release a true autobiography. His fans would love it.</span>

                    <span>I received this book as a gift, which is the only reason it's not in a trash can right now. People are paying $17 for a bunch of recycled photos, only 40 or so of which portray Jesse James, along with a few hundred words of unreadable text? This is the "authorized" biography? Is the man's life so horrible that no one could write about it? Frankly, this book is an insult to Jesse's fans. If you want to read about Jesse, buy "Jesse James: The Man and His Machines," by Mike Seate.</span>
