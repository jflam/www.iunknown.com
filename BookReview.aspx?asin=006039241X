                <span id="Label1">Barry Sears got a lot of attention--and royalties--with his  diet books <I>The Zone</I> and <I>Mastering the Zone</I>.  Sears believes that the food you eat is one of the most powerful drugs  you will ever encounter, and a lot of people get fat and sick using  food in misguided ways. Sears believes that using it the <I>right</I>  way can lead to increased physical stamina, sharpened mental focus, and  a reduced likelihood of developing chronic diseases--and you'll  probably shed unwanted pounds along the way. Sears calls for a diet  based on "hormonal thinking," not the usual calorie counting  and fat measuring. Some of the rules of the diet are eating small meals  throughout the day, having some protein at every meal, always eating  the necessary amount of fruits and vegetables, and taking cod-liver  oil. To make all of this as painless as possible, Sears has created  150 "Zone"-perfect meals that are easy to prepare and require  little planning.</span>

                    <span>I am apparently in the minority here but I like this cookbook. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I bought it!!!<p>Yes, it calls for a ridiculously large amount of veggies (especially the dinners)but isn't that the point. You are suppose to be eating a large amount of fruits and veggies with a small amount of meat/fat. This is what the nutritionists have been telling us for years.<p>Quite frankly, after years of weight loss/weight gain I have discovered there are no shortcuts to eating well. There are very few convenience and fast foods that can be a regular part of a healthly, non-fattening diet.<p>My family and I found these recipes to be very tasteful. The spices add a lot to the flavor. I like the fact that the ingredients are combined. Plain grilled veggies on the side don't do much for me. When combined in these recipes they are much more palatable.<p>True, we often can't finish the portion sizes but that saves me the trouble of preparing lunch the next day.<p>As for the slicing and dicing...try buying frozen veggies or presliced veggies (mushrooms, onions, green beans). Also, When I chop onion or other standard veggies for a recipe I chop the whole thing and store in the fridge for the next meal. One thing I did note was that you tend to use the same veggies,. meat and spices over and over again so once you have them on hand it is very easy to throw together a meal.<p>Last, but not least, I do agree that it takes more that mere minutes to prepare these meals but on the whole not any more time than it would ordinarily to cook a meat and veggies from scratch. If you aren't cooking that way then you are probably using pre-packaged convenience foods that are not all that healthy or good for a weight loss diet.</span>

                    <span>First of all - don't get me wrong: I am a big fan of the Zone diet, and a large part of the reason for that is it's relatively easy to understand and to integrate into my lifestyle without any really onerous sacrifices. I have even been able to concoct Zone-friendly foods that are acceptable to my 12-year old son, who is a somewhat finicky eater. So all kudos to Dr. Barry Sears, the creator of the Zone principles.<p>Furthermore, there is an obvious need for a Zone cookbook - As Barry Sears says in the introductory chapter, "The biggest complaint about the Zone Diet is that it takes too much time. No longer. If you follow a few simple rules and use the recipes provided in this book, it will now take you only minutes to enter the Zone."<p>Just one problem: the guy whom Sears hired to put together this recipe book, "Scott C. Lane, an exceptionally talented culinary expert who is also trained in the most advanced food technology," has apparently done all his cooking in a laboratory, and never prepared a thing in a home kitchen. <p>First off, because most of the recipes rely exclusively on the low-density carbs (vegetables & fruits), the resulting proportions are absolutely laughable. Ten of the 12 omelette recipes in the first 20 pages suggest making omelettes with 1/2 c. of egg white (I estimate you get a pan diameter of about 5 inches with that) and filling it with 6-8 cups of cooked vegetables - "spoon vegetables onto half of omelette; fold over and cook 2-3 additional minutes." Has Scott ever tried this? I'm thinkin' this "omelette" looks like a mountain of vegetables with a little white lace doily on top. One recipe (p. 35) calls for 1/2 c. egg whites, and (I kid you not), 2 oz chicken, 1.5 c. onions, 3 c. bean sprouts, 4 c. mushrooms and 10 c. spinach - a total of 19 cups of omelette fill. Yes, I know spinach reduces a lot in volume when you cook it, but come ON! Even without ANY of the spinach there are 9 cups of contents for the 1/2 c. of omelette wrap. <p>And that's just for one single portion!! I'm cooking for three every night. I guess Scott has access to an industrial kitchen with restaurant-size pots, but I don't have the storage space for vats big enough to make these recipes for my family! If I followed the recipe on p. 35 literally, I would need room to cook 3 x 19 c. = 57 c. of vegetables. Lord help me if we were the typical family of four - we'd be talking about 76 cups! A little impractical, don't you think?<p>The ridiculous thing is, these recipes didn't have to be so stupid. All you have to do is convert some of the low-density carbs into a small quantity of high-density carbs, like 1/4 c. of kidney beans or potato; and in fact, 2 of the 10 omelette recipes do just that. When I make one of the stir-fry recipes, I convert part of the pile of low-density carbs into 1/2 c. of brown rice or barley in the bottom of the bowl. Simple, obvious - inexplicably overlooked in this book.<p>Second, Scott obviously has good help in his kitchen. Many of his recipes require sauteing 1/2 the recipe in one pan, mixing the other half of the ingredients in a bowl, sauteing them in a second pan, then combining the two halves of the recipe. Scott, honey - get a clue from Kraft and Betty Crocker: people prefer to minimize the number of dishes they do after dinner. We don't all have kitchen assistants to clean up after us like you do.<p>Third, lots of his recipes have way too many ingredients (e.g., p. 83 - 18 ingredients) and far too much chopping, mincing and slicing thinly to be made speedily. And since that is supposedly the reason for this cookbook (remember the "Meals in Minutes" title)... one has to wonder what they're doing in here.<p>Finally, some of his seasoning is a bit "precious." For example, on p. 48 - 1/8 teaspoon of red wine. I don't think I've ever SEEN a 1/8 teaspoon measure, let alone would I bother to own one. And since that red wine, combined with 1/8 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, is supposed to flavor a full 10 cups of food, I'm skeptical it's even worth the trouble. On p.70, along with the hearty enhancements of garlic, Worcestershire sauce and celery salt, he "spices" the meal with 1 tblspn of "lemon- or lime-flavored spring water." Come on, Scott, it's a taco salad - let's go wild and make it full-strength lemon zest or juice! Granted, this is more of a minor annoyance than a major complaint, but it just reinforces the point that the recipe author is way out of touch with his readership here.<p>On the other hand, the recipes are marginally useful in getting a feel for how to work with the "block" balancing system. And ironically, the non-recipe chapters of the book are very useful - basically an abridged version of the detailed teachings from the original books. So for those two reasons, I'd give the book 2 stars overall - not useless, but certainly not nearly as good as it could have - and should have - been. I hope Dr. Sears will try again - perhaps this time in collaboration with someone like Good Housekeeping, where they  know how to create recipes that actually work for today's busy lifestyles.</span>

                    <span>This amazing cookbook has helped me lose eight hundred pounds. It's taught me how to use bread for sandwiches rather than two twinkies, how to make my famous "artery clogger chilli" without five sticks of butter. It's changed my life so much i don't know how to thank you guys at amazon[.com] for bringing it to my door.</span>

                    <span>This book is not written for people who really enjoy the culinary arts.  It basically is for the bachelor who doesn't want to be bothered making anything fancier than an omelette.  Anyone with a family or anyone who has cooked extensively will be appalled by the suggestions in this book.  Honestly, if just sticking to the diet is the primary objective, just eating a simple chicken, tofu, or fish dish with the appropriate amount of green veggies and fruit is more than adequate and ten times more delicious than some of the gruesome combinations in this book.<br>On the positive side, the book's layout is nice, especially the spiral binding which makes for easy reading while using.  Too bad, that after making one too many of the catastrophic taste concoctions, I never used it again.  Also handy are the Zone portion charts in the back of the book, but again these can be printed up in a fun format using the table function in Excel and mounted to the inside door of a cabinet for quick reference.<br>Overall this book is totally irrelevant and a waste of cash.</span>
