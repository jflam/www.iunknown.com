                    </div>
                    <span>This book had a lot of potential for me. I was born in '65 and only knew of Koufax through the stories of my father and his generation. This book, nearly 40 years after SK's retirement at the peak of his game, is distant enough to be able to be more objective about his accomplishments.
<br />
<br />In some ways it succeeds, although Koufax's accomplishments, even 40 years later, are still astounding and hard to resist mythologizing. I liked the strategy used by the author of alternating chapters between Koufax's life and career with 9 chapters tracking the perfect game of September 9, 1965. To an avid baseball fan who loves the history of the game, the chapters relating the perfect game were the highlight of the book. The interviews with the participants of the game were very interesting, illuminating and funny and it helped the author that most of those participants are still alive and seemingly willing to share what it was like to face SK at the peak of his powers, to be on his team or to be a fan.
<br />
<br />The book falls short for me on the intervening chapters. The author is a good sportswriter and one can tell that from reading the chapters about the perfect game itself. However, I find her prose a little harder to follow. Many times I had to re-read sentences or passages to figure out who she was writing about. In particular, I had a hard time telling who "he" was in more than a few cases. Was it Sandy Koufax or was it the person that was talking about Sandy Koufax? 
<br />
<br />I wasn't disappointed or let down by how hard it is "getting to know" Koufax. Most fans already have a sense of that and can't expect that the man would break his mold and spill his insides out to this or any writer. But, unlike many people who seem to get all caught up in figuring out Sandy Koufax, I actually am glad for him. From the testimony of the people interviewed, he is a very classy man, good to his friends who enjoys his life and keeps his career in a healthy perspective. Good for him. I don't need to know what makes him tick, why he's been married twice, how he feels about this or that subject. I wish, as is pointed out in the book, we would let more of these athletes be and just focus on their on-field accomplishments (assuming no law-breaking, out of control wackyness or stupidity like Jon Rocker's). We are to blame as much as the press for seeking that kind of information. Most people are just driven to bring down others who have done well, unfortunately...instead of celebrating them when they do good things. I think I would appreciate more a book about Sandy Koufaxs's career and accomplishments in the public arena. There is plenty there to write about without trying to psychoanalyze the man. His personal life away from the game is none of my business.
<br />
<br />I think the author generally feels the same way and is empathetic with SK's wish to be a "regular Joe". She does what she can to undo myths about his being a recluse and about some of his more storied and fabled accomplishments. She does do what she can to set the record straight without the benefit of SK's actual cooperation, although he did direct her to people whom he thought would help her with the book.
<br />
<br />Overall, I think this was a very good, relatively short and easy-to-read book. If you're that curious about the man, I don't think this or any other book will satiate that particular thirst. If, as a baseball fan, you are interested in one of the more spectacular careers in the history of the game, you will have been very pleased to have read this book.</span>

                    <span>To really know someone like Sandy Koufax, who prized privacy in a media-obsessed age, would be damn near impossible. No straight-ahead biography could do him justice. That's where Jane Leavy comes in: rather than write a boring "life of" with dates and games and life off the field, she disects Koufax's essence through the recapulation of his perfect game versus the Cubs, on September 9, 1965.
<br />
<br />The book is daring in that regard, and through the context of this one game (a technique also used effectively by Buster Olney for his "Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty"), Leavy gives us as indepth a portrait of the man as we are likely to ever see. In descibing Koufax's career through the prism of this one magical game, she also lets us see the world around him as Koufax develops from a neglected "bonus baby" with a supposedly erratic arm into the legendary force of nature he became during 1961-1966. 
<br />
<br />We get a look at Koufax's origins and other such minatinue that most biographies would cover as well, but Leavy uses Koufax as a mirror on the culture and society that evoloved around him at this time. She reminds us from the beginning that the night of Koufax's perfect game follows some of the most intense racial rioting in Los Angeles (Watts had erupted in flames just a few weeks earlier), and that Koufax himself faced the subtle and not-so-subtle manifestations of anti-Semitism that plagued baseball as much as society during that era.
<br />
<br />Through it all, we get a sense of the player that Koufax was, the special aura that he projected. But Leavy also sifts through the myths of this modern-day Hercules of the diamond to get at the truth, or what she can manage in the face of the man's wall of privacy. This is as true a portrait as we're likely to get of the man behind the legend, the most important lefty in baseball history.
<br />
<br />"Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy" should be required reading for anyone seeking to pen the biography of baseball figures of his stature. Rather than take the easy route and accuse Koufax of being "difficult to pin down", Leavy does the footwork to come up with a compelling, endearing, and above all interesting portrait of the most storied pitcher of the modern game. For that, she deserves a place among the best sportswriters to ever cover the game. And "Koufax" deserves to be the most engaging book you'll ever read about the best pitcher ever.</span>

                    <span>A book that falls short of it's expectations, and it's not the author's fault. Jane Leavy tells the reader her trouble in putting this book together: Sandy Koufax doesn't want anyone to know about him. Yet she continues to write away. About what? I'm not sure. I personally learned alot about Sandy Koufax from this book because I wasn't around when he was pitching. However, I got the feeling in reading this book that I wasn't learning anything that I couldn't have gotten through a Google search of "Sandee Cofacts".
<br />And I can't even trash Leavy for the scarcity of information. To me, if Fred Wilpon is your primary source, you're not going to have much to write about. It's a pretty simple reason: Sandy Koufax doesn't want you to know anything about him, and so you won't. A quick read, mildly entertaining but seemingly nothing new or profound.</span>

                    <span>The big wide world of sports has produced an elusive array of legends that have spanned generations.  For the late 1950s and 1960s, there was Sandy Koufax and his golden arm at pitching.  He may very well have been considered one of the last of this era in baseball history. Besides his looks and his demeanor, his fellow teammates often called him "the game's Cary Grant and Fred Astaire and compaired him to the Mona Lisa and David...He looked like Michaelangelo," Ernie Banks said.  "Pitching, walking, whatever he did was kind of a rhythm with life, stylish" (2).
<br />
<br />Jane Leavy takes a compassionate approach in delving into the life of Sandy Koufax in SANDY KOUFAX:  A LEFTY'S LEGACY.  This is not one of those "digging up the dish" biographies, but one that shows much respect to the player as well as the individual.  Leavy's accounts are authentic and well documented with the many interviews she made with people that played with Koufax as well as the name dropping of fans that idolized him.  There may still be unanswered questions pertaining to Koufax's personal life, but for the most part, Leavy concentrates on what made Koufax a legend, a man who was dedicated to the game of baseball.
<br />
<br />
<br />A LEFTY'S LEGACY is definitive for its content.  However, there is a little side stepping when Leavy attempts to write a social commentary of the 1960s in which Koufax worked and played in.  It was helpful to reference, but it seemed out of place in particular chapters.  One can say Koufax may have fell under the same category of the "Camelot Years."  
<br />
<br />Nontheless, SANDY KOUFAX:  A LEFTY'S LEGACY is a must read biography about the life of Sandy Koufax.  You do not necessarily have to be a baseball fan, but he is one of many personalities that made the 1960s for what it was.  It also makes one wonder and ask, are there any legends anymore?    </span>

                    <span>Despite Sandy Koufax's athletic prowess as a youngster growing up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn he never anticipated becoming what he seemed naturally destined to do - pitch a baseball with phenomenal results in the major leagues.  During Koufax's early years he was drawn to basketball and was playing the hoop sport at Cincinnati University when major league franchises became aware of his natural skills in throwing a baseball.
<br />
<br />Koufax ultimately signed to play for the home team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, but before he could find his stride the team had moved three thousand miles west to Los Angeles.  Sandy was a victim of his time in signing a bonus contract.  Rules obligated clubs to make room on their rosters for youngsters, creating resentment from established players and lacking the opportunity to develop provided to others in the minor leagues.
<br />
<br />The young lefty would have preferred beginning in the minors.  Instead he had a long, hard climb before breaking into the Dodger rotation.  Years later he would ask former Dodger general manager Buzzie Bavasi why he was not used sooner on a regular basis.  He never could get over those early years of feeling management did not want him.
<br />
<br />As typical of a southpaw with blazing speed, Koufax was plagued by wildness.  When he was able to overcome it he carried pitching to new heights.  Former Yankee manager Casey Stengel, a veteran judge of talent and by then skipper of the New York Mets, said, "The Jewish kid is better than Walter Johnson."
<br />
<br />Washington Post sportswriter Jane Leavy captures Koufax and his times by interviewing scores of those who knew him from his Bensonhurst days to the present.  She keeps two interesting narratives flowing in her text, alternating between the Koufax biography and an exceptionally detailed, fascinating account of the September 9, 1965 perfect game Koufax pitched at Dodger Stadium against opposing hurler Bob Hendley and the Chicago Cubs.  The game was doubly fascinating in that it came close to being a double no hitter in that Hendley gave up only a scratch blooper single to Dodger outfielder Lou Johnson, who had earlier scored the game's only run.  The run occurred after Johnson had walked, been bunted to second, stolen third and run home following a throwing error by Cubs' rookie catcher Chris Krug.  
<br />
<br />To Koufax and those who followed him, the breaks he received to enable him to win his perfect game in a regulation nine innings were payback.  In his initial World Series start in game five in Los Angeles of the 1959 match up with another Chicago team, the White Sox, Koufax performed brilliantly in a pitcher's duel with Bob Shaw in which the game's only run was scored by Nellie Fox while the Dodgers executed a double play.
<br />
<br />As someone who had a rare gift of throwing a baseball at tremendous speeds and velocity a Catch-22 resulted.  The act of repeatedly engaging in such a physically unnatural feat resulted in debilitating injury.  
<br />
<br />At the peak of his career teammates could barely stand to look at Koufax's grotesquely swollen left arm following a game.  He quit at the end of the 1966 season, realizing he would never be able to use his left arm eventually and would be in acute pain regularly if he did not hang up his cleats.  He racked up Hall of Fame statistics and was able to retire at the youthful age of 30.  When most players quit it is after their peak skills have sharply eroded.  Despite enduring increasing pain Koufax's final year was his best as he chalked up a career high of 27 wins against 9 losses wth a sparkling 1.73 earned run average.
<br />
<br />Author Leavy provides sharp insight into a joint act engaged in with the Dodgers' top right-handed starter Don Drysdale that changed Major League Baseball permanently.  Up until 1966 team owners held a commanding advantage over players.  After Roger Maris,  broke Babe Ruth's home run record with 61 round trippers in 1961, he sought to bring his businessman brother to Yankee Stadium to help negotiate the following year's contract. The Yankees declined to allow him to sit in on the meeting.
<br />
<br />In the cases of Koufax and Drysdale, General Manager Bavasi and the top Dodger brass previously used psychology to play the star pitchers off against each other.  If Koufax walked into a negotiating session and a contract was mentioned with opposition, Bavasi would respond, "That's funny because Drysdale said he would accept that amount."  He would do the same when Drysdale appeared for a contract discussion.
<br />
<br />Drysdale's wife Ginger posed the suggestion that the players jointly negotiate their 1966 contracts.  They decided to negotiate as a team, and as holdouts had to convince management that they were willing if necessary to abandon their careers.  At one point they both signed to appear as actors in the suspense film "Warning Shot" starring David Janssen.  Before shooting started, however, management saw the light.  After all, it was a proven fact that more fans materialized when they pitched.  It was said that Koufax drew an extra 10,000 customers when he took the mound as a starter.
<br />
<br />The daring Koufax-Drysdale negotiating ploy was the first major step in what would result in the creation of a Players Association headed by lawyer Marvin Miller.  Koufax and Drysdale would accordingly be classified as labor heroes whose efforts assisted those players who followed them into the major leagues.           </span>
