                    <span>I've really enjoyed my copy of this book.  My husband and I have had fun hashing out the theories and haven't shelved the book since I received it as a gift 5 months ago!
<br />
<br />I particularly like the research that the various authors invested in their essays.  The meticulous documentation in some of the essays is honestly astounding and means that one can't help but take seriously the ideas put forth, even if the reader ultimately disagrees with the conclusions drawn.
<br />
<br />In addition, the wide variety of essay topics meant that I was guaranteed to find something that got my brain whirling with the possibilities.  For example, The Knights of Walpurgis was a great analysis of the roots of the Death Eater movement; essays on Fred & George had me taking the characters more seriously as their strengths were analyzed, particularly their consistent devotion to family; and essays analyzing Neville Longbottom caused me to rethink my perceptions of both his history and his future importance.
<br />
<br />I think, though, that what I enjoy most about this book is that there is no right or wrong; no absolutes.  This is simply a collection of well-thought-out essays drawn up by fans as crazy as I am who want to hash out the possibilities together.  
<br />
<br />I would most certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys analyzing the "what ifs" behind this series.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a great collection of essays that really make you think and are a nice refresher course on all things Potter pre-book-six.  There are a wide variety of topics and writing levels, from charming observations by 8-year-olds to talk of time travel and quantam physics that will make your brain melt at the complexity.  Truly something for everyone!  It's also a treat to read such discussions in organized book form instead of surfing for hours through online forums to find similar writings.
<br />
<br />In a few places the theories are stretching credulity a bit, but it's all in fun.  Most of the essays are excellent and well-researched.  The information on world mythology, history, and other real-world topics is fascinating, and many facets that are explored are ones that aren't often looked into in the fandom.  In more than a few places I literally put the book down and said, "Whooooooooa!" aloud because a theory or observation just blew my mind.
<br />
<br />My only complaints are a few typos that a little extra editing could have taken care of, and a bit of repetition in topics.  The essays on time travel and Mad-Eye Moody were all good, but did we need multiple pieces on these topics at the expensive of others?  The Potter universe is so vast, varied and deep, and there are tons of other characters and topics that I would have loved to explore in this format.  Instead of two essays on Moody, I would have preferred one on him and another on Lupin, for example (or any other character who is more or less ignored in this book).
<br />
<br />I also found it a bit odd that the only real "shipping" essay (putting characters into romantic relationships) centered on the Harry/Hermione pairing, while no other pairings got any in-depth dicussion.  Shipping is a huge part of the online fandom, and although it was nice to see it acknowledged in a published work I would have preferred to see a broader treatment of the topic.
<br />
<br />But these are small complaints, really.  Overall I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to any Potter fan.</span>

                    <span>I have been looking for this book now for 6 months now! I've read the Ultimate Unnoficial Guide and Book 5 Hints, and I'm a HP slueth. (I have the card to prove it!) I'm so happy! I also can't wait for the 6th book. Now I have to save up enough money for 2 books now that I found this! :) YAY!</span>

                    <span>The Plot Thickens... Harry Potter Investigated by Fans for Fans is an anthology of literary criticism essays dissecting the nuances of the first five novels of the wildly popular Harry Potter children's fantasy series. Here are questions poses and issues explored by fans, for fans, probing everything from the secret of Severus Snape's popularity among readers to common debate topics among readers, to the query "Who is the Half-Blood Prince" in reference to the title of the currently forthcoming sixth Harry Potter book. The Plot Thickens is not authorized by "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling; its ideas and conjecture will stand or fall to the test of time. A most enjoyable repertoire of shared experience and emotion from literate fellow readers, and the next best thing to read if one just can't wait for the next series installment.
