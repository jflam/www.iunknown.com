                    <span>Even though "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater" is well written, the story falls flat and also lacks the humor you'd come to expect from a Vonnegut novel.  The message of the story is beyond cynical.  The economic classes exist for a reason, and even though wealth being handed down to subsequent generations may seem unfair to most, it is the way of life and should be respected as such.  This book carps on an issue that is just totally unfair to those who work hard for what they have, and they should most certainly have the right to pass it down to their sons and daughters.  Doesn't posterity mean anything here?  Maybe not.  I do agree that the rich deserve to render a small amount of their wealth to the lower classes, but only through a fair taxation system.
<br />
<br />In an ideal world we would have more Mr. Rosewaters, mad with philanthropy, giving away their wealth as if the money would never end.  Unfortunately, that's not how it is.  That being the case, all of us should not hate those who have just because they don't lavish the have nots.</span>

                    <span>Eliot Rosewater was the scion of an extremely wealthy family- his grandfather had even married a Rockefeller. Eliot stood to inherit control of the vast family fortune through the Rosewater Foundation (a legal entity constructed to shield that fortune from taxation.) But then Eliot went off to WW2 to become a highly decorated Captain of combat infantry. He served with men from all walks of life. Oh yes, he also accidentally bayoneted a 14-year old non-combatant, and afterwards tried to throw himself under a truck. After this he was never the same, much to his rich and powerful family's distress. While he did come back to graduate from Harvard Law and assume control of the foundation, he started behaving...irrationally. He started to actually use the money to HELP people! He also started drinking, wandering, and visiting volunteer firehouses- among other eccentricities. 
<br /> 
<br /> Eventually, he ended up in Rosewater, Indiana- a depressed backwater that his family had long ago used up and abandoned to found the beginnings of their fortune. He found the people there to be without pride, without hope, without work. So he opened up an office over the liquor store in order to help anyone who needed his help. The sign on the door said simply, "Rosewater Foundation: How Can We Help You?" So Eliot Rosewater, philanthropist, poet, volunteer fireman, Harvard graduate, and drunk proceeded to help any and all that came to him for help. 
<br /> 
<br /> Needless to say his family could not allow such insanity to continue. Why even Eliot's psychoanalyst came to the conclusion that Eliot was a pervert. The nature of his perversion being the fact that he had channeled all his psychic energy into bringing Utopia to earth for all those in need. What could be more abnormal in modern, capitalist society? 
<br /> 
<br /> This is my absolute all time favorite Vonnegut novel- and I have read them all. 
<br /> 
<br /> Oh yes, it also offers one of the best descriptions of the absurdity and injustice of the class system in the U.S. As one of the characters asks, who does run this crazy country? These cr**ps sure don't. </span>

                    <span>After greatly enjoying some Vonnegut sci-fi, I was perhaps looking for the wrong thing with this book.  It is a weird story about a nutty millionaire, who is in danger of losing his money to an assembly of the sleaziest twits you could possibly imagine.  While there are many very funny asides, such as his love of Kilgore Troustian conceptions or the characterizations of the evil guys (one's posterior is "luminous when wet"), the plot is weak and far-fetched.  For example, Rosewater's  grandfather built his massive fortune by buying companies in accordance with their acronyms from the Bible's text!  That is too silly to be satire.  Moreover, Vonnegut's laments about the coldness and brutality of American capitalism are sentimental and even ignorant.  He seems to have an obsession with rich people and money.
<br />
<br />Not recommended.</span>
