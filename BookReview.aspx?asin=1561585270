                    <span>I would not consider this a beginner's book at all, although, a do-it-yourselfer with some inclination towards electricity could and would definitely benefit from having this book as a reference.  I enjoyed reading this book because I didn't have to wade through the waters of electrical theory just to pick up tips of the trade from another pro. It's enjoyable and pleasant reading and someone who has worked with electricity (I am a licensed electrian) can enjoy Mr. Cauldwell's "electrical humor" while maintaining respect for electricity.  I believe this book is "for pros by a pro, and, in reading it, you might be abe to obtain an overall, different perspective in which to execute electrical installations beginning with choice of tools, color-coding wire, selection of products, or, simply toting your tools around in a little red wagon vs. carrying them on your hip.  I also appreciate his "theme" of safety throughout the entire book.
<br />There is nothing I didn't like about this book and I received a "red wagon" full of ideas and tips for a more than reasonable fee.  Thank you Mr. Cauldwell! </span>

                    <span>I know nothing about anything having to do with a house and despite my good understanding of physics in theory, the reality of electrons actually "moving" through wires both baffles and scares me.  Though based on other reviews and on the content of this book, this is probably an excellent reference for someone who can and is actually going to do the job her/himself.  Unfortunately, there is much variation among even professional electricians and I can imagine that this book would help any one - pro or DIY'er to do a top notch, above code job.  For me, it will really guide us, once we are able, in choosing and working with a professional electrician and the inspector to have our house rewired and grounded in the best way possible.  It's very nice to have such a credible and thorough reference so that even though this is not at all our area of expertise, we will be able to make informed decisions to assure the electrical security and functioning of our home.  On the down side, for those of us who live in an old house, the wiring looks nothing like what's described in this book or most others.  So, it's a great book to have for anyone, professional down to the most uninformed, electricity-handicapped consumer who nonetheless must pay an electrician for some work or other, when it comes to dealing with modern wiring or rewiring issues but it's pretty useless for figuring out what to do in an old house especially if you can't afford to rewire immediately according to the guidelines set forth in the book (in which case, the book leaves you with the feeling that your house is a fire trap on the verge of erupting into flames as the cloth insulation on all your old wiring erodes and you have wires burning up and ungrounded electricity shooting all over the place but that's not a reason not to get the book for the excellent purposes that it does serve.)  One thing the book also leaves unanswered is how much of a fire hazard really is anything other than the best practices that the author recommends, particularly if one doesn't live in an area where lightening is that much of a problem?  The houses in so many of these neighborhoods have been around for over 100 years with no grounding wires and probably rotted out insulation and all sorts of other problems yet it doesn't seem that much of a problem. </span>

                    <span>I am a homeowner who has done dozens of minor and major electrical projects over the last 20 years. 
<br />
<br />This book is full of practical tips and details I have not seen in the basic books. I wish I had read it years ago.
<br />
<br />Not the best starter book, it's for those who want to go beyond the starter books.
<br />
<br />Cauldwell has and conveys a deep understanding of the electrician's work. His many insights and "Above Code" sidebars help you do a better job than your $60 an hour electrician would do.
<br />
<br />Heavy emphasis on mechanical tips...fishing, drilling, etc. which is usually the most challenging part.
<br />
<br />Excellent photos and illustrations.
<br />
<br />I don't give it 5 stars because there's too much missing. How many conductors are permitted in size X conduit? What gauge wire do I need for 50 amp service? What if it's a long 100+ ft. run? Can the ground wire be a smaller gauge? The book desparately needs reference tables for this kind of stuff. 
<br />
<br />There are no tips for pulling wire through conduit, bending PVC conduit, or outdoor wiring in general.   
<br />
<br />Too bad, beacuse in many respects this a masterpiece. </span>

                    <span>I researched a lot of electrical books and wiring books before I commenced my wiring projects.  Luckily, I found this one.  The book is packed with outstanding, USEABLE, knowledge on beginner to intermediate level electrical projects.  There were also numerous helpful diagrams that were clear and concise.  I highly recommend the book, the best one on the subject that I've found so far.</span>
