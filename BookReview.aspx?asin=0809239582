                    <span>I've been coaching girl's basketball now for four years.  In the beginning I knew nothing.  I was just a parent who stepped in.  But now I feel like a good coach.  I bought a lot of books and videos, but this is the one that is really helpful and that I come back to again and again.  It is really aimed at recreational youth basketball -- grades 3-6.  I'm not sure it would be useful to coaches at higher levels, but then again, the basics are still the basics regardless of your level.  If you want to help young kids improve, and you want to be a better coach for youth basketball, this is your book.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">This book is great for new coaches of inexperienced players.</div>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for an inexperienced coach of young players. The author has coached at all levels and can relate exactly how to coach both experienced and inexperienced players.  The recommended drills  are tied into an overall game strategy as the book progresses.  I would  recommend this book to anyone who would like to get started coaching  basketball for beginners and any moderately experienced coach who needs a  good reference book for the basics.</span>
