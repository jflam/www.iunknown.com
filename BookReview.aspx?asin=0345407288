                <span id="Label1">General Powell may have undertaken this book as a form of paid political test marketing, but it turns out to be a success of an altogether different kind. We don't learn from this book if Powell is presidential material, but his recounting of the various steps of his career give us an unrivaled view of the ins and outs of military bureaucracy and shows how the modern American military, with its consistent emphasis on can-do attitudes and actual results, is a much more congenial place for realizing one's talents than our still-alarmingly pigeonholing general society.</span>

                    <span>Least we have forgotten, Colin Powell's autobiography reminds us why American is still one of the greatest countries to live in, especially if you are an immigrant. And, how if we work hard, stick to our values we can achieve the great American dream like Powell did.
<br />
<br />It was with great reluctance that my husband parted with his copy of this book. I literally had to pry the copy away from him to read. My husband has been deeply influence by Powell's optimism and hard work and often quotes one of Powell's statement, "optimism is a force multiplier."  I had listened to the audio version of the book, and wanted a chance to read it.
<br />
<br />Powell's American Journey has been mimicked by many people, who have have found great fulfillment and happiness in the US. In this book, Powell shares in a candid manner how his hard-working immigrant parents helped him go to a school where he was an average student, and how his stint in the army helped shape him and his future. 
<br />
<br />This book is an inspirational one, and reminds us how we can achieve our dreams if we set our goals and heart to it.
<br />
<br />The book is also about leadership, and what it takes to become a leader. Leaders are often made, and not born and this is clear in Powell's case. No one would have imagined that an average immigrant boy from Harlem would rise to become an important cabinet member in the US.</span>

                    <span>I learn much about General Colin Powell by reading this book.  The book is well written and provides me with enough information that I was left me feeling that I know the General personally.  The book revealed the side of the General that most of America can identify.  I am able to sense the his pride my his accomplishments (the Buffalo soldier statue, providing the house that his wife enjoyed, his daughter performance, his son choice of career, etc.).  I would not have ever invision him working on a "busted" car for resale. </span>

                    <span>I used to 'despise' Colin Powell for he was one of the few people to oppose U.S. military action against Serbian terrorists who while wearing police and army uniforms slaughtered hundreds of thousands inncoent people's lives in Croatia,Bosnia and Kosovo. 
<br />'He must be a pro-serb" - I thought and that's what spurred me to read his autobiography - hoping that in it there might be clues why and how come a grandfather in power do nothing or create obstacles when people's lives were at stake. 
<br />To my greatest surprise, as I read his book he became my hero! 
<br />There's no limit to my respect I have for him now! Because he is the best example of what SUCCESS or I shall better say, what LIFE is all about!
<br />Obstacles to him were not holes that people get stuck in them all of their lives. To him obstacles were nothing more then Challenges. He was discriminated and intimidated because he was black but that didn't make any difference on him. To him that meant Challenge, again.
<br />
<br />His autobiography is over 600 pages. The three long, yet very fast days, that it took me to finish Colin's book - were definitely my best reading days ever so far. Colin writes so honestly and so beautifully that he made me feel that I know him and his lovely family personally. 
<br />No Stephen Covey or Anthony Robbins or any self development writers can raise your self-esteem better then Colin Powell - my hero.
<br />Remember his over 600 pages book is a re-readable book. There's heaps to be learned not only about success, him and his family but about other people too such as President Regan, Bush and so many other prominent figures.
<br />

                    <span>Back in the early 90's, I didn't understand America's love affair with Colin Powell.  It was only after he was named Secretary of State by George Bush that I read My American Journey, originally published in 1995.  While the book obviously doesn't provide much insight into Powell's sudden about-face in early 2003 on whether to invade Iraq, it does provide a great deal of background and context to allow Americans to understand that Powell probably felt he exhausted his options and had no choice but to support Bush's policy or to resign.  It also makes plain Powell's disdain for Dick Cheney.  Clearly, Powell did not expect to be working again so closely with Cheney when he published My American Journey.<p>Powell's lessons are inspirational.  There is a reason that Colin Powell is one of the most admired leaders in America, and his autobiography makes clear that he cares about his troops and his employees.  Strange, then, that he would have forced his Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs to "retire" in 2002 rather than stand up to the pressure he must have been under from the press and other government colleagues, including, perhaps, his boss, in the wake of numerous visa scandals.  That she was one of the most respected and successful Foreign Service Officers shows that even such bigger-than-life heroes as Powell are only human after all.<p>My American Journey includes some of Powell's setbacks as well as his achievements.  His vignette about a poor efficiency report he received at a crucial stage in his career helped me deal with a similar run-in with my boss.  I practically quoted Powell to my boss, but was a bit more active than Powell has himself come across.  (Powell essentially resigned himself to finding a new job.)  In the end, Powell's first rule prevailed: "It ain't as bad as you think.  It will look better in the morning."</span>

                    <span>Upon  reading  "My  American  Journey," I  felt  an  enourmous  sense  of  pride  for  the  United  States  of  America.  Secretary  Powell  is  an  example  of  what  people  can  be  become  through  hard  work  and  determination.  In  his  autobiagraphy, Powell  allows  the  reader  to  become  aware  of  the  challenges  this  country  has  endured  and  how  he  has  over  come  obsticles  that  have  been  placed  throughout  his  life.<br>     Powell  lets  the  reader  become  aware  of  where  he  stands  on  various  important  issues  that  have  been  part  of  both  United  States  international  and  domestic  policy.  Even  if  one  does  not  agree  with  him  politically, we  can  all  gain  from  his  sense  of  respect  and  devotion  to  ones  country.  This  is  a  must  read  for  any  one  interested  in  the  life  of  a  great  American  hero.</span>
