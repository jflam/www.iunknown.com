                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>   <p>   ASP.NET 1.0 is the final release of Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP). It is a powerful server-based technology designed to create dynamic, interactive, HTML pages for web sites and corporate intranets. ASP.NET is a core element of Microsoft's exciting .NET vision, building on the strengths of the .NET Framework to provide many new features not seen in previous versions of ASP.   <p>   This book, entirely revised and updated for the final release, will provide you with a step-by-step introduction to ASP.NET using VB.NET, with plenty of worked examples to help you to gain a deep understanding of what ASP.NET is all about, and how you can harness it to build powerful web applications.   <p>   <b>What does this book cover?</b>   <p>   In this book, you will learn how to    <ul>    <li>Create basic ASP.NET pages with VB .NET    <li>Understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming    <li>Work with data and XML    <li>Debug and handling errors in your code    <li>Use ASP.NET Server Controls    <li>Create user controls and components    <li>Explore the world of Web services    <li>Optimize performance    <li>Secure your application    </ul>   <p>   <b>Who is this book for?</b>   <p>   This book is aimed at relatively inexperienced web builders who are looking to enrich their sites with dynamically-generated content, and want to learn how to start building web applications using ASP.NET. Developers who have a little experience with previous versions of ASP (and are looking to move over to ASP.NET), may also find this book helpful in getting a simple grasp on what ASP.NET is, what it does, and how it can be used. Experience of basic HTML is required, but previous experience of ASP or VBScript is not essential. We'll be teaching the basics of VB .NET in this book, so prior experience of the language is not required.    </span>

                    <span>First of all, a good number of my undergraduates like this book as it introduces the bare bones required to get something up and running quite quickly. The downside of the book, from my persusal of it, is that it is less even than it could be, or perhaps should be. In many chapters (especially the crucial early ones) examples are often introduced and developed before their key constructs are properly explained. This is simply confusing to naive readers and highly irritating. For instance, the earliest ASP.net script uses "asp:label" without explaining the syntax or semantics for a another few dozen pages. <P>Unfortunately this is a bit of trend throughout the book and at the very least makes it frustrating. However, once you allow for this, (and it's a big allowance to make) the book is very handy. <P>It has bundles of scripts that anyone involved in web work will find interesting and useful. You can quibble with some of these (the login scripting for example) contra other books such as Professional ASP.NET, but I suspect this is a byproduct of committee authorship. <P>The book is clearly aimed at the learner so don't expect Enterprise quality insights into server management. Given the huge range of architectures and technologies available to the developer, producing any 'true' learner book is a considerable challenge. If you need a book for coursework alone, then this will probably meet most of your needs. If you earn your living with the .NET and its companions, then you need some supplementary texts.</span>

                    <span>The book is for complete beginners who have no previous experience with ASP. Some experience with HTML is helpful but not required. This book will teach you everything you need to know in order to create dynamic ASP.NET web sites.<P>The first part of the book will familiarize you with the basic functionality of HTML, XML, ASP.NET, the .NET Framework, and Visual Basic .NET. You will learn how each of these technologies can be used together to create flexible web sites.<P>The second part of the book introduces the concepts of object-oriented programming. All concepts are explained in detail with the help of many real world programming examples.<P>After presenting the groundwork, the book then progresses to discussing the technologies and techniques that ASP.NET can draw upon to increase its functionality. These include ADO.NET for data source access, XML Web Services for inter-website communication, and Server Controls for facilitating code maintenance and reuse.<P>The final part of the book presents ways in which you can optimize your ASP.NET sites to increase their speed, security and robustness. It also offers some detailed advice on code debugging.<P>This book is highly recommended to beginners who want to learn how to start building web applications using ASP.NET.</span>

                    <span>The book is well outdated (as of mid-2004).<P>I'm just finishing the Begining ASP.NET with VB.NET 2003. This was Wrox's suggestion as the follow-on book to really understand website database development. A real waste. The Begining ASP.NET provided the same level of detail.<P>The book did use SQL Server -- a plus -- which the Begining ASP.NET book lightly covered. But, not enough to justify the expense of buying the book and even more importantly the time to wade through it.</span>

                    <span>I have been a fan of wrox books in the past, but this is not one if their better ones. The writing was poor overall, and there were times where I read the infomration three times before I eventually started to search the internet for a better explaination. The chapters on xml were useful, but could have gone into a little more detail with simple ways to data bind instead of focusing on datagrids as a single solution. As a resource, the index is useless and no glossary to organize key concepts to reference was a disapointment.</span>

                    <span>Many wrox books are great, but this one was a disappointment. As an "classic ASP" developer I found the examples unhelpful and impractical, the information spread out, the request and response object - used constantly in classic ASP - were so poorly explained I still have no idea how they function in ASP.net. I am sure that ASP.NET has many important benefits that make it superior to Classic ASP, but after reading almost 600 pages (!) I feel I do not understand how to achieve the same result I can easily get in Classic ASP. Not recommended.</span>
