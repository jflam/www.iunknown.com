                    <span>The other reviewers here are right:  this is an excellent book, well-written and concise, with coverage of just about every topic relevant to giving presentations.
<br />
<br />The book has three main topics:  establishing a stage presence; structuring a presentation; and staging the presentation.  Each is filled with useful tips.  For example, the author includes a checklist for the different types of delivery skills one needs ("extend eye contact," "vary your intonation," etc.).  The three chapters on structuring and organizing a talk are first-rate.  The author discusses how to prepare for different kinds of audiences, the process of putting together a presentation, and the principles of listener-centered communication.  Throughout the writing is clear and to-the-point.  And it's written almost as a reference guide so that it's easy to refer back to when you want to review a topic.
<br />
<br />One thing I especially liked about the book is that, unlike so many other self-help books, it doesn't have a lot of stories.  It doesn't tell you tales of what others have done right or wrong; it just gives you the how-to advice you're looking for.
<br />
<br />A highly recommended book for anyone who wants help with presentations.</span>

                    <span>When I saw the hyped-up title, "Knockout Presentations: How to Deliver Your Message with Power, Punch and Pizzaz," I winced. But I needed to find a book to teach from that really covered a lot of ground, and DiResta carries through on the promise. If you hate hype, you'll love the book. It delivers what the title promises.
<br />If you want to buy just one book to give you real help from preparing the presentation, through conquering fear, breathing techniques, using your hands, creating useful and easy-to-manage props and checking the room before you present, this is the one book that will give you all that help and more.
<br />To make it even more useful, it's jammed with tips and hints to help you succeed. It is never preachy or pedantic. 
<br />After each major section, there are checklists to go over to make sure you focus on the most important parts of the previous material. 
<br />Still more good news: The table of contents and the index are clear and to the point--you can find what you need and concentrate on just what you need help with. 
<br />Like a website, there are icons for exercises and case studies. Like the best of print books, there are fill-in boxes for those who prefer a workbook to just reading, and margins big enough to take notes in.
<br />I use this book to teach, but it's an ideal book for self-study, too.
<br />Need to lose your fear of public speaking? Need to give better presentations? Buy, read, re-read, follow this book and you will be on your way to success.   --Q</span>

It'll make you and you presentations better almost immediately.<br> <br>It gives great advice, from projecting your voice to developing a truly persuasive presentation to making the most of your visual aids. It gives actionable tips and techniques to help with each of these items, so you can improve immediately.<p>Best of all, the book is a great reference tool. It's very easy to go back and find the section on Developing a Persuasive Presentation or Knowing Your Audience (or whatever), in just a minute.

He was sold!<p>So, don't hesitate. If you spend way to much time and anxiety worrying about your presentations , this is worth every penny!</span>
