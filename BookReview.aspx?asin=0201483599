                    <span>This was the first book I purchased on openGL. This book is a very good introduction to openGL. If I might add one peice of advice to the up and coming linux Graphics programmers. DO NOT shy away from windows openGL programming books. Once you understand the concepts you will easily apply them to your linux or unix work. I think that every unix/linux openGL programmer should have this book, as well as the RED and BLUE openGL programming guide books on their book shelf. One last word. All of these books will primarily focus on understanding the concepts and to do this they spend alot of time working with the GLUT libraries. It will be up to you to figure out how to integrate this with QT or Motif. However....this book does have a section on openGL programming with Motif....if you use QT however you will be learning on your own. It isn't impossible or even that hard. It does however require a good hacker like approach. One last word while on the subject. You might also want to purchase a good book on linear algebra or mathematics for computer graphics if you plan on rendering more than a few simple programs.<P>Good luck to you.</span>

                    <span>Back when I was learning GL, this book was the best. It covered the basics at a good level of detail. Almost as if Mark could read our product requirements, it also has appendecies on off-topic-to-GL-but-not-to-us topics, such as the X input extension and graphics overlays. <P>I believe GLX has gone through a few revisions since this book last had a new edition. Therefore some of its data may end up referencing deprecated old glx functions instead of the slick new method. In particular I'm thinking I saw something about visual selection changing. That's the only reason I'm holding back on star number 5.</span>

                    <span>Mark has a very good way of describing how things work. I have been using OpenGL for while but not using XWindows extensions that much. This book helped a lot and I used it to make sense of some the convoluted text in other books for the wgl functions.</span>

                    <span>I think that it was a good book. This was my first OpenGL book, and I'm now purchasing more. It's good to see that there are some X Window System specific books out there. The book explains in detail GLUT, but not some other complex areas of OpenGL (Why I'm buying more OpenGL books...). I'd recommend the book for beginners of OpenGL that are frusterated with Windows-specific texts.</span>

                    <span>This book gets you up and running fast with OpenGL and X but it fails to point out how to do specific tasks. I didn't know how to use Xlib until I got this book. The examples are kinda flakey as they don't translate well to realworld programming. A ball bouncing in a box would have been a great example. Would somone please write a cross platform OpenGL manual insted of these platform specific books!!!</span>
