                    <span>This book has a lot of topics that you see at a mathematical competition, like IMO. It has Number Theory, Geometry, Games, Combinatorics and many strategies to solve a difficult and exciting problem. I recommend this book for you.</span>

                    <span>I disagree with another reviewer(Math Messiah) who thinks this is a book only for intelligent people like himslf. The problems are wide ranging and numerous and even dumb people (me, for instance) can find fun and excitement in many of them. I also have an advice for the Math Messiah who is on brink of some major discoveries: hold on to that brink, and don't drop.</span>

                    <span>I have just started working on this book recently. I've been reading through and working on the problems in the number theory section which are excellent so far. There is a good balance between warm-up/basic training problems and hard contest problems so you won't be discouraged too easily. I have browsed through the other sections and they seem very good. Must have if you are preparing for math contests!</span>

                    <span>I am best at mathematics.  I have won several national titles in my country.  I am at brink of discovering solutions to several unsolved problems in mathematics.  I got good by competions against good young mathematicians.  I think this book is very good for intelligent people, not dumb people.  If you want to improve your problem solving you will buy this.</span>
