                    <span>I have not read any of T.A. Barron's other works, so this may not be the best representation.  My overriding though while reading this book was, "Some people write for Young Adults because they can't write for the Adult market."  There were good ideas here, but the first few chapters had me wondering whether the main character was a halfwit.  As a whole, it lacked depth and development.</span>

                    <span>Though I have been a loyal follower of Barron's books before, I found this one particularly interesting. With the epic standards of   the Lost Years of Merlin, mixed in with some utterly hilarious "jokes" (for lack of a better word), this book is a grand tapestry of adventure. The only downside I found to this was it had a very obvious ending. However, for those of you who have not yet finished the book and think you know what I am talking about, you're oblivious to the obvious. Overall an exhilirating, heartfelt, legendary adventure; just what I would expect from the mighty Thomas Archibald Barron!</span>

                    <span>Now I normally don't read books and this is the first time I have written a review, but  "The Great Tree of Avalon: Child of the Dark Prophecy," is a page turner.  I believe this novel is the best I have read so far, and I hope you will find the time to read it.  It lets you enter a world of both adventure and suspense, and it has a most interesting plot.  It will also keep you guessing through out the novel.  So please find the time to read this novel, because it's worth it.  </span>

                    <span>I just started The Great Tree of Avalon: Child of the Dark Prophecy last night and I'm all ready half way through it.  It's a great book and I just can't put it down.  If you like The Lord of the Rings books or Harry Potter then I'm pretty confident in saying that you'll love Avalon.  The book is pretty easy to understand and very interesting.  
<br />
<br />The book starts out with the dark prophecy that in the dark year a child will be born that will destroy Avalon and only Merlin's true heir will be able to stop them.  The story introduces you to many very interesting characters and some intriguing creatures.
<br />
<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.</span>

                    <span>I am an avid reader and though fantasy isnt usually my pick, this story drug me in and kept ahold of me. The plot flows nicely and the characters are easily identifiable, which to me usually doesnt happen in fantasy. From the very begining you know that one child will save Avalon and one will try to destroy it but it never tells who and as you work your way through the story, meeting very different types of characters along the way, you begin to guess who is whom. A definite hit with the teens, this book will also draw in adults and possible preteens. A great read all around.</span>
