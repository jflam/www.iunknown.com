                    <span>This book is great for beginners learning Hindi. My husband is Indian and when I received this book and starting saying the words and sentences he was impressed on how quickly and correctly I could speak! Of course, I'm not even close to fluent...but it's nice to start out on the right foot! I recommend this if you want to start learning Hindi. It's a small book so great for sticking in your purse and taking it with everywhere :)</span>

                    <span>I just received this book in the mail and I love it. I work in a hotel owned by Indians and up until now, communication has been difficult. A clerk had been teaching me how to say simple phrases regarding housekeeping, etc. I can carry this book in my pocket while I'm at work. Already, I've been able to communicate better with the other workers and to remember how to say the words because the pronounciations are all here. If you want to learn Hindi, this is a good book for it.</span>

                    <span>This book is amazing. It has a ton of phrases and words. Also, the Hindi words are spelled out the way they sound and written in English so you can say them. If you still can not say something, it is written in Hindi as well so you could show a word or phase to a Hindi understanding person and they would understand you.<BR>Great Book!</span>

                    <span>This book includes common questions and phrases one would need to survive a trip to India. It's inexpensive price makes it a great bargain.<P>Expressions are written in both Devanagari and Roman transliteration. The transliteration does a decent job of conveying how to pronounce Hindi words, but keep in mind that Hindi sounds are softer than English ones.<P>'teen' (Hindi for 3) sounds quite different from English 'teen.'</span>
