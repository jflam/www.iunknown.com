                <span id="Label1">First published seven years ago-just before the World Wide Web exploded into dominance in the software world-About Face rapidly became a bestseller. While the ideas and principles in the original book remain as relevant as ever, the examples in About Face 2.0 are updated to reflect the evolution of the Web.<br>   <br>   Interaction Design professionals are constantly seeking to ensure that software and software-enabled products are developed with the end-user's goals in mind, that is, to make them more powerful and enjoyable for people who use them. About Face 2.0 ensures that these objectives are met with the utmost ease and efficiency.<br>   <br>   Alan Cooper (Palo Alto, CA) has spent a decade making high-tech products easier to use and less expensive to build-a practice known as "Interaction Design." Cooper is now the leader in this growing field. Mr. Cooper is also the author of two bestselling books that are widely considered indispensable texts. About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design, intro-duced the first comprehensive set of practical design principles. The Inmates Are Running the Asylum explains how talented people and companies continually create aggravating high-tech products that fail to meet customer expectations.   <p>   Robert Reimann has spent the past 15 years pushing the boundaries of digital products as a designer, writer, lecturer, and consultant. He has led dozens of interaction design projects in domains including e-commerce, portals, desktop productivity, authoring environments, medical and scientific instrumentation, wireless, and handheld devices for startups and Fortune 500 clients alike. Joining Cooper in 1996, Reimann led the development and refinement of many goal-directed design methods described in About Face 2.0. He has lectured on these methods at major universities and to international industry audiences. He is a member of the advisory board of the UC Berkeley Institute of Design.    </span>

                    <span>Out of reading this book, I was inspired to make many changes to my software interface that resulted in dramatic improvements to quality and usability. There are times when I wish it had more out-of-the-box solutions and concrete examples of how to design, and there are times when it devolves to ranting. But there is real help here for me as a software designer. </span>

                    <span>This book is a self-indulgent rant, that is also poorly edited and structured.  If the authors had read their own book and applied their principles to its pages, reading it would have been as much of a pleasure as using software that follows their advice.
<br />
<br />Why do I give it 5 stars?
<br />Because beneath the diatribes and soapbox oration there is a depth of experience and of thought I have not found elsewhere.
<br />
<br />The authors have considered the issue of what makes using software a pleasurable experience for the user in a depth and with a degree of insight that opened my eyes.</span>

                    <span>- Cooper & Reimann have clearly explained the steps involved in the 'user centered design' process in a logical and easy to understand manner. 
<br />- Process is the problem : The book begins by talkin about User's goals, history of interface design process and blames the 'traditional process' being the reason for rude & difficult to use products and expensive development costs.
<br />- A good book to learn about user requirements research basics, user goals, user profiles & personas, scenarios, etc.,
<br /> - The book is a must read for business teams & interface designers. This book can be used as a text book in interaction design schools too.
<br /> - Think ,whenever author blames 'developers' for bad user experience, he is blaming the usage of 'Implementation Model'</span>

                    <span>Personas and goal-directed design are great techniques for putting together a quality product and really making sure that you're building the right things for your users. In particular, this book provides a process for doing design that would help most teams do a better job of being more customer-focused.<p>Unfortunately, this book has a few bones to pick with the current ways that users work. In many cases, while I may agree with statements such as that the File menu is not strictly necessary, users of many programs already understand how things work under the hood and want to know about it directly. He sometimes preaches design as if all customers of software are and should be ignorant of the system they're working on. I write software for other developers, so a lot of the tips and advice he gives are actually things that would cause my customer to become quite angry -- they understand the system, want to work in terms of it, and want to be able to to understand how your program deals with it. There are a number of commercial software tool failures to prove the mistakes of those who've tried to force a model the designers thought was superior on developers who knew better (ever used Visual Age Java?).<p>There's also a lot of material duplicated from his earlier book, _The Inmates Are Running the Asylum_. If you're only going to read one of the two, I'd advise reading that one, and skipping this one.</span>

                    <span>The main goal of usability engineering is creating the right interface for the right audience.<p>The target field (cf. the users) of this book are developers, every programmer should have a copy, is not?<br>A software package, which is unfriendly, laughing and bashing to its user, such a package would be considered as a computer program with a bad design.  The user would not like to use it.<p>Now, I'm wondering why the so self-declared software design god of the modern times is bashing, laughing and unfriendly against the users of his product.<p>Mister Alan Cooper does not have a clue how a company works and what the background of a developer is all about.  He is bashing the wrong people.  Bad software interfaces are not the fault of the developer but the management and the methodologies that are used in most companies.<p>Developers are trained in schools and universities to produce code and to design the internal architecture.  Few of them receive cognitive psychology courses, which is needed to create five star interfaces.<br>The average management in a company, small or big just allows that developers do the graphical interface design, a task for which they were not prepared.  The outcome is indeed bad software but don't shoot the pianist, instead turn the spotlight on the choirmaster.<p>The content-worth of the book is average.  It is heavily focusing on one aspect of creating better software interfaces: design guidelines.<p>While these guidelines are important, it is not enough to create excellent interfaces.  The risk is that a developer, after finishing reading the book will think he or she knows everything about the job and this is not his or her fault but the author.<p>No words are spoiled by instance on User Profiles, Contextual Task Analysis and so many other aspects of user interface designing.<p>The design guidelines itself are mostly not new, I have read them long ago in other works and with some research you find them for free on the internet. Some guidelines-laws described in the book are even examples of bad designs, which is dangerous, at least in a way.<p>I can imagine that for an average programmer the book is still revealing, but he or she should know that other grasslands are much greener.  Best case, you have a design guideline book, nothing more, nothing less.<p>I do not know I am allowed to do this, but if you want a real step-by-step guide for creating better software you should try "The Usability Engineering Lifecycle" by Deborah. J. Mayhew, also available on Amazon.</span>
