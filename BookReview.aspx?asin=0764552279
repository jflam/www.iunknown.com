                    <span>Working at home seems like a dream for many.  The Edwards have written several books on working on home.  Their advice is sound and filled with common sense.  However, this book does not rate a 5 because it is lacking in details about individual businesses you can start at home.  They do have other home businesses books, as I stated.  These are filled with 3-5 pages at the most on some individual businesses, but does not go too far into details about each, obviously.  But for an overview of starting a home-based business at all, this is a decent book.</span>

                    <span>I will launch my business in March 2005.  I am very excited and nervous.  Yet, believe it or not, this great book calmed me right down.  It will be a wonderful reference that I go back to time and time again.  I was one of the lucky ones that actually found this book BEFORE opening the business.  It will save me from making some mistakes.  Thanks!</span>

                    <span>If you're completely clueless to running your own home-based business, this is a great beginner (hence the title "for Dummies"). I found the book to work best when you already have an idea for your business. As with similar books, it's great to have a general idea of what type of business you'd like to pursue before reading the book; it will help you better shape your idea.<p>The book did spend a lot of time talking about how to deal with family problems, creating a quiet workspace, setting work hours and how to get through a project when you have no desire. While some people might find this beneficial, it read like "filler" to me.<p>All in all, though, it's worth checking out.</span>

                    <span>I love the books by Paul and Sarah Edwards.  They were talking about small, home based businesses before anyone else and their books are thorough to say the least.  This one covers everything from the legal to the financial aspects about starting and running a small home-based business.</span>
