                <span id="Label1"><B>A true-life adventure story with everything: page-turning suspense, remarkable acts of courage, wrenching despair -- and a triumphant, life-affirming ending.</B>  <P>Picture yourself in a tropical climate, sailing out to sea with your fianc&#233;. Life is perfect; you&#146;re young and in love. Then picture everything going horribly wrong. You inadvertently sail into a hurricane, you&#146;re injured, and you wake up to find that your loved one is gone. Your boat&#146;s motor is shot and your masts have disappeared. Utterly alone, you&#146;re weeks from dry land. <I>Red Sky in Mourning</I> is the story of Tami Oldham Ashcraft&#146;s 41-day journey to safety, which she survived through fortitude and sheer strength of character. Interspersed with flashbacks to her romance with her doomed fianc&#233; Richard, this survival story offers an inspiring reminder that even in our darkest moments we are never truly alone.</span>

                    <span>Let's never hear about the weaker sex again. The riviting story of Tami Oldham's tragedy at sea will convince anyone that there is no such thing. A storm at sea swept her fiance, Richard, away to his death and knocked her cold for 27 hours. She awoke to find a demasted yacht, little food and devasting loneliness. But she pulled herself together with the help of a "Voice" and navigated across the open sea in a crippled, jury-rigged vessel to safety.<P>Even though the reader knows that she made the journey successfully one can not help but be anxious for her safety and welfare throughout 41 day voyage. When she happened to find an unexpected container of drinking water on board I could taste the sweet water and rejoiced with her.<P>A splendid read. I just caution anyone to be prepared to stay up very late reading this sad, but uplifting adventure, and to keep a glass of water nearby, because you won't want to stop.</span>

                    <span>I have just finished reading Red Sky In Mourning. I have to say that no book has ever touched me in this way. Once I started to read it I could not even put the book down. I read it from cover to cover in my first sitting and then stayed up most of the night thinking about it. The next morning I awoke and read it again-it is incredible. The book is more than a story it is woman opening up her heart and letting it all out and letting the whole world in. Tami Oldham Ashcraft writes with such honesty and clarity it is as if you were there witnessing the events of her life rather than reading about them. I laughed, I cried, but most of all, this book warmed my heart to know there is love in this world like Tami and Richard shared-what an incredible person Tami Oldham Ashcraft must be. If you are going to buy one book this year I would highly recommend this on. I have already read my copy several times and will more than like read it several more.</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful book, by a courageous woman. As I read the book, I felt that I was there with her during her struggles and triumphs. And the ending is very positive and doesn't leave the reader hanging. She's overcome a great deal in life at a young age, and has gone on to become a very solid and interesting wife and mother, I suspect. Yes, the book describes a real tragedy, the kind of thing that a sailor prays to avoid. However, there are real lessons to be found, such as equipment and design flaws aboard her boat, as well as the 'human factors' which she discusses openly. I've made purchases and upgrades to my boat (I liveaboard and cruise fulltime) based on her book and her lecture at the Annapolis sailboat show. Just buy the book, and you won't be sorry!</span>

                    <span>This is an intense and riveting story of talent, guts and luck. I would have left out some of the slightly gooey romanticism, but it's her story, not mine. <BR>She does a great job narrating on the audio cassette.</span>
