                    <span>This book is totally dissapointing. The authors have no knowledge of aviation business. All the book is just ass-leaking of SWA. They should have done more research just to understand how airline business work.
<br />
<br />The book repeats and repeats the same. It is just honoring of SWA. SWA has no flaws, SWA is the best etc. And there is no explanation why it is best. It is just abstract explnations from textbooks on Leadearship etc. There is no logyc connection between the statements they make and the results they come to in this book.
<br />
<br />If you have too much money and time to waste, and you are a masohistic type of person who likes to be dissapointed by some stupid mediocre unprofessional writing by people who do not know anything the thing they write about - this book for you. Otherwise - just forget about the book called "Nuts!" by Freibergs and look for another good source of information about SWA.</span>

                    <span>I am a Life-Quester, always looking for adventure, passion, joy, and richness in life. What I've discovered is that I have to get out of the cave of my own little world and my own limited experiences and become enriched by the worlds and experiences of others. I use to be an adrenaline junky - now I am a total life passion junky. What does all this have to do with Southwest Airlines? Everything. When I can experience other persons in a process that transforms their lives, that creates a phenomenally successful business of unsurpassed value and service to their employees, customers and stockholders, that energizes, frees, and tickles everone it (they) touches, I am transformed too. <p>Drink, swish, and swallow the power of SWA and the SWA story in. Then, if you are open and ready, let the creativity flow in you of how what they have done, do every day, and the fun and fulfillment they experience and bring to others open you, your team, your company, your agency, your life up to new wonders and successes that are waiting there, have been waiting, and will always be waiting just around the corner, for you to discover them. <p>Thank you SWA. Thank you Kevin and Jackie.</span>

                    <span>This book does provide a nice overview of what is probably the greatest success story in the airline industry. The thing is, I wish the authors had dug a lot deeper. Other airlines have been jealous of Southwest's success and its relationship with its customers and employees for years. And no noe seems ot be able to get to the bottom line of what they do oprationally and financially that makes them a success. Maybe there is nothing more, it's all just a matter of oeprating efficiently and keeping employess and customers happy.<p>In fact, many start-up airlines now use Southwest as their template for operating. The authors do a good job of reviewing the history of the company (at least up to the point of publication) and discussing the operations of the airline, but they just don't seem to dig deep enough. Maybe what is needed is someone with a strong financial background to do a comparison of Southwest's methods directly with those of its competitors, because I would really like to see the difference from a financial analysis standpoint (then again, that might be an awfully boring book). <p>My only other negative criticism of the book is that it almost turns into a fluff piece, cheerleading a little too heavily for Southwest. But that is almost understandable. After all, Southwest has rarely made a misstep in all its years of operations.<p>Regardless, this is a very good look at a truly wonderful operation. Well worth reading if you have an interest in the airline industry.</span>

                    <span>Southwest's very non-formal, non-traditional, non-business way of doing business. How do you turn a profit in an industry that has never turned a profit but is vital to our economy? The answer is different from every other company in the industry. This book is a must read for anyone who is in charge of projects or people. Southwest encourages creativity and is the most flexible company in the airline industry which alows them to adapt to situations much like their pasenger turn around time, record breaking. Of course it helps when your employees literally luv their work.</span>

                    <span>If you have not heard the story behind the success of Southwest Airlines, and it did not just happen over night, then this is the book for you. The theme of the free nuts and low price service is driven home with example after example of the "radical" approach that is part of their "standard operating procedures". The folks at Southwest Airlines are real. There is no reason to expect that they will not continue to succeed. The passion for life and service is what drives their success. It is significant that their stock ticker symbol is LUV. The only fault I find with the book is that it is overlong. The stories are seemingly never ending. Reading the first several chapters is enough to get the point. If you want, you can take these steps to your own life and business. There is nothing magical about nuts that confines it to Southwest Airlines. That more people and companies do not adapt this approach is what is nutty!</span>
