                <span id="Label1">The Visual QuickStart Guide series from Peachpit Press is known for  boiling topics down to the essentials, and presenting them in an engaging and  efficient way, to get the reader up to speed quickly. In applying this model to  XML, author Elizabeth Castro had her work cut out for her.<p>  Fortunately for her readers, Castro has identified successfully the core  components of XML, and presented them in a streamlined way. This book doesn't  tackle any of the advanced elements of XML technology, such as SOAP, SAX, or  integration with the Document Object Model (DOM). Instead, it focuses on  teaching the basic nuts and bolts of creating XML documents, styling them, and  defining their structure.<p>  This book moves at a fast pace. Document Type Definitions (DTDs), for instance,  get only 30 pages of coverage. This tight format comprises simple examples that  illustrate commands and concepts, instead of pages of text. The pages are  presented in a two-column format, so that code fragments can be placed (wisely)  side by side with the step-by-step explanatory text. Each topic example is  supplemented with one or more useful implementation tips.<p>  For a true grasp of XML and all of its potential, you'll need to follow up this  introductory tutorial with more reading on the applications of the technology  and case studies. But this little book is a great way to learn the basics of XML  in a weekend. <I>--Stephen W.

                    <span>The best way to teach a beginner (myself) how to write code is to consistently illustrate the code with examples that can be modified and used in various circumstances. As she has stated in the introduction of the book, this is not an advanced book on XLM for developers but a project manager's book to understand the language of the developers when they are talking and even understand the code being developed. This book follows the same type of verbiage and examples from her previous book, HTML 4, so the transition from very easy. This book delves into the basics of XLM, DTD, Schema, XLST, Cascading Style Sheets and some more topics for the reader to discover.<BR> The price of the book is affordable for anyone trying to step into the new World of coding language.<BR> Have fun coding.</span>

                    <span>With over 60 new books on XML set for release in the year 2000, it seems like another XML book would not be that big of a deal.<P>Well, that might be true if it were an XML book from anyone other than Elizabeth Castro and Peachpit Press.<P>Castro, the author of two other bestsellers, HTML for the World Wide Web and Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web has the rare gift of being able to take extremely complex subjects and render them into understandable terms for just about anyone. In her newest book, XML for the World Wide Web, Castro scores a direct hit in being able to convey the ins and outs of XML and all of its aspects in a way that makes it unique, usable and useful.<P>Castro tackles Schemas, DTDs, Namespaces, XPath, Xlink, Xpointer, XSLT, CSS used with XML and just about everything else being discussed, implemented, debated, planned or argued in the constantly changing world of XML. That's not unusual for an XML book. However, Castro actually pulls it off extremely well, resulting in a very very very good book for those about to immerse themselves in the complexities of XML. That is unusual. Many XML purists will point to Simon St. Laurent's "XML:A Primer" and Benoit Marchal's "XML by Example" as being definitive "first XML books." I would agree, to a point. I have both of those and they are indeed excellent 5-star books but I honestly think that Castro's book will be more digestible to more people not well-versed in XML. <P>Critics, if any, might argue that XML for the World Wide Web is too basic or doesn't cover this topic in extreme detail that way or this way. That's not the point of this book. If you are already working in XML, you'll probably have a shelf full of advanced Wrox or Que or O'Reilly books on XML anyway that are very detailed. No, this book is truly for those just starting out who want to or need to actually learn XML and how to use it. And in that capacity, it succeeds on a grand scale.<P>Castro's HTML for the World Wide Web, now in its 4th edition, has become an industry standard. It can be found in every bookstore across the US and in many many college classrooms. Her Perl & CGI book accomplished the same thing for its target audience. I think that it can be said that XML for the World Wide Web will achieve the same lofty status, becoming the third jewel in Castro's triple crown.<P>I have no gripes at all with this book. But, I do have one suggestion that doesn't detract from the excellence of this work. In XML for the World Wide Web, Castro devotes Appendix A to XHTML. My only suggestion would be that perhaps she should instead consider making the 5th Edition of her HTML book an XHTML book, since HTML 4.01 was superseded by XHTML 1.0 almost a year ago. But again, that's only a suggestion.<P>In conclusion: XML for the World Wide Web...great price, great book, future standard!<P>I recommend it highly to those in the early stages of their XML careers.</span>

                    <span>This is a decent reference guide, but uncomfortably out of date. While the author keeps her site updated for latest changes, why buy a book when you need to read the most up to date info online anyway? The book is an excellent bargain, but a free online tutorial (on oreilly for example) is a much better deal. The best intro to XML book I've read is still Beginning XML (WROX--wait for the 3rd edition if you can, the 2nd edition is still more recent and more useful than the VQ guide).</span>

                    <span>XML, as is explained in the book, is not ready for web pages. However, web page developments are evolving toward XML. Elizabeth Castro explains what that future would look like. This book is for you if you are thinking ahead in your web page development; I found it to be very helpful in understanding how XML will fit into the future. Don't bother reading it if you don't know and don't care what style sheets are.</span>

It gives me principles and examples in very helpful ways. Each example is worth my time, because Castro thinks them out carefully and makes them useful on more than one level.<BR>XML continues to change, so I consider the publisher's website as part of the book. Their online updates are better than most.</span>
