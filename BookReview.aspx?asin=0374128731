                    <span>While more of a hard-cover pamphlet or essay than a book, Scott Turow's "Ultimate Punishment" is a good look at the key issues involving capital punishment in the United States.  The book is drawn from Turow's experience on a commission created in 2000 to review capital punishment in Illinois, a state that clearly had problems and inconsistencies in its use of the death penalty.  This commission indirectly lead to Gov. Ryan staying the excecutions of 167 prisoners on death row in 2003.  The book's brevity serves Turow well, in that he doesn't get bogged down in certain narrow arguments (particularly concerning statistics related to deterrence) relevant to the debate.  Further, there is no moral grand standing.  He takes the concerns of both sides in earnest, but eventually comes to believe that the death penalty should cease to exist.  He writes and argues clearly and convincingly for his position, I think a great number of Americans will agree with him. Turow believes that eventually the United States will do away with capital punishment.  His book marks a further step in that direction.     </span>

                    <span>Scott Turow shows us the illogicality of the death penalty by telling of his own experiences as both a prosecutor and as a member of a task force assembled to inform the governor of Illinois on death penalty policy.  Contrary to what many people may think, the book does not condemn the death penalty for moral reasons but on the basis of the ambiguity with which it is exercised in America.  It would be too absolutist to say every American should read this book, so I will limit it only to those Americans who feel the death penalty has a place in our society and legal system.  I doubt they will come away so staunchly in support of capital punishment and all that it entails.</span>

                    <span>I am not the type to offer a verbose review.  Suffice it to say that this is an exceptional work of non-fiction that offers arguably the most balanced view to date of the U.S. system of capital punishment.  I am a reformed death penalty proponent who went through a period of Turow-esque "agnosticism" before settling firmly on the side of opposition.  I am no longer ambivalent.  The death penalty should be abolished--period.  Though Turow's book had no effect on my change, it did help solidify my current stance.  This book should be required reading in any course of study dealing with the criminal justice system, and I do plan to use it in the future in the college criminal justice courses that I teach, along with Scheck, Neufeld, and Dwyer's "Actual Innocence."  Perhaps the powers that be will eventually wake up and smell the stench of injustice . . . but I'm not holding my breath. . . .</span>

                    <span>Rendered with his fictional writing flair, Turow has tackled a subject matter that literarily deals with life and death. In this short though thorough essay, the novelist reflects on the many arguments surrounding the death penalty. In March 2000, a Moratorium on executions was declared by the then Governor of Illinois, George Ryan. Turow, along with many distinguished lawyers and academics, after two years of deliberation, submitted their recommendations. As a result of these findings, Ryan made international news by commuting the sentences of 167 persons left on death row. (This made headline news in Australia as the death penalty here was abolished over forty years ago) It should go without saying that this was a bold move by the Governor and potential political suicide. However he was at the end of his tenure and decided to make a choice and act on that choice. This book summarizes the many aspects of the Moratorium's deliberations, which makes fascinating reading.
<br />
<br />Before the Moratorium, Turow admits that he was a "Death Penalty Agnostic". In other words, the man was a fence sitter, refusing to make a stand either way. However, after two years on the committee, and by the end of the essay, if asked whether Illinois should retain Capital Punishment, his answer is a certain, no. After reading the many reasons for and against the debate, I found it understandable why he fell off the fence. That the system is fallible and the fact that, for the most part, we seem to be hard wired for revenge, it has been all too easy, in our zealousness for justice or retribution, to execute innocent people. This has occurred far too many times for any government to be comfortable executing its citizens. But of course, as Turow plainly points out, this issue is a complex one, which begs to be further unpacked, potently analysed, in order to make it law, either way, across the boards.
<br />
<br />From my reading, the actual recommendations from the committee are reasonable and fair. For example, ensuring the videotaping of all questioning of a capital suspect conducted on a police facility; that the eligibility criteria for the death penalty is narrowed to five points; that the death penalty is not available when a conviction is based only on the testimony of a single eyewitness. (p. 122) The Moratorium did not want the death penalty abolished entirely, however, these recommendations are designed to ensure an innocent defendant stands a lesser chance of wrongful execution.
<br />
<br />Turow writes great novels about the law. In this case, he has approached a subject that absolutely requires further debate. And he has done it with honesty and enthusiasm with a novelist's flair and elegance. Good reading.
