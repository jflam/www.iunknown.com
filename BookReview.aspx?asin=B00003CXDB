                    <span>To watch this movie in Moscow in 1988 as a student was a liberating and exhilarating experience. Here is the capitalism close-up, warts and all. And we loved it. In three more years the Soviet communism will be dismantled, free market hurriedly introduced, and some of my friends and fellow students will proceed to become very rich people themselves. I did not know then, that Gordon Gekko, a villain who incidentally was much admired by me, was a thinly veiled portrait of Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who incidentally was a son of Russian immigrants, became a center of the biggest insider trading scandal and government investigation in the 1980s, which let to the collapse of junk bond powerhouse firm Drexel Burnham. However, I knew that Gekko must be much more than a villain, otherwise how this ugly character could be so attractive? Of course, a huge part of it was a superb acting by Michael Douglas. But watching this film now, 17 years later, gave me an opportunity to ponder more on the subject from a different perspective. I think now that Gekko's character is archetypal and has the same qualities as Bulgakov's Woland from `Master and Margarita'. He is the Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand seducer, not just some greedy upstart and `faux bonhomme'. But one of the qualities of Lucifer is that he `brings out the light', he helps to illuminate things, partly because of his own darkness. Untimely, in the movie it was his turbulent encounter with Gekko, which helped Bud Fox to find his character and, in a way, redeem himself.  So in some strange way, the movie is a Wall-Street-version of age-old story of Faust.</span>

                    <span>What can I say that hasn't all ready been said? This movie was great,it captured the greed of business to the T! I have been in sililar situations,and have dealt with people who were seemingly cloned from Gordon Gecko.So I am able to relate somewhat.
<br />
<br />If you haven't seen this movie,do yourself a favor and check it out...GREED IS GOOD.</span>

                    <span>...way back in '87, created a little morality play called Wall Street that packs quite a punch. Some films become dated when they deal with relatively recent eras - this one is set during the 80's junk bond fueled bull market. This one doesn't suck, in fact it seems to have improved with age, somehow. Flash forward to the Enron, corportate CEO scandals, and its themes are as relevant as ever. Douglas creates one of the most memorable villans in recent film history in Gekko the Great, investment banker/robber baron.  Great script, performances, and direction - and some classic one-liners from Douglas. If you don't like Douglas, Stone, or either of the Sheens, see it anyway.  If you saw it back in the '80's it's a great film to revisit. Wall Street is a classic.     </span>

                    <span>'Wall Street' must have some authentic merit given the amount of brokers and actual convicted insider traders that worked on the film. Oliver Stone's father was a Wall Street broker from a previous era. In fact Oliver Stone has been a fan and a supporter of the Wall Street world in which he grew up if anyone had taken the time to read any interviews with him. The difference between his father's time and the 80's financial world he was documenting was a rise in the culture of speculation, a system which in relation to his father's business values, creates and produces nothing for society. Indeed Hal Halbrook's character is Stone erecting his father's ghost, the voice of old Wall Street, where capital brought industry, peace and reason.
<br />
<br />Ironically the rise of high profile busts for insider trading in the 80's may have more to do with a more stringent form of policing rather than a rise in financial greed. Reagan took his eye of corporate mergers, allowing the SFC to concentrate on the brash yet ultimatly small fish of insider trading. As corporate mergers got larger and larger, hostile takeovers skyrocketed and the rise of the parasite financers living off the buying selling of others was here to stay.
<br />
<br />Gordon Gekko's "greed is good" speech has been quoted in more T.V., newspaper and magazine retrospectives of the 80's than I care to remember. There are few characters in modern cinema who have had such a divisive response. Seen as a villain by many and a hero by many others. Gekko is a perfect symbol of the economic and political divide of the 80's</span>
