                <span id="Label1">Microsoft Windows scripting support has taken off recently, and Thomas Eck has done a lot of useful work at the cutting edge of this technology. In <I>Windows NT/2000 ADSI Scripting for System Administration</I>, he documents the Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) as they apply to systems administrators interested in using Component Object Model (COM) objects written in Visual Basic to automate administrative tasks. Because this book is backed by such a considerable development effort, administrators of large Windows NT and Windows 2000 networks will be able to put its ADSI solutions to profitable use immediately. <p> Though he does provide a conceptual introduction to ADSI and the services implemented in Active Directory, Eck's book is all about code. Code listings appear in quantity. It's one recipe after another, collectively covering hundreds of administration tasks, with minimal commentary on each solution. After all, this is a book for system administrators, and the idea is that they're not so much reading to become programmers as to see the assortment of tools they can use to solve problems. <p> Though more explanation of the code wouldn't hurt, administrators will be very pleased with the work Eck has done on their behalf. Typical solutions include scripts that add a user to a group, retrieve a computer's processor type, enumerate the groups a user belongs to, and reset all locked-out user accounts in a domain, plus a pair that start and stop an Internet Information Services (IIS) site. Many more scripts populate the pages of this book and its supporting Web site. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Active Directory and the Active Directory Service Interfaces version 2.5 (ADSI 2.5), with emphasis on programs that manipulate users, groups, computers, services, and various resources automatically. Other programs perform administrative work on the Internet Information Services (IIS) metabase, Internet sites, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) services. ADSI and VBScript references appear as appendices.</span>

                    <span>Basically this book takes the MSDN SDK on ADSI and provides examples of all the methods available for each interface. This provides the reader with many excellent code snippets that can be quickly applied. However it's light on the theory behind the COM calls and how to expand the code for further use. I was able to follow all the code fairly easily because I had already read Simon Robinson's book "Professional ADSI Programming- Active Directory Services Interface". My recommendation for those who really what to get a good understanding of ADSI and Windows 2000 that you read Robinson's book first. While some reviewers criticize Simon's book as being too wordy I found it very helpful. That being said this book will get you going relatively quickly...</span>

                    <span>I am revising this review as I again return to this book. I am constantly surprised just how good this book continues to be. With all of the poorly written and just plain wrong computer books out there, this book continues to be a lifesaver.<P>When I need to find out how to do something in ADSI, I go to the index, within a couple of minutes I have a prototyped, mostly working application. This book is worth every penny I paid for it and then some.<P>This book has so many different examples that I went through and wrote a management application just by taking the code snippets from it and combing them to do what my application had to do.<P>It doesn't explain the differences between NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 implementations. But, it does cover most of the functionality built into ADSI. Also, there are some things that are built into ADSI that are counter-intuitive, but the author goes into a sufficient amout of detail to get you going on your way.<P>It is the best treatment of ADSI I have come across both from an administrators point of view and a developers.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book I have used so far on ADSI. The book presents a huge amount of sample code, objects, properties, and methods which act as a source for developing scripts to manipulate network objects. The data is not only provided in Visual Basic format, but also in VB script format. Many underlying priciples of how the code works and what parameters must be met for successful implementation of ADSI scripting are explained. I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>This book will prove invaluable to those who deploy multiple web sites in a redundant environments. If you are deploying web applications over mutliple servers and would like to get away from using the MMC for creating each and every web site then I would recommend getting this book. The book clearly explains how to write automated scripts that can be used to deploy web sites to a single server, or across an enterprise. Creating a web site includes multiple tasks such as FTP accounts, FTP virtual directories, Web site virtual directories and more. This book explains each facet clearly and you can pick and choose the parts that you want to sew together to create an automated system. Now, the only thing I'm wishing for is an ASP book that is written as well so I can create a web interface for the scripts I'm creating.</span>

                    <span>Avoid this book if you can...<P>The author tries to get away with repeating the same paragraph and example over and over and over, and not have to actually explain anything. You finish the book with a lot of code snippets, which are of very little use unless you either know the subject (in which case you wouldn't have bought this book in the first place), or you are trying to do exactly the kind of work described in the book. This is nothing but a cookbook, and a bad one at that.<P>A seemingly hefty reference closes the book. But a closer examination reveals that it's no more that a quick listing of properties and methods (with little distinction made between the two) of some of the ADSI COM interfaces. The text and reference are exclusively VB oriented, and will frustrate all but the most inexperienced programmer. <P>If you are the kind to cut and paste JavaScript code and then go on to call yourself a programmer, this book is for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.</span>
