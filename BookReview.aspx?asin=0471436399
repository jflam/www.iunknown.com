                    <span>This was the first book I have purchased on the subject of real estate investing in multi-family properties.  I have been and interested in the subject for some time however.  
<br />
<br />I found the formulas and rules the book includes to be invaluable, and used them to create Excel spreadsheets to quickly analyze the hundreds of multi-family listings available.  I found the book to be easy to read and understand.

                    <span>This book is very informative if you are a beginner to the multi family world.  For anyone that has already dealt with multi family, then you do not need this book.  However, Berges other book, real estate finance is a good review for the seasoned apartment owner.  In that book he goes over some key performance and efficiency ratios that everyone should be aware of when dealing with multi family properties.
<br />
<br />The book covers the general ideas behind multi family properties but of course it will differ by region slightly.  The cap rates that he speaks of are not available in say california but might be available in indiana.  Overall a good book for beginners to intermediate but definitely not seasoned investors.</span>

                    <span>This book devotes a fair amount of time on valuation from a beginners standpoint. Overall good, easy and quick read. The case studies and examples appear a stretch. The author suggest that the sweet spot is to find a property with 20% vacancy, a few minor cosmetic issues. It then claims that that by leveraging a 80% LTV, the owner, in a short period of time can increase the vale and sell for a healthy premium. Hmmm... I want to see Steve Berges try this in Chicago or New York metro areas.
<br />
<br />As a relatively new property investor, I found the book useful and would recommend to others. I purchased and downloaded the software at thevalueplay.com which is adequate to complement the book's instruction bias. However, buyers beware, these are password protected Excel spreadsheets with macros and without the ability to add formulas, change things here and there, they are useless.

                    </div>
                    <span>Out of all of the real estate books I've read over the years, this is by far one of the better ones.  The author stays focused on the topic of buying and selling apartments and does it in a way that is easy to understand.  Let me emphasize that when I say the book is easy to understand, that is not meant to imply that only the basics are covered.  Not only does Berges do a great job of explaining the mechanics of the process, but he also mixes in a lot of personal examples which help the reader to connect the dots between pie-in-the-sky theory and real world applications.
<br />
<br />Steve Berges concludes the book with an inspiring and motivational chapter he refers to as the 5 Keys to Success, which he points out are not limited to just real estate, but can be applied to any business or profession, as well as to one's personal life.  I thought this section was very well written and gave me cause to reflect on my own course in life.
<br />
<br />I've read several of the author's other books as well, all of which were good, but I particularly enjoyed The Complete Guide to Real Estate Finance for Investment Properties.  Wow...what a great read!  It's about time somebody wrote a book that really deals with the financial aspects of real estate (see my review).</span>

                    <span>The author, Berges, provides unique insight into investing in apartment buildings.  There isn't much written about this topic, and what is, seems to be very generic.  This book, however, provided lots of good examples with specific advice on what to do and what not to do.  In addition, Berges sprinkles various tidbits of information throughout the book that while not directly related to real estate, are nevertheless quite relevant to being successful in it.  I just finished another book of his, The Complete Guide to Investing in Rental Properties, which I also found to be very enjoyable.</span>
