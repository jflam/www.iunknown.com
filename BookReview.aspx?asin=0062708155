                <span id="Label1">Three of America's top-rated golf instructors have come up with a technique that customizes body type to swing type. The "LAWs" of the title <I>The LAWs of the Golf Swing</I> reflect those types: "L" for leverage (average build with average flexibility--think David Frost or Annika Sorensam); "A" for arc (tall with maximum flexibility--think Davis Love or Michelle McGann); and "W" for width (thicker torso and minimum flexibility--think Tom Lehman or Meg Mallon).  Mike Adams, T.J. Tomasi, and Jim Suttie first help you identify which group you belong to, then offer a series of lessons and drills to help you construct the appropriate swing to minimize your natural deficiencies. In other words, they build on what you can do while at the same time assist you in getting out of your own way. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>I thought this book was very, very difficult to follow. There are not enough photos for the descriptions that the author tries to portray. He explains how to grip the club, but doesn't have a photo to show you exactly how to do it. There are practice tips in the book, but again, photos are missing. Also, trying to follow the body type test proved to be a challenge. There were several details left out and I ended up guessing on what the author meant. Again, a person cannot rely solely on the text when learning something so physical as golf. Even Ben Hogan stuggled to match the text with pictures(5 lessons). A person (a least me) requires a lot of photos to understand exact positioning of hands, legs, feet, etc.. <P>This book gave me some things to try, but it is not the ultimate golf swing book as far as I'm concerned. I don't think that Mike Adams revealed any hidden secrets.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book. Suttie, Tomasi, and Adams do a great job explaining how the golf swing really works. Most great teachers would agree with the material presented in this book-It is the only book I have read that dosen't contradict what another book says. I compared the book to Golf My Way, and The Modern Fundamentals of Golf and both correlate with what The LAWs of Golf Teaches. In his book, Hogan writes, the shorter your arc the more quickly you need to get your left hip out of the way." That fits quite nicely with the LAWs Theory. The book also adds to the theory that the golf swing is a chain action, which was proposed by Hogan in his book, by telling how the position of the left foot influences how quickly the energy in your lower body is transfered up through the club. As a tall flexible arc player this book has helped me understand my game for once. Now I know why I have a tendency to come from the outside and have fixed that amazingly quickly with the help of the Laws model. In my opinion the book is a must for every golf enthusiast.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent. There is so much depth and detail into each of the swing descriptions. The swing drills are very good and doing them correctly is easy as there is adequate feedback usually by using a prop such as a chair. <P>Very few books explain the relationship between the hips and the arms the way this book does. The book tells you how to customise your swing so that your hips and arms do not out race each other - ie if the hips outrace the arms then the arms are late resulting in a slice, or if the arms outrace the hips the clubface will be closed resulting in a pull. It starts to become clear that most poor shots are caused when the timing of these two components do not match.<P>I found some of the tests where you are supposed to determine what body type you are a little confusing. Therefore I was not totally sure what type I was, although the book says that the amount of flexibility you have should be the most important aspect in determining your type. <P>There is so much depth in the explanations regarding how each swing type should swing the club. In particular the drill that made the biggest difference was the drill for starting the downswing for the leverage player. I do agree with the comments from the other reviews that more pictures would have been more helpful.<P>I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I am an avid reader of golf books and golf theory, and am also an avid consumer of golf lessons. I recently managed to confuse myself terribly with all of this information, much of which is conflicting. One book or instructor would suggest "A" and another would suggest a very different "B" for things like the takeaway, right elbow position, moving of the head, etc. This book explains why "A" is good for some people, "B" for others, depending on their body type and flexibility. They develop three models, leverage, arc, and width, for three different body types and levels of flexibility. No one fits any of the model perfectly, so they introduce a number of variables (foot flare, ball position, stance width, etc) that will customize the model for your physical strengths and limitations. This may sound complex, but it is the clearest and most straightforward golf book I have ever read. If you are a student of the game, you will already be familiar with many of the techniques and golf truisms they discuss. The real strength of the book is that it resolves the conflicting advice and truisms we have all heard so many times, and pins down what will work in your particular case, and what will not. I broke 80 for the first time in 3 years after reading it.</span>

                    <span>With all of the tips found in books, in magazines, on TV, etc, a golfer needs help to decide which tips will help, which tips will hurt, and which tips will do nothing. This book is that helper.<P>The book describes how physical attributes determine how each person is able to swing a golf club. Each body type (leverage, arc, width) is suited to a particular swing. The book explains why using a single model swing to fit all body types is a mistake. I'm primarily a width player, but all of the books and magazines that I read seem to be arc or leverage oriented. Even in my lessons my swing coaches would try to fit me into the leverage player mold. Now having read this book, I understand why some of their advice worked and why some didn't. I'm now better prepared to diagnose my own swing problems. Best of all this book gives every golfer a blueprint for the swing best suited for them and a way to customize that swing.<P>The explanation aren't always crystal clear, and the authors should have spent a little more effort in describing how the various elements of each swing type feel. If nothing else more pictures in the swing sequences would have greatly enhanced the explanations in the book. However, after experimentation on your own or consulting with a swing coach (ie: take a lesson!), you should be able to figure out what's being described. <P>I finally feel I know what I should be doing throughout the entire swing and know where to change things based on my ball striking. I'm hitting the ball better than ever, but better yet, when I make a mistake I know why and what to do to fix it! I don't feel like a failure now just because I haven't been able to duplicate everything my swing coaches have suggested based on a "perfect" swing model.</span>
