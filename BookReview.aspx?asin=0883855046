                <span id="Label1">Cryptology, the art and science of 'secret writing', provides ideal methods to solve the problems of transmitting information secretly and securely. The first half of this book studies and analyzes classical cryptosystems. The second half looks at the exciting new directions of public-key cryptology. The book is fun to read, and the author presents the material clearly and simply. Many exercises and references accompany each chapter.</span>

                    <span>After nearly 2000 years of being an esoteric branch of pure mathematics, number theory has found an application. And an important one it is. The expansion of the network of the global economy now forces most organizations to send data over public information lines. Without precise, secure encryption/decryption methods, financial trading would be substantially reduced if not essentially halted. Mathematics has indeed come to the rescue in this regard, providing precise, essentially unbreakable codes that are simple to use and understand.<BR>All of cryptology is covered in this work, from the simple substitution cipher to the RSA algorithm. Techniques used to break codes are also demonstrated. Very readable, it is fun to examine the simpler codes and attempt to crack them. The level of mathematics required to understand the material is quite low. Simple algebra and knowledge of modular arithmetic are all that are necessary .<BR> It is probably impossible to understate the simplicity of the RSA encryption algorithm as well as overstate the importance. It is amazing to think that such a simple procedure can guarantee security even when the opposition knows how the encryption was done. This explanation of the RSA encryption methods is the best that this reviewer has ever seen.<BR> Exercises appear at the end of each chapter and it is very unfortunate that no solutions are given. This is a book that can be read for fun, and such books should provide answers to at least some of the questions.<BR> Occupying a niche in the halls of the ivory tower of pure mathematics for nearly two millennia, number theory now forms a pillar of modern society. This book is the best explanation of how the pillar was constructed that is available today. It should be read by all who look down on "applied" mathematics.<P>Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission.</span>

                    <span>My friend and I did a project for school on Cryptology and Albrecht Beutelspacher was our savior!!!! If it weren't for this book we would have flunked. In "Cryptology," Beutelpacher has the most amazing pictures which make cryptology fun and easy! I would recommend this book to anyone. Good Job Albrecht!</span>

                    <span>This book is great for learning about codes! I could never have done research on codes for a math class without it! Albrecht is a great author and the visuals were very entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in cryptology!!</span>

                    <span>I taught a 3-week course on cryptology to academically gifted high school students and I found this book to be the perfect source. It is very clear and actually quite entertaining to read. And yet, I was so happy to see that no good mathematics were sacrificed.<P>Each chapter ends with 20 or so exercises which are doable and really help one to gain a fuller understanding of the concepts involved.<P>I would highly recommend this book to both the lay person and the professional mathematician who are interested in an introduction to cryptology.</span>
