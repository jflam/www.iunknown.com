                    <span>Finally a widely recommended book that live up to expectations!
<br />
<br />If one was just to take a quick glance at the cover their hesitancy to read a book seemingly only about a fish would be understandable but such a face value evaluation of the book sells it far too short!
<br />
<br />Far than just looking at Cod this book rangers across the ocean of human experience and can teach us much.  The struggles of finding a place for the past within modernity was a major theme throughout the work with a constant stream of unemployed or underemployed fishermen.  It isn't often that those of us who grew up thinking that food just magically appeared in our downtown supermarkets are confronted with the question of what responsibility we have to those groups of people who's work made modernity possible - but who have since become marginalized by that same force; namely fishermen and farmers.  This is not the major purpose of the book and no easy answers are given but it was certainly a striking aspect to me personally because of what a mess of a problem it is and how many factors get tangled up in it from political to environmental concerns.
<br />
<br />Likewise I believe my fellow supermarketers will get a new perspective on man's relationship with food throughout history.  Today I decide what I want to eat based largely on whimsy - what I want I can get; in the past the process was inverted with the supply driving the equation not demand.  Cultures were shaped by not just the availability of food sources but by the types of food that were available.  So interesting seeing the differences between those "fish cultures" and more agrological ones.
<br />
<br />Don't let the fishy subject matter deter you from reading this wonderful book if you aren't really of the outdoors persuasion.  While like most kids growing up I have done my share of summertime fishing I wouldn't consider myself a fisher by any stretch of the imagination but it didn't matter because this book is about so much more.  The writing style is also very engaging, I never got the feeling that Kurlansky was reaching to fill up an entire book about Cod - if anything I felt that he could have gone on a lot longer but restrained himself for literary purposes.
<br />
<br />The amount of trash being published these days makes this book's excellence stand out all the more!  A must read!</span>

                    <span>Cod is not for every reader, reflecting as it does the author's deep interest in history, and how individual foods relate to history. What the book gives to thoughtful readers is true context along with its detail. Kurlansky drives home a real point: you cannot separate the fish from the men who risk and lose their lives to extract it from the sea, nor can the food be divorced from the dollars it represents. In culinary terms, I was inspired to start cooking with dried cod; it's the kind of thing you don't notice in your supermarket until something--this book in my case--sticks it into your consciousness with no going back. As a real "foodie" and an incurable history buff, I am thankful that writers like Kurlansky go to the trouble of applying their talents to subjects like this.<p>Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at www.stylegourmet.com</span>

                    <span>This book is another interesting and informative, but narrow subject history book of the type this author prefers to write.  In some sections it poses as a cookbook.  I was irritated by the amount of text actually devoted to Codfish recipes, when what I purchased was a historical type book .  The author has a very good writing style.  The book covers the early history of some cultures that took advantage of this bottom dwelling fish prized for its unique white meat.  The Codfish affected these early cultures as it still does today, where regional and national economies are suffering from the impact of worldwide diminishing Codfish stocks in spite of some sporadic conservation measures.<br>      This reader recommends ignoring the all too frequent codfish recipes interspersed with the good historical information. This book makes for a fine compact interesting history of man's relationship with the Codfish.  Ignore the historical section and I suppose it would be a passable Codfish cookbook.</span>

                    <span>Overall, I thought Cod to be an "ok" read. It's strongest points were the inclusion of historic references to cod, images, and recipes - a novel approach for a non-fiction work. I also found the stories of contemporary cod fishermen (who aren't allowed to fish!) quite compassionate and the history of Basque fishers-of-cod both enlightening and surprising. <p>However, Kurlansky was often repetitive with his cod anecdotes, and I found his writing style to be a bit cumbersome and slow. I'm a big fan of John McPhee's work, which exemplifies the essay as poetry, and I had hoped that Kurlansky might offer a new, strong voice in the non-fiction, natural history essay. I was a bit disappointed that the central text read much like an undergrad research paper. I do plan to read his recent book Salt because I find the subject premise intriguing. <p>If you like eating fish or fishing, are interested in how natural and human history intertwine, or are simply a fan of nature writing, I would recommend giving Cod a try.</span>

                    <span>I read both Mark Kurlansky's Cod and Salt books. I recommend Cod book for those who are not hungry yet not too full since it's full of recipes that makes your mouth water.... Not recommemded for people who are hardcore Red Sox fans since this author writes certain sentences that might offend a little about Bostonians' favorite baseball team. I think Salt book is better for those who do not want too much recipes on cod. However, Cod book is worth the price if you ever lived around Newfoundland, New England, England, Iceland, or places that fished cod.</span>
