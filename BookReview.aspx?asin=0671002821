                    <span>The day after her 43rd birthday Ann Linnea (and her brother-friend, Paul) begin circumnavigating Lake Superior by kayak, a 1200-mile spiritual and physical journey of 65 days. In order to complete this passage, and move onto the next phase of her life (which includes leaving her husband of 21 years), the author struggles to overcome physical and emotional limits while battling raging seas, bitter winds and freezing temperatures. Her desire to understand the changes she needs to make lead her on a search for life-affirming answers, and ultimately allow her to find purpose and meaning in her life. The insights she shares enable the reader to bear witness to her transformation as she faces self-doubt, life-threatening danger and exercises her choice to live. A marathon runner and cross country skier, Linnea is no stranger to the elements, no idle pursuer of physical challenges. Her life lessons are learned through her body. In the summer of 1992, Ann Linnea became the first woman to circumnavigate Lake Superior. Her experience with "She-Who-Is-The-Biggest" changed her life. The telling of that experience is both moving and meaningful.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book expecting it to be a book about not only a woman finding herself and understanding the place where she was in her life better but also a book about kayaking around Lake Superior (a trip I'm about to embark on next spring). I was not disappointed by the Spiritual nature of the book (even if it was a bit too New Agey for me) but I was disappointed by the lack of good kayaking stories (other than the obligatory toughness of the trip type stories). I was also surprised by how "unexpectedly harsh" the author found Lake Superior and the lack of real knowledge of the lake she possessed (especially since she lived on the shores of the lake in Duluth, MN). Anyone preparing to make this trip should have been better prepared for the fickleness of Lake Superior and anyone who actually lives on the lake should have known this wasn't going to be your summer camp paddling trip. Like many other reviewers, I did find her whinning a bit much at times. BUT overall I found this book enjoyable, touching at many points and made me anxious to start my trip at Sault Ste. Marie in June. (Picky-Nicky note here: This town is called "The Soo" by us native Michiganders and not "The Sioux" as the author spells it in the book..it is a local shortening of Sault Ste. Marie pronounced "Soo Saint Marie", not named after the Indian tribe)</span>

                    <span>My book club selected this, and I will admit it should generate lively discussion, if only because some of us will hate it, and some will like it. Personally, the new-agey spiritual narrative nauseated me. This lady whips out her personal altar at the drop of a hat; she is "stunned" by personal revelation to such an extent I wonder that emergency rooms around the lake weren't on high alert for her presence; she finds signs in things most normal people wouldn't even notice. While she writes about a spiritual journey,and personal transformation, ultimately, this is a story about a frustrated housewife who is figuring out how to get on with the rest of her life and needs a slew of new-age speak to get there.</span>

                    <span>Ann's book was inspiring to me - her vivid descriptions of Lake Superior country and the inner landscapes she traversed helped me journey within myself as I read. It was an intimate and poignant story that I enjoyed very much.</span>

                    <span>Ann Linnea is a woman of great courage as evidenced by her ability to persevere on what has to be described as a monumental vision quest. Her book is a courageous act also. She allows us into her thoughts and emotions, gives us an honest look into what was going on "inside". I felt it was a privilege to be able to go on this journey with her. <P>We need more women role models who are willing to risk and "tell it like it is" especially for younger women. I celebrate her willingness to share it with the rest of us.</span>
