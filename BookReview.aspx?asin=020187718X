                <span id="Label1">This popular book provides a detailed comparison of object-oriented, process-oriented ('structured') and data-oriented ('relational database') software design techniques.  All code examples are in C++.  Several, very detailed, case studies are included.  The book illustrates the practical benefits of CASE tools, and includes a complete CASE tool on the associated CD-ROM.  The book includes complete coverage of the software development process, from analysis and design to coding and testing.</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend NOT to get this book. Not only he used to be my Professor from Leicester University. It's like a telephone book furthermore he make something simple to be more complex.<br>Sorry sir.</span>

                    <span>I am using this book for a course I am taking on C++ and it is almost useless.  If your looking to get this book this learn C++, don't!  Please, try another title.  I found that the book does not get detailed enough on  several different topics.  This book is definitely aimed at the beginner.   However, if you want to truly understand C++, this is not the title for  you.</span>

                    <span>Sure Structured Analysis is out of date.  Sure this book focuses alot on that.  But, I have found this book invaluable.  I am using this book in a software engineering class I am taking. The step by step instructions on  Data Flow Diagrams, State Charts, etc. are invaluable.  This book is giving  me a theoretical "history lesson" for OO prog and UML.  This book  is also a great brush up on C++ and it has decent tips on improving your  coding.<p>If you are looking for a quick reference on OO programming with  C++ I wouldnt recommend this book. If you are looking for a good book  explaining both methods (structured analysis AND oo prog) then get this  book.<p>I really liked this book.  It delivers what it says it will  deliver.</span>

                    <span>Horrible book. First off, Pont tries too hard to be funny. He's not. Secondly, he writes programs and then shows output, but he types the output himself instead of displaying the true output. Page 695 is a perfect  example. He writes: "Creating an integer stack" in the program,  yet the output says: "Creating an interger stack". Obviously,  Pont's programs do not properly compile or else he would not have to change  the output. Other mistakes include missing parentheses in various places  (page 680), wrongly placed astericks (666), and a multitude of other  errors. The worst part is the long, incomprehensible code he writes for  some examples in the book. It is code that ONLY he can read, believe me. I  highly recommend that if you are thinking of using this book for teaching  purposes, you find another book!</span>
