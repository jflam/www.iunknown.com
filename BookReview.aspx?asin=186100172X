                <span id="Label1">Peter Wright's <I>Beginning Visual Basic 6 Objects</I> takes the beginning or intermediate VB programmer into the world of object-oriented development in this easy-to-understand book. Early chapters cover the basics of objects and modeling real-world problems. Then the text teaches you how to build custom ActiveX components using Visual Basic. (Actual coding comes only after a thorough discussion of the principles of object-oriented design.) Throughout this text, screen shots and effective examples are used to illustrate key concepts, including how to use the new VB Visual Modeler tool. Anyone making the leap to objects using Visual Basic will certainly benefit from this well-organized and clearly written text. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>This is hands down the best book for learning to program Visual Basic using objects.  I know because I bought all the others and they simply left me dazed and confused.  Perter Wright's perfect sense of what to introduce and when and how to introduce it was key to my learning this subject.  Most importantly, he thoroughly documents the code in his examples so no aspiring programmer is left behind.<p>This book is simply the best of the best.</span>

                    <span>The good news is that, with the amount of stuff you learn from this book on proper object-oriented programming, you'll feel that my money was well spent. The bad news is that every application you wrote before reading this - eh, you'll want to tear them apart and start from scratch. This book is a great introduction to object oriented programming. The concepts are sound, the explanations are great. The examples [stink]. In a book where he preaches cohesion, you would think that he'd cohesively stick to developing the same example further and further.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very good resource for developers starting out in OOP with VB.  Even if you used VB, but never used objects, this book may just convert you to OOP.  It will give you a solid foundation on how to create objects in VB, and also how to develop ActiveX components/controls.  It is easy to understand, and it reads quickly.  Author uses lots of examples, so if you follow along, you'll gain a better understanding of the subject matter.  Because this book is easy to understand and it introduces a complex topic in simple terms, it will make you want to learn more about objects and will increase your confidence in what you know.  At the end of the book, there is a case study using all the concepts introduced throughout the book--it's a good idea to do the project, as it will help you develop your own solutions on the job.  The book also introduces UML, and how to make your own ActiveX controls with Property Pages. <p>This book is just an introduction, so for more complex issues like designing business objects, you will need to get some other resources.  This is, however, a solid foundation for OOP.  If you will understand and know everything this book contains, then you'll be already successful in your job.  You can always hone your skills later on as your experience grows.  <p>Buy it, if you want to understand objects, and don't want to get confused or discouraged with the subject matter because this book will really get you on a good start.  If you're taking the MCP exams in VB, then objects and DLLS and ActiveX subject matter will be very easy for you after reading this one.  This book is also used at some colleges in their OOP in VB classes.  <p>The only negative in this book, and it's a shame because this should be a "professional" book, is that it has many typos and grammar errors.  The editors did a very poor job on it.  However, if you don't mind the English, and just want the tech info, then it's going to be fine, and you'll find the errors entertaining.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book recently and I'm very happy with it.  I'm an experienced C/C++ developer and have used Visual Basic for many projects on the PC....but not with the object oriented capabilities of VB.  This book provided the necessary backgound on how to create real world applications using VB objects and provided good background on ActiveX Components (COM) as it pertains to VB.  Just enough information is provided about the theory without putting you to sleep. I disagree with the other bad comments I read about the book.  I feel the author does a great job of stepping you through all the ways of representing objects in VB.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>SYNOPSIS: I recommend this book for it's presentation of the OOP architecture and the code samples of ActiveX objects and Business Objects. Explanations are easy to read and grasp. There are plenty of simple diagrams that help visualize many of the abstract concepts of OOP. In the step-by-step instructions, there are actual screen shots of what a programmer will see when they write the sample code. DETAILED EXPLANATION OF RECOMMENDATION: I have several Visual Basic books. However, none of them give a simple, complete example of the code needed to construct an ActiveX control that stores it's state values in a property bag. I spent two days trying to write code that would store the values in a persistent property bag. Examples that I downloaded from the Web were complex, and had little or no explanation as to HOW they worked. And explanations that I found were either terse or did not give enough detail for me to successfully construct a Control with persistent state values that a user could alter during run mode then have them save to the property bag object. At Barnes & Nobles I reviewed 40 or more books on Visual Basic. In this book in Chapter 8 "Object Persistence" the author Peter Wright provides step-by-step instructions with the full code for creating an ActiveX control that maintain state information in a property bag object. There are screen shots of how the control and message boxes will appear. The explanations of what, when, where, why, and how the code executes are to the point, easy to read and understand. I only needed one chapter, 23 pages, from this book. Yet I was glad to spend the money to purchase it. Why? It is well written, easy read, has lots of diagrams and screen shots that makes it easy to visualize concepts and control objects, and gave me EXACTLY what I was looking for. I could have used a book of this quality 3 years ago when I began learning OOP on a Java platform. Bravo!</span>
