                <span id="Label1">The average person's attention span lasts about 30 seconds. That means  first and immediate impressions count, and big. In this modern-day update of  Dale Carnegie's classic <I>How to  Win Friends and Influence People</I>, former fashion photographer Nicholas  Boothman instructs you in how to mold those 30 seconds to your greatest  advantage and connect with others at business and social functions.<p>  Boothman, now a lecturer and licensed master practitioner of neurolinguistic  programming (the art and science of how the brain affects human connections),  says that the key to making others like you quickly lies in establishing a  rapport: you have to find out what you have in common or, if you seemingly have  nothing in common, purposely try to become like the other person for a short  time. He then goes on to offer simple techniques for getting a rapport going:  adopt a positive attitude; make sure your words, tone, and gestures are all  saying the same thing; synchronize your attitude and body movements to those of  another person's (which makes the person feel comfortable with you--although he  or she may not know why); and ask lots of open-ended questions. Boothman also  describes how to figure out a stranger's favored sense for receiving information  about the world--some rely on visual cues, others on auditory or kinesthetic  (touch) input--and use it to your best advantage.<p>  If discovering how to connect with others is the secret to business and life  success, as Boothman contends, then employing the strategies in this book will  make you instantly likeable <I>and</I> give you a leg up on the competition.  <I>--Nancy Monson</I></span>

                    <span>This is a quick read (less than two hours) but it has enough tips in it, that once you've finished it, you'll want to go back and reread parts of it again. 
<br />
<br />Written in an easy to understand format, it is an introductory guide to Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). If you already know a little about NLP, you would probably prefer some more advanced literature, but if this is the first time you've been exposed to these types of techniques, you'll find it to be a great introduction.
<br />
<br />A word of caution -- simply reading this book will not turn you into the most popular person on the block. However, even adding just a few of these techniques to your repertoire will help.
<br />
<br />I like to lend this book to friends preparing for job interviews. I was reading this book while interviewing for a new job. I believe it was my improved ability to quickly connect with strangers, brought about in part by using some of these techniques, which helped me to secure my new job. (One interviewer later told me that he felt like he'd known me forever. "We connected right from the start.") 
<br />
<br />Target Audience: You sometimes don't make a great first impression with people, and you wish you could connect with people quicker. The more you practice these techniques, the more powerful they become.

                    <span>Will this book help make you a more popular person?  I suppose the basic flaw of any self-help book is that the reader can readily adopt the program of a book and find the on-ramp to the Highway of Success.  The first two sections of this book amount to little more than common sense in dealing with other people.  The final section, however, gives some fascinating insight into establishing rapport using Neuro-Linguistic Programming.  Boothman writes persuasively enough, but gives almost nothing in the way of solid scientific evidence for his program (At one point, he actually says, "In my opinion, and it has no scientific basis other than my close enough acquaintanceships with more than 35 couples . . .").  He also offers the surprising revelation that couples with successful relationships share not the primary sensory preference but the secondary one, yet gives little in the way of how to determine this secondary preference in others.  One might also wonder how to deal with seriously difficult people, skilled manipulators, or more than one individual at a time.  Perhaps in a sequel.  Still, this is better than most of what passes for self-help advice.<p>REVISED VIEWPOINT:  I've recently read a few books on autism and Asperger's Syndrome which revealed, among other things, that those afflicted do not respond to body language or voice tone, unlike most people, who use those as the primary means of determining a person's intention.  I also recently read John Philpin and Patricia Sierra's novel TUNNEL OF NIGHT (Philpin is a forensic psychologist, criminal profiler, and true-crime writer) in which it is stated that sociopaths who are aware of Neuro-Linguistic Programming can subvert it to deceive others.  I'm downgrading my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book which can help make people like you in a very short time. I found it in a Book Exhibition, and decided to buy it since the title attracted me.<br>It's really useful when you learn how to attract attention of people which is very important in our daily life.<br>This book is concise, user-friendly and uses simple language for conveying the auther's message.<p>Part (1) is an introduction about the importance of the first impression.  There is an old saying which is true most of the time (The first impression is the last impression.) All what you need is to adopt a positive attitude, make sure your words, tone, and gestures are in harmony, and use your gift in organizing your speech to maintain an attractive conversation by using open-ended questions to try to discover what the other person likes.<p>Part (2) focuses on the first 90 seconds for establishing a rapport.  As Mr. Boothman said, the key to establish a rapport with people is to learn how to be like them.<p>Part (3) is talking about the secrets of interactions. I was amazed when I learned that some people rely on visual cues, others on auditory or kinesthetic (touch) input.  You just should try to discover what the other person prefers and use it to your best advantage! After doing the exercise to determine my favorite sense, it came out to be (Visual)! The author gives us some exercises for determining the characteristics of the people whose favorable senses are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. <p>Keep in you mind that your reward at the end will be the acceptance of the other person for your personality.<p>However, I agree with some reviewers that there are few points which were not clarified in this book:<p>1. emphasizing on general appearance.<br>2. exploring coversational techniques.<br>3. overcoming shyness for some people.<br>4. speaking to more than 1 person.<p>In summary, I recommend this book for anybody who is interested in the "psychology" of how to give a good impression in 90 seconds or less!<p>Well done Mr. Boothman!</span>
