                    <span>Priceless is a good book I recommend people who are interested in marketing to read. The paragraph is easy to read and understand. There are lots of examples in the book trying to illustrate some theories which are hard to explain in words only. <p>After I read the book, I appreciate some examples very much, only some small adjustments have made, the total result would be different. For example, there¡¦s an example is talking about how the product display on the shelf. Stores always place the products in a very high shelf which customers are difficult to get the one on that top of the shelf. This would waste resources if customers have to ask the staff for help in every time. So that, the store place a ladder near the shelf which the customers could get the product themselves. <p>The most interesting example in the book is talking about the dessert¡XBanana. The dessert is not a very special one, but it is very expensive and many customers come to the restaurant just for this dessert. This is because the dessert was made in front of the customers. This special serving way creates an extraordinary experience to the customers, and this the dessert seems has a special value to the customers. <p>To turning the ordinary products into extraordinary experience, one of the critical points is trying to understand the customers¡¦ needs and provide something exceed the customers¡¦ expectation which could delight the customer and make a memorable experience to the customers.</span>

                    <span>For those who think that Value is just about structuring a good financial deal, Priceless by LaSalle & Britton will open your eyes to a wealth of new areas for consideration. I found this book to be very useful and delightfully well written with good examples and checklists throughout. It's an excellent catalyst to broaden the thinking on how to improve the value of a product or service.</span>
