                    <span>This book has nearly everything a beginning student of Hindi would need or want. It offers an ample vocabulary, lots of good exercises, (with a key in the back) and its explanations of Hindi grammar are extremely lucid and well-presented. The section on pronunciation is quite thorough, although (as at least one other reviewer has previously remarked) the section on vowels gives British English rather than American English approximations. The only way out of that difficulty of course, is to get the tapes, which anyone learning a new language by themself should do anyway.<P>The one thing that I thought was lacking when I started using this book was a section that showed how Devanagari is actually written by hand. Two other books on Indian languages in the same series do show handwritten characters (Bengali, by Radice, and Gujarati, by Dwyer). However within the last year, one of the authors of this book (Snell) has published a little book devoted to the Devanagari script that does show how to form the letters. It would make a worthwhile companion volume.</span>

                    <span>If you're serious about learning how to read, write, and speak the Hindi language fluently, this is the book to get. I've never seen a Hindi book which is better organised or explains Hindi grammar and usage better than this one. The dialogues and many of the exercises form a soap opera type story about a Delhi family which makes it more enjoyable. There are also up-to-date Hindi-English and English-Hindi vocabulary lists in the back. The book does require that the Devanagari script be learnt so if you're only looking to understand Bollywood films, this isn't the book for you. The Hindi language is much better and easier read in its own Devanagari script so I would highly recommend learning it. I did not have any trouble learning to write Devanagari from this book but if you need extra help the other book "Beginner's Hindi Script" would work.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I wanted something I could listen to at work and hopefully learn quicker by just constantly listening to the CD's. The CD actually has very little English/explanations. It just reads the Hindi from the book. If you are really serious about learning Hindi, you might want to buy Rosetta Stone's computer software. It is quite expensive, but well worth the money. I found this set to be a nice supplement to that program. This book helps you read and learn how to speak Hindi quite effectively. I would highly recommend this book to everyone.</span>

                    <span>For my ministry I need to learn Hindi. I am still going through the course, but I feel this is the best teach yourself program on Hindi out there that will really teach you something without wasting your money. Buy the complete course, which is a textbook and 2 CD's. It will actually teach you what the words mean, not just to memorize phrases without knowing the individual words, so you can in time form your own sentances. The book does move a bit fast, but this is a really good, intensive course for someone who is serious about learning the Hindi language. This book also teaches you how to pronounce and read Hindi. Although I still have much to learn, already with what I have learned from this course I find that Hindi speakers can understand what I say.</span>

It is well-paced, and critically, it's also well-structured, providing focused instruction that keeps you moving forward without overwhelming you. It really is hard to fault this set, and if you are looking for a course that gets you well underway from zero, this is it.</span>
