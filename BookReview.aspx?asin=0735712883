                    <span>I have been working with Flash for over 3 years, so I have a good grounding in the basics, including ActionScript. Today I finally decided to crack it open and do some of the tutorials. I finished Chapter 1 through Chapter 12, so that leaves me right at the beginning of the Intermediate and Advanced Projects section. On page 132 there is an error. In step 4 the author has you to name the "01 - crosshairs" instance on the main stage "crosshairs_mc". Just name it "crosshair_mc". Otherwise, it won't work. Steps 6 and 8 will have you write code to access "crosshair_mc". Just thought I'd mention this.</span>

                    <span>Make no mistake, Joshua Davis is one in a few web designers out there to be a true visionary in Flash design.  So much so, that he sets the standard in inspiring web designers to exceed their own limitations and achieve their own visionary goals.  However, when it comes to tooting their own horn, Mr. Davis is his own Tower of Power.<p>"Flash To The Core" is a 352 page love letter from Joshua Davis to Joshua Davis.  I found myself feeling a bit instrusive, and at times blushing, to be reading Mr. Davis' open missives of love and praise to himself; as often as his little anecdotes and "words of wisdom" got to become more patronizing than inspiring (upon remembering that "Flash To The Core" was meant for me...and anyone else who wanted to further their knowledge of Flash). What's more, agonizing through Mr. Davis' countless self-referentials and numerous "I's" and Me's" had me come to the blistering conclusion that Mr. Davis has the inter-personal depth of a kiddie pool, and only where a hum of a computer fan is is where JD feels most comfortable, and connected. <p>I figured, if you want to be the best, then you look to the best, which is why I purchased this book.  However, after reading this "tutorial", I found that no matter how talented I think Mr. Davis is (regardless of not being very helpful), it is by no means any comparison to how talented Mr. Davis thinks he is and the contribution he has made to his own legacy (a.k.a the Joshua Davis Experience--toot, toot).<p>In short, "Flash To The Core" is an eight course dinner for Mr. Davis' minions and wannabes, however, to web designers, like myself, who want to set our own standard, it's a starter that looked good on the menu, but wasn't very filling.</span>

                    <span>Haven't bought the book yet. So you're probably wondering why in the heck I gave it 5 stars??. Well, if for no other reason,  than the fact that the author (Joshua Davis) takes the time not only to read his book's reviews, but also to write his own review (see review by Joshua Davis). Very impressive. "Flash to the Core" seems to be the one book that is always recommended for me(someone who thinks ActionScripting is a necessary evil) to buy. I have also found Kerman's "ActionScripting in Flash Mx" to be a great resource.<p>Oh yeah, sign me up for the new book by Joshua Davis with no text and images only with the cd rom in the back. :)</span>

                    <span>If you want the style book where it feels like someone is sitting down in front of you explaining the reasoning behind something while using great analogies this is the book to get. Joshua has a way of explaining things that really causes you to think "aaahhh! I got it". He does not give you a bunch of techno garbage, it's pure design how and why's. I have asked numerous top name Flash Designers on the web, how they do certain things and there response is always some stupid Socrates quote or some cosmic reason why there designs are the way they are. Just the facts please! Joshua gives it to you. Great Book!!</span>
