<br />I bought this book back in November, 2003, and have read it a couple times since. As most contemporary readers are aware, Gore Vidal has been scribbling historical novels since BURR was issued in November of 1973. He has continued his 'history' of the United States in several books since then, one entitled LINCOLN, which most people have either read or have read about in reviews.
<br />
<br />I'm always interested when I see a new tome be issued by Mr. Vidal. To me he is much like the late John O'Hara in that people seem to dislike him personally as much or more than the books he writes.  With Gore Vidal too, as with John O'Hara, feelings seem polarized with little distance existing between liking or disliking. And equally true, critics generally dislike Vidal and O'Hara books, while the public 'eats them up.' Both successful writers have sold very well as Nixon would say 'in the public arena.'
<br />
<br />
<br />Though my politics are not Democrat, generally I like Mr. Vidal's writing, and believe the series of books written by him on our country's history are of value. Whether one agrees or disagrees with what he writes, at least he writes it. Not too many American authors are interested enough in their country to even write about it. And since I am politically in line with Washington, Marshall, and other Republicans, I don't always agree with Mr. Vidal. But I do always enjoy reading his side of it. And in this book he and I agree, that George Washington only looks better the more one reads about him. Washington and Franklin seem to have been the most pragmatic of the founding fathers. If Vidal's writing here serves no other purpose than to have Franklin emerge as the giant he must have been it would have been worthwhile. As Franklin reportedly once said, "You have a republic, if you can keep it."  As Americans we have been struggling to do just that ever since.
<br />
<br />I have no hesitation recommending this book to anyone objectively interested in reading a discourse on the American experiment. Our country can only be better served through the writings of any writer as talented as Mr. Vidal when exploring not only how we originated but what we have since become.

                    <span>I've never gotten around to reading any of Gore Vidal's novels, but his non-fiction and history are dynamite.  This recent offering is a colorful and human rendition of our country's formative years.  The interplay between the giant figures of our nation's birth (Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Marshall, and others) is fascinating, and illuminative of our contemporary struggles.  And rather than come down decisively on one side or the other (Federalists vs. Republicans), Vidal is careful to lay out the nuances of each position (although Hamilton does come off as a main villain, in many ways).  
<br />
<br />Perhaps most intriguing is the dynamic of Jefferson's trust of popular wisdom.  He expected the American constitution to be torn down and rebuilt quite often, as scientific discoveries added to the great body of public knowledge.  After all, who wants to be in thrall to a beclouded past?  Franklin also expressed the view that if unchanged, the political arrangements of the United States would result in a course, cruel, and unjust society.  As recent times demonstrate, theological devotion to a piece of parchment scrawled by a hoary generation can result in social and political ridiculousness.  We perhaps need more Jeffersonians and Franklinites today, who are willing to jettison cheap patriotic fealty to the founding fathers in favor of a renewed trust in popular power and wisdom.  We clearly could use a new constitution, updated for the concerns of today.  The present version was conceived as a protector of privilege, and it functions the same today.</span>

                    <span>Gore Vidal's witty, snide, snobby, sarcastic style of writing is very entertaining and even his critics have to admit he knows his history.
<br />
<br />In this short, quickly read book, he demonstrates beyond doubt that our nation was founded, not by saints, but by a vast array of men with mutiple interests, visions, egos, and agendas. The miracle is that a flexible system of government was forged from this complex interplay of lofty enlightement philosophy with base ego centered self interests. 
<br />
<br />Vidal brings historic characters to life with tiny details, for example Abigail Adams becomes disqusted when Benjamin Franklin's mistress feeds her lap dog from the dinner table. While Washington is urging that the flimsy Articles of Confederation be replaced with a Constitution, he and his mother have a falling out. The book is full of these personal touches that bring the historic characters alive in the mind of the reader.
<br />
<br />The team work of these early founders, despite their disagreements, was fantastic. Adams charmed the Dutch while Jefferson and Franklin charmed the French.  The genius of Hamilton and Madison is balanced with the exceptional political skills of Washington. 
<br />
<br />I am always amazed when conservatives attack Gore Vidal, since he is an advocate of maximum liberty of the individual, and he will viciously criticise FDR with the same venom he would use against George W Bush.
<br />
<br />The reader is left with a feeling of wonder and amazement that our principals of government have survived despite the folly of many a generation of politicians. Vidal would have us recognize that we must remain vigilant and skeptical regarding our nation's leadership and direction. </span>

                    <span>Opinionated, erudite, passionate, witty, and manifestly sure of himself, Vidal makes himself as much a subject of the book as Washington, Jefferson, or Adams.  He is everywhere present: in his winking asides, his revolving idealist/cynical stance, and in his time-leaping comparisons of contemporary times with those of the founders. Vidal's sometimes quirky writing style includes unfinished rhetorical questions, an apparent disdain for textbook grammar, references to Shakespeare and the classicists (often in Latin), circuitously long sentences, and a tone alternating between scholarly report, detached bemusement, and profound concern (sometimes combining them into an inventive and provocative alloy). 
<br />
<br />Citing Benjamin Franklin's written opinion (delivered by a friend to the Constitutional Convention) that our form of government will "eventually end in Despotism as other Forms have done before it, when the People become so corrupted as to need Despotic Government, being incapable of any other,"  Vidal shifts immediately to a  1996 Franklin biography, "[with] significantly-inevitably?, Franklin's somber predictions cut out, thus silencing our only ancestral voice to predict Enron et seq., not to mention November 2000, and following that, despotism whose traditional activity, war, now hedges us all around."
<br /> 
<br />All of this will madden those who either disagree with his political views or who expect a traditional historical treatment.  Although Vidal obviously knows American history, the book is fundamentally an auteur's extended op-ed page or stage piece. Vidal's portrayals are a synthesis of his vast knowledge, prodigious research, hindsight perspective, and refreshingly unafraid opinion, mixing fact with both conjecture and psychological insight.  Once you accept this (or put the book down in disgust), you can enjoy Vidor's writing as you would a letter from an affectionate but outspoken family member: One who rules over discussions with a mix of fact and fancy, who educates, persuades, and regales his audience (including himself).
<br />
<br />Vidal covers the intriguing and monumental years from the pre-revolutionary era through the tumultuous presidencies of Washington and Adams (and, especially, contemporaries Hamilton and Madison), ending with a too brief discussion of Justice John Marshall and the roots of judicial review. After this always fascinating and sometimes frustrating view of the nation's founding, he provides an entertaining afterwards (as if he were finally free to really inject himself into the book) which includes a powerful anecdote about John F. Kennedy that poignantly conveys Vidal's anguish over the country he believes we have left behind.

                    <span>I enjoyed Vidal's writing.  Other people have complained that it felt jumpy, and at times, he did leap from one time period to another without an explanation.  It wasn't until I reached the last few pages that I figured out why he was writing this book at all.  I kept waiting for some mass summarization of what he was trying to convey with all of these anecdotes.  It finally came in the last chapter: he's trying to delve into what made these people such great men.  But he doesn't do it with the usual swift stroke that many authors take when they're trying to glorify historic figures.  Instead, he shows that these people were flawed and had their own personalities and agendas and egos.  But they did some great things, and he conveys that through a series of anecdotes.
<br />
<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It didn't feel like any type of propoganda, just a patchwork of stories.  It gave me insights into those characters of the early history of the Republic.  I would recommend it to anybody who would like a conveniently sized, easy-to-read book about the characters in American history.</span>
