                <span id="Label1">On July 14, 1789, a mob of angry Parisians stormed the Bastille and seized the King's military stores. A decade of idealism, war, murder, and carnage followed, bringing about the end of feudalism and the rise of equality and a new world order. The French Revolution is a definitive feature-length documentary that encapsulates this heady (and often headless) period in Western civilization. With dramatic reenactments, illustrations, and paintings from the era, plus revealing accounts from journals and expert commentary from historians, The French Revolution vividly unfurls in a maelstrom of violence, discontent, and fundamental change. King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Maximilien Robespierre, and Napoleon Bonaparte lead a cast of thousands in this essential program from THE HISTORY CHANNEL&#174;. Narrated by Edward Herrmann (The Aviator, Gilmore Girls),  The French Revolution explores the legacy that--now more than ever--stands as both a warning and a guidepost to a new millennium</span>

                    <span>There is a vast amount of information on the French Revolution that can be found in scholarly texts, recreational articles, Internet sites, as well as a large selection of documentaries that have been produced over the years. A great number of these sources are well worth a look at for the serious student as well as the part time historian. Without hesitation, this documentary should be at the top of the list, because it is not only a perfect introduction, but also an extremely well produced and informative film. 
<br />
<br />The History Channel has produced many well-made and educational documentaries over the years. One would have to admit that their Biography Series is second to none. But they have really out done themselves with The French Revolution, as it covers the numerous causes of this important insurrection, focusing on major personages in the aristocracy, the enlightenment and the key political insurgents, painting excellent portraits of Maximus Robespierre and the mad journalist, Marat, leading to their ironic and bloody ends. The Reign of Terror is depicted particularly well with all its high drama, intrigue and endless flow of blood. Interestingly, these portraits of the major players in the revolution, Robespierre, Danton, Marie Antoinette and Louie the 16th, were all done with such pathos, that I came away from the film feeling real empathy for these people, especially Marie Antoinette. This is the way history, as a subject, should be taught, evoking feelings for the people and the times under study. 
<br />
<br />The documentary combines images, well-acted scenarios and informative interviews with academics including a compelling narration - it is also very well written, as it is tremendously difficult to cover such a complex event in a short time and do it any justice. If you have any interest in The French Revolution, an event that virtually changed the world, this documentary would be a suitable starting point. It would also be a worthwhile teaching resource for students in the middle years and above.

                    <span>I glossed over the French Revolution back in junior high, but was not able to recount much years later.  Because I don't have the time to read up on French history, I decided to check out this DVD.  
<br />
<br />First off, I was very pleased with the information I received from this program.  I could easily look up the info from the web in a matter of minutes, but I doubt I could have learned as much as I did from the DVD.  Quite simply, the program is done like a story (with visual reenactments) and laced with interviews from scholars.  The result is that you're entertained from start to finish, while understanding the conflict and events that are being described.  
<br />
<br />And what's nice is that although the program isn't too long, it doesn't rush anything: we learn about Louis XVI's rise to the throne, his relationship with Marie Antoinette, and what led to their deaths.  Robespierre and Marat's background are also analyzed, as they were both major players in the revolution.
<br />
<br />In all, a great DVD to own.  I've been watching PBS and History Channel documentaries/programs for some time, and I was pleased that this production was done well.  Although I wasn't too educated on the French Revolution before this DVD, I felt that the program was done with detail and accuracy.  I definitely recommend it!</span>
