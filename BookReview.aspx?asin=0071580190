                <DIV class="ReviewHeading">Book Description:</DIV>
                <span id="Label1">In World War II, aboard the aircraft carrier <i>Saratoga</i>, Captain Robert Beebe dreamed of one day retiring and cruising the world in a small boat. At that time world cruisers voyaged exclusively in sailboats. But sailboats are confined to narrow lanes of predominantly favorable winds, which can be unpredictable and difficult. Beebe wanted to arrive at distant ports relaxed and on time, not battered and two months late. He wanted to voyage under power. <p>Back in the 1940s, no suitable long-distance powerboats existed. Beebe literally had to invent modern powerboat voyaging from scratch. The design parameters he developed for long-distance powerboats are still in use by naval architects today. The resulting boat, <i>Passagemaker</i>, was home to the Beebes for many years and more than 60,000 ocean-crossing miles. What Beebe learned in those years of voyaging became, in 1974, <Voyaging Under Power</i>, still the most important and influential book ever published on long-distance powerboating. <p>Now, under the able pen of world cruiser Jim Leishman, Beebe's classic <i>Voyaging Under Power</i> has received its first complete overhaul. The core of the book is vintage Beebe; his designs, his research, and his wonderful cruising stories remain intact. What's new are details of the advances of the intervening years: electronic wizardry for navigation and communication; efficient new engines that wring more miles out of a gallon of diesel fuel; active roll-prevention devices that virtually eliminate seasickness; propeller nozzles and bow thrusters that improve maneuverability and ease handling for short-handed crews; bulbous bow extensions that improve speed, fuel economy, and sea-keeping ability. There's an all-new section featuring the work of other designers, including George Buehler, Jay Benford, James Krogan, Jeff Leishman, Nils Lucander, Charles Neville, and Steven Seaton. Mrs. Beebe has thoroughly revised her original chapter on provisioning the long-distance galley, and there are several new chapters, including Inland Voyaging, which covers long-distance cruising on American inland waterways; Watch-Standing; and A Passagemaker's Machinery. <p><i>Voyaging Under Power</i> is the definitive guide for those who yearn to expand their cruising horizons, and cross oceans with speed and comfort.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for readers who are interested in learning about ocean passages in small motor yachts. Author Robert Beebe explains why these boats are superior to sailboats for comfort and stability, and explains the naval architecture principles that make these vessels his preferred choice for crossing oceans. That might sound dull, but it isn't. The combines practical tips on how to evaluate and/or design boats with basics on seamanship and plenty of war stories to lighten the text. The clear message is that, using this class of yacht, anybody willing to learn the basics of boathandling can learn to become an ocean passage-maker. Whether that's your dream (as it is mine) or you just want to read about it, this is a lively and enlightening book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Great book covering many aspects of go-slow, go-far boats: what to look for, how to test salesmen, how to check some basic designs, what to do while underway and how to do it, routines, etc with lots of personal examples. If you are interested in this topic and what it requires, this book is just about a "must." My only complaint, and I've only seen the 3rd edition, is the book smacks of Nordhavn advertising. Don't get me wrong, I've been on both the Nordhavn 40 and the 46, and they are unbelievably good boats. Personally, I like the 40' better even if it wasn't $120,000 cheaper than the 46: one head (if they aren't friends, don't let them on your boat!) with more headroom, better engine room, appears to need less elbow grease given the more industrial trim, and (personally) I like her looks better. Robert Beebe may have built Passagemaker for $43,000 in 1962. Nordhavn wants $429,000 for the 40 and $549,000 for their 46. The kicker? They suggest you tack on an additional $100,000 in "options" (half of which I don't really consider optional). Also recommend the "Troller Yacht Book" (ISBN 0393047091)</span>

                    <span>Beebe's Voyaging Under Power set the standard for long distance power boating. Jim Leishman, designer of the popular Norhavn 46 trawler, restates Beebe's thesis that a properly found power boat of 40 to 50 feet is capable of transoceanic travel. Considerations such as hull shape, power requirements, fuel considerations, as well as stablization are dealt with in a professional and easy to understand format. This book is a must is you are considering long distance power travel, or just enjoy the technical aspects that are involved in such an endeavor.</span>
