                <span id="Label1">There are approximately seven million horses in America. Each year, over seventy thousand are abused, abandoned, and fated to slaughter by callous and irresponsible owners. With a heart as big as a pasture, author Melanie Bowles takes some of these horses into her sanctuary called Proud Spirit. Here, horses that arrive listless and broken find a home where they finally know safety.   <P>The bond between horse and caretaker does not happen overnight. It hangs by a fine thread of trust that the author earns with endless patience and a full commitment to the well-being of the horses in her care. The horses, some of which have suffered severe abuse, astound her time and again with their ability to trust, return the love they are given, and enjoy the companionship of other horses.   <P>You will meet a whole stableful of remarkable horses:  <P>Dusty, a Thoroughbred who recovered from severe injuries to reveal a rambunctious personality and a knack for stealing hats;  <P>Maddy, an old mare, and Dancer, a gallant Appaloosa, both of whom had been isolated for years but whose ecstatic first acquaintance at Proud Spirit was, mysteriously, like the reunion of two soul mates;  <P>Annie, a little sorrel mare who will break your heart with her weary kindness and who found peace and compassion, at last, under an old oak tree in a pasture at Proud Spirit;  <P>Wrangler, a Miniature whose premature separation from his dam turned him into a tiny tormentor. His rowdy innocence helped Marshal, a huge Palomino gelding with neurological trauma, become playful and engaged as he educated Wrangler in horsy manners.    Horses of Proud Spirit is an homage to the spirit of these alluring creatures and a moving memoir of lessons learned in compassion, strength, and loss.</span>

                    <span>The Horses of Proud Spirit is a beautifully written book. The pages are full of love and pain, but throughout, Melanie's love for her horses shines through. I can't remember EVER reading a book where I cried so much! I recommend this book to anyone who loves horses and the true spirit that resides inside them. The cruelty of humans toward animals is a fact of life, but Melanie shows through her words that love and patience can heal the pain left by human hands.</span>

                    <span>Although I am not a horse lover, I was deeply moved by the stories of the horses at Proud Spirit Sanctuary and inspired by Melanie Bowle's genuine kindness and courage in her adoption of these abused and neglected horses. But this is not just a story about horses, it's about a woman who discovers her passion and follows it. When you read this book, you will laugh and cry and you will not want the book to end. I'm hoping there's a sequel....</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely NOT just for horse lovers. It's for anyone who appreciates life, and is saddened by abuse of any of God's Creatures. Melanie Bowles has done a masterful job of putting in just the right amount of description, not too wordy (verbose), not too sparse. I was extremely touched by her recounting her father's passing, as I was the only one with my father when he passed. This book will tug at your heart strings and touch you deeply. Some of her tales are sweet, some are funny, and a few are painfully sad. I feel a bond with this remarkable writer, simply from reading her book. Hope she writes a sequel!</span>

                    <span>As Melanie's husband, I just want to say this is one of the best books I have ever read. I am an avid reader and this is not my particular choice of genre. Having lived every chapter in the book, and knowing each story, I was still unable to put the book down. The book brought back a flood of memories with every chapter I read. It shows the love and dedication Melanie has to these magnificent animals, and the trust that they put in her. A must read for any animal lover. Thanks for writing this.</span>

                    <span>I took The Horses of Proud Spirit with me to read on the plane and during the evenings during my recent business trip. When I mentioned to my wife (she had already read the book) that I would start reading the book while waiting for my flight and while on the plane, she said "I don't think that reading the book in public places is a good idea because you will get emotional reading about the horses and I don't think you want strangers seeing you cry." Well I did not listen to her advice. While at the airport terminal, I started reading the book and it just totally absorbed me. It was when we were called to go through security, that I realized that I had tears flowing down my cheeks (yes, grown men do cry). I tried to stop the tears, a mixture of sadness (caused by the abuse suffered by these horses), anger (caused by the harm and abuse some humans brought upon the horses), and joy (the horses regaining their spirit) but they continued to flow for about another five minutes. After that experience, I read the book in the privacy of my hotel room. It is a moving and heart warming book that touches all of our human emotions! It is a testament to the sprit of horses and to the kindness, passion, and strength of one woman!</span>
