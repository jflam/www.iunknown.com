                <span id="Label1"><P> Howard Lyman's testimony on <I>The Oprah Winfrey Show</I> revealed the deadly impact of the livestock industry on our well-being. It not only led to Oprah's declaration that she'd never eat a burger again, it sent shock waves through a concerned and vulnerable public.  <P> A fourth-generation Montana rancher, Lyman investigated the use of chemicals in agriculture after developing a spinal tumor that nearly paralyzed him. Now a vegetarian, he blasts through the propaganda of beef and dairy interests -- and the government agencies that protect them -- to expose an animal-based diet as the primary cause of cancer, heart disease, and obesity in this country. He warns that the livestock industry is repeating the mistakes that led to Mad Cow disease in England while simultaneously causing serious damage to the environment. <P> Persuasive, straightforward, and full of the down-home good humor and optimism of a son of the soil, <I>Mad Cowboy</I> is both an inspirational story of personal transformation and a convincing call to action for a plant-based diet -- for the good of the planet and the health of us all.</span>

                    <span>I've been a vegetarian for less than a year and this is the knowledge that has made me a lifer. Since it's such an easy and even fun book to read I bought three copies to keep in circulation amongst my friends and colleagues.<P>Lyman doesn't preach he just lays down the facts about the industry in a way in which the information screams for itself. It made me realize how hypocritical it really is to call oneself environmentally conscience and still eat meat. Also, with the surgeon general about to declare obesity as the number one preventable death in America (currently it's cigarette smoking) Lyman's info on personal health couldn't be more timely.<P>If ignorance is your bliss, don't read this book! But if you're one who takes responsibility for your actions and the consequences of them and you're interested in exploring the repercussions of something you do at least three times a day... read this book and share it with those around you!</span>

                    <span>I love hearing Howard Lyman speak in person so it is nice to have a book where I can read about his experiences any time. Mr. Lyman has a refreshingly down to Earth way of getting his important message out. I find that even the most avid meat-eaters enjoy reading his book and hearing him speak. I've seen Mad Cowboy change people from meat-eater to vegetarian overnight. He does not alienate people while he stresses the importance of an animal-free diet. I hope there is another book from Mr. Lyman in the works.</span>

                    <span>Although I found some valuable information in this book, and some information I already knew, his verbage about such things as making animals into cannibals was a little extreme. With the problems with BSE, all blood products and ruminant products have been banned from the feed supply. While I advocate not feeding animal protein to any herbivorous animals, at least they are making headway into changing some things. Things such as jello, makeup, etc. are all animal products, so keep this in mind, also.<P>I have seen feedlots firsthand, as well as a slaughterhouse from start to finish. It has definitely changed my eating habits, but for America to stop eating meat, ALL of the citizens have to come to a realization as to the origin of their meat. Save for a few organizations who publicize this type of info don't look for widespread veganism to come to fruition anytime soon.<P>And for the poster about eating animals prepared Kosher, this is even more cruel, as the animals are totally conscious when their throats are cut. At least the current slaughter industry renders them unconscious before killing them.<P>Kosher is not equal to a higher quality of meat. Temple Grandin has done major work to change slaughter practices, and some of the worst and most cruel slaughterhouses she visited were Kosher ones. Keep this in mind the next time you tout the superiority of Kosher.</span>
